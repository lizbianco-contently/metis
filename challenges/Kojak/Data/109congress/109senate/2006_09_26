Mr. President, today we will begin the session with a 1-\nhour period of morning business. At the conclusion of the morning \nbusiness period, we will address the pending bill, H.R. 6061, the \nsecure fence legislation.\n  I filed cloture on the pending amendment and the underlying bill last \nnight, and I will speak to that process in a moment. I do want to \nremind everyone that the consent agreement now provides that all first-\ndegree amendments to the secure fence bill must be filed at the desk no \nlater than 2:30 today in order to qualify under rule XXII.\n  Today we will recess from 12:30 to 2:15 in order to accommodate one \nof our weekly policy meetings.\n  To further explain, last night I filed an amendment to the secure \nfence bill, and that amendment included language to establish the \nmilitary tribunals, the legislation that is in response to the Hamdan \nlegislation from several months ago which the Supreme Court has handed \ndown, which reflects the agreement announced last week between the \nPresident and Senate Republicans. I also filed cloture on this \namendment last night, as well as cloture on the secure fence bill. \nThere will be a cloture vote Wednesday on the Hamdan amendment. If that \ncloture on the amendment is invoked, there would be time for \npostcloture debate on the amendment. Once all postcloture time is \nexpired, there would then be a vote on the adoption of the amendment, \nfollowed immediately by a cloture vote on the secure fence legislation. \nAll those votes would be Thursday.\n  I explained that last night, and I explain it again now because it \nillustrates the procedural moves that have to be made in order to \nfinish this bill with certainty before we depart on Friday or Saturday. \nIt is critical that we do so. The very important, critical, high-value \ninterrogation programs cannot continue until we legislate, and indeed \nthe military tribunals, military commissions cannot take place in terms \nof trying these enemy combatants until we act.\n  It is important with regard to what I said for people to understand \nthat the Democratic leader and I and our caucuses are working very hard \nto get a unanimous consent agreement to consider the Hamdan legislation \nfreestanding. However, last night we did not reach that agreement, or \nearly this morning, but I am very hopeful that we can do so shortly.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the importance \nof national and homeland security and specifically to ensure that we \nenact the key legislation that we have under consideration necessary to \nprotect our great Nation.\n  While we have achieved a great deal since 9/11 in the area of \nhomeland security, and we need to acknowledge what we have \naccomplished, and while we are making great strides, there is still \nmore left to do. The terrorists we are dealing with are not going to \ncease planning attacks against our country, which is why we are working \nhard to continually improve the national security of the United States. \nThe fact that there has not been another terrorist attack on domestic \nsoil since September 11, 2001, shows that we have been successful to \nthis point.\n  To date, we have implemented 37 of the 39 9/11 Commission findings. \nWe have enacted 71 laws on homeland security. We have increased the \nterrorist watch list to 400,000 persons. We have disrupted at least 15 \nmajor terrorist plots or potential plots against America. We have \nrequired that every visa holder be fingerprinted before entering the \nUnited States. We have frozen nearly $1.5 billion in terrorist assets. \nWe have convicted 261 accused defendants in terrorism-related cases, \nand we have killed or taken prisoner a number of al-Qaida leaders \naround the world, particularly in Iraq, including Al Zarqawi, who was \nthe No. 1 al-Qaida leader in Iraq; including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, \nwhom we have captured and from whom we have received very valuable \ninformation. We have to remember that he was the mastermind of the 9/11 \nplot.\n  In the area of port security, Georgia has three ports and is one of \nthe top five States in the handling of some 11 million containers that \nreach our Nation's shores every year. Georgia plays an important role \nin the commerce of this country, and that is why I am pleased that \nCongress has completed a comprehensive port security conference report, \nwhich will continue to improve the security of our seaports all around \nAmerica.\n  This bill improves a layered security approach to cargo screening and \nscanning. In Georgia, we will begin augmenting the existing cargo \nsecurity detection equipment with radiation portal monitors next month \nto ensure the screening of high-risk containers to stop the illicit \nimport of nuclear and radiological materials. This important piece of \nlegislation also provides for the development of a plan to ensure the \nsuccessful resumption of shipping in the event of a terrorist attack. \nIn addition, it mandates a plan to determine when it is feasible to \nscan containers prior to their reaching the United States. With our \nnational security at stake, we will continue the necessary steps to \nprotect our citizens and, at the same time, balance the flow of \ncommerce.\n  In the closing weeks of this session, I think it is especially \nimportant to ensure that we have the opportunity to take final action \non the Defense appropriations bill and the Defense authorization \nconference report. These vital pieces of legislation will continue to \nensure that our military personnel involved in the global war on \nterrorism, as well as our National Guard personnel at home, have the \nnecessary equipment and resources to do their jobs. We need to ensure \nthat our Guard personnel stationed on the U.S. border can continue in \ntheir homeland security and defense roles, enhance the efforts of \nBorder Patrol agents, and be available to support Governors in the case \nof any natural disaster that may arise.\n  The Defense appropriations conference report which we will be \nconsidering later this week provides $86 billion for military \npersonnel, $120 billion for operations and maintenance, $80 billion for \nprocurement, and $75 billion for research and development, all to \nensure that our Nation's military has the resources they need to carry \nout the responsibilities that we as a nation have asked of them.\n  I would also like to ask the leadership in both the House and the \nSenate to make every effort to take final action on the national \nDefense authorization conference report this week. It would be a shame \non our part not to provide these urgent policies and funding for our \ntroops who so valiantly are defending our Nation today.\n  In closing, I would like to remind my colleagues what is at stake as \nwe consider these bills and urge them to work to pass legislation this \nweek in support of our Armed Forces. In Iraq, the combined coalition on \nIraqi operations continues to target and eliminate al-Qaida operations. \nSince August 30, over 150 operations have been conducted, resulting in \n66 terrorists being killed and over 830 suspected terrorists being \ndetained. On September 12 alone, there was a series of 25 raids in and \naround Baghdad targeting al-Qaida and Iraqi activities. These raids \nresulted in the capture of over 70 suspected terrorists, including an \nassociate of Abu Ayyub al-Masri, the new head of al-Qaida in Iraq. The \nassociate was a leader of assassination, kidnapping, and I.E.D cells in \nBaghdad. Iraqi and coalition forces continue to make tremendous \nprogress in clearing suspect buildings, seizing weapons, moving trash \nout of neighborhoods, improving electricity, wastewater disposal, and \neducational opportunities for the Iraqi people.\n  On the military front, by the end of this month the Iraqi Ground \nForces Command, which recently became operational, will assume control \nof a second Iraqi Army division. And later this month, the Government \nof Iraq plans to assume control of the Dhi Qar Province. These are the \nactivities that we are funding and supporting by doing our job in the \nSenate. I commend the work of our military personnel, the \nAppropriations Committee, and the Armed Services Committee for \ncompleting these bills, and I urge my colleagues to adopt them \nexpeditiously.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/26/senate-section/article/S10110-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10110-S10112]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, first I want to commend the Senator from \nGeorgia for his excellent statement and discussion on what we are doing \non the border and what we are doing generally in the area of fighting \nterrorism. I simply wanted to bring the Senate up to speed, and to the \nextent people are observing the Senate operations, the country up to \nspeed--the listeners, anyway, up to speed on what we are doing on the \nborder.\n  Last night we completed the conference between the House and the \nSenate on the Homeland Security bill, with Congressman Rogers chairing \nthe committee for the House and myself chairing it for the Senate. This \nis a bipartisan bill. It is a bill that passed the Senate 100 to \nnothing. It is a continuum of a lot of effort that we have made as a \nCongress to try to upgrade and significantly improve and make much more \nrobust our efforts in order to secure our borders.\n  I think we all understand that the threat to America comes from many \ndifferent directions. But as we prioritize threats, the No. 1 issue we \nhave to worry about is someone coming into this country with a weapon \nof mass destruction.\n  The No. 2 thing we need to worry about is who is coming into the \ncountry and what products are coming into the country. What do those \npeople intend? Hopefully, they are coming in legally. And what are the \npurposes of the products coming in? Hopefully, the purpose of the \nproducts is general commerce. But it is, first, to protect yourself \nfrom weapons of mass destruction and, second, to make sure our borders \nare secure.\n  In order to accomplish both of those goals, we need to put \nsignificant resources into those agencies and efforts which are \nresponsible for addressing those two major issues. This bill, the \nHomeland Security bill, does exactly that. It puts significant new \nenergy and dollars into detecting and being able to manage a potential \nweapon of mass destruction that will come into this country. Equally \nimportant, it\n\n[[Page S10111]]\n\ncontinues a 2-year effort that began in 2005 when we reorganized the \nflow of dollars within the Department of Homeland Security. It \ncontinues an effort to dramatically increase the boots on the ground \nand the physical and capital support efforts necessary to support the \nindividuals who are protecting our borders and managing our borders.\n  This chart reflects the dramatic increase, using a baseline of when \nPresident Clinton left office to today. In the area of border agents \nspecifically, over 6,000 agents have been added, 4,000 just in the last \n2 years. That is a 40-percent increase in border agents in the last 2 \nyears.\n  In addition, the bill we passed last night, while continuing the \neffort in the area of adding border agents, continues an aggressive \neffort to add detention beds. We understand, if you have agents on the \nground who are hopefully catching people who are coming across our \nborders illegally, it does no good to catch those people unless you \nhave some way to hold them. Up until this month, in fact, we had a \npolicy known as catch and release because we simply did not have enough \nholding space for people who came into this country illegally.\n  This bill continues the effort in the area of adding detention beds. \nOver the last 2 years, we will have added over 9,000 beds, almost \n10,000 beds. The practical effect of this is we are getting real \nresults. Beginning next month, the Department of Homeland Security will \nno longer have a policy of catch and release. They will be able to hold \nthe people they catch and detain them, which is exactly what should be \nhappening. In addition, we have dramatically increased the number of \nCustoms agents, we have increased the number of detention personnel, \nand we have significantly increased our commitment to fencing along the \nborder.\n  This bill, as it was worked out last night, has $1.2 billion in it \nfor putting up either physical fencing, vehicle barriers, or what is \nknown as a virtual fence, which is the Secure Border Initiative where \nin some parts of the southwest border, where a physical fence doesn't \nmake any sense, there will be significant electronic monitoring of the \nborder, which will allow us to see who is coming across the border. \nOnce they come across the border, because we have added all these new \nborder security personnel--the totals of which are here, 14,000 border \nsecurity personnel, almost 15,000--we will be able to catch them if \nthey are coming across illegally.\n  In addition, we have dramatically increased our efforts to \nrecapitalize and support the Coast Guard. I think everyone understands \nthe Coast Guard is one of the premier agencies in our Government. Their \nefforts during Katrina were exemplary. They have the primary \nresponsibility for making sure people coming toward the United States \nover the seas are coming here as part of reasonable commerce or simply \nas tourists and are not coming here to harm us. In order to accomplish \nthat, they have dramatically increased the review of shipping as it \ncomes toward the United States at the port of embarkation--whether that \nis in Asia or somewhere else--and they have increased their \ninterdiction capabilities should there be a suspicious cargo on a ship \nheaded toward the United States. To accomplish this, we have \nsignificantly increased the commitment to the Coast Guard in the area \nof purchasing more cutters, fast boats, arming their helicopters, and \njust generally upgrading their capacity to do their job well, as they \ndo it well. Over $7.5 billion has been put into the Coast Guard as a \nresult of this effort.\n  The practical result of all this new funding, all these new agents, \nnew commitment to detention beds, is that we are moving toward a secure \nborder. In the very foreseeable future, short term rather than long \nterm, we will be able to manage this border in a way that is \nappropriate, making sure people do not cross it illegally. We will also \nmanage our ports, making sure they are secure. We have a way to go \nthere, but we are making significant progress.\n  At the same time, in this bill we have made a commitment to \nreorganize the Department in some areas where it has not been \nfunctioning all that well, specifically in FEMA. congratulate Senator \nCollins for her leadership. She orchestrated a bipartisan, bicameral \neffort to reach an agreement on how FEMA should be reorganized. The \nlanguage of that reorganization is in this bill.\n\n  In addition, we have put in this bill significant language in the \narea of chemical plant security. The Department of Homeland Security \ntoday does not have adequate authority to secure our chemical plants. \nIt simply cannot do it because it doesn't have the legal authority \nnecessary to force our chemical plants to undertake policies which will \nsecure them. With this new language--again, this language was brokered \nby Senator Collins working with Congressman Barton and Congressman \nKing--we have put in place a regime which will allow the Homeland \nSecurity agency to monitor and to require that high-risk chemical \nplants now have a decent security plan in place.\n  There are other ideas out there for chemical security, some good \nones. Senator Byrd has a significant number of good ideas in this area. \nTherefore, Senator Collins looked on this language, basically, more as \na stop-gap language, to get things going, to make sure there was at \nleast some initial authority for the Homeland Security Department, and \nthus this language sunsets in 3 years, so the Congress will have to \nreauthorize, and other thoughts and ideas in the area of chemical \nsecurity can be pursued.\n  This bill is a comprehensive, broad, and extraordinarily robust \neffort to tightening up and making a stronger commitment to securing \nour country and especially our borders and to make sure we have a \nDepartment of Homeland Security which has the resources it needs in \norder to accomplish that goal. There is a dramatic increase in the \nnumber of agents, dramatic increase in the number of detention beds, \ndramatic increase in the commitment to the Coast Guard, dramatic \nincrease in the commitment to the monitoring and the capacity to handle \na nuclear threat, and a dramatic increase to the issue of building a \nfence along the southwest border.\n  We still have a have a long way to go. Nobody is going to argue about \nthat. But in this debate, while we constantly hear this constant \nrumbling of negativism out there about border security--we aren't doing \nthis, we aren't doing that--it should be acknowledged that significant \nprogress is being made and a dramatic amount of resources is being \nfocused on this effort by this administration and this Congress.\n  In addition, as an aside, this bill had one item I would like to \npoint out which I think is important, especially to people who live \nalong the northern border. There is language in this bill which was \nworked out between myself and Congressman Rogers but primarily between \nCongresswoman Emerson and Senator Vitter. The purpose of this language \nwill be to allow American citizens to cross into Canada and purchase \ndrugs at a Canadian drugstore--Senator DeMint was also involved in \nthis--purchase drugs at a Canadian pharmacy and bring them back to the \nUnited States without being subject to legal prosecution.\n  There are a lot of people who believe they can go into Canada and buy \nAmerican-made drugs which are being sold through Canada at a much \nhigher discount than they can get those drugs in America. It may not be \nthe case any longer because of what Wal-Mart is doing because Wal-Mart \nis putting in place a very robust, low-cost drug program. In any event, \nif Wal-Mart doesn't underprice Canada, people will be able now to go to \nCanada and purchase those drugs. I see Senator Dorgan here, and he has \nbeen a major player in this effort, also. They can purchase those drugs \nand not be subject to prosecution.\n  This language took a long time to work out. It has the safeguards in \nit that I believe always were necessary before we could take this \nlanguage and move it forward, and I am glad we were finally able to \nresolve this part of that puzzle. It is a bigger issue, but at least \nrelative to people crossing the borders and purchasing drugs, which \nhappens fairly regularly in New Hampshire and I know North Dakota and \nother places along the northern border, this is a step in the right \ndirection. I congratulate all the people who have worked so hard to \nmake this come to fruition.\n\n[[Page S10112]]\n\n  On balance, this is a truly excellent bill. We will be voting on it \nhere, hopefully before the week is over. Absolutely I hope that is the \ncase. It is very important we get these funds in place. As a result of \nthat, we will continue this rather significant--I would call it \ndramatic--progress toward putting in place the capital, the resources, \nand the people necessary to secure our borders.\n  But I would point out this caveat. No matter how many people we put \non the border and no matter how much capital resources we put behind \nthis--and we are going to do whatever it takes on those two counts--you \nstill have the issue of human nature to deal with, which is, if a \nMexican is making $5 a day and he can come to the United States and \nmake $50 a day and he has a family to support, he is going to come to \nthe United States. We have to figure out a comprehensive approach which \nwill allow somebody to come to the United States, work a job that \nAmericans are not willing to work or we don't have enough Americans to \nwork, and be able to do that under a guest worker program that is \nresponsible and allow employers the capacity to be able to verify that \nthe individual is in this country legally. That is a critical element \nto securing our borders and making sure we do this right.\n\n  So comprehensive reform should not be ignored. It has to be part of \nthis whole package. But pending comprehensive reform, this bill, which \nwe will vote on, the Homeland Security appropriations bill, is a \nsignificant, robust--actually, you could even call it dramatic--step \nforward in making sure our borders are secure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

It is a part of why we \nhave not had another major attack since 9/11.\n  Once again, the Senator from New Hampshire has shown real leadership. \nHe has produced a bill we have to have this year, to provide the \nappropriations for this important Department and the agencies within it \nand to put funding in it for border security. This is a major \nachievement. No matter what else we get accomplished this week, this \nwill probably be, overall, the most important. I thank him for it.\n  I have been very involved in the reform of FEMA because I have seen \nhow FEMA did not always have the authority and didn't have the power, \nif you will, didn't have the people or the money to do the job after \nHurricane Katrina. This reform will help make FEMA stronger, and I \nbelieve it will be a benefit to the Department of Homeland Security.\n  There are a lot of those saying we should be accomplishing more. I am \nhoping before this week is out we will pass a major border security \nbill. I am hoping we will pass the Outer Continental Shelf energy \npackage. I believe we will get Defense authorization and Defense \nappropriations and hopefully several other good bills.\n  I have never seen a Senate more paralyzed than I have seen over the \npast few months. There is no doubt in my mind that a conscious decision \nwas made by the Democratic leadership January a year ago to slow-roll, \nobstruct, delay everything. Every time you take a week or two on a bill \nthat should be done in a day or two, that is that many days you cannot \nuse to do other things which need to be accomplished. But I think, \nrather than trying to have a list with a whole lot of things on it--\nlittle things, in many instances--it is more important to keep a focus \non the big issues.\n  What have we done to really help the American people?\n  Quite often some people say, please don't pass more laws. Leave me \nalone; allow the private sector, allow the markets, allow us to do our \njob, and let the States and localities do their jobs.\n  I think we overemphasis sheer numbers. But I think it is important \nthat we look at the list of what this Senate has passed this year. When \nyou add to that the other things which we hope we will complete this \nweek--the most effective week of a session is always right before the \nend of the year. I remember one night when we passed something like 67 \nbills after almost everybody had gone home. The Democratic and \nRepublican leadership had a blast. We passed a lot of good legislation.\n  Look at what we have already done. The Patriot Act. Under the title \nof Homeland Security, we have taken major actions and they have made a \ndifference in securing our country and have been a critical part of the \nWar on Terrorism. The Patriot Act, border security, and we have funded \nthe war on terror.\n  On taxes and in the budget area, once again Senator Judd Gregg did a \ngreat job as chairman of the Budget Committee. We cut entitlements \nsomewhat. We cut taxes by $70 billion. Other than Homeland Security and \nDefense, we have basically held the line on appropriations. A lot of \nthe credit goes to my colleague from Mississippi, Senator Cochran.\n  We passed a comprehensive energy policy bill last week. It is having \na positive effect. It takes time for legislation in that area to have \nan effect.\n  We passed the Pell grants in the area of math and science \ncompetitiveness in education.\n  We passed lawsuit abuse reform.\n  In the area of health for the benefit of Americans, health \ninformation technology, it sounds as though it wouldn't make that much \ndifference, but it is going to control costs and make information more \navailable to the patients so they can make the right decisions for \ntheir health needs.\n  We have tremendous fights over judges. We have confirmed two Supreme \nCourt judges--outstanding judges. We have confirmed 14 circuit court \njudges and 34 district court judges. Hopefully, we will confirm more \nthis week. But there again, the Democrats chose to filibuster on \njudges--in my opinion, clearly unconstitutional. In fact, the majority \nleader now on almost every bill has to file cloture. Why? Because \notherwise you can't get to the substance of a bill.\n  When you spend 30 hours on a motion to proceed to a bill which has \nmajor consequences for border security, then you know there is \nsomething wrong with the institution. Instead of us finding ways to \nwork together, we find ways to expound and put out more hot air instead \nof taking action.\n  We have done some other things in protecting families, and also \nmoving toward sound government.\n  We passed the Voting Rights Act.\n  I am here today for some reasons and for efforts that are not listed \non this board. One year ago, I was standing on this floor pleading with \nmy colleagues to help us in dealing with the aftermath of the biggest \nnatural disaster to ever hit this country. We tend to forget about it. \nBut most of last fall we spent on passing in a bipartisan, bicameral \nway Katrina relief legislation. We passed major appropriations. I am \nnot talking about a few millions. I am talking about well over $100 \nbillion.\n  When we came back from the August recess, instead of going to some of \nthe things that were scheduled--such as repeal of the death tax--we \nwent immediately to Katrina legislation. But in providing \nappropriations, in providing tax incentives for businesses and \nindustries to rebuild, to stay in the area, or come to the area to help \nus recover, we did that.\n  Medicaid changes--we allowed the States of Louisiana and Mississippi \nto cope with the great increase in the number of people who needed \nMedicaid assistance; assistance through that bill to help many of our \nhospitals that were primary care hospitals. They treated everybody who \nshowed up. It ran into hundreds of millions of dollars.\n  And right across the board, we have Stafford Act changes in the law, \nhelp for our schools and colleges. All of our schools in Mississippi \nwere back and\n\n[[Page S10113]]\n\nopen by November 7. In many instances, they were in pretty dilapidated \nfacilities, without air conditioning, or temporary buildings. But every \none of them opened by November 7, partially because Congress made a \ncommitment to help them with the costs of what they had lost, to deal \nwith the gap between what their insurance provided and what they were \ngoing to need to recover.\n  I am here to thank the Congress for helping us.\n  Have we had continued problems? Yes. Have we been disappointed in \nFEMA and the Department of Homeland Security and the Corps of \nEngineers? Yes, even though a lot of good people have done good work.\n  I have to admit that at the State level and the local level, we have \nhad problems sometimes in making decisions dealing with elevation \nrequirements, dealing with national flood insurance, and actually even \ndistributing the money.\n  When you are trying to distribute $3 billion to 17,000 people, you do \nnot throw it out the window. You have to have a process to make sure \nthese people actually lost their homes, or had damaged homes, and that \nthey are going to deal fairly with their mortgage holders, that they \nwould have a way to get their homes back in place. That process is \nstill underway. It has been a very difficult one.\n  So you can be critical of what happened after Katrina, but there are \na few places where a lot of credit should be given and it has not been \nadequately done.\n  The Congress did the job after Hurricane Katrina. Every committee \nchairman and ranking member came to our aid. The Mississippians, the \nLouisianians, the Texans, the Alabamians told you what our problems \nwere. We poured our hearts out, and the Senate did its job.\n  Senator Cochran, my colleague from Mississippi, deserves enormous \ncredit for the very calm, cool, and determined way he handled that \nlegislation.\n  I am here to say thank you. When you make this list of Senate \naccomplishments, you must add to this list the things we did after \nHurricane Katrina. The system worked. Congress did its part. For that I \nwill be eternally grateful.\n  By the way, we ate up the major part of 3 months trying to make sure \nwe were doing it right, appropriately, to help the people who needed it \nand to make sure it was done in an honest way.\n  Sure, I complained we didn't do more. I complain about the way we do \nthings. I don't like the totally partisan political seasons we get \ninto. We all do it and I do it. But I think that while we are doing \nthat, we ought to take a little credit for what we did do and what we \ndid right.\n  I wanted to make that point this morning.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, this is an interesting time as we end the \n109th Congress, at least in that portion that will start with the \nrecess apparently this weekend, according to the majority leader and \nthe Speaker of the House, only to return and reconvene sometime in \nNovember to do a lot of work that was not done earlier this year. Most \nof the appropriations bills have not been passed, and perhaps one, \nmaybe two, will be done this week, but the rest will be done after the \nelection.\n  I know my colleague who just spoke--and others will come to the floor \nof the Senate and talk about how fruitful and how productive the 109th \nCongress has been. I wish I could say the same. I serve in this \nCongress. I am a Member of this Congress and I hope and wish we could \nend a year and say we did an unbelievably good job for the American \npeople; that we addressed the things that needed to be addressed; that \nwe strengthened this country; and that we helped people in many ways. I \nwish I could say that. But as Peggy Lee's song says, Is that all there \nis? Is that an appropriate response to the chart that we see trumpeting \nthe 109th Congress accomplishments? Is that all there is? Yes, that is \nall there is.\n  Let me describe a few of the things we ought to be dealing with and \nespecially describe the things we are not dealing with.\n  On health care and the issues related to health care, every business \nin this country and virtually every family in this country--and \nespecially our Government--bears the cost of these dramatically \nincreasing prices in health care. No one seems to be addressing it very \nmuch. We passed a prescription drug plan a while back for senior \ncitizens on Medicare, and that actually had a little provision in it \nwhich prevents the negotiation of lower prices on prescription drugs. \nThat is almost unbelievable to me. Health care costs are on the rise, \nled, incidentally, by prescription drug prices. This Congress seems to \nstand with the pharmaceutical industry. It wants to prevent the \nnegotiation for lower prices.\n  I have stood on the floor of the Senate holding up two identical \nbottles of the same pill made by the same company, both FDA approved, \none sent to Canada, one sent to the United States. The difference is \nthe one sent to Canada is half the price of the one sent to the United \nStates.\n  My colleague said there is a provision in Homeland Security--and \nindeed there is--dealing with prescription drug reimportation. It is \nmuch to do about nothing, I regret to tell you, because it will allow \npeople to bring a 90-day supply as they cross over the Canadian border \nand come back. Very few Americans have the capability of driving to the \nCanadian border to access that lower cost FDA-approved drug. We are \ncharged the highest prices in the world for FDA-approved prescription \ndrugs. That is unfair to the American people.\n  The provision in Homeland Security is going to do very little. In \nfact, we have almost always allowed exactly what that provision says we \nshould allow. We have always allowed a personal supply of 90 days to \ncome across the border from Canada when American consumers buy that \nprescription drug. This is nothing new. It doesn't address the issue.\n  We have been blocked on the floor of this Senate for 2 years now with \na bipartisan piece of legislation cosponsored by over 30--myself, \nSenators Snowe, McCain, Kennedy, and many others--a big bipartisan \nbill. We have been blocked from getting a vote on the floor for this \nlegislation which would allow the reimportation of lower cost, FDA-\napproved prescription drugs.\n  Why is that the case? Because on this subject the pharmaceutical \nindustry has more influence here, regrettably, than the American people \ndo.\n  We are not addressing the health care costs, and we are not \naddressing the issue of prescription drug costs--and we should.\n  Trade and jobs, think of that. Are we addressing trade issues? The \nonly thing we are doing on trade issues is to pass more incompetent \ntrade agreements. We just did the Oman Trade Agreement, a country that \nby sultanic decree has said there will not be an organization of \nworkers; it is illegal to form a labor union in the country of Oman by \nsultanic decree. We do a trade agreement with a country that basically \nprohibits organized workers.\n  We have a $68 billion a month trade deficit, $800 billion a year. We \nare choking on red ink in international trade. Nearly 4 million jobs \nhave been shipped from this country overseas in search of cheap labor, \nin search of 20-cent and 30-cent-an-hour workers working 7 days a week, \n12 to 14 hours a day. Does anybody care much about that?\n  We not only have this running up and dramatic increase in the trade \ndeficit, but we see the potential loss of another 40 million to 50 \nmillion American jobs, according to some leading economists. And even \nthose that do not leave are tradeable or outsourceable jobs and \ncompeting with others in the world who are willing to work for much \nless, causing downward pressure on wages in this country.\n  Some say we see the world as it is, that it is a global economy, and \nthere is nothing we can do about it. I see the world as it is and \ndecide we ought to change it to what it should be--standing up for good \njobs in this country, for American workers. Yet this Congress doesn't \ndo that.\n  As to deficits and fiscal policy, the President made great fanfare in \ntalking about the fact that the deficit is reduced. Interestingly \nenough, take a\n\n[[Page S10114]]\n\nlook at what we are going to borrow in the next year--close to $600 \nbillion in the next fiscal year. That is the off-the-rail fiscal policy \nof red ink, up to $600 billion in budget borrowing, and $800 billion in \ntrade deficits. That is $1.4 trillion in red ink on a $13 trillion \neconomy. That won't last very long.\n  We are going to bring additional war spending to the floor of the \nSenate. We are all going to vote for additional war spending. Some of \nus believe we ought to pay for it. This will make it, I think, \nsomewhere around $400 billion in total--none of it paid for, not a \npenny paid for, all added to the debt.\n  We send our soldiers to Afghanistan and Iraq and say, Please serve \nyour country, fight for your country, risk your lives, and when you \ncome back, by the way, we will have this debt waiting for you because \nwe have chosen not to be involved in fighting to pay our bills.\n  That doesn't make any sense to me. That can't seriously be called an \naccomplishment.\n  We have been holding some hearings on oversight with respect to \ncontractors. It is controversial. I see in the newspaper today a member \nof the majority said, well, we may take the rooms away so they cannot \nhold hearings. That is an interesting response to the question of \noversight. The reason we have held oversight hearings in the policy \ncommittee room is because the majority party decided not to hold \nserious oversight hearings.\n  The highest ranking civilian official in the Corps of Engineers at \nthe Pentagon in charge of major contracts, the sole-source, no-bid \ncontracts to Halliburton and KBR that were given, has said this is the \nmost blatant abuse of contracting authority she has witnessed in all of \nher career. This is a woman who is viewed as a top contracting official \nin this country in the Pentagon for these contracts. She said it is the \nmost blatant abuse she has ever seen. Guess what happened to her for \nbeing honest. She was demoted.\n  I had her twice testify. Was there any other committee in Congress \ninterested in her testimony to find out how the tens of billions of \ndollars were contracted? Nobody.\n  Yesterday we had an oversight hearing on the conduct of the war. We \nhad a couple of generals and a colonel, all three of whom were \ndistinguished folks who served in Iraq, served a combined 90 years for \nthis country. General Batiste started by saying, I am a Republican, a \nlifelong Republican. It was not partisan. We invited Republicans to \ncome to the hearing to talk about the conduct of the war. There have \nbeen no oversight hearings on that.\n  All of us want the same thing, it seems to me. We want us to prevail \nand do well. We want to protect our country. We want to defeat \nterrorism. All of us want those things. But it seems to me we are \nmoving in the wrong direction in some of these areas. Incidentally, \nmuch of the information that ought to be available is classified in \norder not to embarrass anybody.\n  Let me mention that General Batiste and others who testified \nyesterday said this country is not mobilized. We send our men and women \nto war, but the country is not mobilized. They made a point I thought \nwas very interesting. I read a book that was written a long while ago, \na brilliant book called ``The Glory and The Dream,'' written by \nManchester. He described in the Second World War what this country did \nto mobilize. This country mobilized to beat back the oppressive armies \nof Hitler, the Germans and the Japanese. We mobilized. Manchester, in \n``The Glory and The Dream,'' described what happened with American \nmanufacturing capacity and what they did. At the end of the war we were \nbuilding 50,000 airplanes a year to fight that war.\n  Colonel Hammes yesterday testified there is a new armored vehicle to \ncarry personnel that is much safer than the humvee. Are we producing \nthose? Are we mobilizing to produce those to provide them to our \ntroops? No. We built 50,000 airplanes a year at the end of the Second \nWorld War. This war has now lasted longer than the Second World War. \nYet we have built a total of 1,000 of these stronger, better armored \nsecurity vehicles in which to haul American troops. Why? Because we are \nnot mobilized.\n  The majority says to the American people, not only don't you have to \npay for this war, we want you to have a big tax cut--not to everyone, \njust a few, at the top. We want to repeal the death tax. At a time when \nwe are at war and we are borrowing money to prosecute that war--$400 \nbillion--not a penny of which has been paid for, the majority says our \nhighest priority is to repeal the so-called death tax, which does not \nexist? No, there is no tax on death. That may come as news to some in \nthis Chamber because they have used the moniker often. There is no tax \non death. When someone dies, their spouse, if they are married, owns \neverything taxfree. There is a 100-percent spousal exemption. So there \nis no tax on death.\n  There is, in fact, a tax on inherited wealth and the majority party \nis intent on relieving the tax burden of the wealthiest Americans at a \ntime when we are at war. We are at war, we are spending hundreds of \nbillions of dollars and we are not paying for any of it. It is, in my \njudgment, a Byzantine set of priorities.\n  No, when people say they have a chart that shows the accomplishments \nof the 109th Congress, they might listen to what Harry Truman said to \nSteven Douglas in one of their debates. He described the Douglas \nargument:\n\n       As thin as the homeopathic soup made by boiling a shadow of \n     a pigeon that had been starved to death.\n\n  Bring those charts out with the accomplishments of the 109th \nCongress. Those accomplishments are as thin as the homeopathic soup \nmade by boiling the shadow of a pigeon that has been starved to death.\n  I wish it weren't so. I wish we could stand here and describe a set \nof accomplishments that makes all of us proud, but the priorities here \ncan hardly be called accomplishments for the American people. The \nAmerican people deserve, finally, to be getting what both political \nparties have t offer. Instead of getting the best of both, we are \ngetting the worst of each.\n\n  This Congress needs to come together to address these issues. We do \nnot control the Congress. The majority party does. It is the way it \nworks. The majority party describes what the issues are that will be \nbrought to the floor of the Senate.\n  Go almost any place around the world, the President says and others \nsay, we will go and help. But they forget at home when people are in \ndifficulty. Somehow we do not seem to find ways to say, let us help our \ncitizens at home--health care costs, prescription drug prices.\n  I have not mentioned energy. Energy obviously is a very important \nissue. In the year 2004, the average price of oil was $40 a barrel. At \nthat price, the largest integrated oil companies had the highest \nprofits in their entire history. Now the price of oil has gone from \nthat level to $70, $75 a barrel. Now it is down to $60 and just under, \nand everyone thinks, Isn't that wonderful? The fact is, it is still 50 \npercent higher than it was at which point the major integrated \ncompanies had the highest profits in history. As the money is shoveled \ninto their company, it is taken from the consumers, from the farmer who \nloads the fuel, the people paying at the gas pump.\n  We need to deal with energy prices. It will not last for this country \nto be a country that consumes a quarter of the oil every single day. We \nhave this little planet of ours and we stick straws in this Earth; from \nthose straws we suck out the oil. We suck out 84 million barrels a day \nfrom this Earth, and 21 million barrels a day is used in this spot of \nthe planet called the United States of America.\n  We use it predominantly for transportation, among other things. We \nhave done nothing to change the basis of fuel use in transportation in \nnearly 100 years. We put gasoline in a 2006 Ford the same way we put \ngasoline in a 1924 Model T. I know that because I restored an old Model \nT when I was a kid. Nothing has changed. Everything else has changed. \nThere is more computing power on a new car than there was on the lunar \nlander that landed Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the Moon. \nEverything has changed about automobiles, except we have never changed \nhow we fuel or power that car; just drive to the pump, stick a hose in \nand pump some gasoline.\n  We need to move aggressively toward a different future--renewables, \nwind energy, biofuels, especially hydrogen and fuel cells. There are so \nmany opportunities, yet so little time, and\n\n[[Page S10115]]\n\nseemingly so little appetite on the part of this Senate and others to \ndo something meaningful for the long term.\n  I wish I were part of a Congress I could say has been an enormously \nproductive Congress for the country. We are not. We need to get busy \nand find a way to solve this. This President, this Congress, chart the \nagenda. They describe what is going to come to the Senate floor. We \nneed to begin zeroing in on things that are important.\n  First, we need to win this war in Iraq in a way that satisfies our \nobjectives. We need to fight the war on terrorism in a manner that \nallows us to prevail. Incidentally, this issue of cutting and running, \nwe are going to leave Iraq at some point. That is not the issue. This \ncountry is going to leave Iraq. Our military is going to be withdrawn. \nThe question is, When? When and under what conditions? It is \nappropriate to say at some point to the Iraqi people, this is your \ncountry, not ours. This country belongs to you, not to us. Saddam \nHussein was found in a rat hole. He is on trial. He is not part of the \ngovernment. Iraqis have their own government. And the question for \nthose in Iraq is, do you want your country back? If so, you have to \nprovide for your security. We are attempting to train and provide \nsecurity at this point, but we are not going to provide security \nforever in the country of Iraq. We cannot do that. We must expect the \nIraqi people to decide to take back their country, at which point we \nwill be able to bring the American troops home. That, I hope, is sooner \nrather than later.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I want to speak on three issues this \nmorning. First, I will talk about two amendments I have filed to the \nSecure Fence Act which is the legislation the Senate is debating once \nwe get through morning business. I will talk about the merits of those \namendments and the reasons I believe Senators should support those \namendments, that we should be allowed an opportunity to offer those \namendments. There is some question as to whether we will be allowed \nthat opportunity. After that, I will say a few words about health care \nand health care issues in this 109th Congress.\n  First, as to the Secure Fence Act, H.R. 6061, I represent, as all of \nmy colleagues know, a border State. I understand the frustration \ncommunities are facing due to the inability of the Federal Government \nto secure our Nation's borders. Illegal immigration is a serious \nproblem, and we do need to do a much better job in addressing this \nproblem. The Senate has passed a comprehensive immigration bill. It is \nnot a perfect bill by any means, but it is aimed at improving security \nalong our borders and at also reforming our immigration laws. I believe \nthat the bill passed through the Senate was a step in the right \ndirection. I was disappointed that the leadership of the House of \nRepresentatives refused to appoint conferees to meet with Senate \nconferees and instead decided to hold hearings around the country to \nconcentrate on differences of opinion and to stir up discontent rather \nthan to seek some common solutions to our substantial immigration \nproblems. The Senate has passed a bipartisan bill. The House passed \nwhat I would characterize as a different bill. We should have convened \na conference committee. We should have tried to work out differences \nbetween those bills. The failure to at least have made a good faith \neffort in that regard I think is very unfortunate.\n\n  Mr. President, with regard to the specifics of this Secure Fence \nAct--and the Secure Fence Act is a piece of the House-passed \nimmigration bill from about a year ago--I do believe there are \nlocations along our border where fencing makes sense and additional \nfencing is required. However, we need to be smart about our security. \nWalls may make good sound bites in political ads, but the reality is \nthat individuals charged with securing our borders have consistently \nstated that walls and fences are only part of the solution and that \nthere are better and more cost-effective ways to provide for greater \nborder security.\n  Ralph Basham, who is the Commissioner of Customs and Border \nProtection, stated earlier this year in response to a question about \nthe proposal to build 700 miles of double-layered fencing:\n\n       It doesn't make sense, it's not practical.\n\n  He went on to say that what we need is an appropriate mix of \ntechnology and infrastructure and additional personnel.\n  Let me take a moment to also read some remarks delivered by Secretary \nChertoff, the Secretary of Homeland Security. These were delivered on \nMarch 20 of this year in a speech he gave at the Heritage Foundation. \nIn describing the Secure Border Initiative, also known as SBInet, \nSecretary Chertoff stated:\n\n       We are going to build ourselves what I call a virtual \n     fence, not a fence of barbed wire and bricks and mortar, \n     which I will tell you simply doesn't work, because people can \n     go over that kind of fence but rather a smart fence, a fence \n     that makes use of physical tools but also tools about \n     information sharing and information management that let us \n     identify people coming across the border and let us plan the \n     interception and apprehension in a way that serves our \n     purposes and maximizes our resources thereby giving our \n     border patrol the best leverage they can have in order to \n     make sure that they are apprehending the most people.\n\n  This week, the Department of Homeland Security selected Boeing as its \ncontractor for this Secure Border Initiative. Under Boeing's proposal, \nit will build a network of approximately 1,800 towers along the \nsouthern border. It is unclear how mandating 700 miles of fencing as is \nproposed in this pending bill will fit into the proposal which Boeing \nhas made and which has been selected by the Department of Homeland \nSecurity and whether the two together make sense. Unfortunately, the \nbill as currently drafted does not provide the Department of Homeland \nSecurity with the discretion that Department needs in order to \ndetermine the most appropriate means to secure the border. It also ties \ntheir hands with regard to the use and the placement of fencing. I do \nnot think we should be mandating over 700 miles of fencing at specific \nlocations. I do not think this Senate and those of us here in the \nCongress have enough detailed knowledge of the various areas along the \nborder to be making the decision as to the specific areas where fencing \nneeds to be built.\n  It is also clear that the cost per mile is something we do not have a \ngood handle on at this time in our debate. According to the Department \nof Homeland Security, it costs approximately $4.4 million for a single \nlayer of fencing per mile. The bill we are debating today mandates \ndouble-layer fencing, which would add up to about $6.6 billion for the \n730 miles of fencing required under this bill.\n  In discussions with local law enforcement, local, State, and Federal \nlaw enforcement along the border in the southern part of New Mexico, we \nhave meetings with what we call the Southwest New Mexico Border \nSecurity Task Force, and at some of those meetings I have attended the \npoint has been raised by local security officials that the location of \nthe proposed double-layer fencing in this bill is, in their view, at \nleast, at the wrong place.\n  The bill also mandates fencing in some areas where we just spent \nmillions of dollars per mile to build vehicle barriers rather than \nfencing because it was the judgment of the Border Patrol that vehicle \nbarriers were more appropriate in those areas.\n  If we are going to spend billions of dollars to place a fence along \nover one-third of our southern border, we should at least ensure that \nit is in the right location and that the Department of Homeland \nSecurity can make necessary adjustments in the interest of securing our \nborders. To this end, I\n\n[[Page S10116]]\n\nhope to offer an amendment that would ensure that the Secretary of \nHomeland Security has the ability to modify the placement and the use \nof fencing that is mandated in this bill; that is, he has that \ndiscretion to make those modifications if the Secretary determines that \nsuch use or placement of the fencing is not the best way to achieve and \nto maintain operational control of the border. I believe this is a \nreasonable amendment. I believe it will help ensure that DHS has the \nflexibility it needs to alter this proposal if the proposal is \ndetermined not to advance our overall security strategy.\n  I hope that the majority party will allow a vote on this important \nmeasure and that they will support this important measure. Let me be \nclear. I believe we need to do whatever it takes to secure our borders. \nYou cannot have a nation without secure borders. I have consistently \nworked to secure increased funding for vehicle barriers, for \nsurveillance equipment, and for additional Border Patrol agents, but I \nalso believe we need to pursue that secure border in the most effective \nway both from a security standpoint and in terms of the overall cost of \nthe security.\n  Mr. President, that is my description of the first amendment I do \nhope to offer. Let me also speak briefly about an amendment I hope to \noffer to this legislation This is regarding the Border Law Enforcement \nRelief Act of 2006. This is an amendment which is cosponsored by \nSenator Domenici of my State. It will provide local law enforcement in \nborder communities with much needed assistance in combating border-\nrelated criminal activity.\n\n  During our debate on the immigration bill, this legislation was \nadopted by a vote of 84 to 6. It was also adopted by unanimous consent \nas part of the Senate's Homeland Security appropriations bill.\n  For far too long, law enforcement agencies operating along the border \nhave had to incur significant costs due to the inability of the Federal \nGovernment to provide adequate security of the border. It is time that \nthe Federal Government recognize that border communities should not \nhave to bear that burden alone. This amendment would establish a \ncompetitive grant program within the Department of Homeland Security. \nThese grants would help local law enforcement situated along the border \nto cover some of the costs they incur as a result of dealing with \nillegal immigration, with drug trafficking, with stolen vehicles, and \nwith other border-related crimes.\n  The amendment authorizes $50 million a year to enable law enforcement \nwithin 100 miles of the border to hire additional personnel, to obtain \nnecessary equipment, to cover the cost of overtime, and to cover \nadditional transportation costs. Law enforcement outside of this 100-\nmile geographical limit would be eligible if the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity certified that they are located in what we call a high-impact \narea.\n  The United States shares 5,525 miles of border with Canada and 1,989 \nmiles of border with Mexico. Many of the local law enforcement agencies \nthat are located along the border are small rural departments charged \nwith patrolling very large areas of land with very few officers and \nwith very limited resources. According to a 2001 study by the United \nStates-Mexico Border Counties Coalition, criminal justice costs \nassociated with illegal immigration exceeded $89 million in each and \nevery year. Counties along the southwest border are some of the poorest \nin our country, and they are not in a good position to cover these \ninitial costs. The States of Arizona and New Mexico have declared \nstates of emergency in order to provide local law enforcement with \nimmediate assistance in addressing criminal activity along the border, \nand it is time that the Federal Government step up and share some of \nthis burden.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment again as they have in \nthe past. Let me make it clear to my colleagues I am offering this \nbecause, although it was adopted as part of the immigration bill, we \nneed to once again adopt this amendment and attach it to this bill if \nthis bill in fact winds up going to the President for signature.\n  Mr. President, let me now change subjects once more and speak not \nabout the Secure Fence Act, which is the legislation the Senate is \ndealing with today, but to speak about a subject that has been given \nvery short shrift here on the Senate floor in recent weeks and months; \nthat is, Congress's failure to enact any serious legislation with \nrespect to the major health care problems facing our Nation. While \nproblems such as the fact that 47 million uninsured Americans continue \nto be ignored by this Congress, by this administration, what is equally \ndisappointing to me is that there are a number of Federal health \nprograms that we are failing to reauthorize each year, and that number \ncontinues to grow. These are programs which are public, they are well-\nknown, and I believe the failure of the Congress to reauthorize these \nis a major neglect of our responsibilities.\n  Although the Appropriations Committee continues to provide resources \nfor a number of these expired Federal programs, Congress has \nincreasingly failed to provide the roadmap to the executive branch for \nhow these funds are expected to be spent. In fact, in each of the last \nseveral years, the Congress has ceded more of its legislative and its \noversight roles in regard to health care to the executive branch in \nwhat one head of a national physician organization referred to as \n``inexcusable inaction.'' The result is that Congress is increasingly \nacting more like a trade association in trying to lobby the executive \nbranch of Government to do things related to health care than it is \nacting as a legislative branch actually considering and passing \nlegislation on these important issues.\n  I find myself being asked by colleagues to cosign letters to the \nadministration urging them to use their discretion, their \nadministrative discretion, their administrative authority to \nessentially sidestep the law, ignore the law, take unilateral action to \naddress some of these health care issues that we in the Congress seem \nunable or unwilling to deal with in legislation.\n  That is, I fear, the sad legacy of this 109th Congress on health care \npolicy. When the question is raised: What did the 109th Congress do to \nimprove health care for Americans, I think the answer almost certainly \nwill be very little, if anything.\n  First, let's take the Medicare physician payment formula. As part of \nthe Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Congress enacted a provision that \nattempted to save Medicare money, and it did so by placing physician \npayments on an automatically adjusting formula called the sustainable \ngrowth rate or SGR. During the economic boom of the 1990s, this SGR \nformula worked well for physicians, and physicians did receive positive \nupdates year after year during that period.\n\n  Without getting into great details about the formula that we enacted \nback in 1997, there are four factors that have caused the formula to \nresult in cuts in payments to physicians in recent years. Let me \nmention those four factors: First was the economic downturn in the \nfirst term of the Bush administration; second, the changes in the \ncomposition of managed-care enrollment; third, the addition of more \npreventive care services; and, fourth, the inclusion of prescription \ndrugs in the calculation of the formula.\n  Congress created a mess with a poorly devised formula and, in 2001, \nmore than two-thirds of the Members of Congress--both Democrats and \nRepublicans--cosponsored legislation to halt the cuts and to change the \nmanner in which this SGR formula was to be calculated. That \nlegislation, unfortunately, died when the congressional leadership \ndeclined to schedule a vote. As a result, physician payments were cut \nby 5.4 percent in 2002.\n  In 2002, there were more than 80 percent of the Congress who signed \non to cosponsor legislation to fix the physician payment formula, but \nsome deal was brokered that year, 2002, by one of the committee chairs \nand one physician group to impose a freeze in the payment and \nbackloading the cuts in a budget-neutral manner in later years.\n  So rather than fixing the problem, that has become the new mode in \nCongress: we go for year after year patchwork. Physician groups face an \nimpending cut year after year. Congress pushes back the need to truly \nfix the problem, and the problem grows bigger and bigger, to a point \nwhere some would argue it is virtually unfixable at this point.\n\n[[Page S10117]]\n\n  What do I mean by ``virtually unfixable''? According to a new \nCongressional Budget Office analysis of the Medicare physician payment \nformula, one solution to fix the problem would cost $200 billion over \nthe next 10 years. The sham of these annual 1-year adjustments to the \nMedicare physician payment formula masks the true size of our Nation's \nbudget deficit, as we all know very well that the Congress is not going \nto allow scheduled cuts to physician payment rates of more than 40 \npercent in the coming years, as is provided for in the law that is now \nbuilt into the Congressional Budget Office baseline projections.\n  So this SGR formula is clearly broken, but the hole that has been \ncreated is so deep that the problem is largely unsolvable at this \npoint. The problem is made worse, of course, by the very fact that \nCongress has failed to pass a budget this year. In its next budget--\nhopefully, next year--Congress needs to enact, in my view, a ``truth in \nbudgeting'' amendment for Medicare physician payments so that we can \nadmit the true level of our Nation's deficit by revising the payment \nformula baseline, and through that device address the problem with the \nSGR formula in a forthright manner.\n  It is, sadly, too late to hope that we can solve all of this problem \nthis year in this 109th Congress. I urge congressional leadership and \norganizations that represent physicians groups to push to resolve this \nannual crisis in the next Congress--early in the next Congress--in what \nwould be a far more honest and open manner that would lead to a \npermanent fix with respect to this physician payment formula.\n  Unfortunately, the Medicare physician payment formula is just one \nexample of the much larger institutional problem facing the Congress in \ncoming to grips with health care issues. Just a year ago Congress \nfailed to restore more than $1 billion in expiring funding for the \nState Children's Health Insurance Program, or SCHIP. While there is not \na single Member of Congress who would admit to not supporting the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, congressional leadership has \nfailed to find a way to ensure that $1 billion in dedicated resources \nto SCHIP was actually available to spend on the program.\n  Now SCHIP faces a larger problem because the States are estimating a \n$900 million shortfall in fiscal year 2007 in order to provide current \nlevels of health insurance coverage for children. According to the \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics and 85 other national organizations in a \nletter to Congress dated September 18:\n\n       Without additional federal funding to avert these \n     shortfalls, states may have to reduce their SCHIP enrollment, \n     placing health care insurance coverage for over 500,000 low-\n     income children at risk. States may also be forced to enact \n     harmful changes to their SCHIP programs, such as curtailing \n     benefits, increasing beneficiary cost-sharing or reducing \n     provider payments.\n\n  Just a few years ago, Congress and the administration provided what \nis now estimated to be a $700 billion Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit to our Nation's seniors. Yet somehow we cannot find our way to \nprovide 1 percent of that amount for our Nation's children to avert a \nshortfall in funding in order to ensure that not only prescription \ndrugs but comprehensive health care is provided to those low-income \nchildren.\n  Four days before that, the Institute of Medicine issued a report \nnoting that despite a profound epidemic confronting our Nation with \nrespect to childhood obesity, the Federal Government, the food \nindustry, schools, and others have made little progress in stemming \nthis growing tide of childhood obesity.\n  In 2 straight years, the Senate has passed amendments to the \nAgriculture appropriations bill by overwhelming majorities to increase \nfunding for programs such as TEAM Nutrition, only to see that money \ndisappear once we got into conference with the House. What is needed, \nin my view, is national leadership, both by the administration and by \nthe Congress. We have failed to deal with this extremely important \nissue affecting the long-term health of many of our children.\n  In addition to confronting expiring provisions with programs such as \nMedicare and SCHIP and major problems through the appropriations \nprocess in getting adequate funds to deal with childhood obesity, I \nalso want to raise the issue of Congress' failure to enact \nreauthorizations of numerous Federal programs. According to the \nCongressional Budget Office, in its annual report entitled \n``Unauthorized Appropriations and Expiring Authorizations'':\n\n       The Congress has appropriated about $159 billion for fiscal \n     year 2006 for programs and activities whose authorizations of \n     appropriations have expired.\n\n  Some of the major health care programs whose authorizations have \nexpired include the National Institutes of Health, the Ryan White CARE \ngrant programs, the veterans' medical care, the Indian Health Service, \nand the Administration on Aging.\n  Considering all the Congress must consider on an annual basis, it is \nnot surprising that some programs are not reauthorized in a timely \nfashion. What has become disappointing is that there appears to be a \nlack of effort in some instances to even try or to bring these issues \nto closure despite the vast need.\n  For example, the Indian Health Care Improvement Act expired in 2001, \nand for 6 long years American Indians and Alaska Natives have tried \nrepeatedly to reauthorize the programs administered by the Indian \nHealth Service. Moreover, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights issued a \nreport in 2003 entitled, ``A Quite Crisis: Federal Funding and Unmet \nNeed in Indian Country,'' that called for immediate passage of the \nIndian Health Care Improvement Act and for the Federal Government to \n``act immediately to reverse this shameful and unjust treatment'' that \nis the Indian health care system and funding levels.\n  And yet, here we are 3 years later and the Committee on Indian \nAffairs has reported a reauthorization bill to the Senate floor over 6 \nmonths ago, but this bill has not yet been bought up for debate.\n  Failure with respect to the Medicare physician payment formula, the \nState Children's Health Insurance Program shortfalls, childhood \nobesity, and the Indian Health Service are just examples of a larger \nproblem that has grown over the years.\n  Other programs, such as the Health Professions Act, so desperately \nneed to be reauthorized and improved that both the administration and \nAppropriations Committee recognize are not working well, so they \ncontinue to get dramatically cut or even zeroed out. Meanwhile, as a \nNation, there are areas in the country with terrible health profession \nshortages, and we are now importing 25 percent of our physician \nworkforce from foreign nations, which is not a good result either for \nour Nation or for the country from which we have taken their doctors.\n  Mr. President, our Nation's health care system is in a mess, and yet \nthe Congress is not addressing rather critical and fundamental issues \ndue to inaction, neglect, or inattention.\n  In the coming days and during the lameduck session, I urge the \nleadership of the Congress to begin the work of addressing these \nimportant health care problems facing our country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Is the Senator seeking consent to proceed in morning business?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 30 \nminutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/26/senate-section/article/S10117-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10117-S10120]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FAMILY PROSPERITY ACT\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, earlier this year Republicans put together \none of the most important bills we have considered, and Republicans \nasked for a vote on that important bill we call the Family Prosperity \nAct. Indeed, it does deal with the prosperity, the economic well-being, \nthe cost of living for every American family. It contains three very \nimportant measures and all enjoy majority support in the Senate. One \nwas permanent death tax relief, another was the extension of very \nimportant expiring tax provisions, and a minimum wage increase of more \nthan 40 percent.\n  The bill represents a true bipartisan compromise. Yet it met unified \nDemocratic obstruction that prevented it from receiving an up-or-down \nvote. I do not think I have ever seen a vote that\n\n[[Page S10118]]\n\nhas so clearly demonstrated Democrats' willingness to turn their backs \non American families in order to score political points. I believe \nAmericans understand that Republicans worked hard to reach a true \ncompromise that would raise the standard of living for all American \nfamilies. I think they will remember that after years of rhetoric, \nDemocrats proved they were all talk and no action.\n  For years Republicans, along with many Democrats, have worked for \npermanent death tax relief because it is an immoral double-tax that \npunishes death and savings. As the Senator from New York, Mrs. Clinton, \nsaid when she was running for office in the year 2000:\n\n       [Y]ou ought to be able to leave your land and the bulk of \n     your fortunes to your children and not the government.\n\n  Other Democrats have supported death tax relief in the past, \nincluding Senators Wyden, Bayh, Pryor, Landrieu, and Cantwell. Even the \nminority leader, Senator Reid, has said he is for ``fixing the estate \ntax.'' Yet when it came time to vote, they joined their fellow \nDemocrats to block death tax relief.\n  The Family Prosperity Act also extends several important tax relief \nprovisions that are set to expire in October to extend several critical \nrelief measures, including State and local sales tax deductions, \nresearch and development tax credits, college tuition deductions, work \nopportunity tax credits, welfare-to-work tax credit, depreciation for \nrestaurants, timber capital gains, teacher classroom expense \ndeductions.\n  These tax relief provisions enjoyed broad bipartisan support and need \nto be renewed to keep our economy growing. Instead, in August, \nDemocrats obstructed these items and essentially voted to raise the \ncost of living for American families.\n  Additionally, the Family Prosperity Act contained a longtime priority \nfor Senate Democrats, a 40-percent increase in the minimum wage.\n  I must make it clear that I personally oppose a minimum wage \nincrease, as do many of my Republican colleagues. Economists agree that \nraising the minimum wage prices people with low skills out of the job \nmarket and keeps them from getting a job that ultimately pays higher \nwages. Yet Republicans such as myself are willing to vote for this true \ncompromise bill. Unfortunately, Democrats chose election-year partisan \nobstruction instead of lowering the cost of living for American \nfamilies.\n  However, today we can change this. We are nearing the end of the \n109th Congress, and we have debated these issues over and over. We now \nhave one final opportunity to get this right and pass this bill to \nsecure America's prosperity. In fact, I understand that some Democrats \njust gave a press conference earlier today urging the passage of the \ntax relief extensions in this Family Prosperity Act. Well, they are \nabout to have their chance. The Democrats now have one final \nopportunity to either do what is right for American families and lower \nthe cost of living or they can choose to continue their partisan \npolitical games of blocking American priorities so they can try to \nblame Republicans as a do-nothing Congress.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Yes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would inquire of the distinguished \nSenator from South Carolina--he has just described the blocking of the \nFamily Prosperity Act, which, as I recall, combines the death tax, an \nincrease in the minimum wage, and so-called extension of the tax \nrelief, including the teacher classroom deduction, the State and local \ntax deduction, and the R and development--tax credit. But I \nbelieve he also referenced a press conference that was held at 10 \no'clock this morning here at the Capitol where Republicans were charged \nwith raising taxes against the middle class for failing to extend the \nvery tax extenders that they blocked just in August. Is that the \nSenator's understanding?\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. The Senator from Texas knows as well as I do that this \nhas become the pattern of our Democratic colleagues: to purposely block \nimportant legislation and then attempt to come down and blame \nRepublicans or blame the President when it doesn't actually get done.\n  I am excited, as the election nears, that the American people are \nmuch smarter than that. They are going to clearly see through those \nattempts. These important things which need to be done, many of which \nwe have been able to accomplish despite Democratic obstruction, are \nstill being blocked by our Democratic colleagues.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for an additional \nquestion?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Yes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Is the Senator aware that in addition to blocking the \nFamily Prosperity Act, which would have achieved the No. 1 item on the \nDemocratic agenda, which is raising the minimum wage, in addition to \nreducing the death tax and providing additional tax relief, which we \ndiscussed, that there have been other efforts to block and then blame \nRepublicans for being a do-nothing Congress?\n  I would just like to read a short list--I know the Senator has some \nother prepared remarks he is going to focus on--just to cover sort of a \nsurvey of the field, of areas which our friends on the other side of \nthe aisle have sought to block and blame the majority while, at the \nsame time, being the ones responsible for blocking important \nlegislation.\n  For example, is the Senator aware that there is now an attempt on the \nDemocratic side to block the Child Custody Protection Act--and we \nmentioned the estate tax and Extension of Tax Relief Act, the Gulf of \nMexico Energy Security Act, which would help us become less dependent \non imported energy and oil, the Arctic Coastal Plain Domestic Energy \nSecurity Act, the Health Insurance Marketplace Modernization and \nAffordability Act, the Legislative Line Item Veto Act, the Federal \nElection Integrity Act, and the Social Security Guarantee Act? Is the \nSenator aware that in each of those instances, but for blocking by our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle, we would actually be able to \nmake bipartisan reforms and actually advance the agenda of the American \npeople in very positive and constructive ways?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Yes, I am aware. And I am aware that all of the bills and \nlegislation that my colleague mentioned have majority support in the \nSenate. But by using procedural blocking techniques, the Democrats have \nkept these from coming to a vote, or even debated in some cases. But, \nagain, I am confident the American people, as they focus on what we \nhave been doing--and I realize our Democratic colleagues produced their \ncommercials to call us a do-nothing Congress several months ago, so it \nhas become very important for them in the last days of this Congress to \nblock everything that they can. But we have several important pieces of \nlegislation this week related to the security of this country that we \nneed to pass, and we are going to have the opportunity in a few minutes \nto hopefully get unanimous consent to pass the Family Prosperity Act, \nto give people a raise in the minimum wage, to pass these tax \nextenders, and to create a compromise on this death tax, which is so \nimmoral and hurts so many families.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, if the Senator would yield for one last \nquestion.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Yes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I know the Senator's focus is on the \nFamily Prosperity Act. But one of the bills that I mentioned, just as a \nfinal example of this tactic of blocking and then blaming the majority \nfor being a do-nothing Congress, is the Health Insurance Marketplace \nModernization and Affordability Act. As I recall, this is sometimes \ncalled the small business health insurance bill, which would be \ndesigned to allow small businesses and other associations to pool \ntogether to buy health insurance for their employees at about 12 \npercent lower rates than are otherwise available.\n  Is the Senator aware that while we attempted to close off debate, 55 \nSenators voted to be able to close off debate and go to that important \nsmall business health reform legislation, and 43 Senators voted against \nclosing off debate, thus preventing us--again, blocking us--from \npassing this important health care legislation which appears to \notherwise have broad bipartisan support?\n  Mr. DeMINT. I am glad the Senator from Texas brought that up because \nthis morning our distinguished colleague from New Mexico was talking\n\n[[Page S10119]]\n\nabout how Republicans have done nothing significant to lower health \ninsurance costs when, in fact, the small business health plan would \nhave done just that. I was a small businessman for many years. Health \ncare is one of the highest expenses we had. The chance to pool together \nwith small businesses all over the country to buy insurance, just like \nlarge companies can do, is a commonsense measure that should have been \npassed in the Senate, yet was blocked by our colleagues.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS CONSENT--H.R. 5970\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, we have the opportunity to correct a \nwrong. An important bill was blocked. I would like, as we consider this \nFamily Prosperity Act this morning, to ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 562, H.R. \n5970, which is the Death Tax Repeal Act, which we call the Family \nProsperity Act. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read the third \ntime and passed, and a motion to reconsider be laid on the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, we see again a bill that has been debated \nand considered for many months, a bill on which a press conference was \nheld this very day saying we need to pass a major portion of it. Yet at \nevery turn there is blocking.\n  I would like to take a few minutes--and if the Presiding Officer \nwould let me know when I have 5 minutes left--to talk about one of the \nprovisions of the Family Prosperity Act. My friends on the other side \nof the aisle are holding up legislation that would prevent an enormous \nincrease in the death tax on everyday Americans. I will talk more about \nthis chart, but Democrats widely claim that the death tax impacts only \na few of the wealthiest Americans. The truth is, the only reason the \ndeath tax doesn't affect more hard-working Americans today is that it \ncurrently--the Republicans have passed temporary legislation that is \nphasing out the death tax, as we can se on this chart through 2010. And \nwe have done this despite Democratic obstruction. But as you can see \nfrom this chart, if the Democrats have their way, a huge number of \nAmerican families will be in the death tax death grip in 2011.\n\n  Minority Whip Durbin, my colleague from Illinois, said this about the \ndeath tax:\n\n       How many families will benefit if the estate tax is \n     repealed? Each year in America, a Nation of 300 million: only \n     8,200 families. You have to search long and hard to find \n     them. These families are so well off, who have done so well \n     in this great Nation, who have benefited from this democracy \n     and the blessings of liberty, who have enjoyed a comfortable \n     life because of their prosperity, who now have taken millions \n     of dollars to hire the most effective lobbyists in \n     Washington, DC to push this outrageous special interest \n     legislation, the fattest of cats in America will get a great \n     bowl of tax cuts, tax cuts on the estate tax.\n\n  Senator Durbin argues against full repeal of the death tax, but we \nare not arguing for full repeal of the death tax. Our legislation would \nsimply prevent an enormous increase in the death tax, while Senator \nDurbin is arguing that we should let the death tax increase in 2011 to \na top rate of 60 percent. That is not taxing, it is taking. No, in \nfact, it is stealing.\n  Senator Durbin also argues that the death tax only affects 8,200 \nfamilies. The truth is, the death tax doesn't affect 8,200 family \nmembers who may die; it affects millions of family members still living \nwho are left to deal with Uncle Sam's sticky fingers.\n  Let's take a look for a minute at homes in Senator Durbin's State. \nKeep in mind, in 2011, if Senator Durbin has his way, all estates of $1 \nmillion or more will be taxed at a very high rate.\n  He says: You will have to search long and hard for these families.\n  But look at these homes in Chicago that he says are owned by the \nfattest cats. These are very modest and some would consider lower scale \nhomes, all valued at over $1 million today. Are these the wealthiest \nAmericans? If you look at Chicago, right now over 36,000 homes in urban \nareas would be affected by the 2011 death tax. But if you move ahead to \n2011 and look at the number of homes in the Chicago area that will be \naffected by the death tax, the Democratic death tax increase, you are \nlooking at more than 143,000 homes. You don't have to look long and \nhard to find that many houses.\n  What about other cities? By 2011, when the death tax is raised to the \nDemocrats' level that they want, if you look around the country, over \n500,000 in New York City, over 200,000 in Boston, over 250,000 in \nNewark. If you go to Atlanta, 26,000; Chicago, as I said, 143,000; San \nFrancisco, over a quarter of a million; Los Angeles, 812,000. You don't \nhave to look long and hard to find these homes.\n  The Census reports that just over 1 million homes in 2004 were \nsubject to the death tax at the Democrats' level of 2011. In 2005, that \nnumber reached 1.4 million, over a 40-percent increase. As properties \ncontinue to appreciate, that number will continue to increase year \nafter year, subjecting more and more Americans to the Democratic death \ntax. If you look at 2005, under the levels that will happen in 2011, \nthere has been a 143-percent increase in the number of homes that will \nbe affected, just in 2 years, based on the Democratic death tax.\n  Let's talk about some farms. Let's look at who these families are who \nSenator Durbin claims have enjoyed a comfortable life--the ``fat cats'' \nas he calls them. There are nearly 30,000 farms in Illinois alone, many \nof them owned by families whose comfortable life has made them a target \nof Senator Durbin's death tax should we not vote to block the impending \ntax increase. Based on 2002 Illinois Farm Bureau figures, over one-\nfourth--26.7 percent--of all Illinois farms would currently be subject \nto the death tax at Senator Durbin's rate of taxes in 2011. In 2011, \nyou will have about 30,000 Illinois farms, or over 40 percent of all \nfarms will likely be subject to the death tax. When we fail to prevent \nthe 2011 Durbin death tax increase, it will not be hard to find almost \none-half of Illinois' farms. If you take the USDA figures, the \nDepartment of Agriculture, they say that over half of the farms in \nIllinois will be subject to the death tax in 2011 if Senator Durbin \ngets his way.\n  How many farms will be eligible if hit by the Democratic death tax \nincrease in 2011? Well, again, the fat cats we are talking about, if \nyou look at Arkansas, you have nearly 5,000; Missouri, 9,200; Iowa, \nnearly 20,000 farms; South Dakota, 5,500; in California, 20,000. Lots \nof family farms are going to be affected by the Democratic tax \nincrease.\n  Let's talk about small businesses, really the backbone of the \nAmerican economy. Who are these--to quote Senator Durbin--``the fattest \nof cats who have taken millions of dollars to hire the most effective \nlobbyists in Washington, DC to push this''--as he calls it--\n``outrageous special interest legislation.''\n  Again, his numbers are somewhat questionable. The National Federation \nof Independent Business reports that 1.4 million small businesses would \ncurrently be subject to Durbin's tax increase in 2011 if the Democrats \nget their way. And by 2011, an additional 1.2 million will be eligible \nfor the tax. A vote against the Republican legislation to reform the \ndeath tax is a vote to increase the death tax on 2.6 million small \nbusinesses.\n  Are these 2.6 million hard-working small business owners and \nemployers the fattest of cats? Small businesses that we all use every \nday will be affected.\n\n  Let's take a closer look at some of the specific examples of these \nfamily farms, family homes, and family-owned businesses if the death \ntax is implemented the way the Democrats want. I will use one. The \nGreens, the Green family--Greens Printers. For 97 years, Janet Green \nand her family have owned and operated Greens Printers, Inc., in Long \nBeach, CA. Her company operates a sheet-fed, four-color printing plant \nwith full bindery and electronic capabilities. The family wants to \nremain in business for many years to come. The fact that they have to \npay a ridiculous insurance premium for the sole purpose of paying a tax \nwhen they die is not only absurd, it is antibusiness. However, the \nfuture of Greens Printers is being threatened by the death tax. Janet's \ncompany cannot afford to pay an enormous life insurance cost that would \nhelp pay for the death tax when\n\n[[Page S10120]]\n\nher parents need to pass on the business.\n  Janet says:\n\n       Because we are a third generation printing facility, we \n     have already paid the estate tax in the early 1970's. Both of \n     my parents are well into their seventies and not insurable \n     because of ill health and the astronomical cost associated to \n     do so. At roughly $100,000 a year [for this insurance \n     policy], we cannot afford it.\n\n  She says:\n\n       Let my employees keep their jobs and let us maintain the \n     risk of owning the business to keep them employed.\n\n  She is reminding us it is not just the family that is affected, but \nit is everyone who works for these businesses who are ruined by this \ndeath tax.\n  Over the years, Green has tried not only to be successful in \ngenerating profits, but also successful at being a good neighbor. She \ndoes this by supplying 20 people in the community with good jobs and \nbenefits, and by building lasting relationships with employees that \nallow the company to plan for future growth and the workers to enjoy a \nstable income and fulfilling livelihood.\n  Her family wants to keep Greens Printers even after she is gone.\n\n       We have 16 grandchildren who would love to take over the \n     company and see it grow someday.\n\n  She asked us in Congress:\n\n       Does Congress really think that we small, family-owned \n     businesses out here have hundreds of thousands of dollars \n     tucked away for estate taxes? Any money we make we put right \n     back into the business by purchasing new equipment and hiring \n     more employees.\n\n  Let's look at another business, the Barthle Brothers Ranch, in \nFlorida. These are some more fat cats, as Senator Durbin would call \nthem. Larry, Mark, and Randy Barthle are brothers who share a similar \nstory with many ranchers around the country. They are trying to \nmaintain the family ranch their father built in the early 1930s so they \ncan pass it on to future generations.\n  The ranch has received national recognition for its environmental \nstewardship practices that protect and promote the environment and \nwildlife. The family is dedicated to youth development to encourage \nfuture generations of ranchers to care for resources responsibly.\n  Larry Barthle says:\n\n       Our family was first struck by the Death Tax in the early \n     1970s when both my grandfather and uncle passed away within a \n     short period of each other. We had to sell 1,200 acres of the \n     ranch. Every penny went to pay taxes assessed to us and we \n     still had to take out a loan for the balance. Not one cent \n     was used for anything except taxes. After such a devastating \n     blow, it was my father's lifelong goal to be able to pass \n     along the ranch to his kids without being hit by the Death \n     Tax. He was successful at the time of his death because he \n     was able to make the transfers to my mother. We currently \n     have our ranch set up [in all kinds of legal frameworks in \n     order to try to get it through the death of another owner.]\n\n  This is not fair to American families and businesses.\n  Just one more quick example here, Mt. Pulaski Products. Scott and \nKathryn Steinfort operate the family-owned Mt. Pulaski Products, Inc., \nin a small town in Illinois that bears the company name. It has been in \nbusiness since 1951. They sell products that are absorbents and \nabrasives. For decades, the family has worked to build a successful \nbusiness, which employs over 44 citizens there in Mt. Pulaski.\n  The Steinforts also are known for their community service, dedicated \nto serving the community. They have two sons. Both are serving in Iraq, \nboth with engineering degrees. While many other engineering graduates \nare making big salaries, they serve our country. Someday they would \nlike to join the company business, but the death tax looms over the \nfamily business. Without wealth, the Steinforts may be forced to sell \nthe business to pay for the death tax, not only taking from future \ngenerations but possibly putting 40 families out of work. The say:\n\n       My wife and I have life insurance to cover these taxes, but \n     as we age our premiums are marching steadily higher. Combined \n     with not knowing how much we need to plan for in taxes and \n     fees, the potential costs ultimately point to only one path: \n     sale or liquidation of our plants to pay our tax burdens.\n\n  I have a lot more here that we could talk about, but I will put up \none more chart. The Senator from Illinois, Senator Durbin, has told the \nAmerican people that only 8,200 American families are affected by the \ndeath tax. The only reason that is today is because the Republicans \nhave overcome Democratic obstruction and at least temporarily reduced \nthe death tax. If the Democrats get their way, the tax on the American \nfamily will reach over 3.3 million children and grandchildren of those \nwho die in the 10 years after 2011. Over the next generation, millions \nof children and grandchildren and workers in small businesses and farms \nwill be affected.\n  I ask all my colleagues, what is the difference between these \nnumbers? The difference is the truth. We have been misled, that this \ntax is about the wealthiest of Americans. Whereas, as we have seen \ntoday, in the homes and the farms, the small businesses, this tax is \nimmoral. It steals from the American people, the hard-working families \nwho put together some savings to pass along to the next generation. It \nis not to the fat cats and their lobbyists. It is to the average \nAmericans, who are doing what we expect them to do, and that is to work \nand to save and to build a better future.\n  Today we have seen again that the opportunity to compromise and at \nleast reduce these taxes was blocked again by our Democratic \ncolleagues. Yet they come to this floor every day and ask why we are \nnot doing something for the cost of living of the American people, to \nhelp improve their future. I think the reason for this is obvious. \nSenator Cornyn brought it up a minute ago. The Democratic strategy is \nto block what needs to be done and then try to blame someone else when \nit does not get done. The American people are smarter than that and \nthey will see the difference.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak up to \n15 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from \nLouisiana.\n  Mr. HATCH.

Mr. President, I would like to turn my attention to one \nissue we have to resolve before we leave on this Friday or Saturday.\n  The Senators from Mississippi and Texas and Alabama and Louisiana and \nthe Senators from Florida have stepped forward to come up with a plan \nthat will do more than just talk about the recovery of the gulf coast \nbut will actually put money behind that promise. We will put real money \nbehind that promise.\n  We have been working for months and months through an extremely \ndifficult negotiation and have come up with a way to open more drilling \nin the Gulf of Mexico, drilling for oil and drilling for gas--\nparticularly natural gas--as our region struggles to come back, to stay \ncompetitive as industries large and small struggle to come back. The \nprice of natural gas remains too high. One way to drive it down is to \nopen more gas reserves in this Nation, to open the supply.\n  In the last Energy bill we passed, there were any number of ideas and \nnew initiatives for energy conservation. But what we didn't do in the \nlast Energy bill--please hear me--was open\n\n[[Page S10121]]\n\nnew production. We spent the whole time debating ANWR as if it were the \nonly place in America we could drill. We have debated it for 40 years, \nand maybe we will continue to debate it, but it ended in a no advance-\nno retreat status--basically a draw--in the last Energy bill because \nall the energy was spent in a discussion of ANWR, which is a very \nimportant subject, but it is not the only place that has oil and has \ngas. We have a lot of it in the gulf. We are willing to drill.\n  This is the extraordinary find just off the coast of Louisiana--\nactually an outside distance of over 200 miles--most extraordinarily, \n28,000 feet deep, 20,000 feet of water and 8,000 feet below the floor. \nThis well in this small, little square will double the size of the \nreserves in the entire Gulf of Mexico. There is plenty of oil and gas \nin the gulf, and the great news is that Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, \nand Alabama will do the drilling. We will be host for the industry. We \nrespect the rights of other States that might choose other ways. Your \nState, Mr. President, has chosen a different way, other States look at \nthe Atlantic coast and have chosen a different way, and Florida has \nchosen a different way. That debate is for another day.\n  Right now, the American people need this leadership team to act, to \nopen 9 million new acres of land in the Gulf of Mexico. This has been \nagreed to by Democrats, by Republicans, by Florida, by Alabama, by \nMississippi, by Louisiana, and by Texas, by all the Governors, starting \nwith Governor Bush, to Governor Perry, to Governor Blanco, to Governor \nRiley, to Governor Barbour. You would think we could get this done \nbefore we leave.\n  This is a jack well, one little square. This is lease sale 181 and \n181 south, which Pete Domenici has led in an extraordinary bipartisan \neffort with 72 votes on the floor to open this drilling. Many want to \nsay it is not enough. It looks pretty big to me. We don't even know the \noil and gas that is there because we haven't even tested it. Trust me, \nthere is a lot of oil and gas. Check the industry, check the Web site \nabout what must be there. And there is no fight about it. The only \nfight is we can't seem to get this bill passed when most everybody has \nagreed to it. Some people are holding out to drill off the coast of \nCalifornia or off the coast of New Hampshire or off the coast of New \nJersey, which is not going to happen in the next week. It may not \nhappen in the next year or two. But this can happen now. We need to \nmake this happen now. The industry needs the oil and gas.\n  Why do I keep saying it is America's energy coast? Because this is \nthe pipeline. I didn't make this up. This comes off of the Web site. It \nis from the Annual Florida Natural Gas Supplemental Gas Supply and \nDisposition from the Energy Administration. This is not from Mary \nLandrieu's office; this is from the Energy Administration. This is \nwhere the natural gas is. This is where it comes from. The \ninfrastructure is here, and our country desperately needs it.\n  Here is another chart that shows it in a more colorful fashion. This \nis the pipeline coverage. You can see the contributions of Texas, \nLouisiana, and Mississippi. This is the Superdome. It sits right here. \nThere is Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas. Right here is the heart of \nAmerica's energy coast. We are proud of it.\n  There is not a whole lot of drilling going on up here, not a whole \nlot up here in the northwest, but the infrastructure is here.\n  We need to open up lease sale 181. The steady stream of revenue to \nrestore this coast and to build these levees--$8 billion--is produced \noff of this coast every year, and getting a portion of these revenues \nback to these States, opening additional reserves, and sharing these \nrevenues to build this coast and to restore this coast is something we \ncan get done.\n  In the spirit of the leadership and the spirit of the great victory \nlast night, let this team in Washington get this victory for the \ncountry before we leave.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I proudly rise to mark the 20th anniversary \nof a great event.\n  Twenty years ago today, Antonin Scalia took the oath of office to \nbecome an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  Through his dogged commitment to the fundamental principles of \nliberty, and the brilliance and passion with which he expresses that \ncommitment, Justice Scalia is having a profoundly positive impact on \nour nation.\n  In the time I have this morning, I would like to offer a few general \nremarks about Justice Scalia's judicial philosophy, his judicial \npersonality, and his judicial impact.\n  Antonin Scalia was born on March 11, 1936, in Trenton, New Jersey, \nthe only child of immigrant parents.\n  After graduating first in his high school class, summa cum laude and \nvaledictorian from Georgetown, and magna cum laude from Harvard Law \nSchool, he embarked on a legal career that would include stints in \nprivate practice, government service, the legal academy, and the \njudiciary.\n  President Reagan appointed Antonin Scalia in 1982 to the U.S. Court \nof Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, and then in 1986 to his current post \non the Supreme Court.\n  President Reagan did not choose Justice Scalia simply because he is \nsmart and talented.\n  With all due respect to the good Justice, there are many smart and \ntalented people around.\n  No, President Reagan chose Justice Scalia because his smarts and \ntalents are connected to a deeply considered and deliberately framed \njudicial philosophy rooted in the principles of America's founding.\n  Indeed, as Pepperdine law professor Douglas Kmiec has said, Justice \nScalia ``is the justice who works the hardest to construct a coherent \ntheory of constitutional interpretation that does not change from case \nto case.''\n  When the Judiciary Committee hearing on Justice Scalia's nomination \nopened on August 5, 1986, I quoted from the Chicago Tribune's \nevaluation that the nominee before us was ``determined to read the law \nas it has been enacted by the people's representatives rather than to \nimpose his own preference upon it.''\n  Consider for a moment the vital importance of this simple principle.\n  Since the people and their elected representatives alone have the \nauthority to enact law, the way they have enacted it is the only sense \nin which the law is the law.\n  The way they have enacted it, then, is the only legitimate way for \njudges to read it.\n  This fundamental principle is at the heart of Justice Scalia's \njudicial philosophy.\n  This principle springs directly from the separation of powers, which \nAmerica's founders said was perhaps the most important principle for \nlimiting government and preserving liberty.\n  Alexander Hamilton wrote in The Federalist No. 78 that there is no \nliberty if the judiciary's power to interpret the law is not separated \nfrom the legislature's power to make the law.\n  In his dissenting opinion in Morrison v. Olson, Justice Scalia \nhighlighted the Massachusetts Constitution of 1780 which, to this day, \ncontains what Justice Scalia called the proud boast of democracy, that \nthis is a government of laws and not of men.\n  The Massachusetts charter, however, also states what is required for \nthis boast to be realized.\n  It requires the separation of powers, including that the judiciary \nshall never exercise the power to make law.\n  Today, only 42 percent of Americans know the number of branches in \nthe federal government and fewer than 60 percent can name even a single \none.\n  But America's founders insisted that identifying them, defining them, \nand separating them is essential for liberty itself.\n  In Marbury v. Madison, the great Chief Justice John Marshall wrote \nthat it is the duty of the judicial branch to say what the law is.\n  Not what the law says, but what the law is.\n  The law is more than simply ink blots formed into words on a page.\n  Saying what the law is requires saying what the law means, for that \nmeaning is the essence of the law itself.\n\n[[Page S10122]]\n\n  But here is the crux of the matter, Mr. President.\n  The meaning of the words in our laws comes from those who made them, \nnot from those who interpret them.\n  Those who chose the words in our laws gave them life by giving them \nmeaning, and the judicial task of saying what the law is requires \ndiscovering the meaning they provided.\n  The separation of powers, therefore, excludes from the judiciary the \npower to change the words or meaning of the law and secures to it the \npower to interpret and apply that law to decide cases.\n  As President Reagan put it when swearing in Justice Scalia 20 years \nago today, America's founders intended that the judiciary be \nindependent and strong, but also confined within the boundaries of a \nwritten Constitution and laws.\n  No one believes that principle more deeply, and insists on \nimplementing it more consistently, than Justice Scalia.\n  President Reagan often used the general label judicial restraint for \nthis notion of judges restrained by law they did not make and cannot \nchange.\n  A speech last year at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for \nScholars here in Washington was one of many instances in which Justice \nScalia used the more specific label originalism for his judicial \nphilosophy.\n  When judges interpret the law, he said, they must ``give that text \nthe meaning that it bore when it was adopted by the people.''\n  Whether that simple statement elicits growls or cheers today, Justice \nScalia was merely echoing America's founders.\n  James Madison said that the only sense in which the Constitution is \nlegitimate is if it retains the meaning given it by those who alone \nhave the authority to make it law.\n  This body unanimously confirmed Justice Scalia on September 17, 1986, \nthe 199th anniversary of the Constitution's ratification.\n  I see that as having more than coincidental significance, for it is \nJustice Scalia's judicial philosophy that gives the most substance and \npower to the Constitution.\n  The Constitution cannot govern government if government defines the \nConstitution.\n  That includes the judiciary, which is as much part of the Government \nas the legislative or executive branch.\n  To once again cite Chief Justice Marshall from Marbury v. Madison, \nAmerica's Founders intended the Constitution to govern courts as well \nas legislatures.\n  It cannot do so if, as Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes famously \nclaimed, the Constitution is whatever the judges say it is.\n  If the Constitution is little more than an empty linguistic glass \nthat judges may fill or a checkbook full of blank checks that judges \nmay write, it is not much of anything at all. We all know better.\n  I am not sure what such a collection of words without meaning might \nbe called, but it is not a Constitution.\n  Thankfully, Justice Scalia rejects such an anemic and shape-shifting \nview of the Constitution, insisting that even judges must be the \nservants rather than the masters of the law.\n  Justice Scalia insists that judges stick to judging so the \nConstitution can indeed be the Constitution.\n  Analyzing Justice Scalia's jurisprudential approach in the Arkansas \nLaw Review, one scholar described what he called the justice's \nmeticulous, almost obsessive, attention to language.\n  Let us remember that the epicenter of the remarkable system of \ngovernment America's founders crafted is indeed a written Constitution.\n  They, too, were obsessed with language.\n  President George Washington warned in his 1796 farewell address \nagainst changing the Constitution through what he called usurpation \nrather than the formal amendment process.\n  George Mason actually opposed ratification of the Constitution, in \npart because giving the Supreme Court too much power to construe the \nlaws would let them substitute their own pleasure for the law of the \nland.\n  President Thomas Jefferson said that ``our peculiar security is in \nthe possession of a written Constitution. Let us not make it a blank \npaper by construction.''\n  Justice Scalia appears to be in some good obsessive company.\n  No one should assume that while originalism is relatively straight-\nforward to describe, it is either perfect or easy.\n  Writing in the University of Cincinnati Law Review just a few years \ninto his Supreme Court service, Justice Scalia himself acknowledged \nthat originalism is, in his words, not without its warts.\n  But it is consistent with, I would say compelled by, the principles \nunderlying our form of Government.\n  And it is certainly better than the alternative, which puts judges \nrather than the people in charge of the law's meaning and the nation's \nvalues.\n  Let me emphasize that Justice Scalia's judicial philosophy is about \nthe process of interpreting and applying the law, to whatever ends the \nlaw requires.\n  That process can produce results in individual cases that political \nconservatives or liberals will support or oppose.\n  But when the law, and not the judge, decides the outcome of cases, \nthose who do not like the outcome can work to change the law.\n  When, however, the judge and not the law decides the outcome of \ncases, the people are nearly always left with no voice at all.\n  Justice Scalia's critics attack his judicial philosophy for the same \nreason he embraces it.\n  Originalism limits a judge's ability to make law.\n  The famed Senator and Supreme Court orator Daniel Webster once said \nthat ``there are men in all ages who mean to govern well, but they mean \nto govern. They promise to be good masters, but they mean to be \nmasters.''\n  Justice Scalia has often said that judges are no better suited to \ngovern than anyone else, and certainly have no authority to do so.\n  Unelected judges, no matter how well-intentioned, do not have the \npower to be our masters.\n  The temptation and danger of judges making law reminds me of a scene \nin The Fellowship of the Ring, the first installment of the Lord of the \nRings trilogy.\n  Gandalf the wizard has discovered that Bilbo's ring is indeed the One \nRing of power and Frodo insists that he take it.\n  Gandalf wisely says: Understand Frodo, I would use this ring from the \ndesire to do good. But through me, it would wield a power too great and \nterrible to imagine.\n  In that same spirit, Justice Scalia declines the power to make law.\n  As Hamilton put it, the great and terrible cost of judges rather than \nthe people making law would be liberty itself.\n  Thomas Jefferson warned that by playing with the meaning of the \nConstitution's words, the judiciary would turn the charter into a mere \nthing of wax that they would twist and shape into any form they chose.\n  In the last 70 years or so, the judiciary has been doing a lot of \ntwisting and shaping.\n  One of Justice Scalia's predecessors on the Supreme Court, Justice \nGeorge Sutherland, was also one of my predecessors as a Senator from \nUtah.\n  Justice Sutherland wrote this in 1937:\n\n       The judicial function is that of interpretation; it does \n     not include the power of amendment under the guise of \n     interpretation. To miss the point of difference between the \n     two is to . . . convert what was intended as inescapable and \n     enduring mandates into mere moral reflections.\n\n  In 1953, Justice Robert Jackson lamented what had become a widely \nheld belief that the Supreme Court decides cases by personal \nimpressions rather than impersonal rules of law.\n  Many people, conservatives as well as liberals, do not seem to mind \nthis trend so long as it is their moral reflections and their personal \nimpressions that are twisting and shaping the Constitution.\n  Many people, conservatives as well as liberals, applaud or criticize \nthe Supreme Court when it amends the Constitution, depending on whether \nthey like the Court's amendments.\n  Yet I ask my fellow citizens, both conservatives and liberals: would \nyou rather have your liberty secured by moral reflections and personal \nimpressions or enduring mandates and impersonal rules of law?\n  If you cede to judges the power to make law when you support the law \nthey make, what will you say when\n\n[[Page S10123]]\n\njudges--and they will--make law you oppose?\n  Liberty requires separating judges from lawmaking.\n  Liberty requires that judges take the law as they find it, with the \nmeaning it already has, apply it to decide concrete cases and \ncontroversies, and leave the rest to the people.\n  Professor John Jeffries of the University of Virginia Law School \nwrites that Justice Scalia ``is the most nearly consistent of our \njudges. He cares more about methodology than is usual among judges, \nworries more about fidelity to the law laid down, feels himself more \nclosely bound by external sources, and is more dedicated to a vision of \nconstitutional law as something distinct and apart from constitutional \npolitics.''\n  That is precisely the kind of judge America needs on the bench.\n  The second thing I want briefly to describe, is what has been called \nJustice Scalia's judicial personality.\n  It animates, communicates, and gives practical force to his judicial \nphilosophy.\n  It turns up the volume, making people sit up and take notice of what, \nfrom someone else, might be little more than some quiet ramblings at a \nseminar somewhere.\n  One way to describe Justice Scalia's judicial personality would be \nsimply to read from his opinions.\n  Even while enjoying his powerful prose, however, this might miss the \nreal point.\n  Justice Scalia's piercing logic, witty and provocative writing, \nverbal jousting in speeches and debates, and aggressive questions in \noral argument are but means to an end.\n  He uses wit, humor, logic, sarcasm, and the rest to expose the \npremises and implications of arguments, to assert and defend important \nprinciples, and to make the necessary application of those principles \nabsolutely inescapable.\n  Justice Scalia does not suffer fools gladly, nor will he ignore the \nman behind the jurisprudential curtain.\n  His judicial personality makes his judicial philosophy more potent \nand, quite frankly, impossible to ignore.\n  As a result, the adjectives attached to his name by media, political \nactivists, and commentators seem to be multiplying, as if a single \ndescriptive--or even two or three--just will not do.\n  Some call him outspoken, provocative, or fiery; others say he is \naggressive, engaging, and articulate.\n  One profile said he is colorful, controversial, and combative; \nanother said he is testy, witty, and sarcastic.\n  If adjectives are a measure of one's presence, Justice Scalia is very \npresent indeed.\n  Justice Scalia is also a funny man.\n  What is not to like about a judge who uses words such as pizzazzy \nwhen talking about constitutional interpretation?\n  I had no idea how to spell pizzazzy until I read it in one of Justice \nScalia's speeches.\n  Following our modern penchant for everything statistical, we also \nhave empirical evidence that Justice Scalia is indeed the funniest \nmember of the highest court in the land.\n  Professor Jay Wexler at Boston University Law School examined \ntranscripts of Supreme Court oral arguments, noting when they \nidentified laughter.\n  During the October 2004 term, Justice Scalia was way ahead of the \nlaugh pack, good for slightly more than one laugh per session.\n  Finally, I want to address Justice Scalia's judicial impact in two \nrespects.\n  The first is the impact that comes directly from him, from his \njudicial personality propelling his judicial philosophy.\n  One biography cites an unnamed Supreme Court observer noting that if \nthe mind were muscle, Justice Scalia would be the Arnold Schwarzenegger \nof American jurisprudence.\n  The inherent power of the principles on which Justice Scalia stands, \npropelled by the way in which he asserts and defends them, force us \nconfront, whether we like it or not, the issues most basic to a system \nof self-government based on the rule of law.\n  As a result, Harvard law professor John Manning writes, Justice \nScalia has had a palpable effect on the way we talk and think about the \nissues of judicial power and practice.\n  In addition to the immediate work of judges, which is to decide \ncases, Justice Scalia has prompted, poked, and prodded us to grapple \nmore seriously with these fundamental issues.\n  But he is not simply a judicial provocateur. When he enrages, he also \nengages. If Justice Scalia had no impact, he would get no attention. \nEven the commentators that call him a bully, or worse, feel they have \nto call him something. His harshest critics know they cannot ignore \nhim.\n  Scholars or political activists can no longer simply describe the \npolitical goods they want judges to deliver, they must defend why \njudges have the authority to deliver those goods.\n  Justice Scalia has helped lead this transformation by so powerfully \nand consistently arguing that the political ends do not justify the \njudicial means.\n  As a result, the left-wing groups that today fight President Bush's \njudicial nominees often use Justice Scalia as the bogey-man, the model \nthey say America must avoid.\n  To borrow an image from one of Justice Scalia's many famous \ndissenting opinions, he is used by some as the proverbial ghoul in the \nnight, used to scare citizens and small children.\n  Somehow, I think, that is fine with Justice Scalia because, even as a \nfoil, his judicial philosophy must be reckoned with.\n  He is indeed a happy warrior.\n  His speech at Harvard in September 2004 was typical.\n  According to news reports, nearly three times as many sought tickets \nas obtained them and he held the rapt attention of a standing-room-only \ncrowd.\n  Legal scholars from across the political spectrum concede Justice \nScalia's impact.\n  Professor Michael Dorf of Columbia Law School, for example, says that \nbecause of Justice Scalia's influence, we start more often with text \nrather than its history when looking at written law.\n  America's founders, it seems to me, assumed that judges would always \nstart with the text and be kept in check because the meaning of that \ntext already exists.\n  This is why America's founders could call the judiciary the weakest \nand least dangerous branch.\n  Putting statutory text ahead of statutory history would be a judicial \nno-brainer to them.\n  If Professor Dorf is correct, we should first lament that the courts \nhad gotten so far off course and then cheer Justice Scalia for helping \npoint the way back.\n  The second, more general, way of looking at Justice Scalia's impact \nhas a human face.\n  Like every Federal judge, Justice Scalia each year has the assistance \nof law clerks, those super-brainy, hyper-kinetic workhorses who seem \nable to leap a courthouse in a single bound after virtually no sleep.\n  As his Judiciary Committee hearing opened 20 years ago, Justice \nScalia introduced his law clerk Patrick Schiltz who had helped him \nprepare and who would go on to clerk for him on the Supreme Court.\n  Several months ago, this body confirmed Patrick Schiltz to be a U.S. \nDistrict Judge in Minnesota.\n  In 2004, we confirmed Mark Filip, who clerked for Justice Scalia \nduring the October 1993 term, to be a U.S. District Judge in Illinois.\n  In 2003, we confirmed Jeffrey Sutton, who clerked for Justice Scalia \nduring the October 1991 term, to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nSixth Circuit.\n  Justice Scalia must be proud of these former clerks who now sit on \nthe Federal bench, and the many who have argued cases before him, even \nwhen he might vote against their position or reverse one of their \ndecisions.\n  Justice Scalia's former clerks are now serving in many significant \npositions throughout the country.\n  They are partners at the Nation's leading law firms, on the faculty \nof the Nation's leading law schools, and heading legal teams at the \nNation's major corporations.\n  Some, such as Solicitor General Paul Clement, serve in the top tier \nof the executive branch.\n  Ed Whelan, who clerked for Justice Scalia during the October 1991 \nterm, served as my counsel when I chaired the Judiciary Committee and \nis now president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center here in \nWashington.\n  Through these talented and dedicated men and women who have served in \nhis\n\n[[Page S10124]]\n\nchambers, Justice Scalia's impact extends far beyond the halls of the \nSupreme Court.\n  Mr. President, I have received letters from some of Justice Scalia's \nformer law clerks offering their own thoughts, reflections, and \ncongratulations on this important anniversary.\n  I ask unanimous consent that they be made part of the record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HATCH. While I have just scratched surface, my time is almost \ngone.\n  Justice Antonin Scalia is the kind of judge America needs and the \nkind of man Americans would want living next door.\n  He considers aggressively and defends passionately the principles \nresponsible for the ordered liberty that makes America the envy of the \nworld.\n  He refuses to let politics supplant principle and with a confident \nhumility, or perhaps a humble confidence, submits himself to the rule \nof law and the collective judgment of his fellow citizens.\n  In the process, by the force of the principles in which he believes \nand the personality with which God has blessed him, Justice Antonin \nScalia has made our liberty more secure, our citizenry and leaders more \nresponsible, and given us all plenty to ponder, and chuckle about, \nalong the way.\n  Mr. President, I have such respect for the Federal judiciary. I have \nsuch respect for those who interpret the laws rather than make them. \nJustice Scalia is at the head of the pack.\n  Justice Scalia, congratulations on your first 20 years on the Supreme \nCourt. Thank you for all you continue to do for our Nation\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                               September 21, 2006.\n     Senator Orrin Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: I am writing you on the occasion of \n     Justice Antonin Scalia's twentieth anniversary as a member of \n     the United States Supreme Court to reflect on some of the \n     enormous contributions the justice has made to our public \n     life during his service on the Supreme Court. I first met the \n     justice almost twenty-five years ago at the very first \n     Federalist Society conference ever held which was at Yale Law \n     School. I was struck then and am struck now by his vivacious \n     intellectual manner, his tremendous enthusiasm and energy, \n     and by his sharp wit. Justice Scalia is a brilliant man of \n     many talents, and he is in my view the intellectual leader of \n     the Court. I thought I would write you this letter to \n     describe some of the many ways in which Justice Scalia has \n     distinguished himself on the Supreme Court.\n       First, the justice is one of the most gifted writers ever \n     to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States. Not since \n     Justice Robert Jackson has anyone served on the Court with \n     such a gift and flair for writing. Since his appointment to \n     the Court on September 26, 1986, Justice Scalia has emerged \n     as a brilliant, outgoing, and very outspoken Justice. His \n     sharp and pointed opinions, which all too often are dissents, \n     include many memorable lines. From the beginning, Justice \n     Scalia has also been a very active participant in the Court's \n     oral arguments where he asks probing and effective questions.\n       While serving on the Supreme Court, Justice Scalia became \n     the most active proponent of originalism among the justices, \n     and it is fair to say he is the leading proponent of \n     originalism in American law today. Originalism is, of course, \n     the theory that constitutional language should be interpreted \n     according to the original meaning the relevant words had \n     when they were enacted into law. Justice Scalia defended \n     this theory in an important public lecture which was \n     published under the title Originalism: The Lesser Evil and \n     then in a book called A Matter of Intepretation: Federal \n     Courts and the Law. Justice Scalia's originalism is \n     evident in many of the most important decisions he has \n     written or joined including his opinions rejecting the use \n     of substantive due process in abortion, homosexual rights, \n     or assisted suicide cases. On criminal law and procedure \n     cases, Justice Scalia's originalism has sometimes led him \n     to favor criminal defendants claims with respect to issues \n     such as the right to jury trial in sentencing, in \n     determining the scope of the Confrontation Clause, and in \n     evaluating whether the President has power to detain \n     citizens who are enemy combatants without a court hearing.\n       Justice Scalia has qualified his support for originalism in \n     two important ways which illustrate his intellectual depth \n     and contribution to legal theory. First, he has made it clear \n     in constitutional cases that it is the original meaning of \n     the text which controls and not the original intentions of \n     those who wrote the text. Justice Scalia applies this \n     approach as well in statutory interpretation cases where he \n     has led a campaign for formalism and against any reliance on \n     legislative history. Justice Scalia's formalism has had a big \n     effect on the Court, and the justices make much less use now \n     of legislative history than they did when Justice Scalia was \n     first appointed. The revival of formalism is thus another \n     major accomplishment of the Justice's during his twenty year \n     tenure on the Supreme Court.\n       Second, Justice Scalia has also argued that when the \n     original meaning of the constitutional text would enmesh \n     judges in balancing judges ought in those cases to announce a \n     minimalist rule to further judicial restraint. As a result, \n     Justice Scalia rejects on judicial restraint grounds allowing \n     judges to assess the proportionality of punishments under the \n     Eighth Amendment or the necessariness of federal laws under \n     the Necessary and Proper Clause or the unconstitutionality of \n     broad delegations of power to the executive under the non-\n     delegation doctrine. Justice Scalia has defended his approach \n     in an important law review article called The Rule of Law as \n     a Law of Rules. In this article, Justice Scalia makes it \n     clear that when the original meaning of the text would enmesh \n     judges in balancing he thinks they should abstain from acting \n     instead. This too is a major contribution to the theory of \n     judicial restraint in judging.\n       Justice Scalia's most important opinions on the Court \n     include: his dissent in Planned Parenthood of Pennsylvania v. \n     Casey, where the Court reaffirmed Roe v. Wade and his dissent \n     in Morrison v. Olsen, where the court upheld the \n     constitutionality of court appointed special prosecutors. The \n     Morrison dissent amusingly came to be hailed by liberals as \n     prophetic during the Clinton impeachment proceedings, and it \n     helped lead to a situation where the political branches \n     jointly decided to junk the special prosecutor law in 1999. \n     Other very important Scalia opinions include: his majority \n     opinion in Printz v. United States; his concurrence in Bush \n     v. Gore; and his dissents in Romer v. Evans and in Lawrence \n     v. Texas. Justice Scalia was also a critical fifth member of \n     the majority which found that flag burning was protected \n     speech under the first Amendment. In recent years, Justice \n     Scalia has led a campaign to preclude the Court from relying \n     on foreign law in many constitutional cases. But most \n     important of all, no other justice who has served on the \n     Court since Justice Scalia's appointment in 1986 has ever \n     been able to match him in his intellectual leadership of the \n     Court or in writing ability. A brilliant mind and a sharp pen \n     have guaranteed Justice Scalia a place in American history as \n     one of our most influential justices.\n           Best wishes,\n                                              Steven G. Calabresi,\n     Professor of Law.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               New York University\n\n\n                                                School of Law,\n\n                                 New York, NY, September 24, 2006.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: I am pleased to join the celebration of \n     the 20th anniversary of Justice Scalia's swearing in as a \n     Supreme Court Justice by submitting this letter to the \n     Congressional Record. Although it is somewhat ironic that \n     this tribute to Justice Scalia will be contained in pages of \n     legislative history that he so often derides, I think even he \n     will be convinced that, in this instance, the legislative \n     history is authoritative. After all, if, as he has noted, the \n     use of legislative history is ``the equivalent of entering a \n     crowded cocktail party and looking over the heads of the \n     guests for one's friends,'' he will see many friends and \n     admirers today. I proudly include myself in that group. \n     Justice Scalia has been a valued mentor and serving as his \n     law clerk was an honor I will always treasure.\n       All of the Justices play a significant role during their \n     time on the Supreme Court by virtue of their votes in the \n     important cases of the day. But most Justices fail to leave a \n     lasting imprint on the law that goes beyond those votes. \n     Justice Scalia's jurisprudence, in contrast, will long \n     outlast his time on the bench. For he has spent his twenty \n     years on the Court not merely voting in important cases; he \n     has been articulating his vision of the Court's place in the \n     constitutional order. Anyone interested in the Supreme \n     Court--from legal scholars to litigants, politicians to \n     pundits--must reckon with his impassioned and intelligent \n     defenses of originalism and textualism. These methodologies \n     have never had a more brilliant advocate on the bench, and \n     generations of law students will wrestle with the arguments \n     he has developed in his opinions. Whether you agree or \n     disagree with Justice Scalia's jurisprudence, there is no \n     denying the brilliance or coherence of his vision of the \n     Supreme Court.\n       It is important to note that this clarity has not come \n     without costs to the Justice. It takes courage for a judge to \n     stake out a clear position on what methodology he or she will \n     follow in constitutional and statutory cases. For this \n     transparency allows outside observers to assess the judge's \n     performance by a clear metric. It is so much easier for a \n     judge to take each case as it comes without declaring an \n     overarching method or approach. This flexibility allows the \n     judge to change positions from case to case and vote his or \n     her preferences without much constraint. Justice Scalia \n     has not allowed himself that indulgence. Even if we cannot \n     predict his vote in a given case, we know how to judge his \n     performance, for he has told us in\n\n[[Page S10125]]\n\n     no uncertain terms the values he seeks to uphold and the \n     approach he is committed to follow.\n       I will let history assess how each of the Justice's votes \n     has measured up to the standards he has set for himself. But \n     two things are clear. First, there are countless examples \n     that prove the Justice's fealty to his methodological \n     commitments. The Justice has not shied away from the \n     consequences of his chosen methodologies, even when it has \n     meant overturning an anti-flag burning law in Texas v. \n     Johnson, 491 U.S. 397 (1989), or rejecting the government's \n     attempt to deprive an American citizen accused of terrorism \n     of his procedural rights in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U.S. 507 \n     (2004). There are numerous other illustrations of his \n     commitment, including a multitude of criminal law cases where \n     the Justice has protected the rights of defendants. These \n     cases demonstrate that the Justice is not merely a great \n     intellect; he has the courage of his convictions.\n       Second, and more importantly, regardless of how Justice \n     Scalia himself has performed under the standards he has set \n     for himself, we must thank the Justice for articulating those \n     standards brilliantly, cogently, and colorfully for twenty \n     years. His opinions are not only educational, they are \n     engaging. They make us think about the role of the Court in \n     our democracy, the nature of rights, and the balance of power \n     in government. His opinions are also beautifully written; he \n     is a master artisan of the craft of judicial opinion writing. \n     Whether his opinions prompt howls of delight or screams of \n     disgust, they are full of life, just like the Justice \n     himself.\n       I hope we can look forward to at least twenty more years of \n     Justice Scalia's service. But even if he served not a day \n     more, his place in history is both assured and well-deserved.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Rachel E. Barkow,\n     Associate Professor of Law.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 Boston University\n\n\n                                                School of Law,\n\n                                   Boston, MA, September 25, 2006.\n     Senator Orrin Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: One of the greatest privileges of my \n     life was the opportunity to clerk for Justice Antonin Scalia, \n     who has now reached his twentieth year on the Supreme Court. \n     He taught me lessons about law, writing, and life that I will \n     always value. I am particularly fond of two of his favorite \n     sayings that he would trot out when pointing out to law \n     clerks some deep complexity that they had missed: ``Nothing \n     is easy'' and ``It's hard to get it right.'' Right answers, \n     in law and elsewhere, do not come from slogans, party \n     platforms, or warm feelings. They come from hard work, \n     intellectual rigor and honesty, and a willingness to check \n     premises and follow arguments where they lead. Justice \n     Scalia's example in this regard was, and still is, inspiring.\n       I also recall--more fondly with distance--Justice Scalia's \n     practice of checking every citation that his clerks put into \n     a draft. Justice Scalia's meticulous concern for accuracy is \n     truly remarkable, and the world would be a better place if \n     more people shared it.\n       It has been a pleasure and an honor for me to watch this \n     man and this mind in action. I am grateful for the \n     opportunity to recognize one of the finest people ever to sit \n     on the United States Supreme Court.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Gary Lawson,\n     Professor of Law.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               September 26, 2006.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: I write to join you in extending \n     congratulations to Justice Scalia on the occasion of his \n     twentieth anniversary on the Supreme Court of the United \n     States. I had the great privilege to clerk for Justice Scalia \n     during his third term on the Supreme Court, October Term \n     1988. As a teacher of various separation of powers courses, \n     first at Columbia and now at Harvard Law School, it has been \n     a happy part of my job to follow his career closely. Although \n     it is impossible to capture Justice Scalia's many \n     achievements in a brief tribute, it is worth noting just one \n     of the ways he has managed to change not only the law, but \n     also the way we think about the law.\n       I refer to the rules of the game by which judges read \n     legislation. When I graduated from law school one year before \n     President Reagan (with the Senate's advice and consent) \n     appointed Justice Scalia to the Court, the question of \n     legitimacy lay deep in the background of the way federal \n     judges approached Congress's handiwork. Although the dominant \n     way of thinking about the law was known as the Legal Process \n     school, little was said about the relationship between the \n     legislative process and its output. The central precept of \n     the time was that judges should be guided by notions of \n     ``reasonableness.'' If legislation was awkward in relation to \n     its apparent purpose, judges should make it more coherent and \n     smooth out its rough edges. Who could be against that? \n     Surely, no one could object to reasonableness in the \n     abstract.\n       The difficulty is this: Those in your line of work know all \n     too well that in the popularly elected bodies to which our \n     Constitution wisely assigns the task, lawmaking requires \n     compromise. Although sometimes the word ``compromise'' is \n     used pejoratively as the opposite of ``principle,'' the fact \n     is that compromise represents the way that a society as large \n     and diverse as ours works out the inevitable disagreements \n     that people of good faith have about the way we should solve \n     the most pressing problems that we face. Sometimes \n     compromises--good, socially valuable, even life-saving \n     compromises--are awkward, rough-hewn, and uneven. The Court's \n     former impulse to smooth out the rough edges of legislation--\n     to make it always ``reasonable,'' no matter what the text \n     required--ignored that reality.\n       No one drove this lesson home more forcefully than Justice \n     Scalia. Twenty years ago, he began to try to persuade his \n     colleagues on the bench and at the bar that the clear import \n     of the enacted text best captures the lines of compromise \n     that legislators work so hard to reach. In the old days, the \n     Court was prone to say that even the clearest text had to \n     yield to some often ill-defined ``spirit'' or ``purpose'' \n     that judges perceived to lie behind a statute. See Holy \n     Trinity Church v. United States, 143 U.S. 457, 459 (1892). \n     Today, the Court is much more likely to emphasize that \n     ``[t]he best evidence of [statutory] purpose is the statutory \n     text adopted by both Houses of Congress and submitted to the \n     President.'' West Virginia Univ. Hosps., Inc. v. Casey, 499 \n     U.S. 83, 98-99 (1991). Or it might explain that judges ``are \n     bound, not only by the ultimate purposes Congress has \n     selected, but by the means it has deemed appropriate, and \n     prescribed, for the pursuit of those purposes.'' MCI \n     Telecomms. Corp. v Am. Tel. & Tel. Co., 512 U.S. 218, 231 n.4 \n     (1994). In short, the Court now recognizes that the \n     compromises brokered in a complex, untidy, but ultimately \n     democratic process of passing legislation are not for federal \n     courts to second-guess.\n       That change in judicial practice, I submit, is a healthy \n     one. It is much more respectful of the kind of democracy our \n     Constitution adopts. It is much more respectful of the wise \n     process by which you and your colleagues make law--a process \n     whose rules of procedure and whose practices quite obviously \n     stress the importance of compromise. Greater judicial respect \n     for that legislative reality has grown during, and because \n     of, Justice Scalia's tenure on the Supreme Court. It is one \n     of the many things for which Justice Scalia--and the Senate, \n     which confirmed him without dissent--have reason to be proud.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to join you in celebrating \n     Justice Scalia's first twenty years on the Court.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                  John F.

Mr. President, today we are speaking about security. The \nmajor topic of discussion has been, are we safer today? Well, we are \nsafer because of the actions this administration and the Congress have \ntaken, backed up by our brave Americans in the military, intelligence, \nand law enforcement agencies.\n  But recently, there has been another politically motivated selected \nleak of classified information. Regrettably, I am talking about the \nNational Intelligence Estimate, a fraction of which was reported on in \nthe New York Times and, I believe, misinterpreted.\n  Beside the fact that leaks of this nature, 6 weeks before elections, \nare clearly politically inspired, these leaks are also illegal and they \nmake the job of our intelligence agency operatives even more difficult. \nFor example, how can intelligence operatives report on the strengths \nand weaknesses of our allies when those conclusions will be spread on \nthe record? Our policymakers need to know, but what good is it to tell \nthe world what we think about the people we depend upon?\n  With that said, I have read the NIE in question. It is not what the \npaper\n\n[[Page S10126]]\n\nand some on the other side and the media say it is. Some of our \nDemocratic colleagues would like Americans to believe that the document \nconfirms what the Democrats believe--that the war in Iraq is simply a \ndistraction from and has nothing to do with the war on terror, and that \nis the reason for the growth of radical Islam. This is simply a pitiful \nelection year misinterpretation of a serious document.\n  It is clear that critics want Americans to have only a portion of the \ntruth. That is unfortunate, but that is what happens when some people \nsimply see intelligence matters as another tool to aid them in the fall \nelections.\n  As I said, I have seen the NIE, which is a lengthy 35-page document. \nIt remains classified, so we cannot discuss its contents, although the \nPresident announced that some of it will soon be declassified.\n  Although it is a shame that dishonorable leakers have put us in this \nposition, I believe declassifying the relevant portions of the document \nso that the American people will have a more balanced perspective on \nwhat the document truly says is necessary.\n  The fact is the war on Iraq is a central front in the struggle \nagainst radical Islamists. Our successes in Afghanistan and Iraq have \nmade us much safer in our homeland. There have been no attacks since 9/\n11. We have destroyed their safe havens, interrogated detainees, \ntracked terrorist financing, and listened in on al-Qaida calls in the \nU.S., followed up by agency, law enforcement, and military personnel.\n  Iraq is not a distraction from the war on terror; it is now central \nto the war on terror. You don't have to take my word for it; that is \nthe word of Osama bin Laden's primary deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri. He \nwrote this to the late head of al-Qaida in Iraq, Zarqawi. We \nintercepted that in a raid months ago. So their deputies echoed the \nsentiments.\n  They believe the war in Iraq is their best chance in the war on \nterror, and I believe that once you see more of the NIE, you will see \nit conveys that message with a warning that if we lose in Iraq, terror \nthreats from radical Islamists will dramatically increase.\n  There is no greater motivation than success. If the radicals are able \nto claim success in Iraq, I believe we will see a geometric increase in \nradical recruitment as we have never seen before.\n  At first, Democrats argued that Iraq had nothing to do with the \nglobal war on terror. Now they are grasping at a selectively leaked \nportion of an NIE, claiming that Iraq is central to terrorism because \nof our efforts there. You cannot have it both ways. Does Iraq or does \nit not have something to do with the war on terror? It is clear it \ndoes.\n  Iraq supported terrorists before the war, and terrorists are there \nnow. Iraq was a state sponsor of terrorism and paid the families of \nsuicide bombers. Was Iraq the primary backer of al-Qaida? No, but \nSaddam Hussein supported terrorism, and that is what this is about--all \ngroups who use terror to attack America. And they must be dislodged.\n  In April, about the same time the NIE was produced, current CIA \nDirector Michael Hayden, then the Deputy Director of National \nIntelligence, best summarized why Iraq is crucial to winning the global \nwar on terror. In his speech in Texas, he addressed the subject we \nfocus on today. He said that while the war in Iraq may inspire or \nmotivate terrorists now, the failure of the terrorists in Iraq would \nweaken the movement elsewhere.\n  He continued saying that, should jihadists leaving Iraq perceive \nthemselves, and be perceived, to have failed, fewer fighters would step \nforward to carry the fight.\n  He went on to explain the terrorists' greatest vulnerability--the \nfact that the terrorists' ultimate goal of establishing an \nultraconservative religious state spanning the Muslim world is \nunpopular with a vast majority of Muslims.\n  General Hayden stated that the emergence of a Muslim mainstream, such \nas the one we are building in Iraq, could emerge as the ``most powerful \nweapon in the war on terror.''\n  Whatever one believes about how we got where we are now, one thing is \nclear: The war in Iraq and the global war on terror are part and parcel \nof the same thing.\n  Some on the other side of the aisle, and some in the media, may try \nto use selected leaks and political spin and half truths to cynically \nwin votes in the election, but their efforts grossly distort reality.\n  If we win in Iraq, moderate Islam wins and bin Laden and other \nextremists will have been handed a sound defeat that will have profound \nrepercussions.\n  The terrorists realize this. That is why they are there, and that is \nwhy we are fighting them on their turf before they have the opportunity \nto regroup and assault us on our turf.\n  There is no way the United States can afford to let the terrorists \nhave their way in Iraq. That means we cannot cut and run, or establish \na politically driven withdrawal date, before Iraq's security forces can \ncontrol the country. Were we to do that and were the place to fall into \nchaos, not only would sectarian strife arise, but it would become a \ntraining ground and feeding ground for terrorists once again, and they \nwould be emboldened, as they were after we pulled out of Somalia. That \nsign of weakness would be a sign for terrorists to get mobilized and \nget working on it.\n  Success in Iraq is essential. Sure, people are motivated on both \nsides by the war, but the only answer to that is to win, make sure that \nwe prevail and protect freedom, democracy, and integrity throughout the \nworld.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 minutes, \nto be equally divided into 10-minute parcels, to the Senator from New \nMexico, the junior Senator from New Mexico, and the Senator from \nTennessee, Senator Alexander, and that we speak in that order for 10 \nminutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/26/senate-section/article/S10126-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10126-S10134]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS INVESTMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, while we in the Senate have been busy \ndoing many things and our minds have been all over the world, \nliterally, with the war in Iraq and all kinds of things that have come \nbefore us and to us for consideration, we have been confronted with a \nvery exciting opportunity for America and America's future.\n  We have been listening to and acting on a rather remarkable effort \ninvolving three Senate committees, with valuable contributions from a \nnumber of other committees and a number of Senators from many \ncommittees. All of these Senators and all of these committees have \nworked to write this legislation and are deeply concerned about \nmaintaining our Nation's ability to compete in the high-tech global \nmarketplace.\n  Today I join a bipartisan group of Senators in speaking about \nlegislation that will be introduced later tonight by the distinguished \nmajority leader and the minority leader. They will introduce the \nlegislation later this evening. Its name will be the National \nCompetitiveness Investment Act, and its number is S. 3936.\n  All of us worked on this legislation because we are deeply concerned \nabout America maintaining its ability to compete in the high-tech \nglobal marketplace.\n  One year ago, the National Academy of Sciences released a report that \nhighlighted the urgency of the challenge. It was called ``Rising Above \nthe Gathering Storm'' report, which was written by a distinguished \ncommittee chaired by Norm Augustine, former chairman of Lockheed \nMartin. His committee included three Nobel laureates, presidents of \nleading universities, and chief executive officers of multinational \ncorporations.\n  The charge to Mr. Augustine and his committee was to develop a \nspecific list of policy recommendations to bolster U.S. \ncompetitiveness. After an intensive 10 weeks of effort, the committee \nproduced and recommended an impressive report with a list of 20 \nrecommendations.\n  The recommendations all address a central problem; that is, we are \nnot doing enough to harness and develop our national brainpower. The \nreport recommends significant increases in\n\n[[Page S10127]]\n\nour investments in science and mathematics education at all levels--\nkindergarten through high school, college and graduate school.\n  The bill that will be introduced later tonight, as I have indicated, \ncontains provisions to address nearly every one of the recommendations \nof the Augustine report. Many of these provisions were included in the \nProtecting America's Competitiveness Edge, or PACE, legislation, which \nI introduced in January along with Senators Bingaman, Alexander, \nMikulski, and an additional 61 cosponsors.\n  Through this new legislation, we are going to put the Augustine \nreport's recommendations into action. We will authorize a doubling of \nresearch dollars to each research agency, including the Department of \nEnergy, Office of Science, National Science Foundation, and the \nNational Institute of Standards and Technology.\n  As chairman of the Energy and Water Appropriations Committee, I was \npleased I was able to slightly exceed the President's request for a 14-\npercent increase in the Office of Science in fiscal year 2007, putting \nit on a track to double in a decade, which is the goal and objective of \nthe Norm Augustine report. The NCIA, which it will be called, also \nincludes provisions that will build on the educational program \nsponsored by the Department of Energy, by engaging the facilities and \nscientific workforce of the national laboratories, and these \neducational programs will help ensure that we are preparing today's \nyoung people for the demands of tomorrow's high-tech workplace. The \nNCIA is a good partner to the President's initiative. I applaud the \nPresident for his bold vision which he expressed to us in his State of \nthe Union Address, and which we have built upon in the legislation we \nare talking about today.\n  I applaud the President for his bold vision and leadership in the \nissue of U.S. competitiveness, which is so serious and about which many \nof us worry, because we know that without our remaining competitive, \nAmerica has no chance in a world which is built on competitiveness. We \nneed to take action to support our standard of living and to ensure \nthat we continue to grow and prosper. If we do not, we can expect other \nnations to rival our global competitiveness and one day to surpass us \nwithout a doubt.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a chart I have \nprepared which examines and compares side by side the National \nCompetitiveness Investment Act to the Augustine National Academies \nreport and the administration's American Competitive Initiative to show \nhow this bill compares with each of those.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   BIPARTISAN SENATE, NATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS INVESTMENT ACT, COMPARISON TO THE AUGUSTINE NATIONAL ACADEMIES\n                 REPORT AND ADMINISTRATION'S AMERICAN COMPETITIVENESS INITIATIVE, SEPTEMBER 2006\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                        National\n               Category                    Rising above the         Competitiveness         Administration ACI\n                                           gathering storm           Investment Act\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIncrease talent pool by improving K-   Recruit 10,000 science   .......................\n 12 science/math Education.             & math teachers w/4     Robert Noyce\n                                        year scholarships.

Mr. President, I think it is good to summarize by \nsaying that S. 3936 contains all but one of the provisions that are \ncontained in the 20 suggestions made to us by the Augustine report, \nwhich has been heralded by so many to be such a vital piece of \nlegislation which we ought to adopt and implement so as to keep our \ncountry free and competitive in a very changing world.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor to Senator Bingaman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Domenici, \nfor his comments, and I join him and Senator Alexander and many other \ncolleagues who have cosponsored this legislation and congratulate our \nmajority leader, Senator Frist, and our minority leader, Senator Reid, \nfor their leadership in getting this issue introduced into the Senate. \nI hope very much this bipartisan effort can succeed and that before the \nend of the 109th Congress, we can see this legislation on the \nPresident's desk for signature.\n  This bill is the result, as Senator Domenici said, of a close, \ncooperative effort by three of our Senate committees: the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee, which Senator Domenici chairs and of which \nI am the ranking member, and Senator Alexander is on that committee as \nwell; the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee; and the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. I commend the staffs \nof those committees\n\n[[Page S10128]]\n\nfor their hard work in producing this legislation, as well as the \npersonal staffs of all Senators involved.\n  As Senator Domenici pointed out, this is a major piece of legislation \nwhich arises out of the good work that was done by the National \nAcademies. This report which was done there made a series of \nrecommendations which are clearly specific which will intend to put the \ncountry on a track to reverse some of the unfortunate trends we have \nseen in connection with our ability to compete with other countries in \nthe world.\n  Senator Domenici, Senator Alexander, Senator Mikulski, and I \nintroduced three bills in January of this year in order to put into \nlegislative form the recommendations of the National Academies report. \nEach of these bills went to a different committee.\n  Since all three of us on the Senate floor today are members of the \nEnergy Committee and since Senator Domenici chairs that committee, we \nwere able to move more quickly in the Senate Energy and Natural \nResources Committee with the legislation that was assigned to that \ncommittee, S. 2197, which authorizes a number of programs to strengthen \nthe Department of Energy's role in promoting stronger math and science \neducation from kindergarten through graduate school. It creates a \nDirector for Math and Science Education in the Department of Energy. \nThe bill strengthens the role of our national laboratories in this K-12 \nmath and science education. It authorizes a program whereby national \nlaboratories adopt a nearby school to increase its math and science \nproficiency.\n  The bill goes on and on with other initiatives which are taken \ndirectly from the recommendations of the Augustine commission that was \nreferred to earlier. These provisions that are in S. 2197 have remained \nlargely intact in the legislation that is being introduced today. In \nsome cases, we had to reduce the authorization levels so that the \nincreases to particular programs were ramped up over a period of time \ninstead of suddenly doubling existing programs as had been recommended.\n  In the education area, the National Academies report assigned highest \npriorities to this need to strengthen K-12 math and science education, \nand this legislation does so in a variety of ways. Senator Domenici \nelaborated on some of those. I will not go into great detail about \nthem, but they are directly taken from the National Academies report.\n  We are all aware here in the Senate that we operate on two different \ntracks: we operate on the track of authorizing legislation and the \ntrack of appropriating legislation. The legislation we are talking \nabout today and introducing today is authorizing legislation, so it is \nonly one of the steps needed in order to get action accomplished here \nin the Congress. But it is an important step, and it is particularly \nimportant when you are setting a long-term goal.\n  That is what this legislation attempts to do: It tries to look long \nterm. It tries to say that we need to ramp up our investment in these \ncritical areas of concern so that 5 years from now, 10 years from now, \nwe will see a change in these trend lines which have so concerned the \nNational Academy of Sciences as well as many of us here in the \nCongress.\n  This bill authorizes $73 billion to be spent over 5 years to maintain \nour Nation's competitive edge. Of that, about $20 billion is considered \nnew funding; that is, it is funding above the 2006 level at which we \nare today. These are only authorizations. It is not an appropriation. \nIt is going to be our job, and it is not an easy job, but it is going \nto be the job of the Congress not only to appropriate these new moneys \nwe are here authorizing but also to make sure those moneys are not \nappropriated at the expense of other important programs in the \nDepartment of Education or in the National Science Foundation or in the \nDepartment of Energy. I think we are all aware that this has to be new \nmoney in a genuine sense of that term.\n\n  Again, I thank my colleagues for joining in this bipartisan effort. I \nbelieve this is a very good piece of legislation. It is an important \npiece of legislation. Often we allow the urgent to crowd out adequate \nconsideration for the important items that ought to be on our agenda. \nThis is an exception to that. This is a case where we are giving \nattention to the important issues.\n  Let me particularly single out for praise Senator Alexander. He has, \nat every step in this process, been pushing to get this initiative one \nstep closer to the goal line. I compliment him for doing that. I \ncompliment him for the introduction of this legislation today, and I \ncompliment all my other colleagues who have been so cooperative in \nseeing that happen as well.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico and \nthe senior Senator from New Mexico for their leadership and their \ncomments. This is important legislation.\n  It is worth pausing today to notice that this is legislation which \nwill be introduced tonight by the majority leader of the Senate, \nSenator Frist, and by the Democratic leader of the Senate, Senator \nReid. There are not very many things this year in this Congress that \nhave been introduced by our distinguished two leaders. They do that for \na reason. They usually don't even cosponsor legislation. But they have \ndecided that in this case, this issue is so important that they wanted \nto send a signal to our country, to the rest of us in the Senate, to \nthe Members of the House of Representatives, to all of us.\n  The Presiding Officer and I deeply believe it is urgently important \nfor our country to do what it takes to keep our edge in science and \ntechnology so we can keep our share of good-paying jobs in the United \nStates of America and not see them go overseas to China and India and \nother places. This is the way to do that, and this is an important \nbeginning. It would not have happened but for Senator Domenici and \nSenator Bingaman and a variety of other Senators--so many, it is hard \nto mention them all. In fact, the reason I think the bill is having \nsuch success as it moves through the Senate is that it has so many \nfathers and mothers, it is not possible to tell who they are because \nthis is a subject matter which many Senators have been working on for a \nlong time.\n  This bill is about growing our economy, creating as many good new \njobs as we can, so that in 20 years we don't wake up and wonder how \ncountries such as China and India passed us by. This is a pro-growth \ninvestment. This $20 billion of new spending over 5 years is as much a \npro-growth investment as a tax cut is.\n  In my experience as a Governor of a State, we had low taxes, and that \nhelped to create new jobs. But we also needed to make investments in \ncenters of excellence and good teaching and distinguished scientists \nbecause we knew what most of the world now is learning: most of our \ngood new jobs come from brainpower, from our advantage in science and \ntechnology. We are in a constant state of losing jobs every day as most \nhealthy economies are. So the key to our success is how many good new \njobs we can create, and the key to that is our brainpower advantage.\n  We are not the only ones in the world who understand this. We have a \nDemocratic leader who understands it. We have a Republican leader who \nunderstands it. We have a President of the United States, President \nBush, who understands it and who made it a central part of his State of \nthe Union Address. But let me mention just one other President who \nunderstands it.\n  Just about a month ago, a group of Senators, led by Senator Stevens \nand Senator Inouye, traveled to China. We met with the President of \nChina, President Hu Jintao. We also met with the Chairman of the \nNational People's Congress, the No. 2 person in China, Mr. Wu. Just 2 \nmonths earlier, in July, President Hu went to the Chinese Academy of \nSciences and the Chinese Academy of Engineering to outline a new 15-\nyear plan to make China the technology leader in the world. In his \nspeech, the President of China said China must:\n\n       Promote a huge leap forward of science and technology; we \n     shall put strengthening independent innovation capability at \n     the core of economic structure adjustment.\n\n  His plan included reforming China's universities and massively \ninvesting in new research.\n  The President of China concluded his speech this way:\n\n       We all bear the time-honored mission to provide strong \n     scientific support for the construction of a well-off society \n     by improving\n\n[[Page S10129]]\n\n     our independent innovation capability and building an \n     innovative country. I hope that our scientists and \n     technicians will strive hard to make brilliant achievements \n     and constantly contribute to our country and the people.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the complete remarks of \nPresident Hu to the Chinese Academies of Science and Engineering in \nJuly be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. We met with President Hu for about an hour, those of \nus from the Senate. We talked about a variety of issues with him: North \nKorea, Iran, Iraq. He was more animated about this subject than any \nother subject, which is why I suppose we had 70 Senators--35 Democrats, \n35 Republicans--who cosponsored the Domenici-Bingaman bill that was the \nAugustine report. We all understand it is very important.\n\n  We have seen what is happening in India. India is another great \ncountry with a distinguished group of scientists, and they now \nrecognize if they want a bigger share of the world's economic pie, the \nway to do that is through science and innovation.\n  The challenge America faces today is really a challenge about brain \npower and jobs. I appreciate the way the Augustine report especially \nput this into perspective. It didn't say the United States of America \nis about to fall off a cliff or that China and India are going to catch \nus tomorrow. It said we face a gathering storm.\n  We need to realize how fortunate we are in the United States of \nAmerica when it comes to our standard of living. We constitute between \n4 percent and 5 percent of the world's population. Last year we had 28 \npercent of the world's wealth. The International Monetary Fund says the \ngross domestic product of the United States last year was 28 percent of \nthe global total for just 4 to 5 percent of the people.\n  The average Chinese person probably has a share of the gross domestic \nproduct that is one-twentieth of the average American. By some \nestimates, China may be moving fast enough to have a gross domestic \nproduct as big as that of the United States by the year 2040. But even \nthen, the average American's share of that amount of wealth will be \nfour to five times as much as that of the average Chinese person. So we \nare not about to fall off the cliff.\n  But at the same time, we know if we want to keep our high standard of \nliving for all Americans, we have to constantly create a large number \nof good new jobs. And the way we do that is brain power. Our good \nfortune comes from that advantage in brain power. We have the finest \nsystem of colleges and universities. We attract 500,000 of the \nbrightest foreign students. They come here because these are the best \ninstitutions. Many stay here, creating good new jobs for us. Many go \nhome. Many are going back to China and India to help their countries \nsucceed. No country has national research laboratories to match ours. \nAmericans have won the most Nobel Prizes in science. We have registered \nthe most patents. That innovation has been responsible for at least \nhalf of our good new jobs.\n  That is why we introduced this bill today. That is why we went, \ntogether, the Democratic side, the Republican side, to the National \nAcademy of Sciences and said: We see this coming. Tell us what we \nshould do. Tell us specifically what we should do, 1 through 10 in \npriority order. If you tell us, if you are specific about it, I bet we \nwill do it.\n  Some who watch Congress might think that is a little bit naive \nbecause we disagree about a lot and there are a lot of politics here. \nBut the National Academies came back with 20 recommendations. The \nCouncil on Competitiveness already had a very good report. The \nPresident made his own proposal, which was very substantial. Lo and \nbehold, we have worked together for 18 months and came up with an even \nbetter piece of legislation than any of us introduced to begin with. \nAnd we have virtually a unanimous agreement about it, among three of \nthe largest and most important committees here, and the majority leader \nand the Democratic leader are sponsoring the bill themselves.\n  We should pass this legislation this year. We should not go home \nwithout doing it. We can't do it this week. But by introducing the \nlegislation today, Senator Frist and Senator Reid give our country a \nchance, while we all are at home in the next 4 weeks, to tell us what \nthey think about it.\n  There are a lot of people running for the Senate. I hope in every \nsingle Senate race this year someone asks the question, Are you in \nfavor of the Frist-Reid competitiveness legislation, and do you believe \nit ought to pass the Senate before the end of the year? I hope that \nquestion is asked. I believe the answer will be yes.\n  Our friends in the House of Representatives have been working hard on \nthis issue, too. Again, it is not just a Republican initiative, not \njust a Democratic initiative, they have plenty of bipartisan effort \nthere, too. It would be my hope that we can take what they have done \nand what we have done and do it before the end of the year. This is \njust the beginning of what we are able to do.\n  Senator Domenici and Senator Bingaman did a good job of suggesting \nwhat the bill includes, so I will not belabor that. But I would simply \nlike to conclude my remarks to try to bring these lofty words down to \nEarth a little bit in terms of how this legislation might actually \naffect one State.\n  For example, if this legislation is enacted, many bright Tennesseans \ncould receive 4-year scholarships to earn bachelor's degrees in \nscience, technology, engineering, or math while concurrently earning \nteacher certification. The new teachers would be expected to teach in \npoorer schools for at least the first few years after graduation. That \nwould be available in every State.\n  There could be summer academies for math and science teachers in \nTennessee. In our case, it could be at the Oak Ridge National \nLaboratory, providing opportunities for those teachers to work with \ndistinguished scientists and go back to the classrooms and inspire \ntheir students.\n  There would be more advanced placement training for 400 Tennessee \nmath and science teachers so more students could learn math and \nscience, we could have more home-grown scientists. There would be \nsupport for a proposed math and science specialty high school. Our \nGovernor has recommended that. North Carolina has had one for 20 years. \nWe never felt we could afford it in Tennessee, but this would give some \nhelp to our State in terms of having a specialty high school in math \nand science.\n  There would be high-tech internships for middle and high school \nstudents across our State, and there would be growing support \nTennessee-based researchers that would lead to new high-tech jobs. This \nis in addition to the increases in funding for the physical sciences \nauthorized in this legislation, which would especially affect our \nresearch universities and our National Laboratories.\n  So I am delighted to have had the opportunity to be a part of this. I \nlook forward to advancing it. I certainly intend, as I go across \nTennessee, to let our citizens know what the Frist-Reid competitiveness \nlegislation offers our country. I intend to let them know that this is \nthe way we keep our high standard of living and that we should be \nexpected to act on it before the end of the year.\n  I congratulate all those Senators who have worked on it, and I invite \nevery single Member of this body to be a cosponsor\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n  Address by Hu Jintao at 13th Academician Conference of the Chinese \nAcademy of Sciences (CAS) and 8th Academician Conference of the Chinese \n          Academy of Engineering (CAE), Beijing, June 5, 2006\n\n       Dear academicians and comrades, Today witnesses the opening \n     of 13th CAS academician conference and 8th CAE academician \n     conference. First of all, on behalf of the CPC Central \n     Committee and the State Council, I would like to extend my \n     warm congratulations to the conferences, and my sincere \n     greetings to the academicians of CAS and CAE and all \n     scientists and technicians in China!\n       The conferences of CAS and CAE are held in this crucial \n     moment of turning on the 11th Five-Year Plan. The success of \n     the conferences will have great significance in giving play \n     to the leading role of academicians of CAS and CAE in China's \n     scientific and technological development, and encouraging \n     scientists and technicians to build China\n\n[[Page S10130]]\n\n     into an innovative, well-off society in an all-around way.\n       Today I would like to talk about three issues.\n\n\n     i. Current Situation and Science and Technology Tasks of China\n\n       China has maintained a sound momentum of economic growth in \n     the 28 years since reform and opening up. The process of \n     industrialization, urbanization, marketization and \n     globalization has been accelerated, social productivity, \n     technological strength and overall national strength have \n     been significantly enhanced, and people's living standard has \n     been improved. Socialist political and spiritual civilization \n     construction has been fully strengthened, China's standing \n     has been elevated and its international influence has \n     expanded. We have successfully completed the 10th Five-Year \n     Plan, and are striving for goals of the 11th Five-Year Plan \n     on a new starting point. At the beginning of this year, the \n     State Council issued China National Mid- and Long-Term \n     Science and Technology Development Plan. Meanwhile, CPC \n     Central Committee and the State Council decided to implement \n     the Plan and enhance independent innovation capability, while \n     holding a National Conference for Science and Technology, \n     calling for building our country into an innovative country \n     within 15 years. The scientists and technicians around the \n     country are striving vigorously for the strategic task.\n       The more achievements we have made and the more promising \n     outlook we are facing, the calmer shall we remain. While \n     affirming the achievements, we shall analyze correctly the \n     opportunities and challenges we are facing.\n       Seen from an international perspective, peace, development \n     and cooperation is the irresistible trend of the times, world \n     multipolarization and economic globalization are progressing, \n     science and technology are advancing rapidly, \n     international industry and technology transfer is \n     accelerating, and there is a growing tendency of foreign \n     countries to cooperate with China. Meanwhile, \n     international situation is experiencing profound and \n     complicated changes, instabilities and uncertainties that \n     affect peace and development are increasing, international \n     competition is being intensified, and our country is still \n     pressed by economic and technological advantages of \n     developed countries.\n       As for domestic development, our economic strength has been \n     notably strengthened, and socialist market economic system is \n     improving. Abundant labor resources, huge market and stable \n     social politics lay solid foundation for the economic \n     development of our country and promise us a bright future. \n     However, China, the large developing country with over 1.3 \n     billion people, is now in the primary stage of socialism and \n     will remain so for a long time to come. For the time being, \n     we are challenged by such acute problems: low productivity, \n     unbalanced development, low living standard, weak \n     agricultural foundation, extensive economic growth mode, \n     growing limitation by energy resources, worsening \n     environmental pollution and ecology contamination. We shall \n     make long-term efforts to tackle such problems and achieve \n     the goal of modernization.\n       Now turn our eyes to the world's scientific and \n     technological development. Science and technology, especially \n     strategic hi-tech has become an increasingly decisive factor \n     of economic and social development, as well as the focus of \n     overall national strength competition. Science and technology \n     are advancing rapidly, creating many new cross-subject fields \n     through overlapping and penetration between subjects, between \n     science and technology, and between science and humanities. \n     Scientific discoveries are providing more favorable \n     conditions for technical innovation and productivity \n     development, leading to shortened S result \n     industrialization cycle, faster technological updating, and \n     rapid development of hi-tech and industries represented by \n     information technology and biotechnology. New scientific \n     breakthroughs and economic growth points have been created to \n     mark scientific innovation and advanced productivity, while \n     driving economic and social development. A nation's core \n     competition increasingly reflected in cultivation, \n     configuration and controlling capability of intelligence \n     resource and scientific results, as well as ownership and \n     utilization of intellectual property. In the surging waves of \n     world scientific development, it is clear that whoever \n     masters the new features and trends, grasps opportunities and \n     constantly improves scientific strength especially \n     independent innovation capability will hold priority in \n     overall national strength competition. Now, major countries \n     are accelerating their steps of scientific R Rapid \n     scientific progress and its impelling influence have posed \n     inevitable challenges before us. The only way out for us is \n     to catch up with the developed countries with persistent \n     spirit and independent innovation capability, enhancing our \n     core competitiveness and boosting our productivity in order \n     to win in the fierce international competition.\n       Through long-term efforts, we have made brilliant \n     achievements in science and technology, formed a complete \n     subject layout, and fostered a team of scientific scholars \n     who are in scientific innovation. Our R ability in some \n     crucial fields has ranked top in the world. However, compared \n     with the world's advanced level, we still have a long way to \n     go. There are problems that hamper economic and social \n     development, including weak independent innovation \n     capability, few invention patents, high dependence on key \n     technologies abroad, low proportion of hi-tech industry, \n     enterprises not truly becoming the mainbody of \n     technological innovation, scientific results not \n     industrialized yet, and lack of excellent talents etc. We \n     have to make great efforts to tackle them.\n       In a word, seen from any angle, we are facing both \n     opportunities and challenges. Under the circumstance of \n     intensified international competition and complicated tasks \n     on domestic reform, development and stability, we must be \n     prepared for any eventualities, facing, meeting and defeating \n     challenges while recognizing, seizing and taking \n     opportunities. Furthermore, we should put more attention to \n     varied challenges that may affect current or long-term \n     development of our country, focus on vital contradictions and \n     problems, and promote the better, swifter economic and social \n     development based on technological development.\n       To build an innovative country is a strategic decision made \n     by CPC Central Committee and the State Council based on the \n     consideration of building a well-off society in an all-round \n     way and creating a new situation in building socialism with \n     Chinese characteristics. To realize this objective, we shall \n     raise strengthening independent innovation capability to a \n     strategic position, create a new way for independent \n     innovation with Chinese characteristics, and promote a huge \n     leap forward of science and technology; we shall put \n     strengthening independent innovation capability at the core \n     of economic structure adjustment and economic growth mode \n     transformation, build a resource-efficient, environment-\n     friendly society, and push forward swifter and better \n     development of national economy; we shall take strengthening \n     independent innovation capability to be our national strategy \n     and implement the strategy throughout modernization \n     construction; we shall inspire the nation's innovative \n     spirit, cultivate high-level innovative talents, form a \n     system or mechanism favorable for independent innovation, \n     promote innovations in theory, system and technology, and \n     continuously consolidate and develop socialism with Chinese \n     characteristics. With strong sense of historical \n     responsibility and worldwide vision, and under the guideline \n     of ``independent innovation, key breakthrough, sustainable \n     development and leading the future'', we shall persistently \n     take science and technology as primary productive force, \n     implement strategies of Invigorating China through Science \n     and Education and Reinvigorating China through Human Resource \n     Development, stick to the principle of ``rely economic \n     construction & social development on science & technology, \n     and science & technology progress serves economic \n     construction & social development''; develop major policies \n     and relevant measures for scientific development, push \n     forward national innovation system construction, strengthen \n     studies on basic science, hi-tech field and sustainable \n     development, quicken the transformation of knowledge and \n     technology to actual productivity in order to provide strong \n     technological support to economic and social development, and \n     make science and technology modernization the true drive \n     forces for rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.\n\n\n     ii. Build a Large-scaled Team of Innovative Technical Talents\n\n       Talents, especially innovative technical talents, play a \n     key role in building an innovative country. It is impossible \n     to realize this goal without the support of a powerful team \n     of innovative technical talents. The worldwide competition of \n     overall national strength is actually a competition for \n     talents especially for innovative talents. Only those who \n     cultivate, attract, and make good use of the talents \n     especially innovative talents can hold priority in the \n     fierce international competition, and realize the \n     development goals as well. Here, I would like to talk \n     about how to intensify the cultivation of innovative \n     talents.\n       The whole technical innovation history has proved that \n     innovative technical talents are creators of new knowledge, \n     inventors of new subjects, leaders of technical breakthroughs \n     and development approaches, and strategic treasures for a \n     nation's development. Cultivation of innovative technical \n     talents with no hesitation is essential for improving \n     independent innovation capability and building an innovative \n     nation, and is also indispensable for realizing the state's \n     development goals and rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. We \n     should persist in the strategy that considers talents to be \n     primary resources, take cultivation of innovative technical \n     talents as a strategic measure to build an innovative nation, \n     and quicken our steps of building a large-scaled team of \n     innovative technical talents.\n       To cultivate innovative technical talents, we should \n     thoroughly carry out the strategy of paying respect to labor, \n     knowledge, talent and creation, follow the requirements of \n     building an innovative nation and the rules of talent \n     development. We should attract the talents with business, \n     shape the talents with practices, spirit up the talents with \n     our system and protect the talents with our laws so as to \n     enlarge the team of the technical talents.\n       The cultivation of innovative technical talents is complex \n     program that requires joint efforts from all party \n     committees, governments, relevant departments, universities, \n     scientific institutions and the whole society. We should \n     highlight the following aspects in our work:\n\n[[Page S10131]]\n\n       First, improve the cultivation system. The cultivation of \n     innovative technical talents is a long comprehensive process, \n     and we must begin from education. We should further enhance \n     education reform and the education for all-round development \n     according to China's economic and social development \n     especially technological development, in order to establish \n     an education system favoring for innovative technical \n     talents. We should take systematic control of primary \n     schools, middle schools, universities and employment in order \n     to establish an effective mechanism to cultivate innovative \n     technical talents. In addition, we should change the \n     traditional indoctrinatory way of education into a new \n     innovative manner, paying more attention to students' \n     initiative and creative thinking mode while respecting the \n     guiding role of teachers. We should reduce the homework \n     burden of primary and middle school students, inspire their \n     curiosity and exploration enthusiasm so that they will make \n     all-round development based on their interest and potential. \n     We should reform the course arrangement of colleges and \n     universities, update teaching materials, and pay more \n     attention to the combination of theory and practice, in order \n     to cultivate the students' innovation spirit and capability. \n     We should lay great emphasis on the cultivation of technical \n     development and practice capability, and improve the ability \n     to turn scientific achievements into project application. \n     Moreover, we should provide continuing education for on-the-\n     job technicians at different layers through multiple \n     channels, and accelerate the establishment of an open, \n     independent networking life-long education system, so that \n     the technicians will learn new knowledge and skills \n     continuously to improve their capabilities of \n     technological innovation.\n       Second, use talents without prejudice. We should establish \n     and complete a targeted management system and method to \n     distinguish and cultivate talents on an equal competition \n     basis. Instead of paying sole attention to one's educational \n     background, qualification or status, we should provide more \n     opportunities for excellent talents, especially young \n     innovative technical talents. We should carry out the state's \n     and industry's plan for technical talent cultivation, \n     actively push the building of the innovation team, and create \n     a good environment for cultivation and development of \n     innovative technical talents under the support of the state's \n     talent cultivation programs, important researches and \n     projects, major industry projects, key subjects and research \n     bases and international academic exchange projects. We should \n     carry forward the innovation culture, build harmonic \n     interrelationship, keep a free working environment, create a \n     solidaric organization system, understand the personalities \n     of the innovative talents, allow them to express their new \n     academic thoughts and ideas, encourage and cultivate their \n     innovation spirit, inspire their enthusiasm in innovation, \n     and ensure that they make innovations dedicatedly. The \n     technological innovation is risky and unpredictable, which \n     requires tolerance of failure during innovation. Therefore, \n     we should take good care of the talents facing frustrations, \n     and support their future work based on past experiences. In \n     addition, the leaders and managers of the technical team \n     should improve their leading and management capability, make \n     every effort to be the talent scout, and make good use of the \n     talents.\n       Third, improve the system and policy support. We should \n     continue deepening the science & technology system reform to \n     give full play to the leading role of the government and the \n     fundamental role of market in the distribution of \n     technological resources. A comprehensive system pertaining to \n     talent training, utilization, appraisal, assignment and flow \n     should be established. By changing attitudes, practices and \n     systems that block the growth and accomplishment of talent, \n     we should guarantee the successful implementation of systems \n     and policies that encourage technological innovation in \n     scientific research institutions. Considering one's moral \n     character, performance, knowledge and capability, a \n     comprehensive appraisal system should be established to \n     realize management by objectives (MBO) for the innovative \n     talent's contributions and further curb the usual practice of \n     ignoring capability and performance while focusing on \n     educational background and seniority during appraisal. \n     Improve the mechanism of encouraging enterprises to increase \n     scientific investment in order to give play to their leading \n     role in technological innovation and diversify the pattern of \n     scientific investment. Establish an enterprise-centered, \n     market-oriented scientific innovation system that combines \n     production, education and research; encourage innovative \n     talents to gather in enterprises. Improve the intellectual \n     property system to inspire people's zest for innovation, \n     safeguard their rights and interests, and provide legal \n     protection for technological innovation and utilization of \n     innovative achievements. The title evaluation should be \n     restructured to encourage all kinds of talents to engage in \n     knowledge-based and technological innovation. More attention \n     should be put on key industries and human resource-intensive \n     organizations, technology extension in remote and poor \n     areas, industrial and agricultural production bases, \n     various enterprises and institutions that have brought \n     significant social and economical benefits, as well as \n     young and middle-aged technicians. Income distribution and \n     incentive systems that encourage innovation should be \n     established; priority shall be given to key positions and \n     distinguished talents, and talents with remarkable \n     contributions will get rewards. In this way, we can form a \n     mechanism in which posts are obtained by competition, \n     salaries depend on contributions, and eminent talents have \n     enviable income. The talent flow system and talent \n     information management system should be improved to wipe \n     out institutional obstacles in talent flow, promote the \n     orderly and rational flow of talents, let rare talents and \n     professionals demonstrate their full capabilities, and \n     ensure the reserve of talents for the state's major \n     scientific and technological projects.\n       Fourth, adopt open cultivation. No innovative technical \n     talent, especially the pioneers, can be cultivated without \n     going deep into the reality. Under the critical situation \n     that international scientific and technological level \n     surpasses ours, it's hard to cultivate a group of innovative \n     talents in a short time without adopting an open manner. \n     Improving independent innovation capability based on \n     introduction and assimilation is an effective way to catch up \n     with international advanced level, while open cultivation is \n     the right method of bringing up internationally recognized, \n     top-notch talents and pioneers in science and technology. \n     Having studied abroad and communicated with the foreign \n     companions, most academicians in CAS and CAE and outstanding \n     technical workers have demonstrated their talents in \n     international exchange and cooperation, while learning \n     advanced innovation concept and latest technologies. By \n     sticking to the opening-up policy and communicating with \n     international scientific institutions in various forms, we \n     can benefit from global technological resources and learn \n     from all civilizations that human beings have created. \n     Scientific institutions and universities are encouraged to \n     cooperate with overseas R institutions to build joint \n     laboratories or R centers. International programs shall be \n     promoted under the protocol of bilateral and multilateral \n     scientific cooperation. National enterprises are encouraged \n     to establish R institutions or industrial bases in foreign \n     countries and multinationals are also encouraged to set up \n     R institutions in China. We should actively participate in \n     large international scientific projects and academic \n     organizations. Chinese scientists and scientific institutions \n     are encouraged to join or organize large international or \n     regional scientific projects. Utilize human resources from \n     both home and abroad by combining domestic talent cultivation \n     with introducing overseas talents. While developing human \n     resources at home and training talent independently, we \n     should step up efforts to introduce foreign talents as well \n     as new and high technologies. Various measures can be taken \n     to attract talents studying abroad to come back and start \n     their own business; highly-qualified overseas talents or \n     talents urgently needed for our social and economic \n     development are warmly welcomed.\n       Fifth, create a social environment that fosters \n     technological innovation. Innovation culture and \n     technological innovation promote and encourage the \n     development of each other. The Chinese culture has long been \n     advocating innovation and our ancestors emphasized, ``A \n     gentlemen shall strive along with perseverance''. We shall \n     encourage the spirit of innovation so as to provide a \n     powerful cultural support to building an innovative talent \n     team and an innovative nation. Innovation awareness should \n     be raised in the whole society. We encourage people to \n     think innovatively, act initiatively and take risks in the \n     hope of creating a favorable social environment that \n     supports talents to start business and succeed. Scientific \n     knowledge, methods, ideas and spirit should be widely \n     spread to equip more common people with scientific \n     knowledge, which in turn will lead a trend of doing things \n     scientifically, loving science, studying science and \n     applying scientific findings. Publicize exemplary stories \n     and figures in technological innovation to make people \n     realize the role of innovation in driving economic and \n     social development. The value that ``innovation is \n     glorious'' should be emphasized, enabling technological \n     innovation to be a kind of work and activity respected by \n     the whole society. Science popularization should be \n     strengthened to foster a notion of technological \n     innovation in teenagers' minds and inspire them to become \n     the main force in technological innovation and scientific \n     development in the future.\n       It is proved that innovative technical talents, especially \n     the pioneers, are all endowed with basic qualities and \n     characteristics necessary for their development and \n     technological innovation. In sum, there are six qualities to \n     become an innovative scientific talent in China today. First, \n     you must have high ideals for life, love the country, the \n     people, and science and technology, be qualified in both \n     ability and moral integrity, and realize your values of life \n     in making scientific contributions. Second, you shall have \n     enough aspiration and courage to seek truth, emancipate your \n     mind, draw conclusions from facts, keep pace with the times, \n     keep strong desire for innovation and exploration, have sharp \n     eyes on new things and knowledge, dare to challenge authority \n     and traditional concepts, and run forward without fear to \n     seek truth and innovation. Third, you must be competent in \n     precise and scientific thinking, master the thinking method \n     of dialectic materialism, and keep lifelong studying by using \n     scientific methods to constantly update your knowledge and \n     theories, build a wide, profound knowledge structure, and \n     foster comprehensive scientific and cultural\n\n[[Page S10132]]\n\n     quality. Fourth, you must have solid professional knowledge, \n     international vision and keen insight to grasp the trend of \n     scientific development and innovation, and be adept at \n     providing key solutions for major scientific problems. Fifth, \n     you must have strong team spirit to lead the innovative team \n     in implementing major scientific programs or tackling front-\n     line science difficulties by organizing multi-subject experts \n     and collecting knowledge on all fronts. Sixth, you must be \n     honest and serious about your work, indifferent to fame and \n     wealth, have strong ambition and high ideals, hardbitten and \n     determined, unafraid of hardships and frustration. You must \n     have the courage to defeat difficulties in technological \n     innovation in order to make great achievements continuously. \n     These qualities can be found in successful scientists of any \n     country, as well as our academicians, excellent scientists \n     and technicians. We shall inherit and carry forward the fine \n     traditions and styles of Chinese scientists and technicians, \n     which will play a very important role in cultivating a large \n     group of innovative scientific talents.\n       There is a Chinese saying, ``It is easy to recruit \n     thousands of soldiers, but it is not so easy to find a \n     general.'' A leading scientific elite, an international \n     scientific master or pioneer can lead a team of excellent \n     innovative scientific talents to make world-leading \n     scientific achievements, giving birth to competitive \n     enterprises and new industries. There are many such leaders \n     among our academicians, but there's shortage of such \n     talents in our whole country. So our work of cultivating \n     innovative talents shall focus on such talents esp. youth \n     or middle-aged leaders. Meanwhile, we shall cultivate \n     innovative talents at different levels, who will act as \n     backbone of academic and technical innovation and form a \n     talent structure suitable for scientific innovation, thus \n     promoting innovation practices in each field and at \n     different layers.\n       The scientific and technological development in China is \n     now facing many opportunities for huge leap forward. Under \n     the background of reform, opening up and modernization \n     construction, it is urgent to develop science and technology, \n     and the scientists and technicians are able to exhibit their \n     brilliancy. The aspirant scientists or technicians shall \n     seize the opportunity to contribute to the construction of an \n     innovative country while realizing their own dream in this \n     course.\n\n\n III. Academicians of CAS and CAE Display their Talents in Building an \n                           Innovative Country\n\n       Academicians of CAS and CAE represent our country's highest \n     academic level in science and engineering technology. They \n     enjoy highest honor and are respected by the whole society. \n     As leaders of national science and technology, academicians \n     of CAS and CAE has long been committed to our country's \n     scientific and technological development as well as economic \n     and social development. Thanks to their painstaking efforts, \n     we have made all these achievements from drawing of The 1956-\n     1967 Science and Technology Development Plan to successful \n     development of ``two bombs and one satellite'' in hard times, \n     from drawing and implementation of ``863 Program'' and ``973 \n     Program'' that play a key role in our scientific development \n     to the launch of manned spaceship of Shenzhou V and Shenzhou \n     VI, from a series of discoveries including hybrid rice, \n     nonmarine oilgeneration theory and application and high \n     performance computer to the great projects of Three Gorges, \n     south-to-north water diversion, west-to-east electricity and \n     gas transmission, Qinghai-Tibet Railway, and high speed \n     railway transportation. Mr. Wang Xuan who passed away \n     recently is just one of the most outstanding academicians. He \n     devoted all his life to science, and becomes the model of all \n     scholars with the spirit of pioneering, earnest aid to young \n     generation, and utter devotion. Academicians of CAS and CAE \n     are truly the pride of our nation and people!\n       It has been proved that the academician system with Chinese \n     characteristics fits the real situation of our country. It is \n     very effective in gathering scientific elites to contribute \n     their ideas and tackle difficulties in economic and social \n     development, organizing innovative team for national major \n     scientific projects, and stimulating the scientists and \n     technicians to work for our country's flourishing and \n     prosperity. But after all, academician system has existed in \n     China for only decades. To give better play to its functions, \n     we shall continue improving the system based on real \n     situation and experiences.\n       The Central Committee of CCP, State Council and Chinese \n     people have high expectations towards academicians of CAS and \n     CAE. We hope that, with the advantages of cross-subject, \n     cross-department and high academic level, CAS and CAE will \n     carry out macroscopic, strategic, proactive and comprehensive \n     decision consultancy on such major issues as promoting \n     economic and social development, improving people's living \n     standard and ensuring national defense. Meanwhile, they \n     shall organize scientific research team to play a leading \n     role in professional fields, provide the Party and \n     government with valuable opinions, and make major \n     decisions more scientific and democratic through real \n     efforts.\n       We hope that academicians of CAS and CAE will endeavor to \n     become pioneers standing at the frontier of scientific \n     innovation with the patriotic spirit of love for our homeland \n     and conscientious devotion, scientific spirit of being \n     practical and innovative, exploration spirit of being \n     unafraid of hardships, and team spirit of being cooperative \n     and indifferent to fame and wealth. They shall bear in mind \n     the major scientific problems in economic and social \n     development, combine national demand and micro-deployment \n     with free exploration, continue to drive original innovation \n     and R of core technology and integrated technology, promote \n     introduction, assimilation and re-innovation, industry-\n     academy-research integration, and work hard for huge leaps of \n     independent innovation capability as well as construction of \n     an innovative country.\n       We also hope that academicians of CAS and CAE can take lead \n     in all-out efforts of building an innovative country; carry \n     forward the scientific spirit of seeking truth from facts, \n     foster socialist concept of honor and disgrace--Eight Honors \n     and Eight Disgraces; bear the responsibility of demonstrating \n     innovative behavior and achievements to the public and \n     promoting innovative culture; develop the people's interests \n     in science and technology, deepen their knowledge about \n     scientific innovation, and build innovative culture together. \n     Meanwhile, I sincerely hope you will shoulder the heavy task \n     of cultivating talents especially innovative scientific \n     talents, develop academic echelon, and make every effort to \n     support the innovation and rapid growth of youths.\n       Dear academicians and comrades!\n       We all bear the time-honored mission to provide strong \n     scientific support for the construction of a well-off society \n     by improving our independent innovation capability and \n     building an innovative country. I hope that our scientists \n     and technicians will strive hard to make brilliant \n     achievements and constantly contribute to our country and the \n     people.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I join Senators Alexander, Bingaman, and \nothers in talking about a topic that I personally have spent a great \ndeal of time on over the past two years: how to improve the ability of \nthe United States to compete in an increasingly global marketplace.\n  We have held many hearings in the Commerce Committee and in the \nCommerce Subcommittee that I chair on technology, innovation, and \ncompetitiveness issues. I know that both the HELP Committee and the \nEnergy Committee have also examined related issues of competitiveness \nand innovation within the scope of their jurisdiction. A major focus of \nthese hearings has been to consider how we keep America on the cutting \nedge.\n  We have learned some startling statistics. First of all, we find out \nthat America will graduate somewhere around 60,000 to 70,000 engineers \nthis year. China and India together will graduate a much larger number \nof engineers in that same time period.\n  In the 21st century, we need to encourage more people to go into the \ntechnology fields, into science, math, and engineering. We need more \nstudents to pursue advanced degrees in these fields. We need to inspire \nmore of our young people to go into these fields.\n  One interesting fact that came out is that if our kids become \ndisinterested in science and math in elementary school, the chances of \nthem ever becoming interested in these fields later on in life are \nvirtually nil. So we have to focus on inspiring our young kids to go \ninto science, technology, engineering, and math from a very young age.\n  We had a fascinating hearing with the Director of the Museum of \nScience in Boston--Dr. Ioannis Miaoulis--who put it very simply. He \nsaid: When we started our curriculum in the United States for \nelementary school, we started it back in the late 1800s. Engineering \nwas not a big field back then, so it didn't get a lot of attention then \nand that has carried over into our current curriculum. Now when we \nteach about science, we learn a lot about nature. Those are good things \nto learn. As a matter of fact, I have kids in school now, and one of \nthe things we all learn about is how a volcano functions. Dr. Miaoulis \ntalked about this when he testified before my Subcommittee. We all \nbuild our model volcanos with our kids and see how a volcano works.\n  Dr. Miaoulis posed this question. He said: Have you ever noticed how \neverybody in America learns how a volcano functions, but nobody really \nlearns how a car functions?\n  Then he asked this question: Where do you spend more time, in a car \nor in a volcano?\n\n[[Page S10133]]\n\n  As the story suggests, our children are not learning enough about \nengineering concepts in our schools, and as a result they are not \nbecoming interested in those engineering concepts. The National \nCompetitiveness Investment Act that I am happy to join with my \ncolleagues in introducing today focuses on three primary areas of \nimportance to maintaining and improving the innovation of the United \nStates in the 21st century: research investment, increasing science and \ntechnology talent, and developing an innovation infrastructure.\n  A tremendous amount of bipartisan cooperation has gone into the \ndevelopment of the National Competitiveness Investment Act, going back \nwell over a year to when Senator Lieberman and I first started drafting \nlegislation to address key concerns, identified in ``Innovate \nAmerica,'' a report from the Council on Competitiveness.\n  Subsequent reports such as the National Academies' ``Rising Above the \nGathering Storm,'' have raised similar concerns and have led several \nSenate committees to look at programs related to basic research, \neducation, and other areas of competitiveness within their respective \nareas of jurisdiction.\n  As a matter of fact, Senators Alexander, Bingaman, and Domenici \nintroduced what they called their PACE bills that addressed a lot of \nthe problems that were identified in the National Academies, ``Rising \nAbove the Gathering Storm'' report. During the past several weeks we \nhave undertaken a bipartisan effort to combine the work products of the \nSenate Commerce Committee, the Senate Energy Committee, and the Senate \nHELP Committee. This effort has included the involvement of the \nchairmen and ranking members, both Republicans and Democrats, from all \nof these committees, as well as several other Members who have been \ninvolved. This has been under the direction of the two leaders' \noffices. This is the most bipartisan effort on any bill probably in the \nlast several years in the Senate.\n  This was no easy task, especially when we need to be ever vigilant \nabout growing deficits. We were forced to take a hard look at how to \nbest address pressing needs related to science, technology, \nengineering, and math education, basic research and barriers that U.S. \ncompanies are facing as they compete in this global economy.\n  I believe the legislation before us today is a good compromise, and \nit reflects a good mix of spending on key priorities like basic \nresearch and education, while being sensitive to avoiding the \nduplication among various federal agencies. This legislation will \nensure these programs are being evaluated and are being responsive to \nkey needs, while at the same time being fiscally responsible.\n  Specifically, the National Competitiveness Investment Act would \nincrease authorization for the National Science Foundation, or the NSF, \nfrom approximately $6 billion in fiscal year 2007 to more than $11 \nbillion in 2011.\n  We doubled the funding for the National Institutes of Health, the \nlife sciences, and it is now time to do the same for basic research in \nthe physical sciences. This is an investment in our country.\n  I am a fiscal conservative. I am one of the most fiscally \nconservative Members of the Senate. But every dollar we spend on basic \nresearch is a dollar that will come back to us in spades in terms of \nstimulating economic activity and helping to keep the United States at \nthe forefront of global innovation.\n  By the way, those who are concerned about tax revenues coming in, the \nbetter our economy does, the more tax revenues come into the Federal \nGovernment.\n  The bill also expands existing NSF graduate research fellowship and \ntraineeship programs. It requires NSF to work with institutions of \nhigher education to develop professional science master's degree \nprograms and strengthens the NSF's technology talent program.\n  It also helps to prioritize activities in NSF's research and related \nactivities account to meet critical national needs in the physical or \nnatural sciences--technology, engineering, mathematics; or to enhance \ncompetitiveness or innovation in the United States. And there is \nlanguage to authorize the National Institutes of Standards and \nTechnology from approximately $640 million next year to $940 million 4 \nyears later.\n  It would require the same agency to set aside no less than 8 percent \nof its annual funding for high-risk, high-reward innovation \nacceleration research.\n  This is very important because this is different than what people do \ntoday. We need to invest in high-risk, high-reward basic research and \nsetting that 8 percent as a minimum is very important.\n  This bill also requires the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a \nstudy to identify the forms of risk that create barriers to innovation \n1 year after enactment and 4 years after enactment. It establishes the \nInnovation Acceleration Research Program to direct Federal agencies \nfunding research in science and technology to set a goal, once again, \nof dedicating approximately 8 percent of the research and development \nbudget toward high-risk frontier research.\n  It also authorizes increased funding for the Department of Energy's \nOffice of Science over the next 5 years. We all know how important it \nis for the Department of Energy to be involved in basic research.\n  There are other provisions to assist States in establishing specialty \nschools in math and science to benefit high-need districts. The bill \nalso strengthens the skills of thousands of math and science teachers \nby establishing training and educational programs at summer institutes \nhosted at the National Laboratories.\n  The bill also establishes partnerships between the National \nLaboratories and local, high-need high schools to create centers of \nexcellence in math and science education.\n  Finally, the bill authorizes competitive grants to States to promote \nbetter alignment of elementary and secondary education with the \nknowledge and skills that are needed to succeed at institutions of \nhigher education and in our marketplaces in the 21st century.\n  This is a comprehensive piece of legislation to address the key \nrecommendations in the two reports, ``Innovate America'' and ``Rising \nAbove the Gathering Storm.''\n  While I am sure there are many other well-intentioned ideas of other \nprovisions to add to this bill, I would plead with my colleagues to not \noverload this bill. We have worked diligently together in a bipartisan \nfashion over the last 2 years to remain absolutely disciplined and to \nconfine this effort to enacting the key provisions that relate to \ninnovation and competitiveness. We have worked hard to keep the cost of \nthis bill within a responsible budgetary framework.\n  I believe we have a solid work product that will help the United \nStates be competitive as we enter an increasingly difficult global \nmarketplace where our students and our U.S. companies need to be \nprepared to meet an unprecedented global challenge.\n  I am pleased that Senators Frist and Reid have agreed to address an \nissue of this tremendous importance to the United States on a \nbipartisan basis.\n  I thank my colleagues from the Commerce Committee, Senator Stevens \nand Senator Inouye; from the HELP Committee, Senator Enzi, Senator \nKennedy, and Senator Alexander; and, from the Energy Committee, \nSenators Domenici and Bingaman and their staff for great bipartisan \nwork to pull this bill together.\n  I also would like to specifically recognize Senator Hutchison for her \ngreat work, and all of the staff--my staff and all of the Senators' \nstaff--who have contributed a great deal of personal time and effort on \nmany of the key provisions of this legislation.\n  Finally, I would like to acknowledge the work of my colleague, \nSenator Lieberman, who started in this endeavor with me many months \nago.\n  As Senator Alexander said a few moments ago, we encourage all of our \ncolleagues to join us in cosponsoring this important piece of \nlegislation. Now is the time to act. We have a rare opportunity to put \naside our party labels and to put our country first. In many other \nareas, we should be not Republican, not Democrat, not Independent--we \nshould be Americans. This is such a bill. This piece of legislation is \ncritical for the future competitiveness of our country.\n  I urge all of our colleagues to join us in this bipartisan effort\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I would like to acknowledge the role of\n\n[[Page S10134]]\n\nSenator Ensign in this competitiveness piece of legislation.\n  It would not have gotten started without him and the work he did with \nSenator Lieberman in the Council on Competitiveness, and it would not \nhave been finished without he and his staff taking a lead role in \nhelping to bring the Senators together.\n  It is important the way he characterized this as a progrowth \ninitiative. This is progrowth legislation. It is part of a progrowth \nagenda. Sometimes we forget that.\n  It is a great pleasure to work with him on this legislation. I wanted \nto acknowledge his leadership.\n  I want to say to the Senator from Massachusetts that I appreciate his \nleadership on this legislation. He was already a veteran when I was a \nSenate aide here many years ago. He has been deeply involved in these \nissues for a long time. He and his staff made it possible for us to \nbring this to a conclusion.\n  There are many ideas about how to do this. To have three committees \nbasically unanimously agree that this is how we should begin--there are \nmany other issues to be dealt with. Many of them may be dealt with in \namendments after the recess. But without Senator Kennedy's leadership \nand without Senator Ensign, nothing would have happened.\n  After Senator Kennedy's remarks, I would like to say a word about \nSecretary Spellings' speech today. I appreciate him allowing me to \nspeak now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I just want to say a few words on the \ncompetitiveness legislation to which Senator Alexander and Senator \nEnsign referred. My full statement will accompany the bill's \nintroduction later today, but I do want to mention that I am a very \nstrong supporter of the bill. As Senator Ensign and Senator Alexander \nmentioned, it is the result of a strong bipartisan process.\n  Americans know how to rise to challenges and come out ahead. We've \ndone it before and we can do it again. We were called into action in \n1957 when the Soviet Union sent Sputnik into space. We rose to the \nchallenge by passing the National Defense Education Act and inspiring \nthe nation to ensure that the first footprint on the moon was by an \nAmerican. We increased the commitment we made to math and science and \ndoubled the federal investment in education.\n  Money in itself may not be the answer to everything, but it is a very \nclear indication of a nation's priorities.\n  Now we are faced with the challenges of globalization, and now we \nmust decide--are we going to get consumed by it, or are we going to \nembrace the challenge and make sure that every individual, whether in \nTennessee or in Massachusetts, is going to be prepared to respond to \nit; that our States are going to be prepared to respond to it; and that \nour country is going to be prepared to respond to it? This is critical \nnot only for the sake of our economy, but for the sake of our national \nsecurity.\n  We need the same bold commitment today that we made four decades ago, \nin order to help the current generation meet and master the global \nchallenges of today and tomorrow. The National Competitiveness \nInvestment Act is a strong first step in that effort.\n  I will not take the time here to review how America is slipping \nbehind in technology and engineering compared to what is happening in \nIndia and in China and other countries. But one brutal fact is that the \njobs of the future are going to go to the societies and the economies \nthat are on the forefront of innovation. That is where the economic \nstrength is going to be, and it will directly impact our national \nsecurity. This legislative effort is a very important downpayment on \nensuring that the United States is that society at the forefront of \ninnovation. And the legislation is the result of a good deal of work.\n  The good work of the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Alexander, of \nSenator Bingaman from New Mexico, and the large bipartisan group the \nSenator from Nevada mentioned. It stems from the work of the National \nAcademy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, and the \nInstitute of Medicine as well as some very important leaders in the \nprivate sector who have played an extremely important role in our \nefforts to keep America on the cutting edge.\n  We are also dealing with other important issues that are before the \nSenate today. But I agree with my colleagues that these issues related \nto America's competitiveness are issues that Congress needs to act on \nas soon as possible. It is extremely important.\n  At a time in Washington when the debate seems to be dominated by \npartisan politics, it should be reassuring to the American people that \nwe are united in recognizing the importance of investing in America's \ncompetitiveness in the years to come. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues as the bill moves forward to ensure that Congress provides \nthe new investments needed to fully support and build on these \nimportant proposals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/26/senate-section/article/S10134-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10134-S10136]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              IMMIGRATION\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, before the Senate tomorrow, we will be \ndealing with one of the provisions relating to immigration, the \namendment dealing with the fence on the southern border of our country. \nI would like to address the Senate about this issue and about the \ngeneral issues of immigration.\n  We face a clear choice on the bill between two fundamentally \ndifferent approaches to immigration. We are talking about the \nunderlying legislation on which the majority leader now has put forth a \ncloture motion, which we will be voting on tomorrow. We will be unable \nto have any kind of amendments to it. That opportunity has been \nforeclosed. I think that is regrettable. I think this would have given \nus an important opportunity for alternatives that have been debated and \naccepted in the Senate earlier this year. That is the way we have to \ndeal with it in terms of Senate rules and procedures. That is where we \nare at the present time. We will vote on this tomorrow.\n  There is no debate about our immigration system being broken and in \nneed of repair. All of us at this point understand that reform is \nessential. The choice we confront is whether we will answer that call \nwith a decisive vote in favor of comprehensive reform or whether by \nfailing to do so we will defer to the House of Representatives, which \nhas an enforcement-only approach.\n  I listened to Dr. Land today, who is the President of the Southern \nBaptist Organization--not recognized as being either a Democrat or \nliberal figure--talk about the morality of this issue and also about \nthe immorality of the House approach. He commented on a joint press \nconference he read with great particularity and with the language which \nis the approach of the House of Representatives included in terms of \nits immigration bill. He was pointing out that any person of the cloth \nwho cares for the least among us, whether it is food, clothing, or a \nstranger, any act of general humanity, would be accused of aiding and \nabetting an undocumented and, under their language, he concluded could \nbe both arrested, tried, and convicted.\n  He spoke enormously eloquently about the morality of that particular \nHouse legislative approach and its inappropriateness, and compared it \nto the fugitive slave law wherein innocents were helping free slaves in \nthe mid-1800s.\n  The recent report of the Independent Task Force on Immigration calls \nimmigration the oldest and newest story of the American experience.\n  Immigration has always been part of our history. It is in our blood \nand genes. In the beginning, immigrants helped to build our country, \nmake it strong, loved America, and fought under our flag with great \ncourage. Over 70,000 permanent residents have fought in Afghanistan and \nin Iraq. A number have won medals for bravery and courage. Generations \nof immigrants have settled here, found a nation that rewarded their \nhard work, respected their religious beliefs, and enabled them to raise \ntheir families.\n  Immigrants today are no different. They work hard, they practice \ntheir faith, they love their families, and they love America.\n  Today, more than 60,000 immigrants serve in the U.S. military. Many \nhave made the ultimate sacrifice, giving their lives for America on the \nbattlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan. That\n\n[[Page S10135]]\n\nhas always been the American story. It is what makes America a land of \nliberty and progress and opportunity.\n  Reform is a pressing issue today. It is a security issue, an economic \nissue, a moral issue. The question is, How do we secure our borders \neffectively to keep out criminals and terrorists who want to harm \nAmerica and not obstruct the entry of many others who want to continue \nto benefit our country?\n  How do we deal with 12 million law-abiding, taxpaying, undocumented \nimmigrants and their families in this country? They live beside us, \nworship in our churches, attend our schools, are part of our \ncommunities. They deserve a fair chance to come out of the shadows and \ncontribute fully and legally to our country.\n  U.S. businesses that are unable to find the American workers they \nneed must be able to draw upon workers from other nations. Both native-\nborn and immigrant workers deserve to be free from exploitation, be \npaid fair wages, receive the protections of our labor and health and \nsafety laws.\n  In May, the Senate met this challenge and passed a comprehensive \nimmigration bill with effective enforcement measures. Enforcement alone \nand fencing alone will not work. Those who support enforcement only, \nanti-immigrant approach may think it is good politics, but security \nexperts agree that cracking down harder on illegal immigrants won't \nresult in our regaining control of our borders. Instead they believe \nthe Senate had the right approach.\n  As Tom Ridge, the former Secretary of Homeland Security, recently \nnoted:\n\n       [T]rying to gain operational control of the borders is \n     impossible unless our enhanced enforcement efforts are \n     coupled with the robust temporary guest worker program and a \n     means to entice those now working illegally out of the \n     shadows in some type of legal status.\n\n  Instead of following the sound advice of these experts and focusing \non solving real problems, the Senate is considering a House bill to \norder the Department of Homeland Security to build hundreds of miles of \nfencing along our border with Mexico--a country that is not our enemy, \nbut a close friend, our second largest trading partner.\n  The House bill is unnecessary. Earlier this year, Secretary Chertoff \ntold Judiciary Committee members that he needed about 370 miles of \nfencing and 461 miles of vehicle barriers and targeted urban areas \nalong the southwest border. The Senate included a provision in our \nimmigration reform bill to do that and on August 2 we agreed, by a vote \nof 94 to 2, to appropriate $1.8 billion for that purpose.\n  The much longer fence in the pending bill would be a waste of \ntaxpayers' money. The Congressional Budget Office estimated it would \ncost roughly $3.2 million a mile, which may be the low end. The first \n11 miles of the San Diego fence cost $3.8 million a mile and the final \n3.5 mile section cost approximately $10 million a mile.\n  Under more recent estimates, which take into account the cost of \nroads, lighting, infrastructure, terrain, and other factors, the costs \nare even higher. The current estimate also ignores the annual \nmaintenance costs which could be as high as $1 billion a year. The more \nthan 700 miles in fencing that the House proposes but that Secretary \nChertoff does not need will result in at least $1 billion in \nunnecessary spending.\n  Fences don't work. Undocumented inflows have increased by a factor of \n10 since fencing was introduced. San Diego's wall has benefited the \nsmuggling industry and increased the loss of immigrant lives by \nshifting entry to the desert. The track record of the four concentrated \nborder enforcement operations in border States shows that tougher \nborder controls only enrich smugglers, endanger the lives of migrants, \nand encourage those who overcome the obstacles to settle permanently \nhere in the United States.\n  Testimony we had before our committee recently from some of those who \nhave studied this issue pointed out that up to 60 percent or more of \nthose who come here want to work for a while, make some money and be \nable to return to their families and to their community to be able to \nenjoy it. By putting the fence up, we are making sure they are locked \nin the United States illegally.\n  Recent testimony from the bipartisan Congressional Budget Office \nconcluded that the sharp increase in border security funding over the \npast decade and the near doubling of the number of Border Patrol agents \nover that time have not kept sizable numbers of illegal migrants from \nentering the country illegally. The reason? Jobs were the magnet. As \nlong as you have the magnet of jobs, people are going to find ways \naround the fence, under the fence, and over the fence. Until you have a \ncomprehensive approach that will deal with that issue, as our \ncomprehensive approach does, the idea of putting more fencing is \nbasically going to be ineffective.\n\n  For example, the Border Patrol budget increased from $263 million in \n1990 to $1.6 billion today, a sixfold increase, yet during this period \nmore than 500,000 undocumented immigrants entered the United States \neach year. In all, nearly 9 million have arrived since 1990. During the \nsame time, the probability that an unauthorized border crosser would be \napprehended fell from 20 percent to 5 percent. The United States now \nspends $1,700 per border apprehension, up from $300 in 1992.\n  Nor will fencing keep out criminals or terrorists. The September 11 \nterrorists did not come across the Mexican border illegally. They \nentered the United States with visas. Fences won't stop immigrant \nworkers from coming here to work. Governor Janet Napolitano of Arizona, \nwho knows a lot about borders, recently said:\n\n       You show me a 50-foot wall and I'll show you a 51-foot \n     ladder at the border.\n\n  Fences can be outflanked--and not only over land or through \nunderground tunnels. Increased fences prompted smugglers to move \nmigrants in boats and transport them by plane to Canada, with its 4,100 \nmile largely open border. A recent study of the Pew Hispanic Center \nfound that roughly 40 to 50 percent of the people currently in the \nUnited States illegally entered the country legally. We are going to \nvote on this measure tomorrow in order to stop allegedly illegal \nimmigration coming across the southern border when half of those who \nare undocumented today come here legally. herefore, you have to deal \nwith that particular issue. That fence issue does not do anything about \nthat problem. Our comprehensive approach does.\n  More fences would do nothing about immigrants who come here legally \nand then overstay their visas. Unnecessary enforcement measures also \nharm United States relations with Mexico and other countries. A \n``fortress America'' mentality alienates other nations and makes it \nharder to work with them on other counterterrorism priorities. Already, \nthe ``muro of muerrte,'' the wall of death, is a rallying call for \nopponents of free trade and other aspects of United States economic \nagenda in Latin America.\n  Cardinal Mahoney, of Los Angeles, has pointed out, ``as the world's \nlone superpower and greatest democracy, we possess the resources and \ningenuity to solve our immigration problems humanely and without \nresorting to the construction of barriers and walls.''\n  The United States is facing a delicate period in its current \nrelations with Mexico. Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador will soon become the \nPresident of Mexico after a very close election that challenged \nMexico's democracy. Mr. Obrador stated that fencing will increase \ntension and insecurity at the border.\n  President Bush got it right in May when he declared an immigration \nreform bill needs to be comprehensive because all elements of the \nproblem must be addressed together or none of them will be solved at \nall. He got it wrong last week when he indicated that the House fence \nbill is an acceptable interim measure.\n  We will have the opportunity to vote. I hope the Senate recognizes \nwhat it recognized during the course of the 2-week debate, and that is, \nthe comprehensive approach is the approach that will ensure the \nstrongest security at our borders. The law enforcement within our \ncountry, in terms of the enforcement of programs and human policy, \nrecognizes that those who worked hard, played by the rules, contributed \nto their community, have sent their sons and daughters off to war, want \nto be a part of the American dream, who are willing to pay a penalty \nand also go to the end of the line, would be able to adjust their \nstatus.\n\n[[Page S10136]]\n\n  A comprehensive approach is the way we ought to be going. That is \neffectively the way everyone who has talked about the overall \nchallenges of the undocumented and illegal immigration believe is the \nway to go. Sure, we need to do what needs to be done at the border, but \nit ought to be done in a comprehensive way with these other elements.\n  This legislation does not do so, will not be effective, and should \nnot be accepted.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/26/senate-section/article/S10136-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10136]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I have 2 minutes \nas in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Commending Senator Alexander\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I note that the distinguished Senator \nfrom Tennessee, Senator Lamar Alexander, is in the Chamber. I am sure \nhe has already spoken this afternoon, but I was not present because I \nwas attending another meeting.\n  Senator, if you do not feel good this afternoon, I don't know what we \nare going to do in the Senate in terms of qualifying you to be happy. I \ndon't know what else we will do to make you happier than what we are \ngoing to do tonight or during the next week or so on this competiveness \nmeasure.\n  Senator Alexander came to the Senate, and before his first term has \nexpired he has taken the lead, without anyone wanting to run around and \ntry to figure out who should get the lead, on this mammoth piece of \nlegislation. It falls automatically that Lamar Alexander deserves the \ncredit for getting it started. It was his idea. He recruited the junior \nSenator from New Mexico.\n  They asked me, as members of my committee, if they could take the \nproposition of what we could do to better America's position in a \ncompetitive world, if they could take that to the Academy of Sciences \nto get a report so we could adopt a report during this calendar year.\n  Believe it or not, they did that. As a result, 71 Senators \ncosponsored the legislation. As a result, we will have introduced a \nbill today that almost takes care of every recommendation that \ncommittee made to the Congress. We are having it introduced officially \nby the leadership this evening. It will be held and passed by this \nSenate before we adjourn this year.\n  Imagine that, for a Senator who has just come to the Senate. If he \ncannot say and put up whatever he puts up, matters of high esteem, \ncompleted by him, something that he can be proud of, that is this \nlegislation.\n  There will be a day when it passes that he can be happier, but he \nwill be overjoyed today when he sits down and thinks for a moment of \nwhat is accomplished for America to get moving to develop our brain \npower where we could, where we can, as we can, and as we should, \nwithout any doubt.\n  I compliment the Senator.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico. He \nis overly generous. I learned as a staff aide in the Senate that if an \nidea has many fathers and many mothers, it has a much better chance of \nmoving along than if it just has one.\n  Senator Domenici is being overly modest about his own role. This \nwould not have gotten to first base--by ``this,'' I mean the \ncompetitiveness legislation--had not Senator Domenici created the \nenvironment in which it could succeed, and if he and Senator Bingaman \nhad not had such a good partnership and been able to work together, set \na good example and have been willing to step back and allow other good \nideas that were progressing through the Commerce Committee and the HELP \nCommittee.\n  It has been a remarkable exercise in restraint for many distinguished \nSenators, some among the most senior Members of the Senate, and at a \ntime when politics is at a pretty high level.\n  I thank the Senator for what he said. It means a lot to me.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na summary of the National Competitiveness Investment Act.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Summary of the National Competitiveness Investment Act\n\n       The National Competitiveness Investment Act is a bipartisan \n     legislative response to recommendations contained in the \n     National Academies' ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm'' \n     report and the Council on Competitiveness' ``Innovate \n     America'' report. Several sections of the bill are derived \n     from proposals contained in the ``American Innovation and \n     Competitiveness Act of 2006'' (S. 2802), approved by the \n     Senate Commerce Committee 21-0, and the ``Protecting \n     America's Competitive Edge Through Energy Act of 2006'' (S. \n     2197) approved unanimously by the Senate Energy Committee. \n     Accordingly, the National Competitiveness Investment Act \n     focuses on three primary areas of importance to maintaining \n     and improving United States' innovation in the 21st Century: \n     (1) increasing research investment, (2) strengthening \n     educational opportunities in science, technology, \n     engineering, and mathematics from elementary through graduate \n     school, and (3) developing an innovation infrastructure. More \n     specifically, the National Competitiveness Investment Act \n     would:\n     Increase research investment by:\n       Doubling funding for the National Science Foundation (NSF) \n     from approximately $5.6 billion in fiscal year 2006 to $11.2 \n     billion in fiscal year 2011.\n       Setting the Department of Energy's Office of Science on \n     track to double in funding over 10 years, increasing from \n     $3.6 billion in fiscal year 2006 to over $5.2 billion in \n     fiscal year 2011.\n       Establishing the Innovation Acceleration Research Program \n     to direct Federal agencies funding research in science and \n     technology to set as a goal dedicating approximately 8 \n     percent of their Research and Development (R) budgets \n     toward high-risk frontier research.\n       Authorizing the National Institute of Standards and \n     Technology (NIST) from approximately $640 million in fiscal \n     year 2007 to approximately $937 million in fiscal year 2011 \n     and requiring NIST to set aside no less than 8 percent of its \n     annual funding for high-risk, high-reward innovation \n     acceleration research.\n       Directing NASA to increase funding for basic research and \n     fully participate in interagency activities to foster \n     competitiveness and innovation, using the full extent of \n     existing budget authority.\n       Coordinating ocean and atmospheric research and education \n     at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and \n     other agencies to promote U.S. leadership in these important \n     fields.\n     Strengthen educational opportunities in science, technology, \n         engineering, mathematics, and critical foreign languages \n         by:\n       Authorizing competitive grants to States to promote better \n     alignment of elementary and secondary education with the \n     knowledge and skills needed for success in postsecondary \n     education, the 21st century workforce, and the Armed Forces, \n     and grants to support the establishment or improvement of \n     statewide P-16 education longitudinal data systems.\n       Strengthening the skills of thousands of math and science \n     teachers by establishing training and education programs at \n     summer institutes hosted at the National Laboratories and by \n     increasing support for the Teacher Institutes for the 21st \n     Century program at NSF.\n       Expanding the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program at \n     NSF to recruit and train individuals to become math and \n     science teachers in high-need local educational agencies.\n\n[[Page S10137]]\n\n       Assisting States in establishing or expanding statewide \n     specialty schools in math and science that students from \n     across the State would be eligible to attend and providing \n     expert assistance in teaching from National Laboratories' \n     staff at those schools.\n       Facilitating the expansion of Advanced Placement (AP) and \n     International Baccalaureate (IB) programs by increasing the \n     number of teachers prepared to teach AP/IB and pre-AP/IB \n     math, science, and foreign language courses in high need \n     schools, thereby increasing the number of courses available \n     and students who take and pass AP and IB exams.\n       Developing and implementing programs for bachelor's degrees \n     in math, science, engineering, and critical foreign languages \n     with concurrent teaching credentials and part-time master's \n     in education programs for math, science, and critical foreign \n     language teachers to enhance both content knowledge and \n     teaching skills.\n       Creating partnerships between National Laboratories and \n     local high-need high schools to establish centers of \n     excellence in math and science education.\n       Expanding existing NSF graduate research fellowship and \n     traineeship programs, requiring NSF to work with institutions \n     of higher education to facilitate the development of \n     professional science master's degree programs, and expanding \n     NSF's science, mathematics, engineering and technology talent \n     program.\n       Providing Math Now grants to improve math instruction in \n     the elementary and middle grades and provide targeted help to \n     struggling students so that all students can master grade-\n     level mathematics standards.\n       Expanding programs to increase the number of students from \n     elementary school through postsecondary education who study \n     critical foreign languages and become proficient.\n     Develop an innovation infrastructure by:\n       Establishing a President's Council on Innovation and \n     Competitiveness to develop a comprehensive agenda to promote \n     innovation and competitiveness in the public and private \n     sectors.\n       Requiring the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a \n     study to identify forms of risk that create barriers to \n     innovation.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, although most cannot hear it right now, \nI want to say how much all in the Senate appreciate the extra hours and \nthe skill with which the staffs met and worked through August and over \nthe last several weeks to bring the three committees together. Senator \nEnsign played a major role, and his staff did. There were many staffs. \nThis was not a bill that Republicans wrote and Democrats looked at or \nvice versa. We did it together.\n\n\n                       Future of Higher Education\n\n  Mr. President, today the Secretary of Education, Margaret Spellings, \nmade an important speech at the National Press Club. In her remarks, \nshe discussed the report from her Commission on the Future of Higher \nEducation. This commission was chaired by Charles Miller, who was the \nformer chairman of the board of regents of the University of Texas \nsystem and a leader in education reform at all levels.\n  I am very impressed with Secretary Spellings. I know her job. I once \nhad it. I do not think we have had a more effective Secretary of \nEducation. I am very impressed with Mr. Miller. I know about his work \nin Texas as part of a group of business leaders over the last 20 years \nwho have led the country in terms of helping to set accountability \nstandards in elementary and secondary education.\n  Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to read Secretary Spellings' \nspeech from today.\n  Secretary Spellings is the first U.S. Secretary of Education to \nassume the role of lead adviser to coordinate all of higher education. \nI am glad she is doing that because almost every Department of the \nFederal Government has something to do with higher education. \nCurrently, no one is the lead person for that. It ought to be the \nSecretary of Education. She stepped up to do it. I applaud her, and I \napplaud President Bush for asking her to do that.\n  The Secretary's recommendations in her speech today are sensible and \nrespect the prerogative of Congress to make major changes in higher \neducation policy. In plain English, she laid out some very good \nrecommendations, but she recognized that is one branch of Government, \nwe are the Article I branch of Government, and if there are major \nchanges in policy, we will make them here, and then it is their job to \nimplement it.\n  But among the strong recommendations in her report are the following: \nSimplify the financial aid system. We are already doing that, having \nworked with the Secretary on a commission, and it is included in the \nhigher education bill that has not passed. That is a very good \nrecommendation. Another recommendation is expanding more access to more \nstudents. The initial cost estimates of her commission's report suggest \nits recommendations might cost $9 billion or $10 billion more in terms \nof Pell grants. That is a lot of money, but it is an important goal.\n  Another recommendation is increased competitiveness. The Secretary's \ncommission spent quite a bit of time urging the Congress and the \ncountry to adopt the recommendations of the Augustine commission, to \nadopt the recommendations of the Council on Competitiveness, and to \nadopt the President's recommendations on competitiveness. That was a \nhelp in getting us come to the point in this body where tonight Senator \nFrist and Senator Reid will introduce the National Competitiveness \nInvestment Act.\n  The Secretary's committee recommended less regulation for higher \neducation, which is something I want to talk a little bit more about in \na moment. I thoroughly agree with that. And, of course, another \nrecommendation is to find ways to reduce costs, which every family who \nhas a student headed toward higher education thinks about. In our own \nfamily, where we have two new grandchildren who are less than 1 year of \nage, the parents--our children--are already thinking about it: How in \nthe world are we going to pay for college out of our budgets in 18 \nyears? That is at the top of almost everyone's concern.\n  I want to wave one bright, yellow flag, a cautionary flag, at one \ntroubling aspect of the report of the Secretary's commission. That is \nbest captured by the following sentence on page 13 of the commission's \nreport, and I quote: ``Our complex, decentralized post-secondary \neducation system has no comprehensive strategy, particularly for \nundergraduate programs, to provide either adequate internal \naccountability systems or effective public information.''\n  ``Our complex, decentralized post-secondary education system has no \ncomprehensive strategy. . . .'' The commission apparently believes that \nis a weakness. I believe that is a strength. I believe that is the \ngreatest strength of our higher education system. The key to the \nquality of the American higher education system is that it is not one \nsystem, but that it is a marketplace of over 6,000 autonomous systems, \nindependent systems.\n  These autonomous or independent institutions--such as the University \nof Tennessee, or Fisk University, or the Nashville Auto Diesel College, \nor Yeshiva University--these institutions are regulated primarily by \ncompetition--competition for students, for faculty, and for research \ndollars--and by consumer choice, which is fueled by generous Federal \ndollars that follow more than one-half of American college students to \nthe institutions of their choice.\n  There is, in addition, a system of independent accreditation to help \nregulate these independent and autonomous institutions. To be sure, \nthere is still plenty of the traditional kind of command-and-control \nGovernment regulation. That is very hard to get away from. Every State \nhas a regulatory body, such as the Tennessee Higher Education \nCommission. And each of the 6,000 institutions I described that accepts \nstudents with Federal grants or loans must wade through over 7,000 \nFederal regulations and notices. Those regulations exist today.\n  The president of Stanford University has said that 7 cents of every \ntuition dollar is spent on compliance with Government regulations. The \nlast thing American higher education needs is a barrage of new Federal \nregulations requiring sending new data to Washington so someone here \ncan try to figure out how to improve the Harvard Classics Department or \nthe Nashville Auto Diesel College, both of whose students are eligible \nfor Federal grants and loans.\n  I believe the overregulation of higher education is the greatest \ndeterrent to maintaining the quality of American higher education, and \nthat autonomy, competition, and choice are the greatest incentives to \nexcellence.\n  I would, therefore, wish to lead the bandwagon or be on the bandwagon \nor\n\n[[Page S10138]]\n\npush the bandwagon for more deregulation and to increase the autonomy \nof institutions of higher education and to preserve competition for \nresearch dollars and to give students the broadest array of education \nchoices possible.\n  Today in America we are doing that much better than any other country \nin the world. It is instructive that China and several European \ncountries are deregulating their overly bureaucratized colleges and \nuniversities to try to catch up with the quality of ours. Of course, \nbetter information informs choices. And, of course, easier transfer \npolicies between or among institutions could increase opportunities. \nMuch is to be gained from research that will help institutions measure \nwhat value their classes add to students.\n  But I do not want rules about transfer policies to diminish \ninstitutional autonomy. I do not want to see rules from Washington \nsubstitute for choice and competition as the principal regulators of \nthe quality of our colleges and universities. I do not want to see even \nmore tuition dollars go to pay for complying with costly Government \nregulations instead of to improving research and teaching in the \nclassroom.\n  By design or luck, the United States has created a magnificent \nmarketplace environment that has resulted in, by far, the best higher \neducation system in the world with remarkable access for students of \nall incomes. Our goal should be to improve that system, not to replace \nit with some command-and-control structure.\n  Mr. President, I spoke before the Secretary's Commission on December \n9 of 2005, and I hope that those remarks were useful to the Commission.\n  Mr. President, I want to comment that it is important to keep all of \nthis discussion in some perspective. For example, there is a great \nconcern about the rising cost of tuition. Secretary Spellings, in her \nremarks, says she wants to know why. Well, I know why it has gone up. \nIt has gone up because State funding for higher education has been \nflat. It has actually gone down in many cases. As State funding of \ncolleges and universities in Minnesota or Tennessee or South Dakota has \ngone down, colleges and universities have had to raise their tuition to \nhave enough funds to maintain quality.\n  Now, of course, there are plenty of ways to reduce costs, and we need \nto push that and encourage that. And the Secretary has many suggestions \nfor that. She is right about that. But let's not overlook the fact that \nFederal spending for higher education has gone way up in the last \nseveral years, but State spending has been flat. If anyone wants to \nknow why your tuition bills are higher, it is because your Governors \nand your legislatures have not been paying their fair share of what it \ntakes to have a quality system of higher education in America. I talked \nabout that in my testimony to the Commission, and I hope they listened \nto that. I hope the Administration and my colleagues understand that as \nwell.\n  For example, during the 5-year period from 2000 to 2004, State \nspending for Medicaid, which is where the Governors have to put most of \ntheir extra money, was up 36 percent; State spending for higher \neducation was up barely 7 percent. As a result, tuition went up 38 \npercent.\n  There is another way I think about it. When I left the Governor's \noffice nearly 20 years ago in Tennessee, Tennessee was spending 51 \ncents of every State tax dollar on education and 16 cents on health \ncare--mainly Medicaid. Today, instead of 51 cents on education, it is \n40 cents on education. And instead of 16 cents on health care, it is 26 \ncents on health care. So if we do not get control of Medicaid spending \nhere in this Chamber, and in the other Chamber, one of the unintended \nconsequences will be that we will drive down the quality of higher \neducation all across America because it will not have appropriate State \nfunding and we will not create the new jobs that will help us compete \nwith China and India.\n  On the question of cost, two other things: One is, I ask unanimous \nconsent, Mr. President, to have printed in the Record a short column by \nthe president of the University of Maryland, William E. Kirwan, who \ndiscusses State funding that I have just talked about, and talks about \nwhat some colleges and universities are doing to reduce costs to help \ncontrol the rise of tuition.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Aug. 14, 2006]\n\n                       Security Through Education\n\n                         (By William E. Kirwan)\n\n       A national security crisis is brewing, and if our country \n     doesn't take immediate action, it could be devastating for \n     the future of the United States.\n       Consider these facts: Worldwide, the United States ranks \n     seventh in high-school completion rates and ninth in the \n     percentage of high-school graduates who enroll in college. Of \n     every 100 current eighth-graders in America, just 18 will \n     receive a college degree during the next 10 years. Based on \n     current participation and completion rates, the education \n     pipeline reveals alarming holes.\n       The ``prescription'' for what ails education in this \n     country enjoys widespread consensus: Improve the performance \n     of our primary and secondary school students and provide \n     access to affordable, high-quality higher education to more \n     people. But how the country goes about filling this \n     prescription is a matter of significant debate.\n       Clearly, a ``fix'' to the problem requires the combined and \n     coordinated efforts of various sectors. Central to the \n     effort, however, must be higher education. Higher education, \n     after all, prepares the teachers for the schools and sets the \n     standards for the degrees.\n       What should higher education do to help plug the holes in \n     the education pipeline and enable our nation to address its \n     most pressing long-term national security issue: the \n     development of a robust and superbly educated workforce?\n       First, higher education must become more engaged in \n     improving primary and secondary school performance. Colleges \n     and universities need to encourage more students to pursue \n     teaching careers and, in partnership with local school \n     districts, better prepare prospective teachers with the \n     content knowledge and pedagogy skills to succeed. \n     Universities must work more effectively with the K-12 sector \n     to ensure that student assessment in high school is closely \n     aligned with college entrance requirements, and that the \n     transition from high school to college is as seamless as \n     advancement from 11th to 12th grade.\n       The best way to achieve such transformational changes is \n     through so-called statewide K-16 councils, which bring \n     educational leaders from all levels--superintendents, \n     principals, university presidents, deans--together with \n     business and community leaders on a regular basis to develop \n     reform agendas. Such an approach is working in Maryland and a \n     few other states.\n       As a second means of plugging the holes, state governments \n     and higher education need to rethink the way they distribute \n     financial aid. During the past two decades there has been a \n     huge shift in the allocation of university-based aid, away \n     from students with demonstrated financial need and toward \n     high-ability students--often from upper-middle-class \n     families--whom universities seek in order to improve their \n     SAT profiles and ``vanity'' rankings. Too many low-income \n     students are either discouraged from attending college or \n     must work such long hours that their progress toward a \n     degree is unreasonably delayed or, worse, terminated.\n       Fortunately, we have seen several ``enlightened'' \n     universities--including the University of North Carolina at \n     Chapel Hill, Harvard University, the University of Virginia \n     and the University of Maryland, College Park--introduce \n     programs to ensure that students from families at the lower \n     end of the economic ladder can graduate debt-free. At the \n     University System of Maryland, we recently adopted a policy \n     requiring that students from families with the lowest levels \n     of income graduate with the lowest debt. Planned expenditures \n     on institutional need-based aid by USM institutions have \n     increased more than 30 percent in the past year.\n       Finally, higher education--especially public higher \n     education--must learn to operate with a more cost-conscious \n     budget model. Most others sectors have experienced \n     significant productivity gains through rigorous attention to \n     cost containment. Higher education can no longer afford to \n     ignore this strategy.\n       Investment of state funds in higher education on a per-\n     student basis is at a 25-year low. It has fallen from about \n     $7,100 in 2001 to just over $5,800 in 2005. As state \n     investment on a per-student basis has declined, the tuition \n     burden on students and their families has increased. In more \n     than a quarter of our states, tuition revenue is now greater \n     than the state's investment in its public colleges and \n     universities. In the coming decades, areas such as health \n     care, energy, and social services for an aging population \n     will require an ever greater proportion of available tax \n     dollars, accelerating the decline in public investment in \n     higher education.\n       With that decline and without serious attention to cost \n     containment, colleges and universities will face two highly \n     undesirable alternatives: Accept more students at generally \n     affordable tuition levels and see quality erode or protect \n     quality by driving up tuition to levels that will be \n     prohibitive for low-income students.\n       With the leadership of its Board of Regents, the University \n     System of Maryland has incorporated cost containment as a \n     formal part of its budget development process. These efforts \n     have reduced the ``bottom line'' by more than $40 million for \n     the system's 13 institutions during the past two years.\n\n[[Page S10139]]\n\n       Filling the holes in America's education pipeline must \n     become an urgent national priority. Nowhere is strong, \n     unified action more necessary than at our colleges and \n     universities. In partnership with other sectors, higher \n     education must be held accountable for embracing its role and \n     responsibilities to help improve K-12 education, increasing \n     its need-based financial aid substantially, and containing \n     costs more aggressively. If this doesn't happen, U.S. \n     leadership in the global economy will erode. Perhaps even \n     more threatening, our national ethos of social upward \n     mobility will be lost and we will devolve into a two-tier \n     society with a permanent underclass.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Sometimes we talk so much about the high cost of \nhigher education where families hear that and think no one can go to \ncollege. I was president of the University of Tennessee. Tuition has \ngone up there for the reasons I just talked about. But today tuition at \nthe University of Tennessee, which is one of the leading research \ninstitutions in this country--the manager of the Oak Ridge National \nLaboratory--is $5,300 a year. It is $5,300 a year for tuition at the \nUniversity of Tennessee. That is more than a lot of people have, but \nthat is a very good bargain in today's marketplace.\n  Volunteer State Community College, a public 2-year college--we \nencourage many people to go to community colleges, and then to our \nresearch universities--the tuition there is $2,383 a year.\n  At Tennessee State University, in Nashville--an excellent \ninstitution--it is $4,300. It is the same story in many other States. \nAt the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, for North Carolina \nstudents--one of the best universities in the world--it is $4,500 a \nyear. At the University of Phoenix--a different kind of university, but \nI had a distinguished scientist from the University of Texas tell me he \nlooked at colleges of education all over America, and he thought the \ncollege of education at the University of Phoenix was as good as any to \nget your teacher's degrees--the comparable cost there for a year's \ntuition is about $6,669. They do things a little differently, but they \nprovide an education and a service that many people are asking for, and \nI think that reflects the strength of our autonomous system of higher \neducation.\n  Now, if you want to go to Harvard, it is a lot more. If you want to \ngo to Vanderbilt, it is a lot more. But the rest of that story is, if \nyou show up at Harvard, or if you are admitted to Vanderbilt, and you \ndo not have the money, they are going to do their best to help you pay \nfor that.\n  So I would hope as we talk about the cost of higher education that we \nrecognize that many of the State institutions are reasonably priced, \nthat the failure of State funding over the last several years is the \nprincipal culprit in the rising increase for public schools, and that \nwe do not get carried away up here in Washington by thinking if we pass \nsome more regulations here, somehow we are going to solve the problem, \nand we are going to make our higher education system better.\n  My main point is this: Our greatest threat to quality higher \neducation is overregulation. And our greatest incentive for it is \nderegulation, choice, and competition. Those are the incentives I would \nlike to preserve.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Energy Independence for America\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, as we wind down this legislative session in \nthis last week, we have a lot of work to do on the agenda. We have \nbills dealing with port security, Homeland Security appropriations, \nDefense appropriations, and border security, which is the subject of \ndiscussion right now, the Secure Fence Act of 2006, and those are \nprobably going to be the things on which we can find consensus. We can \nadd to that the issue of how we deal with detainees and continue to \nacquire high-value intelligence that will enable us to prevent future \nterrorist attacks. That legislation is coming down the pike, too. So we \nhave a lot of things to vote on in the last few days before the \nelection. And the assumption, of course, is that we will probably come \nback in after the election to wrap up some of the outstanding issues.\n  There are other pieces of legislation that could be dealt with in \nthis period--legislation that is without controversy, legislation that \nhas been acted on by the House of Representatives and on which there is \nbroad bipartisan agreement. It seems to me, at least at this point in \nthe legislative session, that in order to get these bills through, it \nis going to take considerable agreement on both sides of the political \naisle, with enough critical mass behind them to get them through.\n  I have a bill that fits into that category. I have come to the Senate \nfloor on a couple occasions to speak about it. It has been cleared by \nthe House of Representatives by a vote of 355 to 9. Now it is sitting \nhere, and Senator Salazar from Colorado and I have a substitute \namendment to that, and as soon as it is picked up and the Senate passes \nit, it goes back to the House. The House has indicated that if we send \nit back, they will pass it. Then we can put it on the President's desk.\n  The bill has to do with an issue that I think is on the minds of a \nlot of Americans--energy independence. It is a fairly straightforward \nissue. As I have explained previously on the floor, it has to do with \nclosing the gap in the distribution system between the production of \nethanol, the supply of renewable energy in this country, and the demand \nfor it, the ultimate consumer of renewable energy.\n  Right now, as you know, in the last year we passed an energy bill \nwhich required, for the first time ever, certain use of ethanol in this \ncountry--7.5 billion gallons by 2012. We are ramping up to that level \nnow. In South Dakota, we already have 11 ethanol plants. We have three \nunder construction, and in a short period we will be at a billion \ngallons a year--just in South Dakota. If you add to that the production \nunderway in the Chair's home State of Minnesota and other States in the \nMidwest, there is a tremendous amount of ethanol that is in the \npipeline. We have now a requirement that States around the country have \nto meet that 7.5 billion. I think we also have a ver robust demand for \nit because people in this country realize that if we are going to get \nserious about energy independence, we have to begin shifting away from \nsome of the types of energy that we get from other places around the \nworld. This is American energy, homegrown energy, renewable energy. We \ncan raise it every year. We have a corn crop every year that can be \nconverted into gallons of ethanol. We have other types of biomass \nmaterials that, raised in places such as the Midwest, are on the cusp \nin terms of the technology that will soon be available. One is switch \ngrass. There is a research project at South Dakota State University \nright now looking at the probability in the near future of having the \nessential ingredients and processes that will enable us to make ethanol \nout of switch grass, something that is in abundance in the upper \nMidwest.\n\n  This movement toward renewable energy, American-grown energy, is long \noverdue. People are demanding that we begin to move in that direction. \nWe have a renewable fuel standard, as a result of the Energy bill that \npassed, which is a great success for moving in that direction. We have, \nas I said, a lot of production now that is currently on line, with \nadditional plants under construction. What we are missing is the method \nby which that ethanol or other renewable fuels--bioenergy--is \ndistributed to consumers in this country.\n  Right now, we have about 180,000 filling stations in America, and \nonly about 800 of those make available E85 or other alternative fuels. \nIf you do the math on that, that is 1 filling station for every 10,000 \ncars that are currently capable of using E85 or some other form of \nalternative energy. The Auto Alliance--and probably Members of this \nChamber have seen them--has run ads in some of the publications in town \nsaying that today there are 9\\1/2\\ million cars on the road that can \nuse alternative sources of energy. ``Flex-fuel vehicles'' is how we \nrefer to them in most cases. If you look at the 9\\1/2\\ million cars \nalready on the road and those currently in production, the car \nmanufacturers are gearing up to come up with more vehicles that can run \non alternative sources of energy, primarily 85.\n\n[[Page S10140]]\n\nWe have an enormous opportunity out there, a great potential for \nincreasing usage of ethanol and renewable fuels, thereby lessening our \ndependence upon foreign sources of energy, which has implications for \nour economy, for our national security, and foreign policy.\n  This is a win-win. This is flatout a no-brainer for America and for \nthe Senate. Yet we have a hold--a secret hold--by someone on the \nDemocratic side that is preventing this bill from moving forward.\n  Mr. President, I understand the traditions and the rules of the \nSenate allow for that sort of thing to happen, but whoever it is--and I \nhave my suspicions about who it is--who has a hold on the bill, I wish \nthey would come forward and defend that hold. This is a \nnoncontroversial piece of legislation which has broad bipartisan \nsupport, has passed the House with a 355-to-9 vote, and is ready for \naction in the Senate. But as of right now, it is being held up by \nsomeone on the other side. Again, I don't know who that is. I would \nlike to know who that is and have the opportunity to visit with them to \nfind out what their objection is.\n  The reality is that this is a piece of legislation which makes so \nmuch sense for our economy and, as I said, for our need for energy \nindependence, to have American energy so we can get away from our \ndependence on foreign sources of energy. It is good for the \nenvironment. There are so many benefits to moving this legislation \nforward. Again, it is heading in a direction that gets us away from \ndependence upon foreign energy and more energy independence in this \ncountry.\n  I come to the floor to urge my colleagues--it has been cleared on the \nRepublican side. It is ready for action in the House. It is teed up to \ngo there; we have talked with our colleagues in the House. It passed \nonce there.\n  The amendment Senator Salazar and I have offered, the substitute \namendment, is a modification of that bill, but it keeps in place the \nbasic concept of the bill. Very simply, in terms of explanation, it \nprovides up to a $30,000 cash incentive for fuel retailers to install \npumps that would provide E85 or other types of energy. The average cost \nto install that pump is somewhere between $40,000 and $200,000, \ndepending on where you are in the country. We believe the convenience \nstores and the gas stations across this country would take advantage of \nthis if it were in place. It would do something about this ratio I just \nmentioned where we have 1 filling station for every 10,000 cars in this \ncountry that are capable of running on E85 or some other form of \nalternative energy.\n  Again, I commend this to my colleagues in the hopes that we can move \nahead. We have a few days left this week before everybody heads home \nfor the elections. We don't know what will happen with the elections. \nThis is legislation which, as I said, is broadly supported on a \nbipartisan, bicameral basis and has the support of the auto \nmanufacturers across the country and the National Association of \nConvenience Stores. I submitted letters previously for the Record \nexpressing the support of the entire ethanol industry and environmental \ngroups. I think it has been cleared on the Republican side, and I hope \nthat whoever on the Democratic side who has placed a hold on the bill \nwill make that known so we can discuss what the objection is and, \nhopefully, clear it for action so we can get something meaningful done \nabout the issue of energy security before Congress goes home for the \nelections.\n  Mr. President, I raise the issue again, and I urge and ask and \nrequest that my colleagues work together to accomplish what I think is \na very important objective before we leave for the election; that is, \nmoving America in the direction of lessening our dependence upon \nforeign energy, becoming energy independent, and helping to address the \nissue of high gas prices in this country. This bill would do that. I \nsimply ask my colleagues to work with me to get that done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the chair.\n\n\n                        Mental Health Parity Act\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in just a few weeks while we are in \nrecess, we will mark the fourth anniversary of the untimely death of \nour former colleague from Minnesota, Paul Wellstone. Paul Wellstone \ndied at the age of 58 in an airplane crash about 4 years ago. Paul and \nhis wife Sheila and daughter Marcia were on their way to a campaign \nevent in Eveleth, MN on October 25, 2002 when their plane crashed in a \nwooded field 2 miles short of the airport. We mourn for the surviving \nchildren Mark and David and for the families of the campaign staffers, \nWill McLaughlin, Tom Lapic, and Mary McEvoy, and for the families of \nthe pilots flying that fated aircraft.\n  Paul's tragic and premature death silenced one of the leading voices \nin America on the issue of mental illness. Paul Wellstone understood \nthe devastation that mental illness can bring: the stigma, the \nalienation, the broken families and, sadly, even broken lives.\n  In 1992, together with Senator Pete Domenici of New Mexico, Paul \nintroduced legislation to require insurance companies to offer the same \ncoverage for treating mental illness as for physical illness. The \nMental Health Parity Act was passed and signed into law in 1996. The \nfinal version of the bill sadly was watered down and fell short of \nPaul's earliest goals.\n  A new bill to eliminate these disparities in insurance coverage was \nintroduced in the last Congress. The Paul Wellstone Treatment Act \nattracted widespread bipartisan support: 69 Members of this Chamber and \n245 Members of the House--a clear majority supporting Paul Wellstone's \nlegacy. But unfortunately, during the past 2 years, this bill was not \ncalled for passage and did not pass.\n  Today I am honored to be joined by Senator Norm Coleman of Minnesota, \nSenator Ted Kennedy, Senator Tom Harkin, and Senator Mark Dayton of \nMinnesota in submitting a sense-of-the-Senate resolution, first to \nremember Paul Wellstone and honor his legacy, but also to publicly \ncommit to finishing his work on mental health equity legislation.\n  Mental health disorders are the leading cause of disability. Without \ntreatment, the consequences of mental illness for the individual and \nfor all of us are staggering: disability, unemployment, substance \nabuse, homelessness, inappropriate incarceration, suicide, and wasted \nlives. The economic costs of untreated mental illness is more than $100 \nbillion each year in the United States. In my home State of Illinois, \nclose to 4 million people, or 30 percent of the population, are \naffected by some form of mental illness each year, including \ndepression. Suicide is the third leading cause of death among young \npeople 15 to 24. Seventy-seven percent of adults with severe mental \nillness are unemployed.\n  Now, the good news is this: Mental illness is treatable but only for \nthe people who have access to sound diagnosis and care. We have a good \nstart, thanks to the Mental Health Parity law that Senators Wellstone \nand Domenici led to enactment in 1996. Our next challenge is to build \non the work Paul Wellstone left behind.\n  Current law requires insurers offer mental health care and offer \ncomparable benefit caps for mental health and physical health, but it \ndoes not require group health plans and their health insurance issuers \nto include mental health coverage in their benefits package. It doesn't \nprevent insurers from setting higher deductibles, higher copays, and \nfewer services covered for mental health illness. I commend Senators \nKennedy and Domenici for their work in this Congress on working toward \na consensus for reaching mental health parity for Americans.\n  I called Senator Domenici last week to tell him I was submitting this \nresolution and to cheer him on so that during the next session of \nCongress we can give the right tribute to Paul Wellstone and, more \nimportantly, as Paul would see it and I see it as well, hope to \nmillions of Americans.\n  This resolution honors Paul Wellstone. It commits us to continuing \nhis work to ensure equity for people with mental illness. Paul fought \nagainst discrimination in any form. His life work was dedicated to \ncreating a world in which everyone, regardless of race, religion, \neconomic status, or health or mental health status, would be treated \nfairly and equally. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and \nrenew our commitment to ensuring mental health parity.\n\n[[Page S10141]]\n\n  Paul Wellstone was often quoted as saying:\n\n       I don't think politics has anything to do with left, right, \n     or center. It has to do with trying to do right by the \n     people.\n\n  That was what Paul Wellstone said. And now we will have our chance in \nthe next session of Congress to honor that commitment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Illinois for \nsubmitting this resolution both on the legacy of Paul Wellstone and, in \nparticular, focusing on this issue of mental health parity.\n  Paul Wellstone and I disagreed on a lot of issues. One of the great \nthings about Paul Wellstone is that even if you disagreed with him, you \nadmired his passion--his passion which was reflected when we had our \ndebates. He was always energized. He was real. He was very real.\n  One of the things he was very passionate about was mental health \nparity and doing the right thing for millions of Americans. His Senate \nfamily has been touched by the tragedy of mental illness--touched. \nMillions of Americans have been touched or impacted by the tragedy of \nmental illness. The reality is there is treatment available. We can \ndeal with this. We can lift up lives to make people whole and \nproductive. There is a path to do this. There is a path that my \npredecessor laid out with the help of Senator Domenici in the early \n1990s. We made some headway, but we didn't go far enough. We know what \nthe voids are. We know what the gaps are. We have a path to get there. \nWe are close. The problem is ``close'' may be good in bocce ball, but \nit is not good in legislation.\n  I have been here 4 years. It is one of my hopes that on one of the \nthings that Senator Wellstone and I fully agreed on, which is the \nimportance of providing true mental health parity, is that we can get \nit done. We are not there yet. We need to get it done. I hope that as \nwe move forward and when we come back and finish this session--we are \nnot going to get it done now, but I hope folks will reflect on what is \nthe right thing. It is the right thing. With this resolution we are \nhonoring the legacy of a great Senator, we honor the legacy of someone \nwho had great passion, and we do the right thing for millions of \nAmericans.\n  Let us get mental health parity through. It is the right thing and I \nhope we can get it done. Again, I thank my colleague from Illinois for \nraising this issue.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I at the outset thank my colleague from \nMinnesota who was quick to join with his colleague Senator Dayton as a \ncosponsor of this resolution.\n  Many times politics divides us, but when it comes to an issue such as \nmental illness, we are all in this together. I know my colleague from \nMinnesota has probably had the same experience I had, of raising this \nissue at a town meeting or a public meeting, and then I almost \nguarantee you that before you leave that hall, someone will come up to \nyou and ask if they can speak to you privately to tell you the story of \na child or a spouse who has bipolar disorder or schizophrenia or who \nhas committed suicide. It touches so many of us. What Paul Wellstone \nwas trying to remind us of is that mental illness is not a curse, it is \nan illness, and an illness that can be treated. Why shouldn't we \ninclude it in our health insurance for Americans so that every family \ncan be spared the suffering that comes with mental illness today.\n  I thank my colleague from Minnesota for joining me on this \nresolution.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I thank and commend my friend and \ncolleague, the assistant Democratic leader from Illinois, Senator \nDurbin, for submitting the Senate resolution honoring the memory of the \nlate Senator Paul Wellstone from Minnesota, my friend of 22 years, my \ncolleague and mentor for my first 2 years in the Senate.\n  I also thank Senator Coleman, my present colleague, for his \ncosponsorship of this resolution and making it a bipartisan statement. \nI am proud to join as a cosponsor of the resolution.\n  It is hard to believe that it has been almost 4 years--it will be on \nOctober 25, 2006, when we will not be in session--since the terrible \nplane crash occurred that took the lives of Paul Wellstone, U.S. \nSenator from Minnesota, his wife and partner of 39 years, Sheila \nWellstone, his daughter Marcia; the Democratic Party associate chair \nfrom Minnesota, Mary McEvoy; one of Paul's longtime valued Senate \nstaffers here in Washington, Tom Lapic; and a young Minnesota aide, \nWill McLaughlin, as well as two pilots.\n  One of Paul's most important causes was that of mental health parity. \nThe illness of a family member made this a very personal cause for him, \nas well as his compassion for those throughout this country who suffer \nfrom some form of mental illness and are unable to get the treatment \nthey deserve and which is medically available because insurance \ncompanies will not pay for and treat mental illness with the same \nparity they do other physical health problems.\n  Senator Wellstone found a valuable partner in the distinguished \nSenator from New Mexico, Mr. Domenici. Together they worked on a \nbipartisan basis for several years against the fervent opposition of \nthe medical insurance industry to pass mental health parity \nlegislation.\n  In the aftermath of Senator Wellstone's death, then-majority leader \nof the Senate Tom Daschle succeeded in getting through the Senate the \nWellstone-Domenici legislation, which passed the Senate but \nunfortunately hit opposition by the House of Representatives. And once \nagain the medical insurance industry prevented one of Paul's \nlegislative dreams from becoming law in 2002.\n  Despite assurances beginning in January of 2003 from the new Senate \nmajority leadership that the Senate would act on successor legislation \nin honor of Senator Wellstone and pass mental health parity, despite \nthe best efforts of Senator Domenici, who was then joined on our side \nof the aisle by Senator Kennedy and our own caucus leaders, Senator \nReid and Senator Durbin, the Senate has neither considered as a body \nnor passed mental health parity in either the 108th Congress or the \n109th Congress.\n  In other words, during the last 4 years following Senator Wellstone's \nterrible tragedy, the Senate has not acted to pass this legislation.\n  That is why Senator Durbin's resolution today is so timely and so \nimportant in these final days of the 109th session. It states that \nSenator Wellstone should be remembered for his compassion and \nleadership on social issues, and the Congress should act to end \ndiscrimination against citizens of the United States who live with a \nillness by passing legislation relating to mental health parity as a \npriority for the 110th Congress.\n  One of Paul's favorite quotes was that of a rabbi many years ago who \nconcluded by saying: If not now, when? If not now, unfortunately, then \nat least in the 110th Congress, over the next 2 years, it is my fervent \nhope, although I will not be here, and even though my colleague, \nSenator Paul Wellstone, will not be here, his spirit will continue to \ncarry this legislation forward, and with the leadership of Senator \nDurbin and others who have championed this cause in the Senate and with \ngreater understanding perhaps on the other side of Capitol Hill in the \nHouse about the importance of this legislation to millions and millions \nof Americans, this would be one of Senator Wellstone's proudest \nmoments. It would be one of the Senate's and Congress's great \naccomplishments, if mental health parity were to be made the law of \nthis country for the millions of those who would benefit from it.\n  I again thank Senator Durbin.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for a question, \nI would like to say by way of question through the Chair that I thank \nmy colleague from Minnesota. I can recall when he first came to the \nSenate serving with our mutual friend, Paul Wellstone. It must have \nbeen tough to be that close to a dynamo. The man had boundless energy \nand committed to so many good causes.\n  The Senator from Minnesota has carried on the fine tradition for your \nState. I thank the Senator for joining us in this resolution.\n  Hope springs eternal, and maybe during the lame duck session Senator \nKennedy and Senator Domenici will be able to give us some good news \nthat will make us proud on this important issue.\n  I thank the Senator for his words today.\n\n[[Page S10142]]\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. I thank the Senator from Illinois. Senator Wellstone was \nan eternal optimist. I share the Senator's hope that something might be \npossible this year. If not, this resolution passing on that \nresponsibility to the 110th Congress is very timely and appropriate. I \nam glad to cosponsor it.\n\n\n                               Estate Tax\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this morning one of my Republican \ncolleagues came to the floor to talk about what appears to be the \nfavorite topic of most Republican Senators: the estate tax. No matter \nwhat we are talking about on the floor, whether it is immigration \nreform, making America safe from terrorism, dealing with issues \ninvolving the funding for our troops, port security, without fail, you \ncan count on one of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle trying \nto wedge in to this queue with what many of them consider to be at \nleast equally important: the issue of the estate tax.\n  So my colleague came to the floor and mentioned my name over and over \nagain as if I were his opponent. I would say to my colleague there are \nmany Senators who disagree with his position, but I will be happy to \naddress it for a moment or two.\n  The simple fact is this: If an American and a spouse have assets \nvalued at less than $2 million at the time of their death, they will \nnever pay one penny in estate taxes--not one. So if you ask who \nbenefits from this repeal of the estate tax, well, sadly it turns out \nto be some of the wealthiest people in America. If you took 1 percent--\nthat is 1 out of 100--estates in America, people who die each year, \nonly one-fourth of those will ever pay any estate tax. It is a very \nsmall number of people who have done very well in their lives in \nAmerica who may end up paying estate tax.\n  I want my position to be clear. There is an exemption under the \nestate tax, an exempt amount that you can leave to your heirs, that \nwill not be taxed. I think we need to increase that and regularly \nincrease it to reflect reality. It is true, the real estate we own has \ngone up in value while we have lived there, businesses have increased \nin value, farms have increased in value, and I think the exemption \nshould be increased as well.\n  Where I have a problem is where we have people who are very well \noff--multimillionaires--who end up owing the Government--in fact, owing \ntheir country--something for their success, and they will be left in a \nposition with the proposal from the other side of the aisle where they \nmay have no estate tax liability whatsoever.\n  The majority leader of the Senate, Senator Frist, has said he is for \ntotal repeal of the estate tax--total repeal so that Mr. Bill Gates of \nMicrosoft, who has done so well and made so much money, would pay \nnothing back to America by way of estate tax when he passes away. Well, \nMr. Gates is not asking for that. Many people who are well off are not \nasking for that. They understand this country has been very good to \nthem, and they are also prepared to pay back so that future generations \nhave a chance to succeed as well.\n  My colleague came to the floor and talked about farmers and is \nconcerned about farmers. I am from downstate Illinois. A few years ago, \nafter hearing all of the debate about estate taxes, I wrote to the \nIllinois Farm Bureau, the Illinois Farmers Union, and asked them: Tell \nme of any farm that you know of where the farmer's survivors had to \nsell the farm because of paying Federal estate tax. There was not one \nsingle instance in my State. They couldn't find one. Now, I understand \nsome of those farmers may have to sell off a portion of their land or \nsome of their acreage to pay their taxes at the time that the spouse \nfinally passes away. But as far as losing farms, that is something that \nis said over and over again, but neither the Illinois Farm Bureau, the \nFarmers Union and, in fact, the American Farm Bureau could find a \nsingle example of a family being forced to sell its farm because of \nestate tax liability.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, only 123 family-owned \nfarms and 135 family-owned businesses would pay any estate tax at all \nwith a $2 million family exemption level.\n  So we often have to stop and wonder why are we dwelling on this or \nwhy are some Members of the Senate continuing to dwell on this. If \ntheir sympathy is for those who are struggling to survive in America, \nthey should focus their spotlight not on the wealthiest among us but \nthose who are struggling at lower levels.\n  Let's take a look at some of the realities, the economic realities in \nAmerica today. This chart shows what has happened over the last 6 \nyears. The minimum wage has been frozen under President Bush and this \nRepublican Congress for 9 years. During that 9-year period of time, the \nPresident's pay has been increased substantially, pay for Members of \nCongress increased $31,600, and the $5.15 an hour minimum wage has not \ngone up.\n  It is always interesting to me that my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle seem to think that it is fine for those making the lowest \nwages in America, some of them working very hard each day, to have no \nincrease in their pay for 9 straight years, while they are struggling \nto make ends meet. They come to the floor and talk to us about those \nwho have made millions of dollars in their lives and whether they will \nhave to pay any taxes. I think it is a misplaced priority.\n  If we take a look at some of the real household income of Americans \nacross the board, you can see what has happened from 2000 to 2005. Real \nhousehold income has declined by $1,273. It means the average family, \nworking hard, paying off the costs of living--utilities and mortgages, \nenergy costs, education costs--is working harder and falling behind \neach and every year.\n  Our economic policies in this country really are not focused where \nthey should be. We should be focusing on this middle-income American \nfamily that is struggling to make ends meet in a very difficult time.\n  The distribution of wealth in America has changed substantially over \nthe last several years. The distribution of earnings has become even \nmore unequal. When you look at this situation, you see the years \nbetween 1995 and 2000 with a violet color, 2000 to 2005 with the red. \nSo in the year 1995 to 2000, the last term of President Clinton, you \ncan see there was an increase in earnings, weekly earnings for full-\ntime workers, across the board. All of these violet bars above show, \nfor example, a 9.6-percent increase, a 7.4-percent increase. So in that \n4-year period of time, we had the distribution of earnings increasing.\n  Now look at the period of time under President Bush. During that time \nperiod, in each of these categories of income in America, we have seen \nthat earnings have been declining or rising very slowly, as they are at \nthe highest levels of income in America\n  Take a look at the wealth as well under the tax breaks given under \nthis administration the last several years. This is the Bush economic \nrecord: a $38,000 tax break for people who are making $1 million a \nyear, but for middle-income families making $50,000 to $100,000, their \ntax break under the Bush administration has been $55, and for those in \nthe lowest income categories a tax break of $6.\n  You can see where the priorities have been when it comes to taxes. \nBut ask the average family making about $100,000 a year--let's take \nthat as an example. Let's take someone who is a teacher and whose \nspouse may work part time, bringing in some income to the family, and \ntogether they make $100,000 a year. They have raised their kids and \nspent good money sending them to school. Then the kids apply to \ncollege. The families are inundated with a stack of forms--most \nfamilies have seen them--to apply for student loans and students \ngrants. Those making about $100,000 a year will find it difficult to \napply for any financial assistance. So the students, their sons and \ndaughters who finally got into the school of their dreams, may face an \nunconscionable debt.\n  Some students put off their education. Some give up on the best \nschools. Some go on to school and graduate with a mountain of debt, a \nmountain of debt which was made worse this year when, on July 1, a law \nsigned by President Bush increased the interest rates on student loan \ndebts by 2 percent. It doesn't sound like much, except it means the \npayback for that student loan has now been increased by 20 percent over \nthe life of the loan. It means these students, borrowing money to go to \nschool, deeper in debt, will now be paying off their student loan debt \ninto their 50s. Imagine that student graduating today--23, 24 years\n\n[[Page S10143]]\n\nold, maybe--looking ahead to 20 or 30 years of paying off student loan \ndebt. Finally, in their early 50s, they have paid it all off, and now \nthey have a few years to contemplate their retirement.\n  What is wrong with that picture? What is wrong is students and \nfamilies in middle-income circumstances are bearing this burden, and \nthis burden is increasing, as I will show, as the cost of college \neducation increases. So instead of talking about a $38,000 tax break \nfor someone who makes $1 million a year, we believe on this side of the \naisle that we should allow the deductibility of college education \nexpenses. If you can deduct the amount of interest you pay on your home \nto encourage home ownership, why shouldn't a family be able to deduct \nsome of the costs of college education from their tax expenses so we \ncan encourage students to go on, further their education, and make this \na better country? It is a question of tax priorities: on one side of \nthe aisle, estate tax relief for those in the highest income \ncategories; on this side of the aisle, we are talking about relief when \nit comes to tax deduction for the real cost of college education \nexpenses.\n  Most of the families I represent in Illinois were quick to tell me, \nduring the August break, how bad gasoline prices were. We know in the \nlast 5 years they have increased 104 percent. They started coming down \nin the Midwest, but I think there is a false sense of security here. A \nlot of people were sacrificing to put more gasoline in the car, but we \nstill don't have a national energy policy, and there is no guarantee \nthat a few weeks from now those gasoline prices will not go back up \nagain because we have no bargaining power.\n  We are so dependent on foreign oil today that we can't say to those \nwho gouge us and those who want to really charge us the most that there \nis anything we will do about it. And this administration has not really \ncalled the oil company executives in, Exxon and others, to explain the \nabsolutely unprecedented level of profits they took as the gasoline \nprices went up. That industry made more money more quickly than any \nindustry in America, and they reached higher profit levels than any \nindustry had recorded previously. Yet this administration sat back and \nsaid w can do nothing about it as Americans and families and businesses \nand farmers paid the price. As the cost of gasoline goes up, as prices \nhave in the last several months, families have faced that sacrifice. \nNow comes the heating oil season for many, and that may again increase \nthe cost of expenses for these families.\n\n  Take a look at what has happened as well when it comes to family \nhealth insurance premiums under this administration. Family health \ninsurance premiums have increased 71 percent in the last 5 years. That \nmeans the average premium for family health insurance went from $6,348 \nwhen President Bush took office to $10,880. Is it any wonder families \nare feeling the squeeze? These premium increases, of course, translate \ninto another $300 or $400 each month that a family has to come up with \njust to have the same health insurance as last year and maybe less \ncoverage.\n  Have we discussed expanding health insurance or making it more \naffordable on the floor of the Senate? Only once and just for a few \ndays. I salute Senator Enzi, Republican from Wyoming, chairman of the \nHELP Committee, for bringing a health insurance proposal to the floor. \nWe had another proposal here. We tried, if we could, to work out \nsomething ahead of time to have a bipartisan approach. We didn't get it \ndone. I hope that in the next Congress, we can find a way to bring real \nrelief on a bipartisan basis to families that are struggling with these \nhealth insurance premiums.\n  I mentioned earlier the cost of education and student loans. This \ngraph shows what has happened under this administration since the \nPresident took office with regard to the increased costs of college. \nThey have gone up\n   $3,688, the average annual cost of a public 4-year college, tuition, \nfees, room, and board. So there was a 44-percent increase in just this \n5-year period of time under this administration, increase in college \ncost. Again, wouldn't our Tax Code be more sensible if we helped \nfamilies pay this difference, if we helped them put their kids through \ncollege to get a good degree and a good life and contribute to this \ncountry? Wouldn't that be a higher priority in terms of our Tax Code \nthan whether Bill Gates is going to end up being excused from paying an \nestate tax when he passes away?\n\n  There is also a concern as well with retirement plans. Take a look at \nwhat has happened in the last 5 years. In the last 5 years, 3.7 million \nfewer Americans have retirement plans. The number of workers with \nemployer-sponsored retirement plans has gone down from 56.2 million to \n52.5 million, which means more vulnerability.\n  A lot of people who had paid into a retirement plan through the \ncourse of their work experience believed that they had paid their dues, \ntaken the money out of their check every week, and that the day would \ncome and they would see it, that they would finally get to retire and \nrelax. Then came mergers and consolidations and corporate sleight of \nhand and legal work, and the next thing you know a lot of these \npensions started disappearing. So many families are concerned, \nconcerned about when or if they can retire.\n  You read the stories in the paper all the time in Illinois and every \nother State about those who had their future plans wrecked when they \nlost their pension benefits. It has happened at the airlines. It has \nhappened in so many industries across our country. We know it makes a \nreal difference in life. A lot of people who thought they would be \nspending their time worrying about where to go fishing now are acting \nas greeters at stores around America and trying to find part-time jobs \njust to keep it together.\n  We need to do something about retirement in this country, and one \nthing we do not need to do is privatize Social Security. Privatizing \nSocial Security is, of course, supported by the President but not by \nthe American people. They know the math doesn't work. Taking money out \nof the Social Security trust fund for people to experiment with their \ninvestments is going to weaken that fund unfortunately. They will be \nunable to make the payments our Social Security retirees need. If there \nis ever a time when we need Social Security to be strong, it is now, as \nwe see fewer and fewer Americans with retirement plans.\n  The number of Americans without health insurance has gone up \ndramatically under this administration, from 39.8 million Americans \nwith no health insurance to 46.6 million Americans. Those who are \ninsured will tell you many times that their health insurance is not \nvery good. They come up to me at town meetings in Illinois and talk \nabout frightening scenarios where someone in their family had a serious \nillness, a diagnosis, and then when they tried to pay off the medical \nbills, it turns out the health insurance fought them all the way. These \nhealth insurance companies are spending a lot less on care and a lot \nmore on battles with the people who have the health insurance, denying \ncoverage whenever they can. So we have to really get back to this issue \nas part of the priorities of this Congress. I am sorry that this \nRepublican Congress has not really come up with assistance that many of \nthese Americans need with health insurance\n  Overall, as we go through this litany, you can understand as you go \nthrough this litany why this next chart is where it is today. In the \nlast 5 years, under this administration, household debt has gone up \nover $26,000. Because Americans are struggling to make ends meet, \nbecause the cost of college and health care and gasoline and heating \nyour home has gone up dramatically, Americans have had to borrow more \nand more just to keep up. They are right on the edge, trying to pay off \nvery expensive credit card debt.\n  There has been a 35-percent increase in household debt in the last 5 \nyears for the reasons I mentioned earlier, from an average inflation-\nadjusted debt per household of $75,000 to over $101,000. This debt is \nhanging over the heads of many Americans, and if there is any rock in \nthe road that Americans families trip over--if someone gets sick, loses \na job, a divorce, something unforeseen--they are going to find \nthemselves then facing default on their debt and even higher interest \nrates.\n  While this has been going on for the average American, employee \ncompensation has gone down some 4.6 percent. So while all the debts \nhave been\n\n[[Page S10144]]\n\npiling up, the compensation that is being given to individuals has been \ngoing down. Meanwhile, corporate profits are up 8 percentage points. So \nwe can see that the share of corporate income going to profits and \nemployee compensation has gone in opposite directions, and those \ndirections do not benefit those families that are struggling to get by.\n  Those who run the corporations are doing quite well, thank you. In \nthe last 5 years, the pay for the chief executive officers of major \ncorporations in America has gone up over $1.6 million individually. \nThis average pay here of $5.2 million when the President took office is \nnow up to $6.8 million. So while the pay for employees is going down \nand expenses are going up, in the boardrooms the median CEO \ncompensation has gone up substantially.\n  When you take a look at the tax cuts under this administration, their \neconomic record, tax cuts are over 150 times larger for millionaires \nthan they are for most households in America. So we gave the tax cuts \nof $103,000 for those in the highest income levels and $684 for those \nmaking less than $100,000 a year. So the so-called tax cut program has \nnot really helped those families struggling the hardest.\n  What has happened to employment, creation of jobs in America, is \nillustrated by this chart. We have seen the average annual growth rate \nof nonfarm employment in America under every President. You have to go \nback to Herbert Hoover and the Great Depression to see a decline of 6 \npercent in employment in America. You will see the lowest number of any \nPresident since Herbert Hoover has been registered by this \nadministration, in the creation of jobs. That is the average annual \ngrowth rate of nonfarm employment. It is the slowest job growth in \nAmerica in over 70 years.\n  The other sad reality is, while all of these things have taken place, \nthis represents the famous wall of debt which Senator Conrad of North \nDakota has brought to our attention over and over again. When President \nBush took office, our national debt was $5.8 trillion. Today, it is \nover $8.5 trillion--a dramatic increase in America's debt in a 6-year \nperiod of time. With policies which this administration supports and \nmany on the other side have been arguing for, we can see America's debt \nreaching $11.6 trillion in 2011. So in a 10-year period of time, we \nwill have virtually doubled--not quite but almost doubled--the debt of \nAmerica, which means we are leaving a burden for our children, a burden \nwith which they will have to deal--a burden with which they will have \nto deal as we see more and more baby boomers in Social Security and \nMedicare. As we see fewer people working, those who remain in the \nworkforce will not only have to face their own personal challenges \neconomically, but they will have to deal with the debt that we are \nleaving behind.\n\n  If this is fiscal conservatism, I don't understand the meaning of the \nterm.\n  Why is it that we have reached this point? Sadly, the economy is not \ngoing as planned. We are facing a war which costs between $1.5 billion \nand $3 billion every week, and the other side continues to come to the \nfloor and ask for something that no administration has ever asked for \nin the history of the United States--a tax cut in the midst of a war. \nThat is what the Senator from this morning was suggesting. He wants to \ncut the estate tax. By cutting the estate tax there will be less \nrevenue for our Government, the war will continue, and our debt will \ngrow. These numbers will have to be adjusted upwards for the debt we \nare going to leave our children.\n  Yesterday we had a hearing with the Democratic Policy Conference to \ndiscuss the war in Iraq. We had two generals and a Marine Corps colonel \nwho spoke to us. They spoke on a lot of things that we need to do to \nmake America safer and make sure we win this war in Iraq. But one thing \nthat MG John Batiste said I really thought was important. He said--and \nI think we all believe--that America can rise to a challenge. America \ncan meet a challenge. We have done it so many times in our history. We \nhave won wars when we were not expected to. We put a man on the Moon \nwhen a lot of people scoffed at that possibility. We developed medical \nbreakthroughs which no one would have dreamed of. We led the world in \ncomputer technology development and in so many areas one by one. \nWhether it was in agricultural production or in industrial development \nor innovation we have led the world. We have led the world because \nleaders have stepped forward--a President has stepped forward and \nchallenged us and said we need to stick together, we need to work \ntogether to reach the goal.\n  General Batiste said yesterday--and I paraphrase his actual \ntestimony, but I believe what he said. He said that what we need to be \nreminded of is we can meet any challenge as a nation. We need to be \nreminded, as well, if we are challenged and work together, we can win \nthis war on terrorism. And he said it is going to involve sacrifice. It \nis not the first time Americans have been asked to sacrifice. They have \ndone that many times. I believe that spirit of sacrifice is what is \nneeded to make sure we keep America safe from terrorism and safe from \nother threats.\n  I see that Senator Ensign has come to the floor. I don't know whether \nhe wishes to take the floor at this time. But I mentioned his name \nearlier. I commended him for bringing the health insurance issue to the \nfloor. I hope in the next session that we can work together to try to \nfind some bipartisan compromise to deal with this health insurance \nchallenge. It is still out there and getting more challenging every \nday. Senator Enzi of Wyoming, as Republican chair of the committee, may \nhave been the first one to bring the health issue to the floor of the \nSenate in the 10 years I have been here. I commend him for that.\n  Although we didn't see eye to eye on all of that, I hope we come back \ntogether and sit down and try to find some common bipartisan approach \nno matter who is in charge of the Senate in the next session.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n            Ryan White Hiv/aids Treatment Modernization Act\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, in a moment I will request unanimous consent \nthat the Senate pass S. 2823, the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment \nModernization Act.\n  Just last week, we made a unanimous consent request to pass this \nbipartisan, bicameral legislation. That means Members from both sides \nof the aisle and both ends of the building have agreed to the language \nin this reauthorization. It passed out of the House Committee on Energy \nand Commerce last week. However, Senators from three States are \nblocking the vote that would speed reauthorization programs that \nprovide life-sparing treatment to individuals suffering from HIV and \nAIDS.\n  We have to pass this bill. If this bill is not reauthorized by \nSeptember 30, several States and the District of Columbia will be \nslated to lose funds. People who have been counting on the money for \nHIV and AIDS will lose money on September 30. Therefore, Senators from \nthree States are holding up a bill that would help Connecticut, \nGeorgia, Kentucky, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Illinois, \nMaine, Oregon, Washington State, California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, \nMaryland, Montana, Rhode Island, Vermont, and the District of Columbia, \nnot to mention some of the towns, major cities, and some of the States \nthat would be gaining revenue as we move the money to areas where the \ncurrent AIDS and HIV cases are. People with HIV and AIDS who live in \nthe States I just mentioned will be hurt if a few Senators continue \nblocking this reauthorization.\n  As we all know, the Ryan White program provides critical health \nservices for people infected with HIV and AIDS. These individuals rely \non vital programs for drugs and other services. We need to pass this \nlegislation so we can provide them with the treatment they desperately \nneed. I urge Senators who are holding up this bill to stop playing the \n``numbers game'' so that the Ryan White legislation can address the \nepidemic of today--not yesterday.\n  I mentioned that we changed the formula to follow the people. The \nHIV/AIDS epidemic affects more women, minorities, and more people in \nrural\n\n[[Page S10145]]\n\nareas and the South than ever before. While we have made significant \nprogress in understanding and treating this disease, there is still \nmuch to do to ensure equitable treatment for all Americans infected \nwith HIV and AIDS. We must ensure that those infected with HIV and \nliving with AIDS will receive our support and our compassion, \nregardless of their race, regardless of their agenda, regardless of \nwhere they live; therefore, I urge my colleagues to support this key \nlegislation and to stop playing the numbers game so we can assist those \nwith HIV in America.\n\n\n                   Unanimous-Consent Request S. 2823\n\n  Having said that, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nthe immediate consideration of S. 2823, the Ryan White Act. I ask \nunanimous consent that the Enzi substitute at the desk be agreed to; \nthe committee-reported amendment No. 578, as amended, be agreed to; the \nbill, as amended, be read the third time and passed; the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table; and any statements related to the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I object, not on my account but on behalf \nof some of my Senate colleagues who, I stress, want to join with the \nprogram.\n  I commend the chairman for his leadership on behalf of this \nlegislation and the support of the reauthorization, but they object to \nthe permanent reduction in funding for their respective States which \nwould occur under the formula the chairman referenced. They share my \nhope, along with the chairman, that this issue can be satisfactorily \nresolved for all concerned before the expiration, September 30, so that \nthis--I think we all agree--very important and valuable program \nbenefiting all of our States can continue uninterrupted.\n  I do object on their behalf.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. ENZI. I am sorry to hear we have an objection. We need to find a \nway to work through this objection. I have been working desperately \nacross the aisle with Senator Kennedy, who has been joining me in this \neffort to help get it out of committee. We have been trying to find a \nway that the formula would work. One of the ways was to include in the \nbill 3 years of hold harmless for them to finish updating their system \nto the point where if they truly have the HIV numbers, they will truly \nget the money. If they don't have the HIV numbers, yes, they will lose \nthe money.\n  Now, I don't know if the Senator from Minnesota is aware that our \nRyan White reauthorization bill increases the funding for Minneapolis \nby $2 million and $2.5 million for the whole State. It is a net \nbenefactor. There have been increases in HIV and AIDS cases in \nMinnesota, and this would move money to where the cases are. That is \nwhere the numbers show that his city and State would be significant \nbeneficiaries.\n  I have a lot of statistics I can go through, but I wonder if the \nSenator is also aware that these increases are due to the inclusion of \nHIV/AIDS in the funding formula and that Minnesota has more HIV cases.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, again, to make the record clear, I am not \nobjecting on my own account but on behalf of my other Senate \ncolleagues. I thank the chairman for that improvement in the funds that \nare going to Minnesota. I strongly support the program and intend to \nvote for it.\n  I thank the chairman again for his leadership and his continuing \nefforts to get this important legislation reauthorized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I appreciate that clarification.\n  I will ask the Senator for his help. He said he would vote for the \nbill. Anything we can do to move this forward. We have put a 3-year \nhold harmless in there for everyone.\n  On September 30, the world falls apart for a number of people. \nCalifornia, for one, will lose $18.5 million of their funding. There \nare a number of big losers. There are no big losers if we pass the \nbill, provided the numbers back up what they have.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, by objecting to moving this bill, we need \nto look at the real lives that are getting ready to be harmed. Not only \nis the funding for the program going to be cut to the poorest of the \npoor by the formula in the preexisting Ryan White Act, but also the \nmoney for New York and California is going to be cut. The New York \ndelegation, for example, argues that updating the formulas is \ndevastating their State's infrastructure. A closer look reveals that \nthe impact on New York, like other States with large urban areas, is \nnot so great.\n  The national average funding per AIDS case in 2006 was $1,613. New \nYork's average was $2,122--33 percent more than the national average. \nUnder the corrected funding formulas, the national average in 2007 \nwould be $1,793; New York's would still be higher at $2,107, just 5 \npercent less than the State currently has, so people who are getting no \ntreatment now, especially minority women where this disease has ravaged \nand is growing at a larger proportion, do not have access to any care.\n  What we are really saying is to avoid a 5-percent cut, we are going \nto eliminate access for large numbers of minority women in this country \nwho are infected with this virus and have no access to drugs, have no \naccess to treatment today because the dollars have not followed the \nepidemic.\n  The political response to this, even though it might be parochial, is \nwrong for this country. It is wrong for those who have no benefit today \nto continue to be denied benefits because some group might lose a small \npercentage when, in fact, a very large number of people are going to be \nbenefited by the new Ryan White fund.\n  We need to be very careful. The last Ryan White law was very specific \nin what is getting ready to happen. The number of people waiting for \ndrugs is going to shoot through the ceiling if we do not pass the bill \nbecause of the funding formula that was in there to force us to pass a \nbill.\n  What we have said is we are going to object on parochial interests, a \n4- or 5-percent cut, but the reason we are going to object, we do not \ncare that other people are going to have no care, no treatment, no \ndrugs, no access, so what we are really doing is we are not taking away \nany significant care, but we are markedly reducing an opportunity for \nlife for those who are the least able to care for themselves.\n  Just a couple of other examples. The New York Times noted that out of \nthis $2,107, we have dog-walking paid for through AIDS funds, we have \ncandlelight dinners paid for for AIDS recipients--this at the same time \nan African-American woman in Atlanta, in Greensboro, or in Tulsa cannot \nget the lifesaving drugs she needs for tomorrow, the drugs that will \nsave her life, allowing her to continue to be a mother.\n  There have been a lot of people who have worked very hard to get Ryan \nWhite reauthorized. I thank them personally for that. It diminishes the \nSenate when we think of the parochial and not the whole.\n  The long-term former funding for Ryan White was based on AIDS cases. \nThe new funding is based on HIV and AIDS cases. This new funding in \nthis new bill says that 75 percent of the money has to go to \ntreatment--we have never had that before--to really make a difference \nin people's lives.\n  I am disappointed that we are not going to be able to do this bill, \nbut my disappointment is nothing compared to the people who aren't \ngoing to get care, who aren't going to have a future, who aren't going \nto have a life if this is not changed. I thank the chairman for his \nhard work. I thank the Senator from North Carolina for his work and \nSenator Jeff Sessions, as well. This is a disease which is moving hard \nand heavy to minority communities, to the South. If we do not recognize \nthat they ought to have equal rights for treatment and care, there is \nsomething wrong with us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, this is, plain and simple, about whether \nthis Senate is going to allow legislation to go forward to reauthorize \nRyan White, that allows the funding to follow the patients. What an \nincredible thought, that we would be here at a stalemate over whether \nhealth dollars follow the individual HIV-positive and AIDS patients.\n  In North Carolina, we have gone on an aggressive program for \nvolunteer\n\n[[Page S10146]]\n\ntesting. The amazing thing we found out is that of those individuals \nnow tested, 30 percent have full-blown aids, meaning that the options \nwe have, that the health community has, are minimal from a standpoint \nof how we stop that disease in its tracks and give them any quality of \nlife.\n  We are making the steps in North Carolina to try to identify the \nindividuals who should be on a regimen of drugs. But by not allowing \nthis bill to come to the floor for debate, we are denying the Senate \nthe ability to bring the bill up and to consider the merits of it, and, \nyes, to amend it if we want to, to live with the majority of this body \nas to whether we change the funding formulas from what the committee \nhas decided; which is, the funding should follow the patient.\n  My colleague from Oklahoma is an OB/GYN by profession. He has the \nmedical degree. He understands the specifics of it. And the one thing \nthat Tom Coburn has drilled in me over and over and over again is that \nto deny these individuals the ability to have the regimen of drugs that \nare available is to give them a death sentence. To deny this \nlegislation to come up on this floor is to give a death sentence to \nsomebody in America.\n  The likelihood is that some of those individuals with that death \nsentence live in North Carolina. Seventy-two percent of new North \nCarolina cases reported in 2005 were minority clients. Women of color \nin the South are 26 times more likely to be HIV positive than White \nfemales. In 2004, 66.7 percent of people living with AIDS in North \nCarolina were African American--the fifth highest rate in the Nation. \nThe national average was 39.9 percent.\n  What is unique about this challenge of the demographic shift in where \nHIV and AIDS is affecting the U.S. population is that, for example, in \nNorth Carolina, in many cases, it is in rural North Carolina. The \nchallenge is not only how you match the dollars for drugs with the \npatient, it is how you supply the transportation to the patient to get \nto the clinic where, in fact, they get their drugs. To deny the ability \nof the Senate to come to the floor and debate this bill, to bring it up \nand to address the merits of this formula change, to suggest that there \nis something wrong with allowing the funding to follow the patient--I \nam not sure I get it. I thought that is why America sent us here.\n  In 2004, North Carolina's contribution of $11.2 million a year \nrepresented the seventh highest among all States for ADAP programs in \nabsolute dollars, and the second highest contribution as a State in \npercentage. Nobody can look at North Carolina and say we are not doing \nour share and more for the people who live in North Carolina.\n  But what we are denied by our inability to debate this legislation, \nto amend it, if some want to amend it, is to say that North Carolina \nwill have to continue to make a bigger investment on the part of our \nState because certain States do not want to give up their Federal \ndollars, even though they no longer have the pool of HIV and AIDS \npatients.\n  In 2004--one comparison I will draw for this body--in Massachusetts, \nthere were 8,254 individuals living with AIDS; in North Carolina, we \nhad 7,245. Total Federal spending in Massachusetts for individuals \nliving with AIDS was $18.6 million. In North Carolina, it was $8.1 \nmillion--$10 million shy of Massachusetts, with an affected AIDS \npopulation 1,000 less than Massachusetts. That one statistic shows the \ninequity that exists in the formula that we currently have within Ryan \nWhite.\n  One simple change means that funds will now follow the patients. That \nthe concentration of dollars will go into the communities that affect \nthe individuals who are infected with this disease.\n  I am not sure that many of us have stopped to focus on the fact that \nwhen the Federal Government makes an investment or the State government \nmakes an investment to make sure that AIDS patients have the \nmedications they need, we eliminate two hospital visits a year. A \nperson living with AIDS today untreated will likely visit the hospital \ntwice in any given year, for a week's stay each, once for a retinal \ninfection, the second time for pneumonia. The average of those two \nstays is about $33,000\n  For an investment of slightly over $10,000 a year--part by the \nFederal Government, part by the State government, part by private \nentities--we can eliminate those two hospital visits.\n  So the inability to bring up this legislation, the inability to \ndebate a change in Ryan White, an inability to let the money follow the \npatients means not only will New York keep their pot of money or \nCalifornia keep their pot of money, but it means North Carolina is \ngoing to pick up, in unrecoverable hospital expenses, about $22,000 per \nyear per patient for whom we could not provide the medicine. So not \nonly are we not investing the Federal money wisely because it is being \ninvested in communities that do not have the patient population \nanymore, we are turning around, and the Federal Government is picking \nup, in the case of North Carolina, 60-plus percent of the Medicaid \nexpense, or of the disproportionate share of the hospital expense in \nDSH payments, or, in fact, the hospital is sitting there with a $33,000 \nbill and somebody unable to pay for it, and potentially it gives them a \ncollection problem.\n  This is an opportunity for us to fix something that is broken, for us \nto do something that every person, every Member of the Senate \nunderstands the equity and the fairness of; and that is, if we are \ngoing to make a Federal investment, let's make sure the dollars follow \nthe individuals who are affected with HIV and AIDS.\n  This is an opportunity for us to understand that AIDS does not \nrecognize State borders, that it does not recognize the difference \nbetween sexes or ethnic backgrounds, that it has now infiltrated rural \nareas the same way it did urban areas years ago when we were reluctant \nto come to this floor and talk about it.\n  This is a health problem in America. It deserves our attention today. \nIt demands that we change the formula to make sure as many Americans as \npossible who are infected with AIDS are, in fact, treated, in part with \nthe money we devote out of the taxpayers' pockets to do it. The \ninability to bring this legislation up--to stand up and suggest that we \nwould like to bring it up, and there is an objection--is to say, no, we \ndo not want to debate it. Why? Because they do not want to fix it. They \nwould rather allow a death sentence to be applied to somebody, to many \npeople, across this country.\n  So as Dr. Coburn said, dogs can be watched, midnight dinners can be \nhad, but the fact is, this legislation is focused on how we get \nlifesaving drugs to individuals who are infected with HIV and AIDS. My \nhope today is that Members who are scared to have this debate will come \nto the floor and lift their hold, will agree to the unanimous consent \nrequest, and come down and have a debate on this and try to defend--try \nto defend--these numbers, try to tell me that having $18 million for \n1,000 more HIV/AIDS patients is fair. In fact, it is not fair.\n  We are obligated--we are obligated--as Members of this body to change \nthe formula so it represents where the best investment can be made, and \nto where the American people look at it and know we have responded in a \nfair and equitable way.\n  I thank the chairman for the committee's commitment to do this \nlegislation, for the work of the chairman and his leadership in, quite \nfrankly, coming up with a very difficult bill to address the input of \nmany different regions of the country and many different States. But \nthe same population--a population that was infected with HIV/AIDS, \nregardless of where they live, regardless of where they grew up, \nregardless of what their skin color is, regardless of whether they are \nmale or female--they ought to be equitably treated as it relates to the \ndistribution of Federal funds available for them to access lifesaving \ntreatments and drugs for their disease.\n  My hope is that at the end of this day the Chair, the committee, but \nmore importantly the individuals who are infected across this country, \nwill, in fact, win and we will pass this legislation and change this \nunfair funding formula\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his words. The \nincrease in knowledge that I am sure he has created across the \ncountry--and also the\n\n[[Page S10147]]\n\ncomments of the Senator from Oklahoma--both of them have made an \nexcellent case for why we need to do this. We need to do it \nimmediately. We need to do it for people who have HIV/AIDS. I would \nnote that the person who raised the objection to us adopting the bill \nis not from one of the three States that have a hold on the bill. I \nwould hope those people would take a look at the situation in their \nState, and take a look at the fact they are getting more than the \naverage number of funds being expended on patients across the rest of \nthe country, and see that the surpluses their States are running at the \nend of the year greatly exceed the rather minute loss they would have, \nand that they would agree for us to move forward on this bill and get \nit in place before that September 30 deadline that is going to be \ndevastating to 13 States that will lose money for having done the right \nthing.\n  Now, having said that, I know there will be people who will say the \nRepublicans cannot get anything done. Well, that particular issue, and \nmany others are not Republican issues. They are issues of the United \nStates. And that is one on which we worked across the aisle and had a \ngreat deal of agreement on. And I have to thank Senator Kennedy, the \nranking member on my committee, for the extreme work he did to help us \nfind, among the thousands of formulas we looked at, the one that was \nthe most fair so it would follow the patients. I do appreciate the work \nhe has helped us do in the committee during the year.\n\n\n                 Accomplishments of the Help Committee\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I want to take just a few minutes to talk \nabout what the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee has \ndone this year. This Ryan White reauthorization is extremely important, \nbut it is not the only bill we have been working on. Because of the way \nwe have done our work, some people may not be aware of what has been \ndone. In fact, I know that to be the case.\n  This is a committee that has worked across the aisle. When you work \nacross the aisle, a lot of times you can work out many of the \ndifficulties, and when you work out the difficulties, there is not a \nbig floor debate. And when there is not a big floor debate, there is \nnothing for the media to write up about the blood; consequently, it \ndoes not get coverage. So I want to correct that here today, and I \nwould like to discuss the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee's accomplishments for the 109th Congress.\n  We have heard some claims that this is a do-nothing Congress. Well, I \nam here to assure American workers, retirees, students, and parents \nthat the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee has done a \ngreat deal to help you live more secure, productive, and healthy lives. \nOf course, we have more to do, but I am proud that during a time of \nintense partisanship on Capitol Hill, the HELP Committee has produced a \nlengthy list of legislative accomplishments.\n  Looking back over the past 2 years, most of these victories \nmaterialized when Senators were willing to work across party lines and \nacross the Capitol to put finding a solution in front of exploiting an \nissue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of bills and \nreports filed by the HELP Committee in the 109th Congress be printed in \nthe Record\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                REPORTS FILED BY THE HELP COMMITTEE, 109TH CONGRESS, FIRST AND SECOND SESSION (2005-2006)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                  Bill No.                      Ordered rpted.

Cmte. bill and introduced as a Senate Bill on 9/28/2005 as S. 1783--Pension Security and Transparency Act of 2005.\n  Passed Senate amended 11/16/2005. (See also H.R. 28301, H. Res. 602); H.R. 2830--House disagreed to Senate amendment/agreed to a conference on 3/8/\n  2006.)\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I joined the HELP Committee when I was first \nelected to the Senate in 1997. It was natural for me because of my \nsmall business background as an owner of family shoe stores. I had \nfirsthand experience with burdensome government regulations, inadequate \nhealth care coverage for my workers, and adversarial workplace safety \nlaws. I was energized about finding common sense solutions rather than \nmore Washington bureaucracy.\n  Now, another reason I joined the HELP Committee is because its broad \njurisdiction touches nearly every American.\n\n[[Page S10148]]\n\n  Now, there were a lot of vacancies on the committee when I signed up. \nI asked why there were so many vacancies, and I was told, well, that is \na contentious committee. I thought I knew what contentious committees \nwere because I served on the labor committee in Wyoming. I found out \nthat there is another level of contentious. I wanted to work with my \ncolleagues to find smart solutions that would address some of the most \nimportant challenges faced by my constituents in Wyoming and, of \ncourse, other people across the country. I came from Wyoming as a firm \nbeliever in my 80-20 rule. The way that rule works is that we can \nusually find agreement on 80 percent of any issue. We agree across the \naisle on about 80 percent the issues that comes up. Now, we are \nprobably never going to reach agreement on the remaining 20 percent.\n  Unfortunately, for America, what they get to watch on any bill is the \ndebate on the 20 percent we don't agree on, and probably will never \ncompromise on. That is what makes this body seem so contentious--the 20 \npercent that we don't agree on, even though 80 percent can get done. \nThe committee process will enable us to find that 80 percent, and that \nhas been a principle that has guided my chairmanship.\n  I was honored and humbled when my colleagues selected me to chair the \nHELP Committee nearly 2 years ago. Since my chairmanship began, the \nvision for both the full committee and the subcommittees is to craft \nlegislation that provides lifelong opportunities for people to be \nhealthier, more competitive, and to be more secure at school, work, and \nin retirement.\n  Because we have such a broad jurisdiction, the HELP Committee has had \nan aggressive legislative schedule in the 109th Congress. Over the past \n2 years, together with the subcommittees, we have held 57 hearings and \nreported 36 bills out of committee; 21 of these proposals were approved \nby the Senate and 12 were signed by the President and became public \nlaw. We also reviewed and approved 352 nominations that require Senate \nconfirmation. I thank my colleagues, including their staffs, for doing \nthe work needed to maintain this aggressive pace.\n  In this Congress, the HELP Committee has been privileged to have in \nits ranks active subcommittee chairmen and engaged members. This is \nlargely the reason the committee has had legislative success. I thank \nthem for their dedication, and I applaud them for the joint success as \na committee. Our ranking member, Senator Kennedy, and I may disagree on \na number of issues, but we have worked hard to find common ground and \nwe share a commitment to improving the health, education, work, and \nretirement security of Americans.\n  The number of bills acted upon by the HELP Committee is certainly \nimpressive. However, the numbers alone don't begin to tell the story of \nhow the committee's activity will improve the lives of Americans now \nand in the years to come. One of the committee's most significant \naccomplishments came on August 17 of this year when President Bush \nsigned into law the Pension Protection Act. That act marks the most \ncomprehensive change to pension law since 1974. The Pension Protection \nAct is a real victory for working Americans who spend a lifetime \nworking hard and saving for retirement. It dramatically strengthens \npension funding rules and helps curb record pension failures. In doing \nso, the act better protects the retirement dreams of 45 million \nAmericans. Not only were single employer fund rules significantly \noverhauled, but the rules regarding hybrid pension plans were finally \nclarified, and multi-employer funding rules were changed as well. The \nproposal strengthens current law and will better help Americans prepare \nand plan for retirement. It provides workers the security of knowing \nthat moneys earned for retirement will be there when they are ready to \nretire.\n  It also secures the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and secures \nthat corporation without picking the pockets of taxpayers to keep the \nagency solvent. This legislation was no small undertaking. It took a \nyear and a half of hearings, 5 months of deliberations in conference, \nand countless hours of negotiations on each provision of the bill.\n  Fortunately, pension issues are almost always handled in tag team \nfashion, involving both the HELP Committee and the Senate Finance \nCommittee, which has jurisdiction over the Internal Revenue Code. While \nthis tag team approach is a great asset and helped us get the bill \nthrough the Senate, it meant a complicated and extraordinarily large \nconference involving four committees in the House and Senate and 27 \nconferees.\n  Together with my ranking member, Senator Kennedy, Finance Committee \nChairman Grassley, ranking member Senator Baucus, as well as HELP's \nRetirement Security and Aging Subcommittee Chairman DeWine, and Ranking \nMember Mikulski, our committees collaborated with House counterparts to \nmake this sweeping reform happen. Because of this teamwork, the law \npassed the Senate 93 to 5. The result was a policy and a process that \nwas truly bipartisan. Total floor time for the bill--Senate debate and \nconference report debate--totaled about one hour and fifteen minutes \nequally divided.\n  Some may think the conference took a long time to conclude, but \nhistory proves that it was ended in record time. The last big pension \nconference occurred in 1994. The conference was appointed in March of \nthat year, but did not conclude until December. Prior to that, the most \nrecent conference took place in 1987 and operated in the context of \nbudget reconciliation. Again, that conference commenced in March but \ndidn't end until December.\n  This year, our conference began in March and ended in July--just 5 \nmonths compared to a 10-month conference for earlier bills. \nComparatively speaking, the Pension Protection Act conference finished \nquickly, but the impact will be felt for generations.\n  Another major accomplishment of the HELP Committee was the enactment \nof the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act, MINER. From the \ntragic loss of life in the coal mines of West Virginia and Kentucky \ncame the first reforms of mine safety laws in 28 years. These tragedies \nbrought together leaders from the mining industry, from government, and \nfrom the labor unions, and helped to forge a commitment to improve mine \nsafety. I traveled to the Sago mine with Senators Kennedy, Rockefeller, \nand Isakson. We met with the families of the miners who lost their \nlives. We met with other miners who worked there, and we met with \npeople in the union. I felt a commitment to those families and miners \nin this country to try to ensure that this would never happen again.\n  The committee approved the MINER Act on May 17, and the President \nsigned the bill in June. That has to be one of the fastest, most \ncomprehensive changes to any safety law. I can't emphasize enough the \ncooperation of unions and company executives, and Republicans and \nDemocrats.\n  Protecting the health and safety of those who work in the mining \nindustry need not be a partisan issue. Mining, and coal mining in \nparticular, is vital to our national and local economies, and to \nnational energy security. Ensuring the safety of our miners is \nessential to protecting and preserving the industry and protecting the \nworkers. I especially thank Senators Kennedy, Isakson, Byrd, \nRockefeller, and McConnell for the tireless effort they extended. Their \nefforts contributed in large part to this proposal becoming law.\n  I should mention that the debate on the Senate floor was 1 hour \nequally divided with two votes. So nobody saw that. Nobody saw that \ndebate, but it makes a significant difference for all the people in the \ncountry--the mining bill. You never saw any debate on the floor. It \npassed unanimously without debate. It passed in the House under \nsuspension with limited debate--the same bill.\n  Sometimes the things that get done by unanimous consent that \neverybody agrees on nobody ever finds out about, except the people it \ndoes benefit; they know. That is why it is worth doing it that way. For \na bill that has objections around here, there are ways to overcome it \nif you get 60 votes for it. But that is usually about a 3-week process. \nA unanimous consent doesn't use up much time, but it gets things done.\n  The committee has also made tremendous strides related to education \nand job training. This session the\n\n[[Page S10149]]\n\nHELP Committee initiated a comprehensive effort to authorize \nlegislation that enhances knowledge and skills and helps American \nworkers become leaders in the global economy. Some estimates suggest \nthat 60 percent of the jobs created in the next decade will require \nskills that only 20 percent of the workers today currently possess, and \n80 percent of the jobs will require education or training beyond high \nschool. Eighty percent of the jobs will require education or training \nbeyond high school. That is where the world is going. It is changing \nfast.\n  One important component of this effort is the reauthorization of the \nCarl Perkins Career and Technical Education Act. It was signed by the \nPresident in August, and it will help close the gap that threatens \nAmerica's long-term competitiveness. The act addresses the needs of the \nNation's changing workforce and prepares Americans for highly \ntechnical, higher-paying jobs. The reauthorization also made changes \nthat will increase accountability at the State and local levels and \nwill establish stronger links with businesses to build partnerships \nwith high schools and colleges so they can better meet the needs of the \nchanging workforce.\n  For many people, participation in these programs can mean the \ndifference between a job with no possibility of advancement and a \nsuccessful career. Passage of this legislation was a significant \naccomplishment. Again, limited floor debate, no debate on the \nconference report; unanimous consent across the aisle.\n  Another piece of this comprehensive effort is the reauthorization of \nthe Higher Education Act. As my colleagues know, the mandatory portions \nof the higher education law were reauthorized in February under the \nDeficit Reduction Act of 2006. Before I elaborate, I want to stress \nthat it is critical to reauthorize the remaining discretionary programs \nunder the act, which I intend to make a top priority for 2007. We have \nthe bill out of committee but haven't had the floor time to do the \ndebate on it. I am making that a top priority for 2007 because \npostsecondary education is the key to the future success of our \nstudents, our communities, and our economy.\n  As I stated earlier, we reauthorized the mandatory components of the \nHigher Education Act through the budget reconciliation process. We \nfound over $20 billion in savings by eliminating corporate subsidies \nfor lenders and reworking the interest rate structure for many \nborrowers, among other revisions. A portion of the savings was used to \npay for over $9 billion in enhanced students benefits. The law makes \nhigher education more affordable for students who finance part of their \neducation through loans by reducing borrow origination fees and \nincreasing loan limits.\n  Another benefit is a $4 billion grant program for postsecondary \nstudents who major in science, math, and certain national-security-\nrelated foreign languages. These funds are dubbed ``SMART grants'' and \nare an important part of making higher education more affordable for \nlow- and middle-income families. We invested resources where we need \nthem the most, which will help ensure we have a workforce that can \ncompete globally.\n  I was in India earlier this year and saw firsthand what Thomas \nFriedman discusses in his book, ``The World Is Flat.'' It doesn't take \nlong to figure out that by sheer numbers alone, India has only to \neducate 25 percent of its population to have more literate and educated \npeople than the total population of the United States.\n  By using the reconciliation process for these higher education \nreforms, the HELP Committee was able to produce meaningful deficit \nreduction. In fact, I am proud the HELP Committee led the entire \nCongress in deficit reduction and produced $15.5 billion in savings \nover five years. That is 40 percent of the entire Deficit Reduction Act \nof 2006. It is not right to overspend now and pass the bill on to our \nchildren and grandchildren to pay later.\n  I thank Chairman Gregg for his leadership on the Budget Committee and \nfor his contribution on the authorizing committee that helped make the \nmeaningful deficit reduction a reality.\n  Enactment of the Perkins reauthorization and the mandatory revisions \nof the Higher Education Act were critical components of a comprehensive \neffort to strengthen knowledge and skills. However, this effort also \nincludes the reauthorization of the Workforce Investment Act. The \nreauthorization is essential because it will help train American \nworkers to fill the good jobs being created so we can continue to be \nleaders in the global economy.\n\n  The reauthorization of the Workforce Investment Act has been a \npriority of mine since I chaired the Subcommittee on Employment and \nWorkplace Safety in the previous Congress. Last Congress, I worked \ntirelessly to report the legislation from the committee, only to be \nheld up on the Senate floor when it came time to appoint conferees. \nNow, that means the bill made it out of committee and cleared the \nSenate floor. The House passed a different version, so we need a \nconference committee to resolve the differences. However, we weren't \nallowed to appoint a conference committee. That was 2 years ago. Mr. \nPresident, 900,000 new jobs could be trained under that program. This \nyear, once again, I have been procedurally hamstrung in my efforts to \nmove to conference. The bill must be completed. It made it out of the \ncommittee unanimously. It made it through the floor of the Senate, \nagain unanimously. That means everybody agreed with what is in the \nbill. Now the only problem left is we have to reconcile that with what \nthe House passed.\n  America is facing an economic challenge that threatens our ability as \na nation to compete on the world stage. This bill sends a clear message \nthat we are serious about helping our workers and our employers remain \ncompetitive and about closing the skills gap that is putting America's \nlong-term competitiveness in jeopardy.\n  Our commitment to lifelong learning never ends. It begins with giving \nour children the proper tools for a start down the pathway that leads \nto their education. The committee approved improvements to Head Start \nthis last year, and the completion of this process is one of my top \npriorities.\n  On the health front, eight committee bills were signed into law by \nPresident Bush. One of the most significant new health care laws is the \nPatient Safety and Quality Improvement Act. The new law is a \nculmination of 6 years of work in response to the Institute of \nMedicine's 1999 report that found that nearly 100,000 Americans die \nneedlessly every year due to medical errors.\n  The Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act creates a protected \nlegal environment in which patient safety organizations can analyze why \nmedical errors happen and develop strategies to stop those errors from \nhappening again. The law provides critical legal protection for \ndoctors, nurses, and other health care workers who might fear coming \nforward with information about mistakes because the information could \nbe used in a lawsuit against them.\n  This new law is the first important step toward creating a new \nculture of safety and continuous quality improvement in health care.\n  This new law is one of just several important pieces of legislation \nthe HELP Committee produced in this Congress. I would mention again \nthat this too took zero debate time on the floor. Another one is the \nPatient Navigator Outreach and Chronic Disease Prevention Act of 2005, \nwhich will help patients with chronic diseases team up with health care \nexperts who can help them find their way through the maze to the best \ntreatment offered in this often complex health care system. Again, no \nfloor debate time.\n  The Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Act of 2005 supports the \ncreation and maintenance of cord blood stem cells. Stem cells obtained \nfrom umbilical cord blood have already shown great promise in treating \ncancers, leukemia, and other diseases, and this law will accelerate our \nwork in those areas. I have already had people who have reported back \nto me that their life may have been saved by that particular act \nalready. I think we had 5 minutes of debate time on that bill.\n  The National All Schedules Prescription Electronic Reporting Act of \n2005 enables physicians and other prescribers to find out whether \npatients are abusing and diverting narcotics and other dangerous drugs. \nInstead of enabling these patients and their self-destructive habits, \nphysicians will now be able to identify them and treat them.\n\n[[Page S10150]]\n\n  The State High Risk Pool Funding Extension Act of 2005 renewed a key \nlaw that funds State high-risk health insurance pools. These pools \ncreate access to health insurance for otherwise medically uninsurable \nindividuals and are an important part of our strategy to make health \ninsurance available to more Americans. The President also signed a bill \nto amend the Public Health Service Act and strengthen the National \nFoundation for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n  Finally, we passed two key laws to preserve access to medical \ntechnology. The Medical Device User Fee Stabilization Act of 2005 \nprevented the FDA's medical device user fee program from expiring. \nWithout this law, patients' access to the latest medical innovations \nwould have been compromised. Congress also acted to protect children \nfrom dangerous, unregulated cosmetic lenses, often used as part of \ncostumes, by providing for the regulation of these lenses as medical \ndevices.\n  The HELP Committee members worked together with our House \ncounterparts in a bipartisan, bicameral way to complete action on these \nlaws. I personally thank all of the committee members on both ends of \nthe building for their active participation in this process.\n  We also scored a victory on the Senate floor this summer related to \nhealth insurance. Together with Senators Nelson and Burns, I introduced \nlegislation that would allow business and trade associations to band \ntheir members together in small business health plans and offer group \nhealth coverage on a national or statewide basis. It would give small \nbusinesses the capability to group together across State lines to \neffectively negotiate against big insurance companies. It would bring \ndown insurance rate significantly, particularly in the area of \nadministrative costs.\n\n  This legislation, the Health Insurance Marketplace and Modernization \nand Affordability Act, is a direct response to the runaway costs that \nare driving Americans and businesses away from the health insurance \nmarketplace. In May, this legislation received 55 votes on the Senate \nfloor--a clear majority. Unfortunately, obstructionists used arcane \nSenate rules requiring 60 votes for passage to defeat consideration of \nthe bill. I count this as a victory for the HELP Committee because the \npolicy is supported by the majority of the Senate. This will not be a \nvictory for Americans until it is signed by the President.\n  Enacting the Health Insurance Marketplace Modernization and \nAffordability Act will be a top priority for the HELP Committee and me \npersonally in the 110th Congress. I intend to act on this legislation \nearly next year and continue to work across party lines to find the \nsolution that produces 60 votes in the Senate. The HELP Committee has a \nrole to play in making employer-sponsored health care more accessible \nand affordable. Employer-provided health insurance is voluntary, and it \nis in critical condition. Sixty percent of the country's employers \noffer insurance today. That is down 9 percent from just 5 years ago. \nAnd the cost of health insurance for companies has nearly doubled in \nthat same period, with employers expected to pay an average of $8,167 \nper employee family versus $4,248 5 years ago. My proposal would \nprovide health care coverage to over 1 million small businesses and \ntheir working families.\n  This fall, I am also hopeful the committee can add two more victories \nto our list of accomplishments. That would be the Health Information \nTechnology conference agreement and the reauthorization of the Ryan \nWhite Care Act.\n  Right now, my staff is working aggressively with the House to \ncomplete action on the Wired For Health Care Quality Act conference \nagreement. This legislation will enhance the adoption of a nationwide \ninteroperable health information technology system, improve the quality \nof health care, and contain costs. Primarily, it will allow each \nindividual to own their own health care record and to carry it around \nwith them easily. They will have the permanent record to carry with \nthem and release, to the degree they want to, to any health care \nprovider. This will contain costs: just between Medicare, Medicaid and \nVeterans, this is expected to save $160 billion a year. The cost to \nimplement: $40 billion, one time. A good investment anywhere.\n  The committee has also been working in a bipartisan, bicameral \nfashion to complete the reauthorization of the Ryan White Care Act. The \nmeasure was approved by the HELP Committee in May, and I am hopeful \nthat we can swiftly clear compromise legislation through both Chambers \nby December--I was hoping we could pass it today, but I see it has been \nstopped. It is absolutely essential that this clear by September 30.\n  The reauthorization of the Older Americans Act will also have a \nsignificant impact on the everyday lives of Americans. The HELP \nCommittee approved this legislation in June, and I am hopeful we can \ncomplete action on it this year as well. This reauthorization is \nimportant because it ensures that our Nation's older Americans, \nincluding 78 million aging baby boomers, are healthy, fed, housed, able \nto get where they need to go, and safe from abuse and scams. We have \nbeen in bicameral, bipartisan deliberations for several months. Again, \nthere is a little hangup on the funding formula. Money has to follow \nthe people in all of these programs.\n  The committee also conducted various investigations and held several \noversight hearings that exposed waste, fraud, and abuse in Federal \nprograms and used the findings to craft legislation to increase \naccountability. Our first oversight hearing last year focused on how an \nasset management company, Capital Consultants, defrauded workers out of \napproximately $500 million in retirement assets. The findings from this \noversight effort were addressed in the new pension law.\n  The committee also held the first oversight hearing in almost 70 \nyears on the Randolph Sheppard Act and the Javits Wagner O'Day Act. \nBoth programs are supposed to find employment opportunities for people \nwith disabilities. The committee's investigation and hearing \nestablished that some executives were using the programs for their own \nenrichment--making millions while exploiting people with disabilities. \nFollowing the hearing, Federal law enforcement took action against the \nworst actors, and we have collaborated across party lines to \nsystematically overhaul both programs. My goal is to address these \nprograms with legislation next year.\n  I thank my ranking member, Senator Kennedy, and his staff for their \nhard work these past 2 years. His assistance and cooperation are the \nmain reasons we have been able to accomplish many of these priorities. \nWe didn't always agree, but we were able to identify common ground to \nadvance our mutual priorities.\n  I also thank each of our committee members. As I stated earlier, we \nhave kept a full schedule. Many of the legislative victories were \ninitiatives brought to my attention by our subcommittee chairs or \nindividual committee members. Senators were also especially diligent \nabout attending the committee hearings and particularly patient when we \nsometimes waited for a quorum during executive session. For the \nremainder of the year, I will be reaching out to each of our members to \nseek feedback on the 2007 agenda, which will serve as the blueprint for \nthe year.\n  Finally, in closing, I would like to recognize two departing members \nof the committee: Majority Leader Frist and Senator Jeffords. We are \nfortunate they chose to serve, and we are grateful for their \ncontributions. Senator Jeffords is a past chairman of the committee, \nand, of course, Majority Leade Frist has been the doctor on the \ncommittee and provided a perspective no one else could. I am proud of \nthe work we have done here on the committee these past 2 years. By \nworking together, we have established a track record of success.\n\n  I also wish to compliment the subcommittee chairmen for their \nextremely hard work. We gave them a lot of independence, and they \ndidn't disappoint me. They took hold of programs. The competitiveness \nprogram is one of them that has reached a point where it can now be \ndebated and pursued. The Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Alexander, did a \ntremendous job of working that bill, along with Senator Ensign, \ncollaborating with three different committees on one piece of \nfarsighted legislation.\n\n[[Page S10151]]\n\n  Senators DeWine and Mikulski have done a marvelous job with the Elder \nFall Act and Older Americans Act and have worked well together for a \nnumber of years across the aisle to make sure older Americans are taken \ncare of.\n  I could go on and mention all of the subcommittees and the work they \nhave done. Senator Burr has done some fantastic work on bioterrorism. \nHe has put together a fantastic bill that contains new concepts which \nwill allow better preparation for any of the possible terrorism acts \nthat could happen on our own soil. Senator Isakson, of course, has been \nextremely active in handling labor issues. As I mentioned, he was a key \nplayer in the miner safety bill.\n  It has been an interesting year. I look forward to another \ninteresting year. I am looking for suggestions from my colleagues on \nwhat needs to be done, and looking for that 80 percent that can be \naccomplished.\n  Our record of accomplishment is proof that we are a can-do Congress. \nFar from being a do-nothing Congress, we have shown our colleagues and \nour constituents that Congress can and is working hard to improve the \nlives of Americans.\n  One of the reasons America doesn't know more about this is because of \nthe cooperation that has taken place. We didn't have to debate the 20 \npercent we didn't agree on here on the floor of the Senate, and \nconsequently there was not a lot of coverage. But just the pensions \nbill and the miner safety bill, either of those, would be a major \naccomplishment for any committee during a 2-year period.\n  I am proud of the 12 bills the President signed and the 21 bills we \ngot through this body. I think that is a record of accomplishment, and \nI thank all those who participated.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                          Mental Health Parity\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, earlier today, my colleague, Senator \nDurbin of Illinois, took the floor to describe a resolution he and I \nsubmitted and a number of others cosponsored with him to both recognize \nthe contributions of our former colleague, Senator Paul Wellstone, and \nto, in that resolution which has now been submitted in the Senate, \ncommit ourselves to making a mental health parity bill a high priority \nin the next Congress, the 110th Congress.\n  I want to join with Senator Durbin, Senator Coleman, and Senator \nDayton, who also spoke on this topic today, in recognizing the \ncontribution of our former colleague, Paul Wellstone, and to \nrededicating ourselves in his memory to trying to get this mental \nhealth parity bill passed once and for all.\n  It almost seems impossible that it was almost 4 years ago this next \nmonth when we tragically lost our friend and colleague, Paul Wellstone, \nand some others--his wife and others--in that tragic plane crash in \nMinnesota.\n  He was a very special individual to all of us. He was one of the best \nfriends I ever had. Of course, I think he was to millions of other \npeople around America. They thought he was one their best friends also \nbecause of what he stood for and what he fought for. He was always \nsticking up for the kind of little person--people who didn't have much \nvoice or power around here.\n  Paul had one burning goal during his all-too-short tenure in the \nSenate, and that was to get mental health put on the same parity as \nphysical health. He struggled mightily to get that done.\n\n  After his tragic death in October of 2002, many here talked about the \nneed to pass in his memory the Paul Wellstone mental health parity \nbill. We still have not gotten it done. Four years later, we remember \nthat political science professor who came to the Senate. He had a great \nimpact.\n  Paul once said, politics is about what we create by what we do and \nwhat we hope for and what we dare to imagine. He dared to imagine and \nto fight for the end of neglect and denial surrounding issues of mental \nhealth, especially access to mental health services.\n  Right now, over 41 million persons suffer from moderate or serious \nmental disorders each year. Less than half receive any needed \ntreatment. However, 80 to 90 percent of mental disorders are treatable \nby therapies and medications. Paul fought hard with his characteristic \npassion for the Mental Health Parity Act, to end this absurd practice \nof dividing mental health from physical health and putting them into \ndifferent categories under health insurance.\n  Mental disorders account for 4 of the 10 leading causes of disability \nfor persons age 5 and older. In fact, depression is the leading cause \nof disability in the United States. Tragically, mental disorders are \nalso major contributors to mortality. Some 30,000 Americans die by \nsuicide each year.\n  According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \nAdministration, undertreated and untreated mental disorders cost the \nNation in excess of $200 billion annually, hurting the economy, the \nprofitability of businesses, and, of course, our Government budgets.\n  For example, a report released earlier this month by the Department \nof Justice found that more than half of all prison and jail inmates, \nincluding 56 percent of State prisoners, 45 percent of Federal \nprisoners, and 64 percent of local jail inmates were found to have a \nmental health problem.\n  We do not treat the mental health; we hire more police. People with \nmental health problems cause problems in society, and they turn, \nperhaps, to crime or illicit drugs to somehow treat themselves and \ntheir mental disorders and they wind up in our jails. And we pay and we \npay and we pay for this as a society. More than half of all of the \npeople in jails and prison in America have mental health problems.\n  A lot of opponents of mental health parity claim it will drive up the \ncost of health care. However, an interesting study released on March \n30, 2006, in the New England Journal of Medicine released results of a \nstudy that evaluated the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, the \none we are under, to which we all belong. This has provided insurance \nparity for mental health since 2001. The researchers found that when \nthe care was managed, the cost of coverage for mental health problems \nattributable to parity did not increase the cost, and the quality of \nthe care remained constant.\n  Interesting. In our own health benefits program since 2001 we have \nhad mental health parity. And guess what. The costs have not gone up, \nand the quality of care has remained constant. The Wellstone Mental \nHealth Parity Act is modeled after the mental health benefits provided \nthrough the Federal program.\n  Many cost studies miss something that is very important: they fail to \ncalculate and quantify the benefits and savings that will result from \nparity. They fail to weigh the offsetting cost-benefits to employers \nfrom increased productivity, reduced sick leave, reduced disability \ncosts. Indeed, a true comprehensive assessment of the costs of parity \nmust take into account the costs of not providing parity, including the \neconomic costs in the workplace, the cost to taxpayers of shifting of \nburden to public systems--as I mentioned earlier, our prisons and \njails--the cost of care of homeless persons, the cost of care of our \npublic mental health systems, the increased cost in emergency room \nvisits. Add up all that and the cost of not treating people with mental \nillnesses comes to around $79 billion a year.\n  When workers suffering from depression receive treatment, many of the \nmedical costs decline by $882 per employee per year. Absenteeism drops \nby 9 days. Again, if we provide that care, we are saving money and \nincreasing productivity.\n  Also, the good news is that millions of people with mental illness \ncan recover. I don't know why so many people think once you have a \nmental illness, that person is doomed for life. That is like saying if \nI have a physical illness, forget it, I have to have it for the rest of \nmy life. Not true. It is the same for mental health. People have \nproblems; they need help; they get it; they get over it. They can \nreclaim their lives if they are provided treatment and support in a \ntimely fashion.\n\n[[Page S10152]]\n\n  To that end, it is time to do away with the discriminatory practice \nof treating mental and physical illnesses as two different categories \nunder insurance. It is time to do away with the barriers to mental \nhealth treatment and coverage. It is time to pass mental health parity.\n\n  I might remind the Senate, we did pass it once on the 2002 \nappropriations bill. I happened to be chairman that year on the health \nappropriations bill. We passed mental health parity in the Senate. It \ngot voiced-voted. No one even objected. Imagine that. We passed it. It \nwent to conference. We kept it in on the Senate side, but we went to \nconference with the House and we lost it because the House objected to \nit, by two or three votes. By two or three votes in conference we lost \nit. We came that close in 2002 to getting mental health parity.\n  What has happened since? Why have we fallen so far backward? Why \nhasn't the Senate, since that time, brought it up? As I said, in 2002, \nwe did it. Since 2003, it has not even been brought up. Hopefully, in \nthe next Congress, we will bring it up again, we will pass it again, \nlike we did before.\n  For those who had the privilege of serving with Paul Wellstone, his \nspirit is still very much with us. He still inspires us and he still \ncalls us to conscience. Each day that we fail to pass this legislation, \nas we have for years, we are cheating millions of Americans. Each day \nthat we do not step up to the plate and provide adequate mental health \ncoverage to our citizens, we cheat them from reclaiming their health \nand well-being, and we starve society of the talent, contributions, and \nproductivity they have to offer. It is a disservice to society to sweep \nmental illness under the rug and to deny people access and coverage of \nadequate treatment.\n  Congress should make the Wellstone Mental Health Equitable Treatment \nAct a priority for the 110th Congress. With widespread support and \nwidespread need, passage of this legislation is long overdue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/26/senate-section/article/S10152-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

WILLIAM C. TORCH\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of Dr. William \nC. Torch of Reno, NV, who has been selected as a recipient of the \nprestigious Tibbetts Award. Significantly, Dr. Torch is the first \nindividual from Nevada to receive this honor.\n  Each year the U.S. Small Business Administration celebrates the \naccomplishments of a handful of firms, organizations, and individuals \nnationwide with the Tibbetts Award, the agency's highest recognition \nfor innovative technology. Named for Roland Tibbetts, the father of the \nSmall Business Innovation Research Program, the award honors those who \nbest exemplify the philosophy and doctrine of the SBIR Program. \nRecipients are selected based on overall business achievements, the \neconomic impact of technological innovations, and demonstration of \nsuccessful collaboration, among other factors. An individual may only \nwin once in his or her lifetime.\n  Considering the purpose of the Tibbetts Award, I find it very \nappropriate Dr. Torch is a recipient. A neurologist specializing in \nsleep disorders, Dr. Torch has long been an innovative leader in \nmodern, medical research, and social improvement. I have been very \nimpressed by Dr. Torch's unique contributions to the field of medicine \nand the State of Nevada.\n  Dr. Torch is perhaps best known as the inventor of EYE-COM, a \nbiosensor that monitors the frequency and speed of the human eye blink. \nSmall enough to hide inside of a pair of glasses, EYE-COM uses an alarm \nto alert wearers if they begin blinking slower than normal. Already \nthis technology has had profound social effects; it holds great \npotential for even more social and medical utility in the future.\n  For example, EYE-COM has improved the therapy and lives of many \npatients by allowing them to better interact with the world around \nthem. In a 2002 interview, Dr. Torch said he hoped truckers and pilots \nwould use EYE-COM to warn them if they were getting too tired, thereby \nincreasing the safety of our Nation's airspace and highways. Law \nenforcement officers might also use the device to determine if \nindividuals were driving while impaired. As I speak, researchers across \nthe country are working to cultivate the inherent potential of EYE-COM.\n  Beyond being a noteworthy inventor, Dr. Torch has significant \nbusiness achievements to his credit. He is the founder and director of \nthe EYEcom Corporation, the Neurodevelopmental and Neurodiagnostic \nCenter, and Washoe Sleep Disorders Center in Reno, NV, which is \naccredited by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. He is also the \nfounder of Sleep-Management, a Nevada corporation, specializing in jet \nlag and shift work fatigue research. From 1998 to 2003, he was the \ndirector of neurology at Northern Nevada Medical Center.\n  Dr. Torch, who has been licensed in Nevada since 1979, received his \nmedical degree with distinction in research and a master's degree in \nneurochemistry from the University of Rochester. He received his \nbachelor's degree in chemistry from the Brooklyn College. He completed \na residency in pediatrics and a residency and fellowship in child and \nadult neurology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in Bronx, \nNY.\n  The Tibbetts Award presentation ceremony is on September 26, 2006, in \nWashington. I wish to congratulate Dr. Torch on this significant \nachievement and express my confidence that he has great contributions \nyet to come. I hope that you will join me in recognizing Dr. Torch's \nsignificant achievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/26/senate-section/article/S10152-3", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10152-S10153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL PUBLIC LANDS DAY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of the 13th \nannual National Public Lands Day, which will be celebrated on Saturday, \nSeptember 30. Covering nearly one third of America's total land area, \npublic lands are part of the essence of our country. Today, I am \npleased to acknowledge the efforts of volunteers around the Nation who \nwill come together to improve and restore one of America's most \nvaluable assets.\n  Since it's inception in 1994, National Public Lands Day has helped \nfoster communities of volunteers around the Nation. When it started \nthirteen years ago, there were 700 volunteers working in only a few \nareas. I am pleased to report that this year nearly 90,000 volunteers \nwill work at over 800 locations to maintain and enhance countless acres \nof public land for the enjoyment of future generations.\n  Growing up in Searchlight--whether I was hunting or just hiking in \nthe desert--I developed a great appreciation for public lands. \nPreserving these lands for both practical and aesthetic purposes is one \nof my top priorities.\n  Given that more than 87 percent of the land in Nevada is managed by \nFederal agencies, I know that I am not alone in recognizing the \nimportance of public land. Nevadans understand that public lands serve \nmany vital purposes in our State; from hiking and hunting to mining and \nranching.\n  I would be remiss if I didn't also take time to recognize and thank \nthe thousands of Federal employees who manage these lands year-round. \nThe Bureau of Land Management, the Forest Service, the Fish and \nWildlife Service and other Federal land agencies help ensure that the \ncomplex patchwork of Federal land management in Nevada serves and \nadapts to the changing needs of our communities and the public at \nlarge. They provide a vital, although rarely reported, service to our \nNation.\n  Through the month of October, volunteers and staff from land \nmanagement agencies from across Nevada will gather at sites such as the \nBlack Rock Desert-High Rock Canyon Emigrant Trails Conservation Area, \nthe Desert Tortoise Conservation Management Area, the Lake Mead \nNational Recreation Area, Lamoille Canyon, and the Nevada Northern \nRailway, among others. They will remove litter, construct walking \npaths, restore fences, post signs, and perform tasks that will improve \nour public lands for everyone who is fortunate enough to visit them.\n  Our public lands are part of what makes America a great nation. I \nvoice\n\n[[Page S10153]]\n\nmy gratitude to everyone who will participate in National Public Lands \nDay this year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/26/senate-section/article/S10153-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                  Private First Class Anthony P. Seig\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave young man from Sunman. \nAnthony P. Seig, 19 years old, died on September 9 in Baghdad after \nbeing gravely injured when a rocket struck the roof of his barracks the \nday before. Tony risked everything to fight for the values Americans \nhold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around the world.\n  Tony enlisted in the Army shortly after graduating East Central High \nSchool in St. Leon last year. He had been in Iraq for 2 months when he \nwas killed and would have celebrated his 20th birthday in a few weeks. \nTony was remembered by his aunt, Vicki Jenkins, who told a local news \noutlet, ``He's certainly our hero. He was very proud to serve his \ncountry. He felt very strongly about serving his country.''\n  Tony was killed while serving his country in Operation Iraqi Freedom. \nHe was assigned to the 118th Military Police Company, Fort Bragg, NC. \nThis brave soldier leaves behind his mother, Linda Seig, and two \nsisters.\n  Today, I join Tony's family and friends in mourning his death. While \nwe struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take pride \nin the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer \nplace. It is his courage and strength of character that people will \nremember when they think of Tony, a memory that will burn brightly \nduring these continuing days of conflict and grief.\n  Tony was known for his dedication to his family and his love of \ncountry. Today and always, Tony will be remembered by family members, \nfriends and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero, and we honor the \nsacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Tony's sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families \nof the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg:\n\n       We cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow \n     this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled \n     here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or \n     detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \n     say here, but it can never forget what they did here.\n\n  This statement is just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, \nas I am certain that the impact of Tony's actions will live on far \nlonger that any record of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Anthony P. Seig in the Record \nof the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and for his profound \ncommitment to freedom, democracy and peace. When I think about this \njust cause in which we are engaged, and the unfortunate pain that comes \nwith the loss of our heroes, I hope that families like Tony's can find \ncomfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah who said, ``He will swallow \nup death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all \nfaces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Tony.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/26/senate-section/article/S10153-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate National \nHispanic Heritage Month. I am honored to have the opportunity to \nrecognize the valuable contributions and achievements of the Hispanic \npeople of our proud country.\n  For the nearly 34 years I have represented my home State of New \nMexico in the Senate, I have witnessed the growth and success of the \nHispanic community in almost every facet of social life. New Mexico's \nHispanic community has a long and rich history that dates back \ncenturies. Today, it can claim a long ledger of accomplishments in \nfields as diverse as science and art, business and sport, medicine and \npublic service.\n  With respect to the fields of science and military service, I am \nproud to call attention to the remarkable achievements of Sidney \nGutierrez. Born and raised in Albuquerque, Sidney Gutierrez is a \ndistinguished astronaut who has complied over 488 hours in space during \nhis time with NASA. Sidney has been recognized by Hispanic Business \nMagazine as one of the 100 most influential Hispanics in America, and \nhe has also been a recipient of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus \nAward. Prior to his stellar achievements at NASA, Sidney served his \ncountry in the U.S. Air Force after he graduated from the Air Force \nAcademy. What is important to note about Sidney's record is that his \nisn't an aberration. Today, hundreds of Hispanics serve our Nation's \nhigh-tech fields--both in the private sector and for the Government as \nscientists and researchers at our national laboratories.\n  Today, many Hispanic people from New Mexico continue to serve their \ncountry in the armed services. They have stood up as proud Americans \nand volunteered to protect their families and communities during the \nglobal war on terror. We should also take this moment to remember the \nsacrifices Hispanics have made to preserve the liberties and freedom \nthat make America a beacon of hope to millions around the world. Just \nas soldiers from New Mexico distinguished themselves in battles at \nBattan, Attu, North Africa, Europe, and the Pacific, today men and \nwomen in uniform of Hispanic heritage are fighting for their Nation in \nAfghanistan and Iraq. Our Nation is stronger because of these men and \nwomen. They deserve the gratitude of the Nation for their sacrifices.\n  Hispanic Americans have also been active in other forms of public \nservice. The first Hispanic Congressman in the House of Representatives \nand the first Hispanic Senator in our Nation's history were from New \nMexico. Since it became a State in 1912, New Mexico has been a \ntrailblazer in placing Hispanics into elected office.\n  The first Hispanic Senator in our Nation's history was a New Mexican \nby the name of Octaviano Larrazolo. Senator Larrazolo lived a rich life \nand valued public service above everything else. He was one of the \nearly and important contributors to the constitution of the State of \nNew Mexico and a fearless advocate for statehood. It was no surprise \nthen that the people of New Mexico elected him to serve as their \nGovernor. Throughout his career he was known as an advocate for better \neducation and believed that a strong educational system was the key \nadvancement in our fair and competitive society.\n  The tradition of Congress celebrating the contributions of Hispanic \nAmericans goes back almost 40 years. In 1968, Congress started by \ndesignating a week to celebrate Hispanic heritage. Over the years, we \ndecided to extend the designation to cover a month starting on \nSeptember 15. The extra time has been a necessary and appropriate \nchange to allow us to recognize the long record of contributions \nHispanic Americans have made to our communities and to our Nation. I \ncall on the American people to join with all children, families, \norganizations, communities, churches, cities, and States across the \nNation to observe the month with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/26/senate-section/article/S10153-3", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10153-S10154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         IT'S TIME TO TALK DAY\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I would like to call my colleagues' \nattention to the efforts of Liz Claiborne, Inc., and Redbook to \ndesignate September 21, 2006, It's Time to Talk Day. What they want us \nand the Nation to talk about is domestic and dating violence, and they \nhave partnered to encourage national dialog on the subject of this \npervasive and terrible crime.\n  We are not the only ones talking about it: talk radio, government \nofficials, domestic violence advocates, businesses, and schools across \nthe Nation are taking time today to focus on the issue that will affect \nnearly one- third of all women in their lifetime and many men. Bringing \nthe crime of domestic and dating violence to the level of a simple \nconversation can start a chain reaction that will save a relationship \nand may, very well, save a life.\n  Some of you may know that I am especially concerned about teen dating \nviolence, a crime that exists in every community regardless of race, \nsocioeconomics, rural or urban. A young Idaho woman in an abusive \ndating relationship died 6 years ago. Since that time, I have pushed to \ninclude\n\n[[Page S10154]]\n\ndating violence as a definition of domestic violence under Federal law. \nMy efforts would be fruitless without the help of citizens and \norganizations nationwide. Liz Claiborne, Inc. is one of the \norganizations that has taken a leadership role in educating teens about \nteen dating violence through its ``Love is Not Abuse'' curriculum \ndesigned for 9th or 10th graders. I have been pleased to support those \nefforts to promote this curriculum throughout the country this past \nspring.\n  I commend the company not only on this endeavor but its newest effort \nto partner with the National Domestic Violence Hotline and create the \nfirst-ever National Teen Dating Violence Hotline. The hotline will be \noperated by the National Domestic Violence Hotline and will focus on \nteens and young adults up to the age of 24. Although there are national \nhotlines for adults, teens have special needs and require a different \napproach to dealing with their issues and privacy concerns.\n  Time to Talk Day should not be the only day to talk about how we can \nprevent domestic and dating violence. We must work hard to educate our \nchildren how to live in healthy relationships to prevent the cycle of \nviolence from being repeated in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/26/senate-section/article/S10154-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On July, 29, 2006, in San Diego at an annual gay pride festival 3 gay \nmen were assaulted. During the festival, 3 men with baseball bats began \nyelling anti-gay remarks and a fight broke out. Two of the victims were \nhit in the head with a baseball bat and a third victim was stabbed. In \nthe past 32 years the annual gay pride festival has often been the \nfocus of anti-gay protesters, many times leading to violence.\n  I believe that the government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/26/senate-section/article/S10154-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, this year marks the 60th anniversary of \nPhilippine-United States diplomatic relations and friendship. The \npartnership of our two nations is bound by several battles dating back \nto World War II, and continues today with the war on terrorism. Those \nwho continue to pay the ultimate sacrifices do so in the defense of \nfreedom and the democratic way of life.\n  During World War II, Filipinos fought side by side with Americans in \ndefense of Bataan and Corregidor, fighting a common enemy. Today, we \nface a different battle--the war on terrorism--a battle being fought \nand won in the Philippines. At this moment in many parts of the world, \nlittle children, innocent children are crying in pain. Many of these \nchildren are being killed from mines and explosives mainly because \nolder men do not know how to discuss peace. They know only how to \ndiscuss war, hatred, and death.\n  A month ago, together with the senior officers of the Republic of \nPhilippines Armed Forces, I flew to Zamboanga on the Island of \nMindanao. The main element of the mission was to inspect the joint \nPhilippine and United States Armed Forces, and to receive a report on \ntheir activities. However, the event that impressed me most was the \nsimple ceremony celebrating the presentation of 185 electrification \nprojects to governors, chieftains, and leaders of various villages and \ntowns in the many islands of Mindanao.\n  These island villages and towns never had electricity. Children had \nto study by candlelight. For the first time, these communities have \nelectricity in their homes. Children can spend more time learning. \nParents can use sewing machines and other power tools to make products \nto bring to market. And, communities can use computers to surf the Web \nand connect to the world.\n  The ceremony began with Asalamalaykum, and a prayer thanking Allah, \nrecited by the Imam of Zamboanga. He was followed by a Christian \nminister, who read scripture from the Bible. Thereafter, children \nperformed their traditional Muslim dance, welcoming us with such \nwarmth, joy, and tranquility. While Christians and Muslims in other \nparts of the world are killing each other, to see the scene in \nZamboanga, where Muslims and Christians are sitting together, breaking \nbread together, was a deep inspiration. It demonstrates to me that \nunder proper leadership, miracles can happen, and miracles do happen.\n  In Mindanao, there is a demonstration of hope. The joint military \nforces of our two nations have demonstrated that while you need an iron \nfist to combat terrorism, you also need to extend a hand of friendship \nto win their hearts and minds. When you work together, when you \ncooperate, when you consult, when you speak of peace and hope, miracles \ncan happen. If the rest of the world did the same thing, children would \nnot be screaming in pain.\n  Of all the aid that we provide the Republic of the Philippines, 60 \npercent is being spent in Mindanao to reinforce efforts to secure a \nlasting peace, and to build a better life for the people of Mindanao. \nMore than 22,000 former Moro National Liberation Front combatants are \nnow small-scale commercial farmers, earning incomes through farming \ncorn, rice, and seaweed. An additional 6,500 former combatants have \nbeen trained to produce high-value crops, such as finfish and bananas. \nIn partnership with the private sector, 6,500 households in 227 remote \ncommunities are now equipped with solar-powered, renewable energy \nsystems.\n  The ties that bind our two nations are based on the foundations of \nfreedom and democracy. The work conducted today along with the economic \nopportunities and education provided by the Government of the Republic \nof the Philippines and in conjunction with the United States Government \ncontinues to pave the way toward a better quality of life and stability \nfor the children and region of Mindanao.\n  Mr. President, I commend to my colleagues the text of an August 2006 \npaper entitled ``Securing Peace in Mindanao through Diplomacy, \nDevelopment, and Defense,'' written by the American Embassy in Manila.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/26/senate-section/article/S10154-3", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10154-S10155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I was necessarily absent on Senate business \nyesterday when the Senate voted on the nomination of Francisco Augusto \nBesosa to be a U.S. district judge for the District of Puerto Rico.

Mr. President, last month, on August 10, President Bush \nannounced a new U.S. initiative to combat corruption around the world. \nHe named it a ``National Strategy to Internationalize Efforts Against \nKleptocracy.'' In introducing this initiative, President Bush said:\n\n       High-level corruption by senior government officials, or \n     kleptocracy, is a grave and corrosive abuse of power and \n     represents the most invidious type of public corruption. It \n     threatens our national interest and violates our values. It \n     impedes our efforts to promote freedom and democracy, end \n     poverty, and combat international crime and terrorism.\n\n  I couldn't agree more.\n  But lately, some of the President's actions are at odds with his \nrhetoric. The first principle of the President's initiative against \ncorruption is to deny entry into the United States to kleptocrats, \nmeaning high-level officials engaged in or benefitting from corruption. \nYet in recent months the administration has welcomed two of the world's \nmost notorious kleptocrats: Teodoro Obiang, the President of Equatorial \nGuinea, and Nursultan Nazarbayev, the President of Kazakhstan.\n  What do these two men have in common besides corrupt dictatorships? \nOil. Both control their nations' vast oil resources. Both supply oil to \nthe United States. By welcoming these corrupt\n\n[[Page S10155]]\n\ndictators into the United States, in contradiction to the \nanticorruption principles articulated by the President in August, the \nadministration announces to the world that we will compromise our \nprinciples for a price: oil.\n  On April 12 of this year, at the State Department, Secretary Rice \ngreeted the President of Equatorial Guinea, Teodoro Obiang, by saying: \n``Thank you very much for your presence here. You are a good friend and \nwe welcome you.'' In welcoming Mr. Obiang, she made no mention of the \ndeeply troubling hallmarks of his regime, no mention of human rights \nabuses, no mention of election fraud; no mention of widespread and \nhigh-level corruption. Instead, a photograph of Secretary Rice shaking \nMr. Obiang's hand and smiling broadly appeared in publications around \nthe world. Mr. Obiang has undoubtedly used his visit, and that \nphotograph, to legitimize his regime and demonstrate his favored status \nin the United States.\n  Secretary Rice said that her objective as Secretary of State is to \nconduct ``transformational diplomacy'' which, in her words, requires us \nto ``work with our many partners around the world to build and sustain \ndemocratic, well-governed states that will respond to the needs of \ntheir people--and conduct themselves responsibly in the international \nsystem.'' Under Mr. Obiang, Equatorial Guinea is nothing near \ndemocratic, well-governed, or responsive to its citizens.\n  Equatorial Guinea is the third largest oil producer in sub-Saharan \nAfrica. It currently exports about 360,000 barrels per day, with much \nmore under development. U.S. companies have invested over $10 billion \nto develop those oil resources. But the development of Equatorial \nGuinea's oil resources has not benefitted its deeply impoverished \npeople. Though Equatorial Guinea's oil money makes it, on a per capita \nbasis, one of the wealthiest nations in the world, the standard of \nliving of its people is among the world's poorest. Equatorial Guinea \nranks 121st on the United Nations Human Development Index. According to \na 2002 State Department report, there is ``little evidence that the \ncountry's oil wealth is being devoted to the public good.''\n  Mr. Obiang is a principal cause of his people's misery. He took power \nby coup 30 years ago, his opponents have been jailed and tortured, and \nhis most recent election was condemned by the State Department as \n``marred by extensive fraud and intimidation.'' The 2005 State \nDepartment Country Report on Human Rights Practices states, that in \nEquatorial Guinea, ``Official corruption in all branches of the \ngovernment remained a significant problem.'' In its index of \ncorruption, Transparency International ranks Equatorial Guinea 152 out \nof 159 nations. In other words, Equatorial Guinea is one of the most \ncorrupt countries in the world today.\n  I became familiar with the Obiang regime through my role as ranking \nminority member of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. \nOn July 15, 2004, the subcommittee held a hearing entitled, ``Money \nLaundering and Foreign Corruption: Enforcement and Effectiveness of the \nPatriot Act.'' That hearing and an accompanying report detailed how \nPresident Obiang and his family had been personally profiting from U.S. \noil companies operating in his country, established offshore shell \ncorporations to open bank accounts at Riggs Bank here in Washington, \nand made large deposits, including cash deposits of as much as $3 \nmillion at a time, in transactions suggesting strongly that the funds \nwere the proceeds of foreign corruption. In addition, over $35 million \nin oil proceeds were transferred to suspect offshore accounts.\n  President Bush has stated that his intention is to ``defeat high-\nlevel public corruption in all its forms and to deny corrupt officials \naccess to the international financial system as a means of defrauding \ntheir people and hiding their ill-gotten gains.'' And yet, after it was \nrevealed that Mr. Obiang misused U.S. financial institutions to launder \nsuspect funds, the State Department actually intervened on behalf of \nhis regime in order to convince U.S. banks to open accounts for the \nEquatorial Guinean Government. That bears repeating: after it was shown \nhow Mr. Obiang used Riggs Bank to deposit and transfer suspect funds, \nand after Riggs shut down the accounts used by him and his regime, the \nState Department approached reluctant U.S. banks and asked them to open \naccounts for the Obiang regime. So much for ``denying corrupt officials \naccess to our financial system.''\n  There is more. A few months ago, in May, the administration announced \na new program directing the Defense Department to help 20 specified \ncountries build up their military forces. One was Equatorial Guinea. \nDespite a terrible human rights record, a reputation for corruption, \nand their own oil wealth, the administration proposed spending U.S. \ntaxpayer dollars to build up the Obiang regime's military. Indeed, \nPresident Bush asked for a provision in the DOD authorization bill \napproving the funding. A number of us objected, and Equatorial Guinea \nwas removed from the provision in the Senate bill.\n  These and other actions taken by the administration to court Mr. \nObiang are more than misguided. They supply ammunition to critics of \nAmerica who claim we don't mean what we say and we don't live up to our \nprinciples, especially when oil is at stake. On the issue of foreign \ncorruption, the President needs to play it straight. What will it be? \nWill we avert our eyes from Mr. Obiang's record of corruption and \nbrutality so we can obtain Equatorial Guinea's oil? Or will we demand \nan end to his corrupt ways?\n  The President's courting of Mr. Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan is also \ndisturbing. Mr. Nazarbayev is an iron-fisted dictator who imprisons his \nopponents, bans opposition parties, and controls the press. The State \nDepartment's 2005 Kazakhstan Country Report on Human Rights Practices \nstates that ``the government's human rights record remained poor,'' and \n``corruption remained a serious problem.''\n  That is not all. Several years ago, our Justice Department filed a \ncriminal indictment alleging that Mr. Nazarbayev accepted tens of \nmillions of dollars in bribes from an American businessman. The U.S. \nattorney of the Southern District of New York is at this very moment \npreparing for trial in the case, U.S. v. Giffen. The indictment targets \nthe American businessman, James Giffen, for paying $78 million in \nbribes to Mr. Nazarbayev and his cronies to gain access to an oil field \nin Kazakhstan. It does not charge Mr. Nazarbayev with a crime, despite \nalleging his acceptance of the bribes. It is a sad and sorry spectacle \nto observe that, despite this indictment, the administration is \nwelcoming Mr. Nazarbayev to the White House this week.\n  Talk about mixed messages. For paying the bribes, Mr. Giffen gets \nindicted for violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, mail and wire \nfraud, money laundering, and tax evasion; for accepting the bribes, Mr. \nNazarbayev gets an invitation to the White House. The President has \ninvited to the White House a man who our very own Department of Justice \naccuses of accepting a $78 million bribe. Why? What could be the \nreason, the justification, for this White House invitation? Could it be \nthat Kazakhstan exports 1 million barrels of oil per day?\n  The President has got to play it straight. The State Department says \nMr. Nazarbayev is a dictator who imprisons opponents and disregards \nhuman rights. The Justice Department says he accepted $78 million in \nbribes from one U.S. businessman alone. The President says he is an \nhonored guest. Which is it? Corrupt dictator or honored guest? Surely \nit can't be both.\n  President Bush said that kleptocracy ``threatens our national \ninterest and violates our values.'' He said high-level foreign \ncorruption ``impedes our efforts to promote freedom and democracy, end \npoverty, and combat international crime and terrorism.'' He is right, \nwhich is exactly why his courtship of corrupt dictators like Mr. Obiang \nand Mr. Nazarbayev is so deeply regrettable. To compromise our battle \nagainst corruption to gain favor with oil-producing dictators is not \nonly morally wrong, it hands a propaganda club to our critics, it \nsustains brutal and corrupt regimes, and it is ultimately destructive \nof our efforts, in the words of Secretary Rice, to ``build and sustain \ndemocratic, well-governed states.'\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/26/senate-section/article/S10155-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10155-S10156]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                AGRICULTURE NATURAL DISASTER ASSISTANCE\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak to an issue that is \nvital\n\n[[Page S10156]]\n\nto agricultural producers in my State as well as across our Nation. \nThat issue is agriculture natural disaster assistance. The relentless \ndrought has brought economic hardship to both our agriculture producers \nand our rural communities. Farmers and ranchers in many different parts \nof the United States are suffering the effects of natural disasters.\n  We must not and cannot continue to ignore the impacts of drought and \nthe effect it has on our agricultural producers and our rural \ncommunities. Agricultural producers are every bit as deserving of \nassistance for their suffering from the drought as the small businesses \nsuffering from the hurricanes.\n  We as a nation have a responsibility to provide emergency assistance \nto those who have had losses due to natural disasters. I look forward \nto working with my colleagues to fulfill that responsibility, working \nto support a bill that provides critical emergency relief to our \nNation's agricultural producers. After what I hope will be a healthy \ndebate on this important issue, I ask that a vote be taken on the bill.\n  Too often, the argument is made that farmers and ranchers should be \nsatisfied with the funding they will receive from the farm bill. The \ntruth is that only 18 percent of the total funding in the farm bill \ngoes directly to producers. The rest goes to very important programs, \nsuch as Food Stamps and the Senior Farmers Market Nutrition Program. \nNothing in the farm bill was ever intended to cover losses due to \nnatural disasters. It is only intended to cover economic losses.\n  The same way we use emergency funds to help individuals and rebuild \ncommunities hurt by hurricanes and tornadoes, we should use emergency \nfunds to help individuals and rebuild our communities hurt by drought.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/26/senate-section/article/S10156-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10156]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             WAR ON TERROR\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak for a few minutes in \nmorning business.\n  In August, I received a letter from a constituent, Mr. John Dodgen, \nof Humboldt, IA. Along with the letter, Mr. Dodgen enclosed a copy of \nan opinion piece he authored regarding the war on terror that was \npublished in the local newspaper.\n  In his opinion piece, Mr. Dodgen rightly asserts that the United \nStates is engaged in a global war on terror with an enemy whose goal is \nthe elimination of the United States. I also strongly agree with his \npremise that we must take the fight to the terrorists where they \noperate or we will be forced to confront them on our soil. This is a \nwar that we must win, and we must remain on the offense until the war \nis won.\n  Mr. Dodgen raises some compelling thoughts in his opinion piece. \nRather than try to summarize all of Mr. Dodgen's points and \nrecommendations, I would like to submit for the Record his thoughts on \ncontrolling terrorism.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of Mr. Dodgen's opinion piece \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         Controlling Terrorism\n\n       Our world is made-up of two dramatically opposed factions. \n     Those who enjoy freedom versus those who would enslave the \n     world. This is not a debatable subject--it's an all out world \n     war of ideologies.\n       As a nation of freedom, we are engaged in a conflict that \n     must be won or our world culture will be reduced to the dark \n     ages. We are engaged in a conflict for survival.\n       The nations of Iran, Syria, North Korea, and the terrorists \n     of Hezbollah all seek one objective--the destruction of \n     Israel and the United States. They are like ``mad dogs''. \n     There is no way to reason with them to a peace loving state. \n     The only solution with a rabies infected dog is to destroy \n     it. This same strategy does not apply to all Muslims, only \n     those lunatic, malicious, hateful, and destruction-minded \n     fanatics who declared war on ``infidels'' several years ago. \n     In World War II the allies stopped Hitler, Mussolini and \n     Japan from destroying half the world. Ninety percent of my \n     Navy amphibious group were killed or wounded invading the \n     Philippines and millions of others were killed in tragic \n     World War II.\n       While we still have a chance to stamp out the hate and \n     suicidal destructive force in our world, the U.S. and our \n     allies should confront Iran, Syria, North Korea, and \n     Hezbollah with an ultimatum to destroy their rockets and \n     nuclear warhead pursuits or we will have no alternative but \n     to destroy them ourselves with or without the United Nations \n     blessing. It's totally unrealistic to think that negotiations \n     with these evil nations will solve or alleviate the threat, \n     so we should bring this to a head before they attack any \n     other nations and unleash their evil hatred and destruction \n     on innocent, peace-loving people. We should use every means \n     within our power to reduce their threat to insignificance. \n     There is no other course; we should act now while our \n     declared and profound enemies are vulnerable to our \n     containment. If we wait and try to solve our world's conflict \n     with diplomacy and negotiation, we are fooling ourselves and \n     eventually our nation and our love for freedom and peaceful \n     existence on Earth will be destroyed.\n       In past history, two postures for our nation--The Monroe \n     Doctrine and Teddy Roosevelt's ``Walk Softly And Carry A Big \n     Stick Policy--along with President Kennedy's demand that \n     Russia withdraw rockets with nuclear warheads from Cuba, kept \n     us from wars to maintain our freedom. Now we need to declare \n     and carry out the United States world position that we will \n     not tolerate ``evil and war mongering'' nations, and unless \n     they cease and desist of such a threat they will have the \n     United States and its overwhelming power to force them to do \n     so. We were able to convince Libya to stop its terrorism with \n     a well placed bomb; we can do the same with the other \n     terrorist nations listed.\n       America needs to withdraw from the United Nations as they \n     have utterly failed from their beginning existence to keep \n     the peace or more than temporarily stop aggression and human \n     suffering. What the world needs is for the United States to \n     establish a ``World Peace Council'' made up of: The President \n     of the United States; The Prime Minister of England; Queen \n     Elizabeth and/or Australia's Governor General; The President \n     and/or The Prime Minister of Russia; The President of China; \n     The Emperor and/or Prime Minister of Japan; The President of \n     India.\n       These nations could meet for three days every month to \n     determine the issues requiring their attention, determine the \n     appropriate action, and then enforce their decision based on \n     the majority vote of the council. A veto would be prohibited. \n     Funding would be on an assessed basis from the seven nations \n     plus other voluntary freedom loving nations and a chosen \n     General whose International Police Force would be enlisted on \n     a country by country basis to carry out the seven nations' \n     solution.\n       If any of the nations selected to form the World Peace \n     Council chooses not to serve or withdraws, then the remaining \n     members would select a nation for their replacement. In the \n     case of a tie vote, another candidate would be chosen until a \n     majority vote determined the successor.\n       As a Christian, it is utterly deplorable for me to come to \n     the above conclusion. However; as a practical human being and \n     a concerned U.S. Citizen, I acknowledge that terrorism is a \n     fact that must be recognized and dealt with. I therefore urge \n     our Congress and President to declare an ultimatum on the \n     nations of terrorists and restrain them while we still have \n     the power and resolve to do so. We cannot wait until we have \n     another Pearl Harbor, Cuban Missile Crisis, or 9/11 before we \n     stop this aggression.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/26/senate-section/article/S10156-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10156-S10157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     IN MEMORY OF SEYMOUR ROBINSON\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I ask my colleagues to pay \ntribute to an exceptional man and a wonderful friend of mine, Seymour \nRobinson. Seymour died on September 13 at the age of 90. His deep sense \nof moral and social responsibility and tireless commitment to giving \nback touched the lives of all who knew him.\n  Seymour was born on May 24, 1916, in Chicago, IL. He worked hard to \nsupport his family during the Great Depression. He enlisted in the Army \nAir Corps and was soon transferred to the U.S. Army Infantry in Fort \nWorth, TX. It was here that he met his beloved wife of 60 years, Anita. \nBefore they could marry, he was shipped out to serve in World War II.\n  As a member of the Civil Affairs D Team of the U.S. First Infantry \nDivision, he fought at Omaha Beach during the U.S. landing in Normandy \non D-Day. As part of a U.S. unit attached to the French Second Armored \nDivision, Seymour was involved in the liberation of Paris. After his \nunit captured the German SS barracks on the Place de la Republique in \nParis, it was overrun by cheering crowds; the Jewish people in Paris \nwere finally able to come out of hiding, wearing the yellow stars that \nwere used to segregate them. Of this time, Seymour recounts a powerful \nincident: ``As their enthusiasm settled down, we were asked a \ndevastating question: `What is the will of the Americans. Are we still \nto wear our yellow stars?' Without a second's hesitation, we tore the \nstars off the clothes of\n\n[[Page S10157]]\n\nthose nearest us and put them on our uniforms. The question had floored \nus. We couldn't speak. The word had spread quickly. `We are free!' ''\n  His bravery and courage will never be forgotten. He was awarded three \nBronze Battle Stars by the U.S. and the Croix de Guerre by the French \ngovernment, given to individuals who distinguish themselves heroically \nin acts of bravery against the enemy.\n  Seymour's experience as a World War II veteran helped shape his deep \nsense of responsibility. He said ``This experience reestablished my \nidentity. I am a Jew who knows that I must forever be vigilant about \nthe human rights not only of my people but of all people . . .''\n  After returning to Chicago a war hero, he married Anita on January \n14, 1946. They soon visited California, where Anita's parents lived. As \nAnita recounts their trip, there was ice on the ground in Chicago when \nthey took off and it was 80 degrees in California when they landed; she \nrefused to go back. Seymour and Anita thus ended up in my beautiful \nhome state, where they lived the California dream with their three \nwonderful children: David, Lorraine and Billy.\n  Their children were deeply influenced by their father. Seymour taught \nhis three children that they have a responsibility as Jews and \nAmericans to give back to society and do the right thing.\n  Once in California, Seymour easily found a job first as a steelworker \nand then a typographer. As a typographer, he worked his way up to \nforeman and ended up buying the business, Ad Compositors, which was one \nof the largest of its kind in Southern California. He was a lifelong \nmember of the International Typographical Union. Seymour had previously \nbeen an organizer for the Congress of Industrial Organizations, CIO, \nbefore it became the AFL-CIO.\n  While living in West Los Angeles with his family, Seymour was a \ncofounder and leader of Neighbors United, an organization that worked \nto promote racial harmony and maintain diversity in neighborhoods at a \ntime of racial strife in L.A. He was also active in the Public Affairs \nCommittee of the Westside Jewish Community Center and the Urban Affairs \nCommittee of the Los Angeles Board of Education, working to desegregate \nthe Los Angeles public schools.\n  Seymour helped elect Mayor Tom Bradley, Los Angeles's first African-\nAmerican mayor. Seymour was also involved with the L.A. City Human \nRelations Commission and the Mayor's Advisory Committee.\n  Seymour was President of the Citizen's Advisory Committee for Pan \nPacific Park, helping to coordinate funding for this park. Mayor \nRichard Riordan officially named him the ``Father of Pan Pacific Park'' \nfor his instrumental role in creating this public park on the Westside \nof Los Angeles.\n  Never one to rest on his laurels, in his later years he was active as \nthe Los Angeles County Political Coordinator for the AARP.\n  Seymour Robinson is survived by his beloved wife Anita; his children \nDavid, Lorraine and Billy Robinson; and his granddaughters Rachel and \nMara Woods-Robinson.\n  I am proud to have called Seymour my friend. Seymour was never afraid \nto speak his mind when he saw injustice. He had a deep sense of right \nand wrong and was very persuasive in convincing others to get involved \nin the fight for social justice. He was an inspiration to all who knew \nhim and a hero to this nation. He will be greatly missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/26/senate-section/article/S10157-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING JONATHON SOLOMON\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \nrecognize the life and legacy of a great Native American leader, \nmentor, and friend. This summer, Alaska and the Nation lost Jonathon \nSolomon, a Gwich'in Athabascan elder and lifelong environmental \nadvocate, at the age of 74 in Anchorage. Jonathon's life was dedicated \nto the defense of Native rights, and he was best known throughout the \ncountry for his indefatigable advocacy of Gwich'in lands, most \nespecially the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n  Born in Fort Yukon, Solomon began his advocacy for the Refuge in the \n1970s through his fight for subsistence rights and the protection of \nthe Porcupine caribou herd. This work brought him all over the country, \nincluding numerous trips to Washington DC. I had the special \nopportunity to meet Jonathon during one of these trips, and I quickly \nlearned that he was an eloquent speaker, strong debater, and a \nmasterful advocate. He spoke strongly about the importance of the \nCoastal Plain of the Arctic Refuge, the birthplace of caribou upon \nwhich the Gwich'in have relied for their existence for generations.\n  Jonathon's work will live on through the Gwich'in Steering Committee, \na nonprofit group which he helped to found during the first united \nmeeting of the Gwich'in people in 1988. I am proud to have a part in \ncarrying on Jonathon's legacy through my continued and unwavering \nsupport for the protection of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. \nPlease join me and many others across this Nation in honoring a fallen \nenvironmental hero.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/26/senate-section/article/S10157-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  REMEMBERING DETECTIVE MICHAEL THOMAS\n\n Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, please allow me to take a moment \nto commemorate the loss of a Colorado police officer last week. He was \nkilled in an act of senseless violence, a victim of a random shooting \nwhile he was on duty. Detective Michael Thomas proudly served a 24-year \ncareer with the Aurora Police Department, and had been promoted to \ndetective last April, where he worked on narcotics cases.\n  Mike Thomas graduated from Hinkley High School in Aurora in 1972, and \njoined the U.S. Air Force. There, he became a mechanic for F-16 fighter \nplanes, and eventually wound up working with the Air Force's precision \nflight unit, the Thunderbirds. But after 10 years in the Air Force, \nMike retired, leaving behind his Air Force uniform of service for \nanother: that of the Aurora Police Department.\n  During his career in the patrol and canine units and as a detective, \nDetective Thomas was decorated for service more than 12 times. Among \nthe awards Detective Thomas received was the Medal of Honor, the Aurora \nPolice Department's highest award, in 1992. Detective Thomas received \nthe award for disarming a suspect armed with a knife in October 1991.\n  Aurora Police Chief Daniel Oates said last week, ``There was no one \nwho didn't like Mike Thomas.'' Stories abound of Detective Thomas's \ngenerosity of spirit, his thoughtful nature, and attention to detail \nthat made him such an outstanding policeman. One fellow officer \nrecalled the impression that Thomas made upon him about following \nthrough: after every call, Mike Thomas would make sure to ask those he \nwas helping if they were satisfied with the service he had provided \nthem.\n  Detective Thomas will be interred today at Fort Logan National \nCemetery in Denver. He will be surrounded by his family of the Aurora \nPolice Department, and in the thoughts and prayers of police officers \nand their families around our Nation.\n  To Detective Thomas's daughter, Nicole, I can only offer the profound \nthanks of our community and Nation during this time of grief. Your \nfather's sacrifice for the greater good fills each of us with deep \nrespect and humbles all of us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/26/senate-section/article/S10157-3", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT CHRIS HART\n\n Mr. THUNE.

A bill to invest in innovation and education to improve the \ncompetitiveness of the United States in the global economy; read the \nfirst time.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the National \nCompetitiveness Investment Act of 2006. Unfamiliar as it might sound to \nsome, I am joined by the Democratic Leader, Senator Reid, on this \nimportant legislation.\n  This truly is a bipartisan bill. It reflects the fact that when it \ncomes to our country's economic future, there is wide bipartisan \nsupport for those policies that will keep the United States competitive \nin this ever changing, dynamic, global economy of the 21st century.\n  The bill we are introducing today is a product of many Senators who \nhave come together . . . who put aside political affiliations . . . to \ncraft a broad comprehensive bill. The legislation has evolved over the \ncourse of the 109th Congress.\n  Two years ago, under the leadership of Senators Domenici, Alexander, \nand Bingaman, the Senate Energy Committee asked the National Academies \nwhat were those policies that--if enacted--would enhance the science \nand technology enterprise so that the United States could successfully \ncompete, prosper, and be secure in this new century.\n  Out of that request, the National Academies created a high level \ncommittee of experts headed by the respected former CEO of Lockheed, \nNorm Augustine.\n  Chairman Augustine put the problem in stark terms when he wrote last \nDecember: ``In the five decades since I began working in the aerospace \nindustry, I have never seen American business and academic leaders as \nconcerned about this nation's future prosperity as they are today.''\n  The U.S. today has the strongest scientific and technological \nenterprise in the world, including the best research universities. But \nthere is growing evidence and recognition that our educational system \nis failing in those areas that have directly underpinned our strength--\nscience, engineering, and mathematics. We must invest for the future in \nthose areas if we are to maintain our technological edge in the world.\n\n  The Augustine report entitled ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm'' \ndid identify four broad areas for policy action. These were: 1. \nIncrease the talent pool by improving K-12 science and math education. \n2. Strengthen the Nation's traditional commitment to reseaerch. 3. \nIncrease the talent pool by improving higher education focus on \ntraining math and science teachers. 4. Improve incentives, primarily \nthrough the tax code, for innovation.\n  The President's budget also recognizes the need to target Federal \nresources on those areas that will allow the country to continue to \nlead in innovation.\n  The President's ``American Competitiveness Initiative'' similarly \nfocuses on increasing resources for basic research and science, and by \nfilling gaps in our education competitiveness agenda with expanded \n``Math Now'', Adjunct Teacher Corps, and Advanced Placement and \nInternational Baccalaureate programs.\n  Trying to put all this into one piece of legislation has been a \nchallenge. Indeed, at least three different Senate Committees--Energy, \nCommerce, and HELP--all have jurisdiction over programs and policies in \nthis area. This does not even address tax policies under the \njurisdiction of the Finance Committee.\n  So in July I directed the three major Senate Committees with \nresponsibility for authorizing legislation to combine their various \nproposals into one bill. The bill Senator Reid and I introduce today is \nthe result of a lot of hard work over the summer and August recess \nmonth.\n  First I want to acknowledge the leadership of Senator Ensign, \nChairman of the Commerce Subcommittee on Technology, Innovation, and \nCompetitiveness in helping to produce this legislation.\n  Second, I thank the Chairmen and Ranking Members of Energy, Commerce, \nand the HELP Committees for their dedication to this project--Senators \nDomenici, Bingaman, Stevens, Inouye, Enzi, and Kennedy.\n  Finally, Senators Alexander, Lieberman, Hutchison, Nelson, and \nMikulski have contributed their time and insights into this important \nlegislation and I am sure there are others I have failed to mention.\n  While the legislation does not address all of the issues raised in \nthe various studies--it is doubtful anyone piece of legislation could--\nit nonetheless is a start, it is a good first step, and of course it is \na bipartisan first step.\n  The legislation would, among other things: 1. Authorize a doubling of \nthe funding for basic Federal research over the next 5 years at the \nNational Science Foundation, and significantly expand funding for basic \nresearch at National Institute of Standards and Technology, the \nDepartment of Energy's Office of Science, and NASA. 2. Recruit and \ntrain needed new math and science teachers. 3. Create new Teachers \nInstitutes to improve the teaching techniques for math and science. 4. \nCreate a DOE--DARPA dedicated to the goal of increasing innovation and \ncompetitive breakthroughs in technology. 5. Expand scholarship programs \nto recruit and train math and science teachers at the K-12 level. 6. \nIncrease the number of students taking Advanced Placement courses and \nentering International Baccalaureate programs, and 7. Increase funding \nfor ``early career'' researchers.\n  Authorizations for these programs would total $73 billion over the \nnext five years, less than $2.0 billion above the President's request.\n  When we consider that over the next five years our economy will \nexceed $76 trillion--a 1 percent investment for the future seems a \nsmall price to pay for our continued economic security and leadership \nin the world.\n  This legislation is the correct thing to do for the country's future \neconomic security.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3936\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am proud to join my colleagues from the \nCommerce, Energy, and Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committees \nin introducing the National Innovation Investment Act. This bill \nrepresents the culmination of nearly a year's work by three Committees. \nWe examined the Nation's civilian research and education enterprises \nand their contributions to innovation and economic competitiveness.\n  By the broadest definition, the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation is responsible for the economic and commercial health of \nthe country. We have expertise that touches on multiple fields of \nindustry from telecommunications to transportation; from the safety of \nthe home to the security of the homeland; and from marine containers to \nmarine mammals.\n  At the end of the day, our middle name is ``science,'' and we brought \nthat perspective to this bipartisan effort to use technology and \ninnovation to address emerging challenges to our national economic \ncompetitiveness.\n  The lynchpin of continued innovation that will lead to economic \ncompetitiveness will be educating and inspiring young people to be \neducated and employed in science- and technology-related disciplines. \nThis bill uses educational programs to inspire students from \nkindergarten through graduate school to pursue math and science. It \nalso ensures that the Nation's enterprise research is well-funded and \nfocused on the needs of the Nation.\n  This bill includes a 5-year authorization that would double funding \nfor the National Science Foundation, NSF, and significantly increase \nfunding for the National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST. \nThe Congress has increased funding for NSF before. This time, with the \nhelp of my colleagues and the administration, I hope we can actually \nprovide those dollars to NSF, NIST, and the other priority agencies \noutlined in the bill.\n  I am pleased that the Commerce Committee and this group were able to \ninclude several provisions related to ocean and atmospheric research \nand education. The ocean truly is the last frontier on Earth and ocean \nresearch and technology may have broad implications for improving \nhealth and understanding our environment.\n  The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy recognized this potential in \ntheir final report and dedicated three chapters to recommendations on \nways to improve ocean education, basic research, and technological \ninnovation. Recognizing the allure that the oceans hold for many young \npeople, the Commission viewed ocean education as a tool that could be \nused to increase general science and math literacy in the U.S., and we \nhave incorporated that notion into this bill.\n  The United States can and must remain strong and competitive in the \nface of emerging challenges from the rest of the world. This bill is \nnot the final answer, but it is a starting point. We will begin by \nstrengthening science research and improving education to generate the \nideas that U.S. companies can transform into the next breakthrough \nproduct.\n  I would be remiss if I did not mention that this bill contains input \nfrom the leadership, the Chairs and ranking members of three major \ncommittees, Senators Dominici, Bingaman, Stevens, Enzi, Kennedy, and \nmyself, as well as Senators Ensign, Lieberman, Alexander, Mikulski, \nHutchison, and Bill Nelson.\n  However, the Senate, at large, also must be involved in the process \nof considering and improving the bill. From the beginning, we have been \nassured that the bill would be considered in an open process. I support \nthe bill and look forward to its thorough consideration by the Senate.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, families across America are facing \nserious challenges in today's global economy. The value of their wages \nis declining, the cost of living is going up, and many\n\n[[Page S10184]]\n\nof their jobs are being shipped overseas.\n  We must respond to this challenge to ensure that our citizens can \nachieve the American dream once again. We have the best workers in the \nworld, and we must prepare them to compete and succeed in the global \neconomy.\n  America has long been at the forefront in innovation, invention, and \neducation. But other countries are catching up and surpassing us.\n  We are now ranked 28th out of 40 nations in math education.\n  Since 1975, we have dropped from 3rd to 15th in the world in \nproducing scientists and engineers.\n  A recent report shows that high school and college graduation rates \nin the United States have dropped below the average for other developed \ncountries.\n  Federal investment in research and development has been shrinking as \na share of the economy, and government research programs at the \nNational Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation and the \nDepartment of Energy all have less funding this year than they did \nthree years ago.\n  At the same time, fast-growing countries like China, Ireland and \nSouth Korea are realizing the potential for economic growth that comes \nwith investing in innovation. For example, China's total research and \ndevelopment investments rose from $12.4 billion in 1991 to $84.6 \nbillion in 2003, an average increase of 17 percent a year. Over the \nsame period, the increase in U.S. investment averaged only 4 to 5 \npercent annually.\n  Study after study tells us that we need major new investments in \neducation and research and development to stay ahead. We cannot just \ntinker at the margins and expect to master our own destiny in the \nglobal economy. We have a responsibility to make the investments that \nare necessary to our progress--a responsibility to our families, to our \neconomy, to our Nation, and to our national security.\n  Last year, the Council on Competitiveness urged a focus on lifelong \nskill development--through elementary, secondary and higher education, \nand workforce training and support, as essential to keeping America on \nthe cutting edge of innovation.\n  The recent report by the National Academy of Sciences, ``Rising Above \nthe Gathering Storm,'' emphasized these recommendations. Two of the \nreport's four major recommendations involved education as the solution \nto meeting the global challenge. The report set out a broad roadmap for \nkeeping America competitive, but it prioritized investment in education \nover all other recommendations.\n  The National Association of Manufacturers also issued a report urging \nrenewed focus on education and training to keep American businesses \ncompetitive.\n  It is clear that we must act, and today we are taking a step toward \nputting America back on the right track.\n  I am pleased to join with a bipartisan group of my colleagues today \nto introduce the National Competitiveness Investment Act. It is a \nmodest proposal, but it represents an important down-payment on the \ncommitment and sustained investment needed to keep America competitive \nin the years to come.\n  The legislation responds to many of the recommendations in the \n``Gathering Storm'' and other recent reports and includes many \nprovisions based on those in the Right TRACK Act, which I introduced \nearlier this year.\n  The bill takes important steps to encourage innovation in America as \na way to create jobs and move our economy forward. It is often \nfederally funded research that primes the pump for technological, \nmedical and scientific breakthroughs, and the bill doubles basic \nresearch funding by the National Science Foundation over the next five \nyears. It also puts us on a strong course to doubling basic research \nfunding at the Department of Energy as well.\n  The legislation also creates a President's Council on Innovation and \nCompetitiveness, based on successful models being used in established \nand emerging economies in Europe and Asia. The council will bring \ntogether the heads of Federal agencies with leaders in business and \nacademia to develop a comprehensive agenda to promote innovation. Japan \nfor some time has had a similar council, and Ireland, known as the \nCeltic Tiger, has already had success in expanding its R strength \nsince it established its council last year.\n  The bill also strengthens programs at college and universities to \nencourage a renewed interest in nuclear science. Massachusetts has long \nbeen a leader in nuclear research. There are only three dozen licensed \nnuclear reactors in the United States, and three of them are located at \nMassachusetts universities--University of Massachusetts Lowell, \nWorcester Polytechnic Institute and MIT. These colleges will have a \nvital role as nuclear science expands, and this bill will help expand \ntheir programs and establish new ones to meet the growing demand.\n  These are important investments, but there is more we can do. We \nshould act to renew the research and development tax credit as soon as \npossible. The incentive provided by the tax credit has led to quality \njobs, better, safer products, greater productivity and a stronger, more \nrobust national economy. A growing number of countries who recognize \nthe importance of research and development spending to future economic \ngrowth now offer more generous R tax incentives than the United \nStates. The top 6 pharmaceutical companies, and American high tech \ncompanies like Microsoft, Intel and GE have all opened advanced R \nfacilities in India. We must give American companies the certainty that \nthese incentives will continue to be there, so that they can choose to \nmaintain these high-skilled jobs here at home, to keep America at the \ncutting edge as a leader in innovation in the global economy.\n  These investments also depend on a talented pool of well-trained \nindividuals who can make discoveries and scientific breakthroughs. Jobs \nin science and engineering are expected to increase 70 percent faster \nthan those in other fields over the next 6 years. To ensure Americans \nare prepared to hold these jobs, we must improve education at all \nlevels--from the very early years in a child's life all the way through \ndoctoral study and beyond--especially in math, science, engineering and \ntechnology.\n  Although international comparisons of student achievement show that \nthe United States is slipping behind other countries, a closer look \nshows that the picture is more complex. The real problem lies in the \nserious and pervasive achievement gap in this country between higher \nincome students and lower income students.\n  On the most recent test comparing student achievement in \nindustrialized nations, white students in the United States performed \nbetter than the average for all countries in both math literacy and \nproblem solving, while their Hispanic and African American peers did \nworse. Low-income students in the U.S. performed worse than their high-\nincome peers, and also performed worse than other low-income students \nin over half of the developed countries surveyed.\n  If we close this achievement gap, and guarantee all children in this \ncountry a world-class education, we can put America back at the top of \nthe list. To do so, we should fully fund the No Child Left Behind Act.\n  We must also invest in teachers. The National Competitiveness \nInvestment Act recognizes and responds to the critical need to recruit \nand train high quality math, science, technology and engineering \nteachers to teach in the schools with the greatest need so that we can \nbegin to close the achievement gap and ensure that all American \nstudents can compete on a level playing field with their peers in other \nnations.\n  Research shows that having a high quality teacher is one of the most \nimportant factors in a child's success in school. But almost half of \nmath classes taught in high poverty and high minority schools are \ntaught by teachers without a college major or minor in math or a \nrelated field, such as math education, physics or engineering. The \nproblem is even more serious in middle schools--70 percent of math \nclasses in these schools are taught by a teacher who doesn't even have \na minor in math or a related field.\n  The bill provides a 10-fold increase in the Robert Noyce Teacher \nScholarship program at the National Science Foundation to recruit math, \nscience, engineering and technology students and professionals to \nbecome teachers in high need school districts.\n\n[[Page S10185]]\n\n  It provides grants to institutions of higher education to create \nundergraduate programs that integrate the study of math, science, \nengineering, or critical need foreign language with teacher education, \nmodeled on the successful U-Teach program at the University of Texas. \nIt also helps institutions create part-time master's degree programs to \nimprove the content knowledge and teaching skills of current teachers. \nIn both of these programs, universities would partner with high-need \nschool districts to ensure that these resources will go where they are \nneeded most.\n  The bill expands the Teacher Institutes for the 21st Century program \nat the National Science Foundation to provide cutting-edge summer \nprofessional development programs for teachers who teach in high-need \nschools. It also creates a summer institute program in the Department \nof Energy to strengthen the math and science teaching skills of \nelementary and secondary school teachers.\n  Recruitment and training are the first steps, but we must also do \nmore to see that teachers have an incentive to stay in classrooms once \nthey are there. We should provide financial incentives--through \nfellowships or salary increases--to teachers who commit to teach in the \nhighest need schools, where the unique challenges make the schools the \nhardest to staff. I look forward to working with my colleagues as the \nbill moves forward to add this critical component to the effort.\n  In addition to providing a high quality teacher in every classroom, \nwe must also ensure that children in low income school districts have \naccess to the same college preparatory classes that more affluent \nschool districts are able to provide--and, importantly, that they have \nthe preparation they need to succeed in those classes. To do so, the \nbill expands access to Advanced Placement and International \nBaccalaureate classes as well as pre-AP and pre-IB courses, especially \nin high need schools, and creates a program to improve instruction in \nmath for elementary and middle school students and provide targeted \nhelp to students struggling with the subject.\n  The bill also addresses the critical need to ensure our education \nsystem is preparing students for the challenges they face after \ngraduation from high school. According to a recent study, the Nation \nloses over $3.7 billion a year in the cost of remedial education and \nlost earning potential because students are not adequately prepared to \nenter college when they leave high school.\n  Many States have recognized the need to better align elementary and \nsecondary school standards, curricula, and assessments with the demands \nof college, the 21st century workforce and the Armed Forces. This bill \nprovides grants to assist States in those efforts. The grants would \nsupport state PreK-16 councils that bring together stakeholders from \nall levels of the education community, from the business sector, and \nfrom the military to improve the rigor of elementary and secondary \neducation and prepare students for the postsecondary challenges they \nwill face.\n\n  These provisions will help spur the development of more rigorous \nstandards and innovative curricula that engages our children in \nlearning to inspire a new generation of scientists and engineers. It \nwill assist states in the work they are doing to create new disciplines \nin engineering and technology at the elementary school level that allow \nstudents to learn the practical applications of math and science. I am \nproud that the National Center for Technological Literacy at the Museum \nof Science, Boston is at the forefront of these efforts.\n  In addition to the education programs at the Department of Education \nand the National Science Foundation, the legislation relies on the \nresources of the Department of Energy to assist in the effort to \nimprove math and science education. The National Labs at the Department \nof Energy can have a critical role in these efforts, and so can the \nmore than 300 colleges and universities across the country conducting \nresearch supported by the Department of Energy. I appreciate my \ncolleagues' efforts to ensure that the resources of the Department of \nEnergy are used to enhance educational opportunities for children not \nonly in the states that host National Labs, but across the country.\n  It is also becoming increasingly important for students to become \nexposed to and immersed in critical foreign languages and cultures. In \nrecent years, foreign language needs have significantly increased \nthroughout the public and private sector due to the presence of a wider \nrange of security threats, the emergence of new nation states, and the \nglobalization of the U.S. economy. American businesses increasingly \nneed employees experienced in foreign languages and international \ncultures to manage a culturally diverse workforce. But if students are \nto become proficient in these critical foreign languages, they must \nhave access to a sustained course of study, beginning in the early \ngrades.\n  To address these needs, the bill provides grants to enable \ninstitutions of higher education and local educational agencies working \nin partnership to create programs of study in critical foreign \nlanguages for students from elementary school through postsecondary \neducation.\n  All of these programs and investments will help prepare our students \nto compete in the 21st century, but if we are serious about keeping \nAmerica competitive, there is more we can and must--do.\n  A college degree is fast becoming the price of admission to \nparticipation in the global economy. Eighty percent of the fastest \ngrowing jobs in this country will require some postsecondary education. \nA recent study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and \nDevelopment shows that in the United States, earnings of people with a \npost-secondary degree are 72 percent higher on average than for those \nwith only a high school diploma.\n  But with soaring costs and stagnant financial aid, college is \nincreasingly out of reach for students and families. Research shows \nthat 400,000 students a year do not go to a four year college because \nthey cannot afford it.\n  When our troops returned home from World War II, we created the GI \nBill and sent them to college to learn the skills they would need in \nthe changing world. The economy reaped an estimated $7 in benefit for \nevery dollar invested in that effort.\n  In recent decades however, Federal grant aid has dwindled and the \ngrants provided don't go as far as they used to. Thirty years ago, 77 \npercent of the federal assistance provided to students was in the form \nof grants, but in recent years it's 20 percent. The Pell Grant now \ncovers less than 35 percent of the cost of attending college.\n  To ensure the prosperity of our families and the nation, we must open \nthe doors of college to all by restoring the Pell Grant as the \nfoundation of the student aid system.\n  Earlier this year, Congress squandered an opportunity to \nsignificantly increase aid for low income students. The Senate passed a \nbill that would have immediately increased the Pell grant from $4,050 \nto $4,500. But this increase was rejected, and the funds instead were \nused to pay for tax giveaways for the wealthiest Americans.\n  I know many of my colleagues agree that higher education is the key \nto keeping America competitive, and I look forward to working with them \nto ensure that the cost of college is not a barrier to full \nparticipation in the new economy.\n  We must also do more to address the devastating impacts of the global \neconomy on American workers and their families.\n  American workers are facing global competition that is fundamentally \nunfair, but this bill does nothing to level the playing field or to \nhelp ease the burden of their transition to the global economy. To \ntruly improve our national competitiveness, we must address all aspects \nof this challenge. We cannot continue to ignore the plight of working \nAmericans.\n  First, we need to level the playing field in the competition for good \njobs. Americans have nothing to fear from competition that's fair. But \nit's not fair when Americans are competing with foreign workers who \nlack even basic labor standards, like child labor laws, a minimum wage, \nor the right to organize. And it's not fair when companies cut costs by \nexploiting and abusing foreign workers.\n  We need to exercise global leadership in promoting fair wages and \nsafe working conditions for workers around the\n\n[[Page S10186]]\n\nworld, reward companies that treat their foreign workforces fairly, and \nbe a strong voice in sanctioning those countries that will not play by \nthe rules\n  Beyond these basic steps to level the playing field, we owe a \nparticular duty to those American workers who are losing their jobs \nbecause of trade. We all benefit from the lower prices and variety of \nproducts that globalization provides, but many of our most vulnerable \nworkers are paying the price. In the manufacturing sector alone, we've \nlost nearly 3 million manufacturing jobs since 2001, and service sector \njobs are now moving overseas as well. These are good, middle-class \njobs, with decent wages and benefits that form the core of the American \nmiddle class.\n  Our response to globalization must address the disappearance of good \njobs. We must create the good jobs of the future. We must eliminate tax \nincentives for companies to ship jobs overseas. We must give workers \nwho are at risk of losing their jobs to overseas competition fair \nwarning so that they can plan for their futures. We must strengthen our \ncommitment to help workers who lose their jobs adjust to the new \neconomy, with well-funded training and income assistance programs that \nease the transition to new employment.\n  Fulfilling our commitment to American workers also demands that we \ngive them their fair share of the economic growth that globalization \nbrings. We must raise the minimum wage to $7.25 an hour, and give \nworkers a stronger voice in the new economy by protecting their right \nto organize and form a union.\n  If we truly want to be competitive in the global economy, we need to \naddress these challenges facing the American workforce head on, and \ngive workers greater job security in the present, and better \nopportunities in the future. I hope that the same bipartisan coalition \nthat has worked together so effectively on this bill can also work \ntogether to address these important issues for America's working \nfamilies.\n  The legislation we are introducing today is not a complete package. \nIt represents only the beginning of a strong commitment that we will \nneed to build on and sustain if America is to remain competitive in the \nyears ahead. I am proud that the bill has strong bipartisan support, \nand that support is critical to ensuring these proposals become a \nreality.\n  In 2001, there was strong bipartisan support to significantly \nincrease funding to improve our schools through the No Child Left \nBehind Act. But President Bush's budget this year would mean a \ncumulative shortfall of $56 billion in funding since that bill was \nenacted, and this year he proposed cutting education funding by $2 \nbillion.\n  In 2002, we promised to double NSF funding, but last year's \nappropriation was only two-thirds the level we agreed to four years \nago--nearly $3 billion short of staying on track to that goal.\n  Words alone will not keep America competitive. This legislation must \nbe more than a promise. I look forward to working with my colleagues as \nthe bill moves forward to ensure that Congress provides the new \ninvestments needed to fully support these important proposals.\n  Americans know how to rise to challenges and come out ahead. We've \ndone it before and we can do it again. When we were called into action \nin 1957 with the Soviet Sputnik launch, we rose to the challenge by \npassing the National Defense Education Act and inspiring the nation to \nensure that the first footprint on the moon was by an American. We \ndoubled the federal investment in education.\n  We need the same bold commitment to help the current generation meet \nand master the global challenges of today and tomorrow. The National \nCompetitiveness Investment Act will start to put America back on track. \nI look forward to working with my colleagues to improve upon the bill \nas it moves forward and to expand on these efforts in the months to \ncome.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, several of my colleagues and I have \njoined with the Senate leadership today in introducing important \nlegislation to address the challenges of innovation and competitiveness \nthat our Nation faces. Among the provisions of this legislation is the \nrecognition and expansion of the significant role that NASA plays in \nour Nation's search for knowledge and excellence.\n  NASA already has an outstanding track record of achievement in this \narea. That record exists because individuals and organizations within \nNASA have taken the initiative over the years to reach for excellence \nin their work, just as the agency has sought to reach the stars. I am \nespecially proud that the Johnson Space Center in Houston has played a \nleading role in these efforts. We all know that it takes dedicated and \ninspired people to make things happen in any great undertaking.\n  I would like to recognize the dedicated efforts of one of those \npeople, Gregory W. Hayes, who is retiring at the end of the month from \nNASA after nearly 34 years at the agency and nearly 25 years of \nsupervisory and managerial experience at the Johnson Space Center in \nHouston.\n  Mr. Hayes has made significant and lasting contributions to the \nNation's civilian space agency. A few examples will illustrate how the \nAmerican taxpayer has benefited from Mr. Hayes' distinguished public \nservice career:\n  His commitment to innovative management of the center's human \nresources over the decades, including the selection and recruitment of \nour astronauts as well as the pursuit of innovative workforce \npractices, has contributed to ensuring that JSC attracts the best and \nbrightest from the Nation's technical talent pool.\n  His lifelong dedication to encouraging young people's interest in \nspace exploration has taken many forms including partnering with a \nlocal Houston school district to develop a new program in which more \nthan 100 JSC employees volunteer to serve as technical advisors to \nlocal schools for math, science, and technology.\n  His instrumental role in establishing the Aerospace Academy--a \npartnership among community educational systems that helps to increase \nthe number of technical employees and the number of math and science \nteachers in the area.\n  His collaboration with the State of Texas to secure funding for the \nTexas Aerospace Scholars, a program designed to provide hands-on \nexperience at JSC to high school and college students that will ensure \nthe development of a technical workforce ready for the challenges of \nthe 21st century.\n  Mr. Hayes also set a compelling example for his colleagues by \nreaching out to the local community. He served on the Bay Area Houston \nEconomic Partnership board for several years, as well as serving as an \nadvisor on its various task forces; his work promoted the health of the \ncommunity and the Nation's space program.\n  In recognition of Mr. Hayes' formidable leadership skills, it is not \nsurprising that the Office of the NASA Administrator recruited him to \ntake a leadership role in establishing and executing the agency's path-\nfinding effort known as the Freedom to Manage, F2M, Task Force for \nHuman Resources. That activity was designed to fulfill the President's \nManagement Agenda charter to identify and remove impediments to \nefficient and effective ways of doing business. In the course of its \nwork, the task force identified more than 100 potential areas for \nimprovement in human resources--dozens of which were immediately \nimplemented through changes to internal policies and practices.\n\n  In addition to his extraordinary contributions to the, human \nresources and education fields, Mr. Hayes, in his capacity as JSC \nDirector of External Relations, demonstrated great initiative and \nvision in his efforts to proactively reach out to the emerging \ncommercial space sector and seek innovative collaborative arrangements. \nRecent examples include his efforts to pursue cooperative agreements \nwith companies such as Bigelow Aerospace, which this past summer \nlaunched a pioneering low earth orbiting expandable habitat and has \nopened a satellite office near JSC; as well as an engineering \ncollaboration with SpaceX--one of the winners of the recently concluded \nCOTS awards. These are but two examples of several other significant \npartnerships with the entrepreneurial space sector that Mr. Hayes has \npursued.\n  These activities not only support the expanding efforts to enhance \ninnovation and competitiveness but are also consistent with the NASA \nAuthorization Act which I introduced last year and which was signed \ninto law last December. This act strongly encourages\n\n[[Page S10187]]\n\nthe pursuit of partnerships with the commercial space sector. Mr. Hayes \nhas left a legacy for his successors as they continue policies of \nencouraging effective partnerships with the emerging commercial space \nindustry.\n  Given his impressive record as public servant, it is not surprising \nthat Mr. Hayes has been the recipient of the Presidential Meritorious \nExecutive Rank Award as well as NASA's Outstanding Leadership Medal.\n  On the occasion of Mr. Hayes' departure from his beloved NASA, he can \nleave knowing that he has left a remarkable record of accomplishment. \nHe serves as an inspiration to NASA's next generation of space leaders \nwho will ensure that the agency utilizes the space shuttle and \nInternational Space Station to the fullest extent possible, while \ndeveloping the next generation human space transportation system and \nlaying the groundwork for the agency's new human space exploration \ngoals of returning to the Moon and then moving on to Mars.\n  I know I speak for many of my colleagues in paying tribute to the \nkind of dedication and excellence Mr. Hayes has brought to his \ngovernment service and in wishing him continued success as he enters a \nwell-deserved new chapter in his remarkable life.\n  Mr. President, I am delighted to join our distinguished majority and \nminority leaders in introducing and cosponsoring the National \nCompetitiveness Investment Act. This is an essential and important \nfirst step in addressing critical challenges facing our Nation in an \nincreasingly competitive global economy. America must be a leader in \nscientific research and education. It is in the best interest of both \nour national and economic security.\n  This bill renews and expands our national focus on strengthening key \nareas of research, education, and innovation. It is the product of a \ntruly bipartisan effort, undertaken with the blessing and encouragement \nof the Senate leadership and by the leadership of the three principal \ncommittees with jurisdiction over these matters: the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation, the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources, and the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions. I am proud to be part of this bipartisan initiative to \nprovide new resources to support these competitiveness programs.\n  This legislation increases research investment by doubling the \nauthorized funding levels for the National Science Foundation, NSF, \nfrom approximately $5.6 billion in fiscal year 2006 to $11.2 billion in \nfiscal year 2011. It doubles funding for the Department of Energy's \nOffice of Science over 5 years, from $3.6 billion in Fiscal Year 2006 \nto over $5.2 billion in Fiscal Year 2011.\n  Another vital focus of the bill is to strengthen educational \nopportunities in science, technology, engineering, mathematics and \ncritical foreign languages. It authorizes competitive grants to States \nto promote better coordination of elementary and secondary education \nwith the knowledge and skills needed for success in postsecondary \neducation, the workforce, and the U.S. Armed Forces. Another key \nemphasis is strengthening the skills of thousands of math and science \nteachers through support for the Teachers Institutes for the 21st \nCentury Program at NSF.\n  As chair of the Science and Space Subcommittee of the Commerce \nCommittee, I am especially pleased that this legislation ensures that \nboth NASA and NSF are able to expand their strong traditional roles in \nfostering technological and scientific excellence. The language we have \ncrafted increases essential NASA funding to support basic research and \nfoster new innovation by calling for full use of existing budget \nauthority that we provided within the 2005 NASA Authorization Act. \nUnder the terms of this legislation, the President could request an \nadditional $1.4 billion dollars in Fiscal Year 2008 for application \ntoward these activities. By directing NASA's full participation in \ninteragency efforts for competitiveness and innovation--under the more \nwidely known term of the American Competitiveness Initiative--this \nlegislation points the way for the administration to now make use of \nthat additional authority in supporting projects that can help meet \nthese important competitiveness and innovation goals.\n  Mr. President, this bill represents an important first step in our \nefforts to meet the increasing challenges to our Nation's competitive \nposture. I encourage all of my colleagues to join in cosponsoring this \nbill and working with us at the appropriate time to ensure its passage \nby this body and its enactment into law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAPO:\n  S. 3938. An original bill to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank of \nthe United States; from the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs; placed on the calendar.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I want to thank my fellow Banking Committee \nmembers for working with me to reauthorize and reform the Export-Import \nBank that reflects broad bipartisan agreement among our Committee. I am \nespecially appreciative to Chairman Shelby, Ranking Member Sarbanes, \nSenator Bayh, and their staffs for all their diligence and hard work.\n  The Export-Import Bank is the official export credit agency of the \nUnited States and the current authorization ends on September 30. \nFinancing is a key element in global trade competition and extending \nthe Bank's programs for five years is a vital and integral component in \nsupporting the export of American-made goods and American provided \nservices for both small and large companies.\n  At the same time we need to ensure that the Bank's support for \ntransactions not only helps U.S. exports but does not negatively impact \ndomestic companies. The current system still has problems, which has \nbeen demonstrated on loan guarantees involving semiconductors, steel, \nethanol, and soda ash. This legislation seeks to improve the process by \nmaking it more predictable, transparent, and by involving interested \nstakeholders in the process. First, it would require the Bank to \nmaintain a list of sensitive areas where export financing is unlikely \nto be provided. Second, it requires detailed information to the public \nregarding the proposed financing at an early stage and in an adequate \nway so that input can be brought to bear by those who have the \nexpertise on the specific proposal and industries involved. Third, it \nestablishes protections against circumvention of U.S. trade remedy \norders.\n  There is also a lot of concern that the Bank has not met its 20 \npercent small business mandate and this legislation builds upon \nstructural changes to make sure the small business community has an \nadvocate to advance its needs and address its concerns. First, it \nestablishes a Small Business Division, headed by a Senior Vice \nPresident who reports directly to the Bank President. Second, it \nestablishes a Small Business Committee, chaired by the Senior Vice \nPresident of the Small Business Division. Third, it requires Ex-Im to \nauthorize banks to process medium-term transactions on behalf of Ex-Im \nto facilitate the approval of such transactions.\n  Additionally this section would also require that Ex-Im's Senior Vice \nPresident be notified of any staff recommendations for denial or \nwithdrawal of an application for support involving a small business at \nleast two days prior to a final decision. I would like to thank Senator \nHagel for his work to make sure that Ex-Im does not deny small business \ntransactions without giving the Senior Vice President for small \nbusiness an opportunity to advocate on behalf of the small businesses.\n  Due to Senator Hagel's efforts, Ex-Im has pledged that it will \nfurther strengthen this notification provision by administratively \ngranting the Senior Vice President of the Small Business Division the \nauthority to request an additional two days to review notices of staff \nrecommendations for denial or withdrawal.\n  Finally, the legislation clarifies that case-by-case decisions on \nwhether to award tied aid credits shall be made by the Board of \nDirectors of Ex-Im, subject to a veto by the President of the United \nStates. It is very troubling that no tied aid has been approved since \nthe last reauthorization.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S10188]]\n\n                                S. 3938\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to fully \nallow students to live in units eligible for the low-income housing \ncredit, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will allow families across the country to climb the economic \nladder of success without fear of losing their affordable housing.\n  The Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program is currently the \nlargest Federal program for producing new affordable rental housing. It \nis also a\n\n[[Page S10190]]\n\n``go-to'' program for preserving and revitalizing aging HUD and rural \nproperties. As this program becomes an increasingly important option \nfor serving the housing needs of low-income families, there is an \nunintended nuance in the occupancy requirements that must be addressed.\n  When Congress created the LIHTC, it properly intended that this \nhousing should be available to low-income families in need of an \naffordable apartment. Congress included strict occupancy restrictions \nto ensure that these properties did not become cheap off-campus housing \nfor college students. Therefore, households made up entirely of full-\ntime students were prohibited from living in LIHTC apartments. Only \nfour narrow exceptions exist for families: those who are receiving \nTemporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF); those enrolled in a \nFederal, State or local job training program; single parents and their \nchildren, provided that such parents and children are not dependents of \nanother individual; or married full-time students who file a joint \nreturn.\n  While well-intentioned, the occupancy restrictions for full-time \nstudent households are penalizing low-income families trying to get \nahead. One of the most common unintended consequences of the current \npolicy is that it disqualifies from LIHTC eligibility single parents \nwho have returned to school full-time and have school-aged children. \nUnder the current law, children in grades K-12 count toward the \ndetermination of whether family is a full-time student household. \nTherefore, a single mother who has returned to school full-time and \nwhose children, in grades K-12, were claimed as dependents on the ex-\nhusband's tax return becomes ineligible for LIHTC housing. This family \ncannot be allowed to move into the unit or, if they live there already, \nthey have to move out. This policy is just plain wrong, and it needs to \nbe corrected. It is also contrary to the No Child Left Behind Act's \ncommitment to ensure our children receive a quality education. Low-\nincome families should not have to choose between obeying the law by \neducating children or losing their housing. And it is not just students \nenrolled in four-year programs who have been disqualified from LIHTC \neligibility. Working adults trying to complete the requirements for a \nhigh school education have also been adversely affected. Even an \nelderly adult pursuing a GED can be denied occupancy in a LIHTC \napartment or lose their eligibility to remain in the unit.\n  Whenever practical, affordable housing should be used as a stepping \nstone to self-sufficiency. This bill updates the LIHTC program so that \nlow-income families can achieve the education necessary to land higher-\npaying jobs and eventually own a home or rent a market-rate apartment. \nIt makes three specific statutory changes which specify that minor \nchildren in grades K-12 should not count toward the determination of \nwho is a full-time student household; it strikes the requirement that \nsingle parents and their children must not have been claimed as \ndependents of another individual to qualify for the single parent with \nchildren exemption; and it adds a new exemption for working adults who \nare full-time students pursuing a high school diploma or GED.\n  These updates are consistent with the original legislative intent of \nthe student restrictions. At the same time, they recognize current \neconomic and workplace realities and the role of education in \nencouraging self-sufficiency. I ask for my colleagues' support to move \nthis legislation forward.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself and Mr. Menendez):\n  S. 3942. A bill to establish the Paterson Great Falls National Park \nin the State of New Jersey, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today with great pride to \nintroduce legislation which would create a national park in my \nhometown, Paterson, NJ. The Paterson Great Falls National Park Act of \n2006 would bring long-deserved recognition and accessibility to one of \nour Nation's most beautiful and historic landmarks. I am pleased that \nmy colleague from New Jersey, Senator Menendez, is cosponsoring this \nlegislation.\n  The Great Falls are located where the Passaic River drops nearly 80 \nfeet straight down, on its course towards New York Harbor. It is one of \nthe tallest and most spectacular waterfalls on the east coast, but the \nincredible natural beauty of the falls should not overshadow its \ntremendous importance as the powerhouse of industry in New Jersey and \nthe infant United States. Indeed, in 1778, Alexander Hamilton visited \nthe Great Falls and immediately realized the potential of the falls for \nindustrial applications and development. Hamilton was instrumental in \ncreating the planned community in Paterson--the first of its kind \nnationwide--centered on the Great Falls, and industry thrived on the \npower generated by the falls. Rogers Locomotive Works, the premier \nsteam locomotive manufacturer of the 19th century, was located in the \nshadow of the falls, as were many other vitally important manufacturing \nenterprises.\n  President Ford recognized the importance of the area by declaring the \nfalls and its surroundings a ``National Historic Landmark'' in 1976; he \ncalled the falls ``a symbol of the industrial might which helps to make \nthe United States the most powerful nation in the world.'' Now, it is \ntime that we recognize the importance of this historic area by making \nit New Jersey's first national park. This would be of special \nimportance because so few of our national parks are in urban areas. I \nbelieve that it is time we acknowledge that many of our most \nsignificant national treasures are located in densely populated areas.\n  Mr. President, I grew up in Paterson, and I have appreciated the \nmajesty and beauty of the Great Falls for many years. By creating a \nnational park in Paterson, more Americans can be exposed to the \nexceptional cultural, natural, and historic significance of the Great \nFalls, and that is why I will passionately advocate for the passage of \nthis bill. I have been delighted to work with my good friend, \nCongressman Bill Pascrell--another longtime resident of Paterson--on \nthis issue and with a bipartisan group of lawmakers from my home State, \nall of whom believe strongly in this cause. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the passage of this legislation, which is so important to New \nJersey and all of America.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mr. Menendez, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. \n        Schumer, Mr. Obama, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Nelson of Florida):\n  S. 3944. A bill to provide for a one year extension of programs under \ntitle XXVI of the Public Health Service Act; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to talk about my bill to \nprovide a temporary reauthorization of the Ryan White Care Act.\n  I want to thank my colleagues, Senators Menendez, Clinton, Schumer, \nObama, Durbin, and Bill Nelson, for cosponsoring this important and \nlife-saving measure.\n  I was an original cosponsor of the Ryan White CARE Act and I have \nbeen an active supporter of this legislation for many years now. Never \nhave I been as concerned about the future as I am right now.\n  The Ryan White CARE Act Reauthorization legislation that has been \nproposed in both the House and the Senate actually attempts to shift \nalready inadequate Ryan White money away from States like New Jersey, \nwhere the epidemic first appeared and the need is still growing, to \nStates where the epidemic is emerging.\n  The Committee bill pits cities against cities, States against States, \nwomen against men, and urban areas against rural. This is not the way \nto go. We need to fully fund the Ryan White CARE Act to realize the \npromise of its original intentions.\n  Today I am introducing an alternative bill to reauthorize Ryan White. \nMy bill has something for everyone in it. This legislation to \nreauthorize the Ryan White Care Act includes provisions that would help \nremedy funding disparities and permit a temporary extension to allow \nnegotiations to continue.\n\n  My bill would simply extend current law through Fiscal Year 2007. \nAdditionally it would provide for a 3.7 percent increase in \nauthorizations over the 2006 amounts to account for inflation. \nImportantly, my bill also protects States\n\n[[Page S10191]]\n\nthat have not yet transitioned to ``names based'' reporting for HIV \ncases by giving them an extra year to make that change. Without this \nprotection these States would lose significant money.\n  Finally, I recognize the need of those States who have a growing \nincidence of HIV, which is why I include a one-time emergency \nauthorization of $30 million to be distributed to those States who have \nunmet need and no Title I entities.\n  The original Ryan White CARE Act provides critical funding to help \nprovide health care and support services for low-income individuals and \nfamilies affected by HIV or AIDS. Since its enactment in 1990, Ryan \nWhite funds have helped millions of HIV/AIDS patients receive the care \nand treatment services they need to live healthy and productive lives.\n  The Senate and House bills to reauthorize the Ryan White Care Act are \nnamed the ``Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Modernization Act.'' \nIronically, it does not modernize the care of folks living with HIV/\nAIDS in our communities. Rather, it will bring us back to the early \n1990s when the disease was spreading even more rampantly than it is \nnow, and people were dying quickly.\n  I know firsthand that many of the stakeholder groups, those people \nwho are on the ground providing and receiving services funded by the \nRyan White CARE Act, are terrified of what will happen to our system of \ncare should this reauthorization move forward.\n  In my home State of New Jersey, we have the highest proportion of \ncumulative AIDS cases in women, and we rank third in cumulative \npediatric AIDS cases. Furthermore, we have consistently ranked fifth in \noverall cumulative AIDS cases since the beginning of this epidemic. And \nyet, under the reauthorization proposal we stand to lose millions of \ndollars.\n  That is unacceptable. It is not acceptable for us simply to say that \nthis is a formula fight and there will undoubtedly be winners and \nlosers. With the Ryan White CARE Act, when we talk about losers, we are \ntalking about lives being lost. I, for one, am not willing to settle \nfor such an outcome.\n  It's not just my State that stands to lose money, either. New York, \nFlorida, and Illinois all stand to lose millions of dollars under this \nproposal. All those states that have substantial need.\n  My bill is clearly not meant to be a permanent substitute for \nreauthorizing Ryan White. It is meant to give us all more time to \ncontinue our negotiations and try to work out a compromise that may \nkeep all of our systems of care in tact.\n  I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3944\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ONE-YEAR EXTENSION OF PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Authorizations of Appropriations for Fiscal Year \n     2007.--Notwithstanding any provision of title XXVI of the \n     Public Health Service Act:\n       (1) For the purpose of carrying out part A of such title, \n     there is authorized to be appropriated $634,209,704 for \n     fiscal year 2007.\n       (2) For the purpose of carrying out part B of such title, \n     there is authorized to be appropriated $1,247,000,000 for \n     fiscal year 2007.\n       (3) For the purpose of grants to States that demonstrate \n     unmet needs with respect to HIV/AIDS and that do not have any \n     areas that receive grants under part A of such title for \n     fiscal year 2007, there is authorized to be appropriated \n     $30,000,000 for fiscal year 2007.\n       (4) For the purpose of carrying out part C of such title, \n     there is authorized to be appropriated $218,600,000 for \n     fiscal year 2007.\n       (5) For the purpose of carrying out part D of such title, \n     there is authorized to be appropriated $75,385,648 for fiscal \n     year 2007.\n       (6) For purposes of AIDS Education and Training Centers \n     under section 2692 of part F of such title, there is \n     authorized to be appropriated $35,983,900 for fiscal year \n     2007.\n       (7) For purposes of dental programs under section 2692 of \n     part F of such title, there is authorized to be appropriated \n     $13,570,182 for fiscal year 2007.\n\n     Amounts appropriated under this subsection are available to \n     the Secretary until the end of fiscal year 2009.\n       (b) Names-Based Reporting of Cases; Other Changes Regarding \n     Methodology for Counting Cases.--Notwithstanding any \n     provision of title XXVI of the Public Health Service Act, the \n     Secretary may not, in determining the amounts of formula \n     grants under such title for fiscal year 2007, use a \n     methodology for counting the number of cases of acquired \n     immune deficiency syndrome, or the number of cases of HIV, \n     that is different than the methodology used by the Secretary \n     for such purposes for fiscal year 2006.\n       (c) Definitions.--For purposes of this section, the terms \n     ``HIV'' and ``Secretary'' have the meanings that apply to \n     such terms under title XXVI of the Public Health Service Act.\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator Lautenberg, \nand Senators from New York, Illinois and Florida, in support of a one \nyear reauthorization of the Ryan White CARE Act, and to raise my \nserious reservations about the current committee proposal. I recognize \nand respect the dedication and hard work of Senators Enzi and Kennedy, \nCongressmen Barton and Dingell and their staff to reauthorization this \nvital program. But unfortunately, their proposal, as it currently \nstands, threatens lives by destroying networks of care in New Jersey \nand in other States across the country.\n  In reviewing the committee's proposal, I cannot help but wonder why \nwe are not doing more and providing additional resources to address a \ngrowing need in our communities. More people are getting infected and \nmore communities are having to provide care for individuals with HIV/\nAIDS, which means we need more resources, not less. We need to address \nthe growing need for care. Unfortunately, this legislation doesn't \naddress the spread of the disease; it simply spreads already limited \nfunding even thinner.\n  In New Jersey, we are still struggling with the HIV/AIDS battle and \nunfortunately, at this point, we are not winning the war. It is a sad \nreality, but New Jersey continues to rank fifth in the country for \noverall AIDS cases. We have the highest proportion of AIDS cases in \nwomen, and rank third in pediatric AIDS cases. We have not yet won the \nbattle--we are still fighting. And we need weapons, in terms of \nfunding, to win.\n  New Jersey has stepped-up to the plate to develop a comprehensive \narray of medical services, which are funded in part by the CARE Act. \nPeople infected with HIV/AIDS living in New Jersey have access to one \nof the most effective ADAP programs in the nation, as well as primary \nmedical care, mental health service, substance abuse services, oral \nhealth, case management, and nutritional services. I'm proud of our \nState's networks of care, and recognize how important they are to the \nwell-being of countless New Jerseyans. But in order to help this \nprogram to grow and be effective, we must maintain our Federal support.\n  During the debate surrounding the reauthorization some are saying we \nshould cut funding for certain States and their HIV/AIDS services. I \ndisagree and so do New Jerseyans. I am proud of the strong voice of New \nJersey's advocates. Beneficiaries from across the State, members of our \nHIV Health Services Planning Councils from our eligible metropolitan \nareas or EMAs, representatives from all counties that are part of the \nPhiladelphia EMA, and individuals from the consortiums of the remaining \ncounties have been fully engaged in this reauthorization process.\n  Our elected officials, the Governor's office, and our entire New \nJersey delegation have all been supportive of making sure New Jersey \nhas the resources to continue fighting this battle. Our State--but \napparently not this Congress--is united in providing care, saving lives \nand ending this epidemic once and for all.\n  Unfortunately, the committee's proposed reauthorization threatens to \ndestroy and dismantle critical networks of care that are keeping people \nalive and healthy in New Jersey. With our current network of care, our \nhealthcare providers have been instrumental in helping prevent people \nwith HIV from developing full-blown AIDS. Without these services, the \nimpact will be devastating for patients, their ability to work and \nprovide for their families and most importantly, their lives.\n  My concerns continue to grow. Most recently, the U.S. Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention recommended routine HIV testing for all \nAmericans ages 13 to 64, saying that an HIV test should be as common as \na cholesterol check. The CDC estimates 250,000 Americans are infected \nand don't even\n\n[[Page S10192]]\n\nknow it. At a time when we are identifying more and more individuals \nwith HIV, our country is destroying the very networks of care that will \nhelp educate and care for these individuals. We need testing, but we \nalso need so much more.\n  That is why I propose that we try again--and this time, get it right. \nThat we try to find a way to build on our networks of care, and provide \nthe services that our entire Nation needs to win the war on HIV/AIDS.\n  Today, I join Senator Lautenberg in offering a proposal that would \nprovide a 1-year reauthorization of the Ryan White CARE Act under \ncurrent law. It would provide a 3.7 percent increase in authorization \nlevels through 2007, while preventing funding from reverting back to \nthe Treasury. This bill would provide a 1-year extension of the names-\nbased reporting requirement set to go into effect beginning October 1, \n2006. In addition, it would provide $30 million under Title II for \nStates who have an ``unmet need'' and ``no title I entities.'' This \nproposal would help all States across the country without doing any \nharm. Instead of 5 years of a detrimental reauthorization, I support \nanother year to get it right.\n  I believe America can do better, and today I am standing up for the \nHIV/AIDS community across the country. Today is a day to make our \ncountry's budget reflect our values by expanding funding for this \nimportant program. I call on my colleagues to save the Ryan White CARE \nAct. Wait to implement formula changes that could destroy existing \nnetworks of care, and instead, work out a solution that addresses the \nneeds of the entire country. Please join me in supporting this \nlegislation.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \nsupport for the Ryan White CARE Act. The programs funded through this \nlaw have, for more than 15 years, enabled hundreds of thousands of \npeople living with HIV and AIDS to access essential care and treatment \nservices.\n  Yet the reauthorization proposals currently under consideration by \nboth the House and the Senate would unfairly shift funding from the \nhardest-hit areas of the epidemic, devastating the ability of providers \nand organizations to offer life-extending services. The more than \n100,000 people living with HIV and AIDS in New York would be adversely \naffected by the millions of dollars in cuts they would face if these \nreauthorizations were to go through.\n  I understand that the White House and the Republican leadership are \npressuring many of my colleagues, particularly those from code-based \nStates, that if they don't reauthorize the bill this year, they will \nface cuts in funding next year. But approving a fundamentally flawed \nbill under pressure is not the right thing to do. We should be working \nto strengthen the CARE Act for everyone, not decimate it.\n  Today, I, along with my colleagues from New Jersey, Illinois, and \nFlorida, will be introducing legislation that provides for a 1-year \nextension of programs funded by the Ryan White CARE Act, to give us \nmore time to address the concerns of many that were raised during this \nreauthorization process. It will increase authorization levels across \ntitles by 3.7 percent, and will set up a grant program to address unmet \nneed in States that do not receive title I funding, in order to address \nthe need in rural areas where HIV incidence has increased. It will also \ndelay the switch from code-based to names-based reporting for 1 year, \nin order to give us time to address many of the issues that these \nStates are facing in making this switch.\n  I believe in the reauthorization of the CARE Act, but I believe in \nreauthorizing the CARE Act the right way--in a way that will help, not \nhurt, all of the people living with HIV and AIDS in this country. Our \nbill will help that process, and I would urge all of my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON (for herself, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Lautenberg, Mrs. \n        Boxer, Mr. Menendez, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Inouye, Mr. \n        Kerry, Mr. Jeffords, and Mr. Chafee):\n  S. 3945. A bill to provide for the provisions by hospitals of \nemergency contraceptives to women, and post-exposure prophylaxis for \nsexually transmitted disease to individuals, who are survivors of \nsexual assault; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce the \nCompassionate Assistance for Rape Emergencies Act, a bill that will \nhelp sexual assault survivors across the country get the medical care \nthey need and deserve.\n  It is hard to argue against this commonsense legislation. Rape--by \ndefinition--could never result in an intended pregnancy. Emergency \ncontraception is a valuable tool that can prevent unintended pregnancy. \nThis bill makes emergency contraception available for survivors of \nsexual assault at any hospital receiving public funds.\n  Every 2 minutes, a woman is sexually assaulted in the United States, \nand each year, 25,000 to 32,000 women become pregnant as a result of \nrape or incest. According to a study published in the American Journal \nof Obstetrics and Gynecology, 50 percent of those pregnancies end in \nabortion.\n  By providing access to emergency contraception, up to 95 percent of \nthose unintended pregnancies could be prevented if emergency \ncontraception is administered within the first 24 to 72 hours. In \naddition, emergency contraception could also give desperately needed \npeace of mind to women in crisis.\n  I am proud that for 3 years, this has already been law in New York \nState. Survivors of sexual assault and rape receive information and \naccess to emergency contraception at every hospital in the State. As a \nresult, victims are getting better care than they ever have before in \nNew York. This bill will allow women nationwide to benefit from the \nsame standard of care New Yorkers receive.\n  In New York City, women are benefiting from Mayor Bloomberg's \nsignificant initiative to expand access to emergency contraception and \nfamily planning services and improve maternal and infant outcomes. I \napplaud this focus on increasing awareness about emergency \ncontraception--to all women--so that we can work together at decreasing \nthe rate of unintended pregnancy in this country.\n  The FDA recently made EC available over the counter for women 18 \nyears of age and older. Despite the ideologically driven agenda against \nthis drug, the research has been consistently clear--this drug is safe \nand effective for preventing pregnancy. The FDA's own scientific \nadvisory committees and more than 70 major medical organizations, \nincluding the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical \nAssociation recommended EC be made available without a prescription. If \npharmacies stock this drug for any citizen of age, surely hospitals \nshould provide women in crisis with the information necessary to \nevaluate this option for themselves.\n  Women deserve access to EC. For millions of women, it represents \npeace of mind. For survivors of rape and sexual assault, it offers hope \nfor healing and a tomorrow free of painful reminders of the past. Let \nus recommit ourselves to the fight to better protect and serve our \nNation's sexual assault survivors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/26/senate-section/article/S10192-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10192-S10195]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 585--COMMENDING THE NEW ORLEANS SAINTS OF THE \n NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE FOR WINNING THEIR MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL GAME \n          ON MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, 2006 BY A SCORE OF 23 TO 3\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation:\n\n                              S.

(2) and we commend League Commissioner Paul Tagliabue for \ndemonstrating exemplary leadership and commitment to the City of New \nOrleans.\n\n  Mr. President, I thought it was important to read the words of this \nresolution which will go in the Record today. I am certain there were \nmillions and millions of people all over America who watched that \nspecial football game last night because, as you know, it was more than \na football game. It was a symbol of hope and recovery for a great \nAmerican city in a great region of this country.\n  I came to the floor today to share this resolution and to also thank \nmy colleagues, as Senator Lott from Mississippi has done earlier this \nmorning, to thank them for coming together in such an extraordinary and \nbipartisan way throughout this year to pass not one, not two, not \nthree, but four supplemental requests that are helping to send money to \nthis stricken region of the country.\n  Even when there were some problems and some hurdles in the executive \nbranch, this Congress came together across party lines, led in large \nmeasure by the appropriators in this Chamber, to say: Yes, this region \ndeserves investment; yes, we need to fix FEMA; yes, we need to reform \nthe Corps of Engineers; yes, we need to build levees; and, yes, we need \nto restore the wetlands that protect this great coast of which New \nOrleans and Houston and Gulfport and Beaumont and Lake Charles and \nLafayette and Baton Rouge are such important cities in this region--\nAmerica's only energy coast.\n  Last night, the Saints did us proud. They came home and not just won \nthe game, but it was, of course, more than a game. For the Saints \nmanagers, for the dome director, for the commissioners of the dome \nstadium who\n\n[[Page S10194]]\n\nhelped get their magnificent building ready after such a tragedy of \nlast year, we thank them.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the roster of \nthe Saints players, the names of the coaches and the assistant coaches \nand their managers, the names of the contractors, and as many of the \nworkers as we can get.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                             NEW ORLEANS SAINTS TEAM ROSTER\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                No.                          Last, first               Pos         Ht       Wt      Age      Exp                   College\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nActive Players:\n    9..............................

We are going to continue to fight hard, \nto build partnerships, to reform what needs to be reformed, to fix what \nneeds to be fixed, and to build this region, every single neighborhood, \nevery single town, and to do it smarter and better.\n  The Saints came marching in. They brought a lot of hope to everyone. \nThis resolution will commend them for their extraordinary work as we go \ninto the difficult rebuilding in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/26/senate-section/article/S10195-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10195]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 586--CELEBRATING 40 YEARS OF ACHIEVEMENTS OF MEDICAL \n   CODERS, AND ENCOURAGING THE MEDICAL CODING COMMUNITY TO CONTINUE \n  PROVIDING ACCURATE MEDICAL CLAIMS AND STATISTICAL REPORTING TO THE \n              PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES AND TO THE WORLD\n\n  Mr. HATCH submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions:\n\n                              S. Res. 586\n\n       Whereas, in 1966, the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) \n     was developed by the American Medical Association (AMA) to \n     assist with the accurate reporting of physician procedures \n     and services, and has since grown to include 8,568 codes and \n     descriptions;\n       Whereas, in 1977, when the 9th revision to the World Health \n     Organization's International Classification of Diseases (ICD-\n     9) was published, the United States National Center for \n     Health Statistics modified the statistical study with \n     clinical information and provided a way to classify \n     diagnostic and procedural data to create a clinical picture \n     of each patient to improve the quality of health care;\n       Whereas, in 1977, the Health Care Financing Administration \n     (HCFA), now the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services \n     (CMS), was established for the coordination of the Medicare \n     and Medicaid programs and its responsibilities has since \n     included coordinating the annual update to ICD-9-CM Volume 3 \n     procedures codes;\n       Whereas Congress passed the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage \n     Act of 1988 (Public Law 100-360), and mandated the reporting \n     of ICD-9-CM codes on each part B claim submitted by \n     physicians and that mandate has since extended to parts A, C, \n     and D of the Medicare program;\n       Whereas the Health Information Portability and \n     Accountability Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-191) requires \n     every health care provider who does business electronically \n     to use the same code sets, including Current Procedural \n     Terminology, ICD-9-CM, and other code sets involving medical \n     supplies, dental services, and drugs;\n       Whereas, since 1998 and the publication of the first \n     medical practice compliance plans, the Office of Inspector \n     General (OIG) of the Department of Health and Human Services \n     (HHS) has recognized medical coding as an essential element \n     in the fight against health care fraud and abuse;\n       Whereas, in 2003, the Department of Health and Human \n     Services delegated authority under the Health Information \n     Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 to the Centers for \n     Medicare & Medicaid Services to maintain and distribute the \n     Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) that is \n     used primarily to identify products, supplies, and services \n     not included in the Current Procedural Terminology codes, \n     such as ambulance services and durable medical equipment, \n     prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies (DMEPOS) when used \n     outside a physician's office;\n       Whereas the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and \n     Modernization Act of 2003 (Public Law 108-173) included a \n     provision to update ICD-9-CM codes affecting new technology \n     and procedures twice each year;\n       Whereas, in 2006, the Department of Labor forecasted above \n     average job growth for medical coders through 2012 because of \n     rapid growth in the number of medical tests, treatments, and \n     procedures that will be increasingly scrutinized by third-\n     party payers, regulators, courts, and consumers; and\n       Whereas medical coders have a tradition of working in \n     collaboration with the Federal Government to improve the \n     overall health of all people of the United States through the \n     accuracy of claims reporting: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the historical, clinical, and public health \n     achievements of medical coders and celebrates the milestones \n     achieved in the 40-year history of medical coding;\n       (2) recognizes the great impact that medical coders have on \n     improving the quality of health care of people in the United \n     States and around the world; and\n       (3) congratulates medical coders for their dedication and \n     trusts that the profession will continue to offer its \n     guidance relative to medical coding and its effect on \n     accurate patient information to improve the public health of \n     future generations.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to submit today a resolution \nto celebrate 4.0 years of achievements of medical coders, and to \nencourage the medical coding community to continue providing accurate \nmedical claims and statistical reporting to the people of the United \nStates and to the world.\n  There are about 80,000 professional medical coders employed in the \nUnited States, and that number is expected to continue to grow due to \nthe increasing number of medical tests, treatments and procedures, and \nthe consequent scrutiny to provide the best quality health care in a \nmarket driven economy. Medical coders are a diverse group of women and \nmen dedicated to ``running the numbers'' of health care. They translate \nthe information that a physician documents during a patient visit into \nnumerical codes that are used for both payment and statistical \npurposes.\n  Medical coders are sentries of our Nation's health. They communicate \nregularly with physicians and other health care professionals to \nclarify diagnoses or to obtain additional information in the assignment \nof alphanumeric codes. They are knowledgeable of medical terminology, \nanatomy, physiology, and the code sets necessary to serve effectively \nin their professional role within the health care community. They are \nteam players committed to ethical and sound medical documentation and \nreimbursement practices.\n  Medical coders work in a variety of health care environments. Nearly \n40 percent of all coding jobs are in hospitals. Others work in the \noffices of physicians, nursing care facilities, outpatient care \ncenters, and home health care services. Insurance firms that offer \nhealth plans employ coders to tabulate and analyze health information. \nMedical coders in public health departments supervise data collection \nfrom health care institutions and assist in research. The Department of \nDefense policy requires accurate and prompt documentation of and coding \nof medical encounters within the Military Health System to assist, \nMilitary Treatment Facility operations. The compliance plan for third-\nparty payers of the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of \nthe Inspector General acknowledges the specialized training of medical \ncoders required due to the greater legal exposure related to coding \nmedical services. Coders also stand as the frontline against the \npotential fraud and abuse of the Medicare and Medicaid programs while \nassuring that the physicians, hospitals, and clinics receive accurate \ncompensation for the services provided.\n  The abilities coders possess to collect data about diagnoses and \nprocedures figure prominently within my own interests for quality \nhealth care. Medical coders also provide us with the data we need for \nmaking tough choices in health care policy.\n  It is my hope that this resolution will help advance the recognition \nof professional medical coders and the attention given to their \ncommendable work. It recognizes contributions to the national health \ncare system and it reminds us of medical coders' dedication to the \nvalue of hard work in the interest of a national priority--quality \nhealth care for everyone. I applaud that contribution and am hopeful \nthat my colleagues in the Senate will join me by passing this \nresolution.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/26/senate-section/article/S10196-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10196]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S10196]]\n SENATE RESOLUTION 587--EXPRESSING CONCERN RELATING TO THE THREATENING \n BEHAVIOR OF THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN AND THE IDEOLOGICAL ALLIANCE \nTHAT EXISTS BETWEEN THE COUNTRIES OF CUBA AND VENEZUELA, AND SUPPORTING \n THE PEOPLE OF IRAN, CUBA, AND VENEZUELA IN THE QUEST OF THOSE PEOPLES \n            TO ACHIEVE A TRULY DEMOCRATIC FORM OF GOVERNMENT\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM (for himself, Mr. Martinez, and Mr. Coleman) submitted \nthe following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nForeign Relations:\n\n                              S.

Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Mr. Domenici) submitted an \namendment intended to be proposed by him to the bill H.R. 6061, to \nestablish operational control over the international land and maritime \nborders of the United States; which was ordered to lie on the table; as \nfollows:\n\n       On page 7, after line 10, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 6. BORDER RELIEF GRANT PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) It is the obligation of the Federal Government of the \n     United States to adequately secure the Nation's borders and \n     prevent the flow of undocumented persons and illegal drugs \n     into the United States.\n       (2) Despite the fact that the United States Border Patrol \n     apprehends over 1,000,000 people each year trying to \n     illegally enter the United States, according to the \n     Congressional Research Service, the net growth in the number \n     of unauthorized aliens has increased by approximately 500,000 \n     each year. The Southwest border accounts for approximately 94 \n     percent of all migrant apprehensions each year. Currently, \n     there are an estimated 11,000,000 unauthorized aliens in the \n     United States.\n       (3) The border region is also a major corridor for the \n     shipment of drugs. According to the El Paso Intelligence \n     Center, 65 percent of the narcotics that are sold in the \n     markets of the United States enter the country through the \n     Southwest Border.\n       (4) Border communities continue to incur significant costs \n     due to the lack of adequate border security. A 2001 study by \n     the United States-Mexico Border Counties Coalition found that \n     law enforcement and criminal justice expenses associated with \n     illegal immigration exceed $89,000,000 annually for the \n     Southwest border counties.\n       (5) In August 2005, the States of New Mexico and Arizona \n     declared states of emergency in order to provide local law \n     enforcement immediate assistance in addressing criminal \n     activity along the Southwest border.\n       (6) While the Federal Government provides States and \n     localities assistance in covering costs related to the \n     detention of certain criminal aliens and the prosecution of \n     Federal drug cases, local law enforcement along the border \n     are provided no assistance in covering such expenses and must \n     use their limited resources to combat drug trafficking, human \n     smuggling, kidnappings, the destruction of private property, \n     and other border-related crimes.\n       (7) The United States shares 5,525 miles of border with \n     Canada and 1,989 miles with Mexico. Many of the local law \n     enforcement agencies located along the border are small, \n     rural departments charged with patrolling large areas of \n     land. Counties along the Southwest United States-Mexico \n     border are some of the poorest in the country and lack the \n     financial resources to cover the additional costs associated \n     with illegal immigration, drug trafficking, and other border-\n     related crimes.\n       (8) Federal assistance is required to help local law \n     enforcement operating along the border address the unique \n     challenges that arise as a result of their proximity to an \n     international border and the lack of overall border security \n     in the region.\n       (b) Grants Authorized.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary is authorized to award \n     grants, subject to the availability of appropriations, to an \n     eligible law enforcement agency to provide assistance to such \n     agency to address--\n       (A) criminal activity that occurs in the jurisdiction of \n     such agency by virtue of such agency's proximity to the \n     United States border; and\n       (B) the impact of any lack of security along the United \n     States border.\n       (2) Duration.--Grants may be awarded under this subsection \n     during fiscal years 2007 through 2011.\n       (3) Competitive basis.--The Secretary shall award grants \n     under this subsection on a competitive basis, except that the \n     Secretary shall give priority to applications from any \n     eligible law enforcement agency serving a community--\n       (A) with a population of less than 50,000; and\n       (B) located no more than 100 miles from a United States \n     border with--\n       (i) Canada; or\n       (ii) Mexico.\n       (c) Use of Funds.--Grants awarded pursuant to subsection \n     (b) may only be used to provide additional resources for an \n     eligible law enforcement agency to address criminal activity \n     occurring along any such border, including--\n       (1) to obtain equipment;\n       (2) to hire additional personnel;\n       (3) to upgrade and maintain law enforcement technology;\n       (4) to cover operational costs, including overtime and \n     transportation costs; and\n       (5) such other resources as are available to assist that \n     agency.\n       (d) Application.--\n       (1) In general.--Each eligible law enforcement agency \n     seeking a grant under this section shall submit an \n     application to the Secretary at such time, in such manner, \n     and accompanied by such information as the Secretary may \n     reasonably require.\n       (2) Contents.--Each application submitted pursuant to \n     paragraph (1) shall--\n       (A) describe the activities for which assistance under this \n     section is sought; and\n       (B) provide such additional assurances as the Secretary \n     determines to be essential to ensure compliance with the \n     requirements of this section.\n       (e) Definitions.--For the purposes of this section:\n       (1) Eligible law enforcement agency.--The term ``eligible \n     law enforcement agency'' means a tribal, State, or local law \n     enforcement agency--\n       (A) located in a county no more than 100 miles from a \n     United States border with--\n       (i) Canada; or\n       (ii) Mexico; or\n       (B) located in a county more than 100 miles from any such \n     border, but where such county has been certified by the \n     Secretary as a High Impact Area.\n       (2) High impact area.--The term ``High Impact Area'' means \n     any county designated by the Secretary as such, taking into \n     consideration--\n       (A) whether local law enforcement agencies in that county \n     have the resources to protect the lives, property, safety, or \n     welfare of the residents of that county;\n       (B) the relationship between any lack of security along the \n     United States border and the rise, if any, of criminal \n     activity in that county; and\n       (C) any other unique challenges that local law enforcement \n     face due to a lack of security along the United States \n     border.\n       (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Department of Homeland Security.\n       (f) Authorization of Appropriations.--\n       (1) In general.--There are authorized to be appropriated \n     $50,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2007 through 2011 to \n     carry out the provisions of this section.\n       (2) Division of authorized funds.--Of the amounts \n     authorized under paragraph (1)--\n       (A) \\2/3\\ shall be set aside for eligible law enforcement \n     agencies located in the 6 States with the largest number of \n     undocumented alien apprehensions; and\n       (B) \\1/3\\ shall be set aside for areas designated as a High \n     Impact Area under subsection (e).\n       (g) Supplement Not Supplant.--Amounts appropriated for \n     grants under this section shall be used to supplement and not \n     supplant other State and local public funds obligated for the \n     purposes provided under this Act.\n\n     SEC. 7. ENFORCEMENT OF FEDERAL IMMIGRATION LAW.\n\n       Nothing in section 6 shall be construed to authorize State \n     or local law enforcement agencies or their officers to \n     exercise Federal immigration law enforcement authority.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 5042.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a joint \nstatement with Senator Biden, and accompanying materials, regarding the \nGeneva Protocol III--the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions \nof 12 August 1949, and relating to the Adoption of an Additional \nDistinctive Emblem--be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              Joint Statement of Senators Lugar and Biden\n\n       Today, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Relations, we \n     have requested that the Committee be discharged from further \n     consideration of the Protocol Additional to the Geneva \n     Conventions of August 12, 1949, and relating to the Adoption \n     of an Additional Distinctive Emblem, which was adopted at \n     Geneva on December 8, 2005, and signed by the United States \n     on that date (Treaty Doc. 109-10A) (``Geneva Protocol III'' \n     or the ``Protocol'').\n       The Protocol creates a new distinctive emblem, a Red \n     Crystal, that will serve the same purposes as the Red Cross \n     and Red Crescent emblems. The Red Crystal is a neutral emblem \n     that can be used by governments and national societies that \n     face challenges using the existing emblems or that believe \n     this neutral emblem may offer enhanced protection in certain \n     situations. The Protocol also paved the way for Magen David \n     Adom, Israel's national society, to become a member of the \n     International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement.\n       As chairman and ranking member of the Committee, we have \n     reviewed the Protocol, as well as responses provided by the \n     Department of State to written questions that we have \n     submitted on the Protocol. Based on our review, we believe \n     that the Protocol is in the interests of the United States \n     and urge the Senate to act promptly to give advice and \n     consent to ratification of the Protocol. Ratification of the \n     Protocol will reinforce and extend the longstanding and \n     historic leadership of the United States in the law of armed \n     conflict. We support prompt ratification of the Protocol this \n     year, as such action emphasizes the U.S. commitment to the \n     humanitarian objectives of the International Red Cross and \n     Red Crescent Movement and its fundamental principles of \n     universality and neutrality.\n       Because the Committee has not formally acted on the \n     Protocol, there is no Committee report. Therefore, in order \n     to assist senators in evaluating the Protocol, we are \n     submitting for the Record a summary prepared by professional \n     staff of the Committee outlining the purpose and background \n     of the Protocol, as well as its key provisions. We also are \n     including the responses from the Department of State to \n     questions that we submitted on the Protocol.\n\n Staff Summary of the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of \n    August 12, 1949, and Relating to the Adoption of an Additional \n               Distinctive Emblem (Treaty Doc. 109-10A).\n\n                               I. Purpose\n\n       The Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of August \n     12, 1949, and relating to the Adoption of an Additional \n     Distinctive Emblem, was adopted at Geneva on December 8, \n     2005, and signed by the United States on that date (Treaty \n     Doc. 109-10A).\n  The Protocol, also referred to as Geneva Protocol III, creates a new \ndistinctive emblem, a Red Crystal, in addition to and for the same \npurposes as the Red Cross and the Red Crescent emblems.\n\n                             II. Background\n\n       The 1949 Geneva Conventions provide for the respect and \n     protection of military medical and religious personnel during \n     international armed conflicts. The 1949 Geneva Conventions \n     retained the distinctive emblems as a means of easily \n     identifying and protecting such personnel, their vehicles and \n     their facilities. The Conventions also permit authorized \n     national societies of the High Contracting Parties to the \n     Geneva Conventions to use these emblems in certain \n     circumstances. The Geneva Protocol III creates a new emblem, \n     the Red Crystal, equal in all respects to the existing \n     emblems (Red Cross, Red Crescent and the Red Lion and Sun), \n     to be used by military medical and religious services and \n     authorized national societies.\n       The new distinctive emblem, the Red Crystal, is a neutral \n     emblem that can be used by governments and national societies \n     that face challenges using the existing emblems or that \n     believe that this neutral emblem may offer enhanced \n     protections in certain situations. The United States had \n     urged the High Contracting Parties to the Geneva Convention \n     to conclude a protocol on this issue as an important step \n     towards achieving truly universal membership in the \n     International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. The text \n     of the Geneva Protocol III was drawn up in October 2000, \n     following discussions within the Joint Working Group \n     established by the Standing Commission of the Red Cross and \n     Red Crescent pursuant to the mandate assigned to it by \n     Resolution 3 of the 27th International Conference of the Red \n     Cross and Red Crescent and subsequent consultations. This \n     draft followed attempts to resolve this issue during the \n     negotiations of the 1949 Geneva Conventions and during the \n     negotiations of Protocols I and II in the 1970s. As adopted, \n     the Geneva Protocol III paved the way for Magen David Adom, \n     Israel's national society, to become a member of the \n     International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement.\n\n            III. Summary of Key Provisions of the Agreement\n\n       The key provisions of the Geneva Protocol III establish the \n     new emblem, the Red Crystal, and set forth applicable rules.\n       Article 2 establishes the new emblem ``in addition to, and \n     for the same purposes as'' the existing distinctive emblems. \n     It also establishes that the emblems ``shall enjoy equal \n     status'' and that the conditions for use of and respect for \n     the new emblem are identical to those applicable to the \n     existing emblems. Article 2 also authorizes the medical and \n     religious personnel of armed forces of the parties to make \n     temporary use of any of the distinctive emblems (including \n     the Red Crystal) where such use may enhance protection. \n     Article 3 authorizes national societies of parties that \n     decide to use the new emblem to incorporate within it one or \n     more of the existing emblems or ``another emblem which has \n     been in effective use by a High Contracting Party and was the \n     subject of a communication to the other High Contracting \n     Parties and the International Committee of the Red Cross'' \n     prior to December 8, 2005. This Article also authorizes a \n     national society that incorporates within the new emblem one \n     of the existing emblems to ``use the designation of that \n     emblem and display it within its national territory.''\n       Article 4 authorizes the International Committee of the Red \n     Cross and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red \n     Crescent Societies and their duly authorized personnel to use \n     the new emblem ``in exceptional circumstances and to \n     facilitate their work.'' Article 5 authorizes the medical \n     services and religious personnel participating in operations \n     under the auspices of the United Nations to use one of the \n     distinctive emblems with the agreement of the participating \n     states. Article 6 extends to the new distinctive emblem \n     provisions of the Geneva\n\n[[Page S10220]]\n\n     Conventions and, where applicable, Protocols I and II, \n     regarding ``prevention and repression of misuse'' of the \n     existing distinctive emblems. Parties to Geneva Protocol III \n     are required to take measures ``necessary for the prevention \n     and repression, at all times, of any misuse'' of each of the \n     emblems. Article 6 also allows parties to permit ``prior \n     users'' of the new emblem, or of ``any sign constituting an \n     imitation thereof,'' to continue using such emblem or signs, \n     so long as the emblem or signs do not ``appear, in time of \n     armed conflict to confer protection'' of the Geneva \n     Conventions and, where applicable, Protocols I and II. Prior \n     users, under this provision, must have acquired the rights to \n     use the emblem or signs before December 8, 2005.\n\n                      IV. Implementing Legislation\n\n       The executive branch has submitted proposed legislation to \n     Congress that would provide protection for the new Red \n     Crystal emblem, as well as the existing Red Crescent emblem, \n     consistent with the Geneva Conventions and the Geneva \n     Protocol III. These protections correspond to existing \n     protections in U.S. law, set forth in Title 18 of the United \n     States Code, for the Red Cross emblem. This legislation was \n     referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                      V. Questions for the Record\n\n\nRESPONSES OF HON. JOHN BELLINGER, III, THE LEGAL ADVISER, DEPARTMENT OF \n  STATE, TO QUESTIONS FOR THE RECORD SUBMITTED BY SENATOR RICHARD G. \n                                 LUGAR\n\n     Question: If the U.S. chooses to ratify this treaty, what \n     legislation is necessary to implement this Protocol?\n       Answer: The Department of State has submitted draft \n     legislation to the House of Representatives and the Senate \n     that would provide protections to the Third Protocol (red \n     crystal) distinctive emblem consistent with Article 6 of the \n     Geneva Protocol III. The draft legislation also provides \n     protections to the red crescent distinctive emblem consistent \n     with the 1949 Geneva Conventions and the Geneva Protocol III. \n     These protections correspond to protections set forth in 18 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 706 for the red cross.\n       Question: How does the Geneva Protocol III serve U.S. \n     foreign policy interests?\n       Answer: The Geneva Protocol III serves U.S. foreign policy \n     interests in several ways. First, it lifted an important \n     obstacle to the universality of the International Red Cross \n     and Red Crescent Movement, by adopting a neutral emblem that \n     could be used by any government or national society that face \n     challenges using the existing emblems or that believe that \n     this neutral emblem may offer enhanced protections in certain \n     situations. The adoption of the Protocol made it possible for \n     Israel's national society, Magen David Adom (MDA), to join \n     the Movement after more than fifty years of exclusion. The \n     United States looks to the Movement to deliver humanitarian \n     assistance in response to natural disasters or armed \n     conflict. MDA's exclusion from the Movement meant that the \n     Movement was falling short with respect to one of its \n     fundamental principles--universality--and did not have \n     national societies everywhere operating under its umbrella \n     delivering humanitarian services.\n       Second, the new emblem created by the Protocol provides the \n     U.S. military medical and religious personnel and the \n     American Red Cross humanitarian workers with another option \n     in circumstances where we believe that the red cross may not \n     be perceived as a neutral emblem. For example, the U.S. \n     government or the American Red Cross may choose to use the \n     red crystal on an exceptional basis to avoid the appearance \n     of a religious affiliation in an armed conflict involving \n     countries or groups with strong religious ties.\n       Third, U.S. ratification of the Protocol will advance the \n     longstanding and historic leadership of the United States in \n     the law of armed conflict, just as our role in urging its \n     adoption did. In addition, it will send an important message \n     of the strength of U.S. support for this issue if the United \n     States Government has ratified the Protocol before it enters \n     into force on January 14, 2007. U.S. ratification of the \n     Protocol emphasizes the commitment of the United States to \n     the humanitarian objectives of the International Red Cross \n     and Red Crescent Movement and the Movement's fundamental \n     principles of universality and neutrality.\n       Finally, the adoption of the Protocol and MDA's subsequent \n     admission into the Movement made it possible for the American \n     Red Cross to end its policy of withholding its dues from the \n     International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent \n     Societies (the Federation) in protest of MDA's exclusion. In \n     2005, the American Red Cross entered into default status in \n     the Federation and lost its ability to run for Federation \n     offices as a result of not paying its dues since 2000. After \n     MDA was admitted to the Movement in June 2006, the American \n     Red Cross resumed its dues payments and regained its status \n     as a member in good standing, thus allowing it to play a very \n     constructive role to ensure that the Movement and the \n     Federation are achieving the policy and program goals that \n     serve the American public.\n       Question: How do national societies around the world view \n     the adoption of the new emblem? What are their views on its \n     use and potential impact on their security?\n       Answer: National societies have consistently supported \n     adoption of the Geneva Protocol III by passing unanimously \n     resolutions at the International Movement's Council of \n     Delegates meetings every two years in support of such a \n     Protocol. Moreover, at the 29th International Conference of \n     the Red Cross and Red Crescent held in June 2006, national \n     societies voted in favor of adopting changes to the \n     Movement's statutes authorizing national societies to use the \n     new emblem for purposes of membership, by a vote of 136 to \n     21, with six abstentions.\n       The statements of representatives of national societies to \n     these bodies indicate that they believe having an additional \n     neutral emblem will enhance their ability to perform \n     humanitarian work. We understand that they believe that it \n     should offer their workers greater security in situations \n     where the red cross and red crescent are not seen as neutral \n     emblems, especially in mixed populations or where parties to \n     a conflict differ in religious affiliation. Statements by \n     representatives of national societies that were not in favor \n     of the statutes changes or the previous resolutions generally \n     did not focus on problems using the red crystal emblem per \n     se, but on opposition to the entry of Israel's national \n     society, Magen David Adom, into the International Red Cross \n     and Red Crescent Movement or opposition to the policies of \n     the Government of Israel.\n       Question: Which countries have ratified Geneva Protocol \n     III? When does it enter into force? Although consensus was \n     not achieved in adopting Geneva Protocol III, what are the \n     expectations of support for its ratification?\n       Answer: As of September 21, 2006, six countries (Bulgaria, \n     Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Philippines, and Switzerland) \n     have ratified the Geneva Protocol III. Article 11 of the \n     Protocol provides that it enters into force six months \n     after two instruments of ratification or accession have \n     been deposited. Accordingly, the Geneva Protocol III \n     enters into force on January 14, 2007, six months after \n     the second instrument of ratification was deposited. For \n     each country ratifying or acceding to the Protocol after \n     the first two, the Geneva Protocol III enters into force \n     six months after the deposit of its instrument of \n     ratification or accession.\n       We expect that there will be additional ratifications of \n     the Geneva Protocol III. Twenty-seven countries, including \n     the United States, signed the Protocol on the day of its \n     adoption (December 8, 2005). Since then, another forty-nine \n     countries have signed the Protocol, suggesting continuing \n     strong interest in the Protocol. We expect most countries \n     will follow up by depositing their instruments of \n     ratification after satisfying their domestic requirements for \n     ratification. In addition, we believe the International \n     Committee of the Red Cross will continue to urge countries to \n     become parties to the Geneva Protocol III.\n       Question: Is it expected that any countries or their \n     national societies will choose to use the red crystal? Will \n     national societies use the option to incorporate another \n     symbol within the red crystal? Are there concerns that the \n     use of red crystal or the incorporation of other emblems or \n     symbols into the red crystal may create confusion about the \n     personnel, vehicles or facilities using the emblems? Does \n     either the International Committee of the Red Cross or the \n     Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies plan \n     to change to use of the red crystal as its primary emblem?\n       Answer: We expect that a number of governments and national \n     societies will choose to use the red crystal on an \n     exceptional basis. In particular, governments and national \n     societies have said that in some current conflict zones, \n     where religion divides the conflicting parties, they may wish \n     to use the red crystal to convey that military medical units \n     and humanitarian workers are neutral and not parties to the \n     conflict. Beyond these circumstances, it is unlikely that \n     many governments or national societies will shift to using \n     the red crystal as their primary emblem. We are not aware of \n     any government currently planning to use the red crystal as \n     its emblem.\n       Magen David Adorn has already declared that when it is \n     working outside of Israel, it will use the Red Shield of \n     David inside the red crystal. In certain circumstances, it \n     may choose to use the red crystal alone, if it believes that \n     it will enhance the security of its staff. The American Red \n     Cross has expressed that it would consider using the red \n     crystal overseas on a case-by-case basis, if desirable due to \n     security and operational circumstances.\n       We do not believe that incorporating another emblem inside \n     the red crystal will create confusion about the personnel, \n     vehicles or facilities using those emblems. Over time, we \n     believe the public will become more familiar with the red \n     crystal as a symbol in its own right. Moreover, parties to \n     the Geneva Protocol III are required to disseminate the \n     Protocol as widely as possible in their countries so that \n     their armed forces and civilian populations become familiar \n     with the Protocol and the new emblem.\n       Neither the ICRC nor the Federation plans at this time to \n     adopt the red crystal as its primary emblem, as noted in a \n     preambular paragraph of the Geneva Protocol III. According to \n     Article 4, they may, however, choose to use the red crystal \n     on an exceptional basis, where circumstances merit and where \n     it will facilitate their work, possibly in regions where the \n     red crystal emblem will underscore their neutrality to the \n     parties to the conflict.\n       Question: How will the adoption of the emblem impact the \n     overall International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement? Is \n     the\n\n[[Page S10221]]\n\n     emblem likely to be accepted as a symbol of protection and \n     reduce the risk of targeted attack on aid workers?\n       Answer: The adoption of the Geneva Protocol III and the \n     establishment of a new emblem significantly impacts the \n     International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement by helping \n     it fulfill one of its seven fundamental principles--\n     universality. The Movement has been unable to achieve this \n     goal for more than fifty years due to the exclusion of \n     Israel's national society, Magen David Adorn (MDA). MDA's \n     membership in the Movement now improves the ability of the \n     Movement to respond to humanitarian crises in the Middle \n     East, with national societies cooperating on an equal basis.\n       Parties to the Geneva Protocol III are required to \n     disseminate the Protocol as widely as possible so that their \n     armed forces and civilian populations become familiar with \n     the Protocol and the new emblem. As a result, we believe that \n     over time parties to a conflict and the public at large will \n     become more familiar with the red crystal. However, the \n     larger phenomenon of targeted attacks on aid workers has \n     diverse causes, many of which will not be addressed by the \n     use of a more neutral emblem. Those who wish to disrupt the \n     provision of humanitarian assistance for political or \n     military goals do not respect the neutrality of humanitarian \n     workers, regardless of whether the humanitarian workers are \n     perceived as neutral or politically or religiously \n     affiliated.\n       Ouestion: Will the new emblem increase the protection of \n     aid workers who appear increasingly to come under fire as \n     soft targets, not because of confusion over symbols, but \n     because of perceptions about their political alliance?\n       Answer: The new emblem gives the International Red Cross \n     and Red Crescent Movement an important tool that may help it \n     operate in exceptional circumstances. While the red cross is \n     not a religious symbol (but the inversion of the Swiss flag), \n     it has been perceived as a symbol of Christianity in some \n     circumstances. Where the Movement is working with populations \n     of different religions, especially if they are in \n     conflict, the red crystal may be a less divisive symbol \n     that better conveys the neutrality of the Movement. \n     Therefore, we expect that the red crystal will enhance the \n     protection of the Movement's humanitarian workers.\n       However, the larger phenomenon of targeted attacks on aid \n     workers has diverse causes, many of which will not be \n     addressed by the use of a more neutral emblem. Those who wish \n     to disrupt the provision of humanitarian assistance for \n     political or military goals do not respect the neutrality of \n     humanitarian workers, regardless of whether the humanitarian \n     workers are perceived as neutral or politically or \n     religiously affiliated.\n       Question: The adoption of the Geneva Protocol III and the \n     changes to the Statutes of the International Movement of the \n     Red Cross and Red Crescent were not accomplished by \n     consensus. Was the International Movement damaged in any way \n     because consensus was not achieved?\n       Answer: While the negotiations over the Geneva Protocol III \n     and the changes to the International Movement's Statutes were \n     challenging, we believe that the Movement was not damaged by \n     the lack of consensus. In the final session of the \n     International Conference of the International Red Cross and \n     Red Crescent Movement, several delegations acknowledged that, \n     while they might have preferred a modified outcome, this \n     issue had reached closure and the Movement should now move \n     forward with other aspects of its humanitarian work. \n     Moreover, when the components of the Movement met immediately \n     after the International Conference to consider admitting the \n     Magen David Adom and the Palestine Red Crescent Society, they \n     admitted them by unanimous acclamation, without having to \n     submit the issue to a vote. We believe this illustrates that \n     the Movement is united behind the outcome of the \n     International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent.\n\n\nRESPONSES OF HON. JOHN BELLINGER, III, THE LEGAL ADVISER, DEPARTMENT OF \n   STATE, TO QUESTIONS FOR THE RECORD SUBMITTED BY SENATOR JOSEPH R. \n                               BIDEN, JR.\n\n       Question: As of this date, according to the information \n     available on the Internet site of the International Committee \n     of the Red Cross, there are five states that have ratified \n     the protocol. Why is it important for the Senate to act on \n     this treaty prior to the end of the 109th Congress? Is it \n     expected that the instrument of ratification will be \n     deposited prior to congressional action on the implementing \n     legislation?\n       Answer: It is important for the Senate to act on the Geneva \n     Protocol III prior to the end of the 109th Congress to \n     underscore its importance and the high priority the United \n     States Government places on it. Urgent ratification of the \n     Protocol will also advance the longstanding and historic \n     leadership of the United States in the law of armed conflict. \n     The Protocol will enter into force on January 14, 2007. It \n     will send an important message of the strength of U.S. \n     support for this issue if the United States Government has \n     ratified the Protocol before it enters into force. In \n     addition, ratification this year emphasizes the commitment of \n     the United States to the humanitarian objectives of the \n     International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. It will \n     also emphasize the U.S. commitment to the Movement's \n     fundamental principles of universality and neutrality.\n       We do not expect that the instrument of ratification will \n     be deposited prior to congressional action on the \n     implementing legislation because at this time we are working \n     with the relevant committees and we expect that Congress will \n     take up the implementing legislation in a timely fashion and \n     at the same time as the Senate is considering the Protocol, \n     consistent with the broad public and congressional support \n     for the Geneva Protocol III.\n       Question: In ratifying the Geneva Conventions of 1949, the \n     United States entered a reservation to the provisions in the \n     First Geneva Convention with regard to the obligation to make \n     unlawful within the United States the use of the Red Cross \n     emblem, in order to protect certain commercial use in this \n     country.\n       a. Is there any prior commercial use of the new emblem in \n     the United States of which the Executive Branch is aware?\n       b. Does Article 6(2) provide the United States sufficient \n     latitude to permit such prior use of the new emblem? Please \n     elaborate.\n       c. Please provide information from the Patent and Trademark \n     Office about whether there are any trademarks currently \n     registered that are similar to the new emblem (the Red \n     Crystal).\n       Answer: The Executive Branch is not aware of any prior \n     commercial use of the new emblem, the red crystal in the \n     United States. Nonetheless, the Geneva Protocol III provides \n     sufficient latitude for the continuation of legitimate prior \n     uses of the new emblem to the extent that they may exist. The \n     International Committee of the Red Cross has registered the \n     red crystal emblem as a trademark (U.S. Registration No. \n     2676576) at the United States Patent and Trademark Office \n     (USPTO). The USPTO has found no other registered trademarks \n     that are confusingly similar to the new emblem.\n       Question: In addition to the enforcement powers under the \n     proposed implementing legislation vested in the Attorney \n     General, are there other existing federal statutes relevant \n     to the protection of the Red Cross or the new emblem (the Red \n     Crystal), such as the trademark laws administered by the \n     Patent and Trademark Office or the unfair trade laws \n     administered by the Federal Trade Commission? Please \n     elaborate.\n       Answer: While the red cross has specific protections in \n     U.S. law (18 U.S.C. Sec. 706), the red crystal does not have \n     similar specific protections in U.S. law. The proposed \n     legislation would provide specific protections for the red \n     crystal and the red crescent. In certain circumstances, U.S. \n     unfair competition law could provide some possible protection \n     for the Geneva Convention distinctive emblems, including the \n     U.S. Trademark Act contained in 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1051 et seq. \n     For example, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1052(a) provides a basis for the \n     U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to refuse trademark \n     applications on the grounds that the mark falsely suggests a \n     connection with institutions, beliefs or national symbols. 15 \n     U.S. Sec. 1125 provides a civil action against any person who \n     uses a word or symbol in commerce that is likely to deceive \n     as to an affiliation with the commercial activities of \n     another. We believe the proposed legislation submitted to the \n     Congress by the Department of State will adequately prohibit, \n     at all times, use of the red crystal and red crescent that is \n     inconsistent with the Geneva Conventions and its Protocol \n     III.\n       Question: Is there a common understanding among the \n     signatories of the term ``in exceptional circumstances and to \n     facilitate their work'' as used in Article 3(3) and Article \n     4?\n       Answer: The term ``in exceptional circumstances and to \n     facilitate their work'', as used in Article 3(3) and Article \n     4 of the Geneva Protocol III, was not discussed or debated in \n     detail during the December 2005 diplomatic conference which \n     adopted the Protocol.\n       Question: The United States is not a party to the 1977 \n     Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions (Protocol I \n     and II). Protocol III includes several references to those \n     Protocols. By ratifying Protocol III, would the United States \n     assume any obligations under the 1977 Protocols?\n       Answer: No, by ratifying the Geneva Protocol III, the \n     United States would not undertake any new obligations under \n     Protocols I and II. The references in the Geneva Protocol III \n     to provisions of Protocols I and II include the language \n     ``where applicable''. Thus, a provision of Protocol I or II \n     must be ``applicable'' to a party to the Geneva Protocol III \n     in order to confer an obligation on that party. As noted \n     above, the United States is not a party to Protocol I or II.\n       Question: Article 6(1) bars the ``perfidious use'' of the \n     distinctive emblems mentioned in Articles 1 and 2. Is there a \n     common understanding among the signatories of the meaning of \n     this term? Please elaborate.\n       Answer: The term ``perfidious use'' in Article 6(1) was not \n     discussed or debated in detail during the December 2005 \n     diplomatic conference which adopted the Geneva Protocol III. \n     Nonetheless, perfidy is generally understood to mean an act \n     inviting the confidence of an adversary to lead him to \n     believe that he is entitled to, or obliged to accord \n     protection, under the law of armed conflict, with the intent \n     to betray that confidence.\n       Question: Did the U.S. delegation to the negotiating \n     conference make any public statements that relate to the \n     meaning or interpretation of any treaty terms?\n       Answer: No, the U.S. delegation did not make any public \n     statements that relate to\n\n[[Page S10222]]\n\n     the meaning or interpretation of any treaty terms during the \n     December 2005 diplomatic conference which adopted the Geneva \n     Protocol III.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/26/senate-section/article/S10222-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10222]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 27, 2006\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.
