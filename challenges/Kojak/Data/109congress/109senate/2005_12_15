Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. \n3010, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     3010) ``making appropriations for the Departments of Labor, \n     Health and Human Services, and Education, and related \n     agencies, for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2006, and \n     for other purposes,'' having met, have agreed that the House \n     recede from its disagreement to the amendment of the Senate, \n     and agree to the same with an amendment, and the Senate agree \n     to the same, signed by a majority of the conferees on the \n     part of both houses.\n\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of December 14, 2005.)\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there will be 90 \nminutes under the control of the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, under the rule, I have 90 minutes--some of \nit has already been used up in the quorum call--to speak on the Labor, \nHealth and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies \nappropriations bill that is now before the Senate.\n  I again ask any Senator who wants to come over and speak on this time \nto try to be here before 10:30. I would be glad to yield time to \nSenators who want to come over and talk about this bill and why this \nbill should not be passed.\n  At this time of the year when we are seeing all the festive holiday \ndecorations, Christmas trees, all the lights around, there is a certain \nmood about Christmas. It is a mood of being generous and understanding \nthat it is the season for giving. It is the season for thinking about \nthose who may be less fortunate than ourselves. It is also the time of \nthe year when most families of means get together and think about their \ngiving, how they are going to support charities or charitable giving \ntoward the end of the year. It is true in churches all over the country \nand many nonprofit organizations. This is the time of year when people \ndecide to give money to the churches, to everything, the Salvation \nArmy, to all kinds of nonprofits. It is the time of the year when we \nremember ``A Christmas Carol'' by Charles Dickens, the wonderful \nstories about ``A Christmas Carol'' played in high school plays and \ntheaters all over the country every year at this time.\n  Charles Dickens ``A Christmas Carol,'' the story of Ebenezer Scrooge. \n``Bah humbug,'' remember that? That is his familiar saying about \nChristmas, ``bah humbug''--this tight man, ungenerous, miserly, stingy, \nwith no feelings of compassion whatsoever to those less fortunate.\n  We all know what happened in ``A Christmas Carol.'' He is visited by \nthe ghosts of Christmas past and the Christmas future. He then begins \nto see clearly that who he has been and what he has stood for is wrong.\n  The wonderful thing about Charles Dickens and ``A Christmas Carol'' \nis, at the end, Scrooge becomes compassionate and generous and changes \nhis ways.\n  It is a wonderful story for this time of the year. If only life in \nCongress imitated that, if only Congress could follow the example of \nEbenezer Scrooge in the final act of the play. I am sorry to say, in \nterms of the appropriations bill before us, the bill that funds those \nthings that lift people up, that help the poorest in our society these \ndays, to reach down, to give everyone hope, and try to make our society \na little bit more fair and more just--that is what is in this bill. \nThat is what this bill is about. But, sad to say, in this bill, as it \nis before us, Ebenezer Scrooge--the first Ebenezer Scrooge, the one \nbefore he changed in the final act--is in this bill. Scrooge reigns in \nthis bill.\n\n  My friend and distinguished senior member of the Appropriations \nCommittee, the Senator from Hawaii, Dan Inouye, once said of the \nDefense appropriations bill that it defends America. The Labor, Health \nand Human Services, and Education bill, he said, is the bill that \ndefines America. I have thought about that over the years. He said that \na long time ago. I have thought about that over the years, as I have \nbeen chairman of the subcommittee and ranking member, and chairman and \nranking member. Both Senator Specter and I have changed places on this \nsubcommittee now I think going back over 15 years. I have thought about \nthat, that this is really the bill that defines America.\n  So how do we want to define America? As the haves with the beautiful \nChristmas tree, with all the lights, nice cars, warm clothes, good \nfood, who send their kids to the best schools, live in the best \nneighborhoods? That is America? That is it, that is America? And then \ndown below we have people barely scraping to get by, who don't know how \nthey are going to pay the heating bills in the winter, the elderly, \ndisabled, the poor, those who want to get job training, they have lost \ntheir job, but they want to work and are looking for job training \nassistance; families with meager means who want their kids to get a \nhead start in life so they want to send their kids to a Head Start \nProgram so that their kids, too, will have a decent shot at the \nAmerican dream; or families who are low income and have poor schools to \ngo to and so they want to at least have good teachers and good \nfacilities and good programs and textbooks and things for their kids so \nthat their kids, too, can get up on that ladder of success; or families \nwho live in low-income areas who have no health care insurance, have no \nhealth care, and the only thing they have to go to is the community \nhealth center for their health needs, and that is there for them.\n  I don't know. What kind of America do we want? Do we want an America \nwhere at least at this time of the year we think generously? In this \nbeautiful country that we have, all of the riches that we have, can we \nnot find it in our hearts to pass an appropriations bill that at least, \nat least, does not back down from where we were before? You would think \nthat would sort of be the minimum. You would think at least at this \ntime of the year we would say, well, we are not going to do any more \nfor low-income people, but we are not going to cut them back any more \neither. You would sort of think that would be the bottom line.\n  Sad to say, of all of the appropriations bills that this Congress has \npassed this year, this is the only appropriations bill that is cut \nbelow last year's level. This bill, the one that funds education and \nhealth, the one that reaches down to help low-income people, this is \nthe one that is cut, the only one, the only one that is cut.\n  Please, someone explain this to me. Interior appropriations, \nTransportation appropriations, Agriculture appropriations, Military \nConstruction and Veterans, Foreign Operations, Commerce-State-Justice \nappropriations, Homeland Security, Energy and\n\n[[Page S13601]]\n\nWater appropriations, Legislative Branch appropriations--all above last \nyear's level. Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education? Cut \nbelow last year's level.\n  Ten days before Christmas, Congress is poised to deliver a cruel blow \nto the most disadvantaged members of our society. Sadly, unlike in the \nDickens tale, there is no sign of remorse, no nagging conscience, no \nchange of heart at the end of the day.\n  This bill that we passed--and here I want to just, again, pay my \nrespects and my esteem for our distinguished chairman, Senator Specter. \nHe had a tough job. We worked it out. We passed a good bill, a decent \nbill in the Senate. I think it was unanimous, if I am not mistaken--I \nam sorry, it was 97 to 3. Well, that is almost unanimous, 97 votes. \nBoth sides voted for the bill that Senator Specter crafted and that we \nworked together on. But then it went to conference, and the House came \nin and insisted on their position. Again, I just remind Senators and \nothers that what happened is that it came out of conference--I didn't \nsign the conference report. Many of us would not sign the conference \nreport because of these massive cuts. The bill went to the House last \nmonth, and the House rejected it. Then they reappointed conferees, as \nwe did, and we met in conference on Monday evening, this last Monday \nevening, 3 days ago, for 44 minutes--44 minutes, with very little \ndebate. The gavel was pounded, and we adjourned subject to the call of \nthe Chair. Of course, the Chair never called us back, the Chair being \nthe House Member. The House ran the conference this year. So they never \ncalled us back.\n  Now they jiggled a few things around, I guess, dealing with rural \nhealth--I will have more to say about that in a second--to get the \nvotes in the House. Well, the House passed this bill yesterday by two \nvotes. I think it was 215 to 213, if I am not mistaken. Two votes. A \nvery contentious bill, two votes. Now we have it before the Senate. \nThat is sort of the history.\n  Now it is up to us whether we are going to step back and say: No, we \nwill not accept this bill. We will not accept cuts to these vital \nprograms that I am about to go through here. But we will at least go on \na continuing resolution until January. In January, when we come back, \nmaybe there will be a little bit of change of heart and we can do a \nlittle better on this bill.\n  This appropriations bill, as I said, funds things such as the Head \nStart Program, community health centers, special education, job \ntraining, programs that help the neediest in our communities. As I \nsaid, most people who are watching today would probably expect these \nprograms to get an increase this year because we know the poverty rate \nhas gone up in this country, or at least you would expect that we would \nnot cut it below last year's level. As I said, this is the only \nappropriations bill cut below last year's level, and that is about $1.4 \nbillion less than last year. This bill cuts education for the first \ntime in a decade, the first time since 1996 has education been cut. No \nChild Left Behind, all of us here, I am sure, hear a lot about that \nwhen we go back to our States, the comments about No Child Left Behind. \nThe biggest complaint about No Child Left Behind is that they are not \ngetting the money by which to meet the mandate. In other words, it is \nlike an unfunded mandate on our schools.\n  Now, I voted for No Child Left Behind. I was at the table when we met \nwith President Bush in 2001 to get this bill through. At that time, it \nwas agreed upon--at least I thought it was agreed upon--that we would \nhave a funding stream to meet the mandate.\n  The President agreed to that. His people agreed to it. The President \nhimself agreed to that. Yet we are now $13 billion less than what we \nsaid we were going to be at 3, 4 years ago. So it is no surprise that \npeople in our communities are upset about No Child Left Behind. They \nare being told to do certain things, but they are not being funded to \ndo them.\n\n  Well, here we are. We are cutting it again in this bill with a 3-\npercent cut, so there will be $780 million this year less than last \nyear. That now puts us at $13.1 billion below the authorized level. It \nleaves 120,000 children behind.\n  Now, what do I say about that? That is title I. In my opening \ncomments, I mentioned the fact that people who live in low-income areas \nand go to schools that do not have a lot of money need help. They need \nwhat we call title I services, the low-income children. It is $9.9 \nbillion below the authorized level. That means that title I services to \n120,000 children, who are currently eligible to receive them, will not \nreceive them next year. Think about that: 120,000 children who are now \neligible for title I services in our public schools will no longer \nreceive those services next year.\n  What is the American dream for those kids? What about it? What about \nthe American dream for them? And because of the programs we had in the \npast--Head Start, title I, all the other programs--we have been able to \nget kids of low income through secondary school. Now they want to go to \ncollege. Well, back in the 1960s we passed a program called the Pell \ngrants, after our distinguished Senator, Claiborne Pell. It was grants \nto low-income students so they, too, could go to college.\n  Under this bill, the maximum Pell grant award is frozen for the \nfourth year in a row. For the fourth year in a row, we have frozen Pell \ngrants. That means the purchasing power of a Pell grant today is about \none-fifth of what it was 20 years ago. So if you are low income, and \nyou want to go to college, it would be better if you had gotten it 20 \nyears ago because your Pell grant would have gotten you a lot further \nthen. Today it is worth about one-fifth of what it was then.\n  And special education: 28 years ago, this Congress passed the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act to meet a constitutional \nrequirement that we had to provide equal and appropriate education for \nchildren with disabilities--a constitutional mandate. At the time we \npassed that, we said our goal was to have the Federal Government \nprovide at least 40 percent of the additional cost of educating kids \nwith disabilities. That was our goal: We would provide 40 percent of \nthat additional cost to our local school districts. That was 27 years \nago.\n  Last year, we had reached 18 percent. In other words, by last year, \nthe Federal Government was providing 18 percent of the additional cost \nof special education. Under this bill, you would think we would be \ngoing forward to 40 percent. This bill goes backward. We are now at 17 \npercent. We are going in the wrong direction.\n  How many times have we voted on this floor to fully fund special \neducation? We keep voting to have special education fully funded. We \nhave all these meaningless votes. When it comes down to paying for it, \nwe are going in the wrong direction. We are going in the wrong \ndirection, down to 17 percent this year.\n  Well, that is the story in education. The story in education is very \nsimple. If you come from a well-to-do family, and you live in a good \nneighborhood, and you have great schools and high property taxes, don't \nworry, the American dream is there for you. But if you live in a low-\nincome area, with low property values, low property taxes, you have \npoor schools, tough luck, you were not born to the right parents. Tough \nluck. That is what this bill is saying to you. That is education.\n  Look at health. Look at the health programs. What do we do about \nhealth? Again, if you are a Member of the Senate or the Congress, work \nfor the Federal Government, you have a nice Federal Employees Health \nBenefits plan--like all of us do--and you do not worry about it. We \nhave great coverage. I often think many times those of us who serve in \nthe Senate and the House probably think: Well, probably everybody lives \nlike we do. Everybody makes $150,000 a year. You have a couple of \nhouses, drive nice cars, wear nice clothes. We send our kids to great \nschools.\n  Well, I don't know, if I am not mistaken, as to the population of the \nSenate, out of 100 Senators, I think--what is it--80 now are \nmultimillionaires? There is nothing wrong with that. There is nothing \nwrong with having money and achieving the American dream and having \nnicer clothes, a nicer car, a nicer house. There is nothing wrong with \nthat. That is a big part of the American dream. But it seems to me that \nthose of us who have been blessed with good health and good fortune, \nand who have sort of made it to the top of that ladder, it is incumbent \nof us that we leave the ladder down for\n\n[[Page S13602]]\n\nothers to climb, too, not pull it up behind us. And there are Senators \nand Congressmen in this body and in the House who are well to do, who \nhave been blessed with good fortune, who understand the necessity of \nleaving the ladder down, and who fight constantly to make sure we meet \nour obligations as a Congress to reach down and help those less \nfortunate than ourselves.\n  Nowhere is this more true than in health. Nowhere is this more true \nthan in health. We have tried over the years, since we cannot get a \nnational health insurance program passed, to at least sort of block and \ntackle, if you will, to fill in the gaps, to help make sure people of \nlow income can get at least some access to decent health care.\n  One of the most important of those is the community health centers. \nPresident Bush himself said at one time that his goal was to have a \ncommunity health center--it was a State of the Union Message. I was \nthere. President Bush said his goal was to have a community health \ncenter in every poor community by 2008, and we all rose and applauded. \nI believe in community health centers. Obviously, the President does, \ntoo. But where is the President? Where is he? Because in this bill not \none new community health center will be authorized for next year--not \none. Not one will be built in the United States.\n  Health professions. We want to recruit qualified health professionals \nto serve in parts of the country. It is slashed by $185 million.\n  National Institutes of Health: 355 new research grants will be cut. \nIt is the smallest percentage increase in NIH. Actually, it is level \nfunded. It is less than 1 percent, so you might as well say NIH has \nbeen level funded. This is the first time since 1970--35 years--that \nNIH has not received an increase.\n  Rural health programs: cut by $137 million. Now, you know there was \nsome talk when this bill came back out of conference that they \n``fixed'' the rural health problem. Not true. Not true. Not true. Rural \nhealth programs are cut by $137 million and nine vital health \nprograms--trauma care, rural emergency medical services, health \neducation training centers, healthy community access programs, \ngeriatric education centers--are closed.\n  This one I think deserves a little bit more discussion, the geriatric \neducation centers. We know our society is aging. We know geriatric care \nis a kind of a specialty. We want health professionals trained in \ngeriatric care so the elderly among us will be healthier, will have \nbetter diets and nutrition, will have better exercise, and will have \nmore sociability.\n  We know when you do those modest things, you keep the elderly out of \nnursing homes, you keep them out of the doctors' offices, you cut down \non Medicare and Medicaid.\n  Well, here is a map that shows States that will lose geriatric \ncenters. All the stars are geriatric care centers that are going to be \nclosed. Two weeks before the 78 million baby boomers in this country \nbegin to turn 60--that is next month, January--we are going to close \nall these centers. In Iowa, we have a center at the University of Iowa \nSchool of Medicine that trains doctors, osteopaths, nurses, dentists, \nchiropractors. There is a big need. Iowa has the highest percentage of \ncitizens over the age of 85--the highest of any State in the Nation. \nThis bill eliminates the geriatric center at the University of Iowa. So \nthat is education.\n  Let's look at labor. We know that people are unemployed and they want \nto be retrained. The Department of Labor is cut in this bill by $430 \nmillion, the biggest cut ever made to the Department of Labor--the \nbiggest ever, at a time when we keep hearing stories about how China is \ntraining all these engineers and scientists and doing all this stuff. \nWe need to get people retrained, and this bill cuts adult job training \nand youth job training. Adult job training is cut and youth job \ntraining is cut. I guess we are telling people that you may have had a \njob and that job has ended, but you may want to get into the new \neconomy. Do it on your own. You are not going to get any help.\n  People cannot do that. They are broke and out of work, and they have \nkids and families. Rather than advancing, they will go out and find \nsome job that will at least put bread on the table, when they could be \ngetting job training that would allow a better job and higher income in \nthe future. This slashes employment services by $89 million--an 11-\npercent cut in employment services.\n  What are employment services? They are to help people get employed, \nto get a job. Yet we are cutting it, even though we know the rate of \nunemployment has gone up. I don't know how anybody can justify this, \nespecially at this time of the year.\n  Let's take one more look at LIHEAP, the Low Income Heating Energy \nAssistance Program. This bill provides no additional funding for \nLIHEAP. We know that fuel costs are skyrocketing. In Iowa, natural gas \nprices are up 40 percent from last year. Hawkeye Area Community \nAssistance in southeast Iowa reports that LIHEAP funds are likely to \nrun out in mid January, one of the coldest months of the year in my \nState. This bill fails to keep up with this overwhelming need.\n  I was in Iowa a couple weeks ago and I met with some people who \napplied for and are eligible for LIHEAP. I remember one individual who \nis disabled and lives by herself. Her monthly cost for fuel has gone up \nabout 50 percent for what she pays every month. I think she qualifies \nfor $232 in LIHEAP funding. I mentioned that to somebody after I met \nwith these people. I mentioned I had this meeting and this one woman \nwho was disabled lived by herself and she qualified for $232 in energy \nassistance to pay her heating bills. One of the individuals in the \ngroup I talked to said, ``That ought to pay her monthly bill.'' I said, \n``Wait a second, that $232 is for the year.'' They thought it was for \nthe month. I said that is for the year--October, November, December, \nJanuary, February, March, and probably April. That is $232 for 6 or 7 \nmonths. ``I didn't realize that,'' she said, ``I thought it was for the \nmonth.'' I said, ``No, that is for the whole year.''\n  Yet we are cutting back on that. We are not providing enough money to \ntake into account the increased price of propane and heating oil and \nnatural gas prices. I have heard: Don't worry, Harkin, we will come \nback in January and, if we need to, we will pass a supplemental or \nsomething at that time.\n  Don't hold your breath. What about the people who are out there who \ndon't know how to pay their heating bills, who need to get propane \ndelivered, especially in rural communities such as where I live? We \nhave propane tanks. I have a propane tank outside of my house. You call \nup the company to come fill it. Well, all right, you have to pay the \nbill. If you have not paid the previous month's bill, you are not going \nto get it delivered. Unlike natural gas where they cannot cut you off, \nthey can cut you off of propane.\n  So we are going to come back and do this in January or February. Yet \nwe will let anxiety rise, let people worry about it. I can tell you \nright now, in my State of Iowa, there are people living on the edge. \nThey have food stamps, they are getting LIHEAP, many are disabled, and \nmany are elderly. They are thinking, I know that next month is going to \nbe cold--in January and February. Maybe I should not buy the drugs I \nneed now because I will need that money next month. Maybe I will cut \nback a little bit on some of the food I have been buying or I will cut \nback on some of the things I want to do in order to have the money for \nthe heating bills. That is what is happening now. There is anxiety out \nthere. We are saying: That is okay, be anxious; we will come back in \nJanuary or February and fix it.\n  Is that any way to treat people? Put yourself in that position. What \nif you didn't know whether you could pay your heating bill next month? \nWhat if you didn't know whether you were going to be able to pay? They \nsay don't worry about it, we will come back in January and February and \nwe will fix it.\n\n  When we passed a continuing resolution at the end of September, I \ntook the floor to beg my colleagues to reject this part of the \ncontinuing resolution that would cut the community services block \ngrants by 50 percent. Well, we didn't get that done. Then it was put on \nthe DOD bill, and they told us we will take care of that. The funding \nfor community services block grants goes out to help programs such as \nHead Start and LIHEAP. In other words, if you are going to apply for \nLIHEAP, you usually go to some agency--an\n\n[[Page S13603]]\n\narea agency on aging or you go through one of these community action \nagencies. They help you with the paperwork and do the necessary things \nto show that you qualify. If you don't have that, chances are you \nprobably would not qualify.\n  In our continuing resolution, we cut that by 50 percent. We are told \nwe will take care of it, we will fix it. But that was in September. We \nhave gone through October, November, and December--3 months--and the \ncommunity services block grant is still cut by 50 percent. They say we \nwill take care of LIHEAP, too. When? In March, April or May?\n  So whether it is health, human services, education, medical research \nat NIH--no matter what it is in this bill--what can I say; it is awful. \nThis bill is awful. It is not something we ought to hold our heads up \nand be proud about. We ought to be ashamed of this, ashamed that we \ncannot find it in ourselves to meet the needs of the poorest people in \nour country, the neediest.\n  This bill ought to be rejected, and we should go to an honest \ncontinuing resolution, not one that cuts programs but one that at least \nkeeps last year's level. If we want to, then we will come back and fix \nit again next year. But this bill is not deserving of our support. It \nsends the wrong--I don't want to say it sends the wrong message, that \nis not it; it doesn't do the right thing. It doesn't do what a \ngenerous, compassionate nation ought to do for its neediest citizens.\n  Mr. President, I see my distinguished colleague, Senator Kennedy, is \non the floor. Again, I yield the floor to him. There has been no one \nwho has fought harder for these programs in education and health and \nhuman services for all of his adult life, no one who has spoken more \npassionately and forthrightly about the obligation we have as public \nservants to meet the needs of our neediest citizens than Senator \nKennedy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join with those on our side and I think \nmost Americans in commending the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin, for his \nsteadfastness and determination to make sure we are a fairer country, a \ncountry that is going to offer better opportunities for many of those \nwho have been left out and left behind.\n  I listened carefully to his excellent presentation earlier in \noutlining the choices, the alternatives for the American people \npresented in this particular legislative proposal. Once again, he has \nmade the convincing case that we can, as Americans, do a great deal \nbetter in terms of those who have been left behind. With this \nrecommendation that has come back from the conference which represents \nbasically the Republican priorities, there are going to be millions and \nmillions of Americans who are going to have a dimmer Christmastime this \nparticular year.\n  There is an extraordinary irony that we are within 9 days of \nChristmas Eve when families will gather around the Christmas tree, \nexchange gifts, will attend church services, and think about the spirit \nof Christmas. When they realize what their representatives have done in \nCongress, they know they will have a dimmer Christmas with fewer \nopportunities for their children and their parents and for the lives of \nworking families in this country.\n  I thank the Senator from Iowa for his excellent presentation and for \nthe continued battle for decency in our country.\n  As the Senator from Iowa has pointed out, this is an issue of choices \nfor our Nation. Budgets are an issue of choices and priorities. He \nmentioned that during his presentation, and he has repeated the areas \nwhere we are going to see further reductions that are going to make it \nmore difficult for families in this country.\n  But you can't get away from the major fact, that a judgment and a \ndecision has been made by the majority for a tax giveaway, effectively, \nto the wealthiest individuals in this country of $95 billion. Someone \nhas to pay for it. The judgment that has been made by the majority \nparty is that it is going to be the neediest members of our society who \nare going to have their belts tightened over this period of time. \nNothing illustrates it better or more effectively than this chart \nillustrating where the House bill leaves tax cuts for the wealthy \nindividuals under the Christmas tree but leaves middle-class families \nout in the cold. Families with incomes over $1 million will receive \n$32,000, and those families with incomes under $100,000 will receive \n$29. And people can say, Is that what this legislation is all about? \nWhy in the world are you doing that?\n\n  We just listened to the Senator from Iowa talk about all these cuts. \nWhat does that have to do with tax cuts? The fact is, if you are going \nto provide $32,000 in tax incentives to families making over $1 million \nin income and only $29 for families making under $100,000 in income, \nyou not only have the issue of fairness if you are going to go for the \n$95 billion--it is grossly unfair in the distribution--but then you \nhave to ask, How are we going to pay for all of that? The Senator has \ndone a very comprehensive job in presenting that issue.\n  I will take a couple of areas. We have gone through these at other \ntimes with the Senator from Iowa--and I commend him--in the health \narea, the neighborhood health centers, the training of personnel, all \nthe range of public health programs. What I would like to do this \nmorning is take a look at where we are with education funding.\n  This chart shows where we have been in 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, \n2002. Look what has been happening in the last 4 years, and this \nRepublican bill contains a $59 million cut in education programs. Look \nat America's priorities as reflected in education. One can say money \ndoesn't solve everything. It doesn't, but it is a clear reflection of a \nnation's priorities. This chart is backed up with budget figures. I \nhave the budget items right here that reflect all of this. They \nindicate that this is what we are saying to Americans on the issues of \neducation.\n  In my State, we have made some important progress in education. We \nhave made some important progress. Quite frankly, we put in place in \nour State a number of the reforms that were eventually put into No \nChild Left Behind--smaller classes and better trained teachers. In the \nNAEP test, which is the national education test, Massachusetts scored \nhigher than all other states in reading, and tied for first in the \nNation in math. In Boston, we saw a 19 point increase in the number of \nHispanic students proficient on the math test, and a 10 point increase \nfor African American students. These are the first major breakthroughs \nin the history of our country in these disparities. We are beginning to \nsee progress because we have been investing in children.\n  Not anymore. Here is where we are going: Right back to the good old \nbad days in terms of a nation's priorities in education.\n  Today, we will have an opportunity, on the issue of education, to \nreaffirm what we did in the Senate. That was a bipartisan effort that \nproduced a decent bill. We met our obligations under what they call \nreconciliation and the budget items. In a bipartisan way, led by our \nchairman, Senator Enzi, and with the assistance of Republicans and \nDemocrats, what did we do? We--in our committee and on the floor--\nvirtually unanimously in our committee increased the maximum need based \naid to Pell-eligible students to $4,500. Before that, we haven't been \nable to increase the maximum Pell grant. We have been flat on these \nPell grants. These affect the neediest students. There are 400,000 \nstudents who won't go to colleges, who are academically qualified to go \nto colleges, because they can't afford the dramatic increase in the \ncost of tuition.\n  The Senate did something about it. We increased these grants to \n$4,500, and we gave an additional boost to those students in their \njunior and senior years who are going to be studying math and science. \nWhy math and science? Because as all of us understand, if we are going \nto have an innovative economy, we are going to have to invest in the \ndegrees that are going to permit us to have an innovative economy. That \nis necessary not only because we need an invigorated economy, but we \nneed strengthened national security and defense. We were able to do \nthis in the Senate.\n  What has the House of Representatives done? The House of \nRepresentatives has raised the interest rate caps for students to 8.25 \npercent.\n  At that rate, the typical borrower will pay as much as $2,600 more on\n\n[[Page S13604]]\n\nloans. They raise the origination fees on direct loans in the short \nterm, which will cost the typical borrower $400; they impose a new 1-\npercent fee on all students who consolidate their loans. It is going to \ncost students, parents, and families thousands of dollars more to \nattend or to send their children to college. That is where the House of \nRepresentatives goes--increasing the cost of college for working \nfamilies who are already struggling. That is why we believe it is so \nimportant that our negotiators hold firm to the provisions in the \nSenate bill. We meet our responsibilities, and we provide the kind of \nhelp which is so necessary for students in this country. That is what \nour bill does.\n  We will have a chance to vote on our motion to instruct conferees \nthis afternoon. We do not always have a chance to offer amendments or \nmotions to instruct conferees on every subject matter but we will in \nterms of the issues on education and higher education.\n  I want to mention one other item that the good Senator from Iowa has \nspoken to because I think it is enormously important to our fellow \nAmericans. Here is the cover of Nature Magazine, publisher of the \noriginal human genome paper. The Senator from Iowa was visionary in \nensuring that NIH was going to move forward in giving the support for \nthe mapping of the human genome.\n  With the mapping of the human genome, we have seen all kinds of \npossibilities in terms of health care and medical breakthroughs. We \nhave seen medical breakthroughs in the historic diseases that have \naffected every family across America, including all of us in the Senate \nand the House of Representatives. We have seen breakthroughs addressing \nthe problems of Alzheimer's, the problems of Parkinson's disease, the \nproblems of cancer, the problems of diabetes.\n  We have begun to see enormous progress that is being made. We are at \nthe tip of the cusp. That is because we have had bipartisan \ncooperation. The Senate was working together, as we have in education. \nWe worked together, Democrats and Republicans, all during period from \nthe late 90's through 2002 to try to get investment in breakthrough \nresearch. Just about every scientist who has appeared before the \nSenate's Committee on Appropriations says this is the life science \ncentury. The possibility of achieving breakthroughs that benefit every \nfamily in America are virtually unlimited if we invest the resources.\n  Does anyone think that is what this administration is doing? No. They \nsay, let us give $95 billion more in tax breaks to the wealthiest, and \nlet us cut all of that potential right off at the knees. That is what \nthey have done. That is what is before us. That is why the Senator from \nIowa has said that this is an unacceptable budget. Do not take our word \nfor it. Look at the budget, the choices that have been made. If one \ngoes back, at least in my State, and talks with families, they will \nprobably be talking to you now about the Medicare D Program and how \nthey are going to deal with the confusion. But underneath it all, when \nit comes to the end of the conversation, they will say: What are the \npossibilities of getting some real breakthroughs? My father has \nAlzheimer's, my uncle has Parkinson's disease, what are the real \nchances of doing something about these diseases? We have to take care \nof them. We love our family members, what are the possibilities of \nfinding breakthrough treatments to save them?\n  Every scientist and every researcher was moving along on this. We \nthought we had an agreement to consider the stem cell legislation, \nanother area on which the Senator from Iowa has been a leader. We \nthought we had an agreement by the leaders that we were going to bring \nthis up. The House of Representatives has acted on it. My State of \nMassachusetts has acted on it. Other States have acted on it. What is \nwrong with the Senate? They say, we have to take more time to pass more \ntax giveaways to the wealthiest individuals, we cannot afford to take \nthe time to do the stem cell research. No, sir, we cannot do that. I \nsay, this is the priority. That is why the Senator from Iowa is as \nworked up as he is.\n  This is the reality of the NIH budget. Dr. Landis, who is the \nDirector of the National Institute on Neurological Disorders and \nStroke, says:\n\n       If we are to fund new programs, we will have to stop \n     funding old programs. For every young investigator, a senior \n     investigator will be unfunded. For every senior investigator \n     who's refunded, it means a junior investigator won't be.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield on that?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate the Senator pointing this out because \nyesterday a big story broke in the newspapers from NIH. A lot of times \npeople ask what happened with the human genome project, what is it \nleading to, mapping of the entire human genome. A couple of years ago, \nI paid my first visit to Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York, \nLong Island. It is run by James Watson, who is one of the codiscoverers \nof the structure of DNA. What they had embarked upon at that time was \nthe beginning of mapping the genes of all of the cancers known to \nhumans. It was a small project. It was funded and it went along. \nYesterday, a story broke that Dr. Zerhouni, the distinguished and very \ncapable head of the National Institutes of Health, announced that the \nNational Institutes of Health was embarking upon a program to map and \nsequence the genome of every known cancer. They are going to go out and \ntake cells of every cancer, take the DNA out, and map it. They think \nthat it is going to take about 10 years to do. It will cost about $1 \nbillion to $1.5 billion.\n  Is it worthy? Of course. These are the bullets we will have to really \nget at cancer. It is phenomenal in its concept and what it is going to \ndo.\n  Here is the problem, as the Senator from Massachusetts pointed out. \nWe do not give them any extra money to do it. That means if they are \ngoing to embark on this, they are going to have to take money out of \nother research on Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and \neverything else.\n\n  Yesterday, I asked Dr. Zerhouni: Where is this money coming from? \nAlready we are cutting down and cutting back on the number of grants \nthat are being awarded, and now with this appropriations bill that we \nhave, it is going to get even worse.\n  I say to my friend from Massachusetts, when we embarked on mapping \nand sequencing the human genome back in 1991 when I was chairman, we \ndid not take money from some other place. We came to the Congress and \nsaid this is important, let us do it, let us fund it and we did it, and \nwe paid for it.\n  Now, with this tremendous news yesterday that came out about mapping, \nsequencing the genomes of all known cancers, we are now cutting the \nfunding basically for NIH. So I say to my friend from Massachusetts, \nwhat he pointed out, that is what we are confronting. We are \nconfronting cutting back in other needed research to do this or maybe \nwe will not do this after all. That is the dilemma we face. That is the \nposition that this appropriations bill puts us in. I thank the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts for pointing that out.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I welcome that very important statement. What we are \nseeing from the research community is not only the progress that is \nbeing made in basic research, but the acceleration of breakthroughs \nthrough the use of advanced engineering and computers to fast track \nthis kind of research.\n  This chart reinforces the point that the good Senator has made. Four \nout of five new ideas will be rejected in fiscal year 2006. This chart \nstates that 79 percent of grant applications to NIH will be rejected. \nThis will be the highest percent of grant rejections in decades. In \nthese grants lie the possibilities of life saving treatments and cures. \nWhen we are talking about the grants, as the Senator knows, we are \ntalking about serious grants. These are not grants submitted by someone \noff the street saying: Listen, give me some dough, I think I think I \nhave an idea. These grants have been researched, examined, and tested. \nThey are the best, in the opinions of the scientists in that particular \narea, and are worthy of further progress. The opportunities for \nmeaningful progress are in these projects. Eighty percent of those \ngrants are being rejected. Why? Because we want $95 billion to go to \nthe wealthiest individuals in this country. This is who is paying for \nthe budget cut, this right here--the 80 percent of scientists whose \ngrants will be rejected. With the budget squeeze and those few hundreds \nof\n\n[[Page S13605]]\n\nmillions of dollars saved, we will be able to provide the additional \ntax breaks, giveaways to the wealthiest individuals.\n\n  Finally, I want to bring up the subject on which the Senator from \nIowa has been the leader. I want to talk about the dangers of avian flu \nand the dangers of the pandemic. I have listened to the Senator make \nthe persuasive case for our Nation that avian flu is a danger. I have \nlistened to him stop this Senate and say: Look, we have to take action \non this flu legislation. We have to provide the resources to deal with \nthis challenge we are facing.\n  I know this chart is difficult to read, but it is a time line going \nback to 1990. It lists all the warnings from June, 1992 through today. \nWe see the warnings all the way back 1992:\n\n       Policymakers must realize and understand the potential \n     magnitude of a pandemic.\n\n  Here's the warning in Hong Kong, 1997.\n  Here it is in the GAO report:\n\n       Federal and State influenza plans do not address key issues \n     surrounding the purchase and distribution of vaccines and \n     antivirals.\n\n  Here it is from the World Health Organization:\n\n       Authorities must understand the potential impact and \n     threats of pandemic influenza.\n\n  Here it is in Vietnam. Here is the December 2003 outbreak in Korea.\n  The Senator rightfully challenged this body to say we have to do \nsomething about the pandemic threat. And we responded. I had the \nopportunity to be at NIH when the President of the United States made \nhis commitment to this deal with $7.8 billion. What happened? The money \nthat had been requested by the President, the money that had been put \ninto the budget by the Senator from Iowa was struck out. The President \nrequested it. The Senate went on record. We have the warnings. We have \nbeen told about this. Secretary Leavitt has spoken passionately about \nthis issue. Former Secretary Thompson has spoken out about this issue. \nBut we are still falling behind on pandemic preparedness.\n  This chart is familiar to the Senator from Iowa but is one I think we \nneed constant reminding of. Japan had their comprehensive flu plan in \nOctober of 1997; Canada, February `04; Czech Republic, `04; Hong Kong, \n`05; Britain, `05. We have gone through their plans and they are \nextensive. The United States released our plan November of `05, and it \nis incomplete.\n  Do we think in this budget we are giving the assurances to the \nAmerican people that we are going to be leaders, able to deal with a \npossible pandemic? Absolutely not.\n  I share the real frustration of the Senator. He had mentioned earlier \nthe problems they were going to have in terms of heating oil. Under \ncurrent funding, families in Massachusetts will receive LIHEAP \nassistance that is effectively enough for only one tank of oil. \nBasically, low-income and middle-income working families use two to \nfour tanks over the course of the winter, two to four tanks. They will \nhave one tank under current funding levels.\n  I think of the number of people, primarily women, who are waiting to \ngo back to work. There are some women who want to go to work, but they \ndo not have the childcare to take care of their child so they can go to \nwork. In Massachusetts, 13,000 children are on waiting lists for \nchildcare slots. Most of these mothers have the opportunities to go to \nwork, but they can't without childcare assistance. I think that is a \nlong, difficult wait for so many of these families who are constantly \nchallenged to protect their child while going out and working and \nproviding for their family. They are constantly facing that every \nmorning they wake up. Do you think we are helping them? Oh, no, we are \nadding more burdens to them. There will be fewer slots, under this \nparticular proposal, for those families.\n  I think of the 160,000 people who are unemployed in my State and the \n72,000 jobs that are out there waiting for people to be able to \nreceive. The only thing that is missing is the training programs, to \ntrain part of the 160,000, train 72,000 so they can get those jobs. Do \nyou think that is in this legislation so these families will be able to \nparticipate in their community, make even a greater contribution to \ntheir community, plus pay taxes? Oh, no. We are cutting back on that \nfunding. There are further cutbacks on the training programs.\n  We are cutting back or eliminating the dropout prevention programs. \nWe are cutting back on the afterschool programs. The list goes on. The \npoint has been made very eloquently by the Senator from Iowa. As the \nSenator from Iowa has pointed out and as I mentioned, this day is about \nchoices in the Senate. It is about choices--whether, on the one hand, \nwe think in our national interest it is more important to give the $95 \nbillion in tax giveaways to the wealthiest individuals in this country. \nIt is not even a fair plan. If you were for a tax program that was \ngoing to be fair, at least you could make that case, I would think, and \nhold your head up. This is $95 billion, and the $32,000 to every family \nearning over the $1 million and $29 to every family earning under \n$100,000--that is not even fair, if you thought that was the Nation's \npriority, paid for by the most vulnerable people in our society.\n  I do not want to hear a lot from the other side talking about the \nChristmas spirit. We have seen how the Christmas spirit is reflected in \nreal terms in their votes on these issues here. It is not going to be a \nhappy one.\n  In our motion to instruct on higher education, which we will address \nin the afternoon, the following Senators have indicated support. There \nare others that have contacted me about it as well. Senator Harkin and \nSenator Durbin, Senator Dodd, Senator Reid, Senator Lieberman, Senator \nKerry, Senator Reed of Rhode Island, Senator Corzine, Senator Clinton, \nand I will add others as the day goes on.\n  I thank my colleague and friend from Iowa for his excellent \npresentation, for his review of all these issues and questions, and for \nposing the vital issue for the American people, almost at the time of \nChristmas Eve. He has summarized it. There is no one more knowledgeable \nor understanding, or anyone who has been a more forceful advocate of \nall of these causes, than the Senator from Iowa. I thank him for his \nenergy and persuasiveness and his presentation.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry: How much time do \nI have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eleven and one-half minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I don't know if any others want to come \nover. That is why I asked for 90 minutes to point out how bad the bill \nis.\n  Looking at all the various programs that were cut, Senator Kennedy \ndid an outstanding job of going over how devastating some of these cuts \nare going to be in terms of health, education, and medical research. \nGoing through a big bill like this, sometimes your eyes kind of glaze \nover some of the important aspects that people do not bring to the \nforefront.\n  But there is one other cut in this bill that people ought to know \nabout. All the staff who are watching, the Senators who are watching, \nyou ought to know about this cut. It is the maternal and child health \nblock grant being cut by 3 percent. The real per-capita purchasing \npower is now 20 percent below what it was in 2002. What is the maternal \nand child health block grant? It helps low-income mothers get \npreventive health services and medical treatment for children who have \ndisabilities and other special needs.\n  One of the best things we have ever done here to help low-income \nfamilies have healthy babies and to make sure those babies get the best \nstart in life is the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant Program, \nwhich goes out to the States, and it is cut by 3 percent.\n  Please justify that. When you vote later today on whether to accept \nthis appropriations bill, please justify just that one thing: how you \nare going to justify cutting the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant \nProgram.\n  As bad as this bill is, every time I look at it, I ask: Can it get \nany worse? The answer to that is, yes. It is going to get worse. Here \nis why.\n\n[[Page S13606]]\n\n  This bill had a $1.4 billion cut. We have just gone over all of the \nthings that are cut in this bill--the Maternal and Child Health Block \nGrant Program, to education, to medical research--all vital in defining \nthe kind of country we are. Can it get worse? Yes. Here is what is \ngoing to happen. Hang on.\n  Tomorrow or Saturday or sometime, we will be voting on a Department \nof Defense appropriations bill. That Department of Defense \nappropriations bill will have a bunch of things in it that do not deal \nwith the Department of Defense. By the way, it will also have in it a \n1-percent across-the-board cut. We are already told it is in there--a \n1-percent across-the-board cut.\n  All of the cuts we have talked about--Maternal and Child Health Care \nBlock Grant Programs, title I funding, special education, geriatric \ntraining centers, and NIH--all of that is going to get an additional 1-\npercent cut.\n  The way that works out is, the $1.4 billion cut in this bill is going \nto be a $2.8 billion cut. It will double it.\n  As bad as this bill is now with the $1.4 billion cut, by the time we \nare through here tomorrow and voting on a 1-percent across-the-board \ncut, it will be twice as bad--a $2.8 billion cut in this bill.\n  That is because this bill is about $140 billion. You take a 1-percent \nacross-the-board cut, that is $1.4 billion. So get ready. That is why \nthis bill should not be passed in its present form because there is \ngoing to be that 1-percent across-the-board cut. It is going to double.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts mentioned the avian flu bill. We put \nmoney in here for the avian flu. I offered an amendment on DOD \nappropriations back in September. In December, the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee said that is not the proper place for it, that \nit ought to be on the Labor-Health and Human Services bill. I agreed \nwith him. But we didn't know if we were going to have a bill. So it was \nput on the DOD bill.\n  Later on when we got this bill before us, we added $8 billion to get \nus prepared to fight perhaps the biggest flu pandemic the world has \never seen, one that could kill hundreds of thousands of our fellow \ncitizens, one that could hospitalize up to 90 million people in this \ncountry. We put $8 billion in this bill. Guess what. Look at the bill. \nIt is not in there. It is all gone, all taken out.\n  They say they are going to put some more in the Department of Defense \nbill. We haven't seen it yet. But they took it out of this bill.\n  It is going to get worse. Today is December 15. By the way, it is \nalso the anniversary of the adoption of the Bill of Rights to our \nConstitution. I hope it is not too much of a leap to ask on this \nanniversary of the Bill of Rights: What about the rights of poor \npeople? What about the rights of low-income people? What about the \nrights of our people to be protected from the pandemic flu? What about \nthe rights of our citizens to decent health care, the rights of our \ncitizens to a decent education, no matter where they live or the \ncircumstances of their birth? Should the quality of your education be \ndecided by geography, where you live? What about our rights? This bill \nbefore us speaks to rights, human rights, the basic rights of an \nAmerican citizen to decent health, housing, education, a shot at the \nAmerican dream. So on this December 15, 10 days before Christmas, the \nanniversary of the adoption of our Bill of Rights, throughout much of \nthe world it is a season of giving, but here in Congress with this bill \nit is a season of taking away education programs, taking away job \ntraining, taking away home heating assistance, taking away rural health \nprograms, taking away maternal and child health care.\n\n  But what it really takes away is hope. It takes away hope from \npeople, hope for a better life, hope for a better shot at the American \ndream, hope that their children will have it a little bit better than \nwhat they have had.\n  I remember when then-Governor Bush was running for President in 2000. \nHe had a saying at that time--I haven't heard it lately, but he had a \nsaying that the Government can't give hope to people. Well, I beg to \ndiffer. Government can give hope to people. It depends on who is \nrunning the Government as to who is getting the hope. As the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts just pointed out, we have a huge tax bill, more tax \nbreaks for the wealthiest in our society. If you are making over $1 \nmillion a year, you have a lot of hope. You are going to get about \n$32,000 in your Christmas stocking. Thirty-two thousand, you are just \ngoing to get it, a nice tax giveaway for the most affluent in our \nsociety. A lot of hope has been given to them by this Government.\n  But if you are low income, if you live in small rural America, if you \nare elderly, if you are disabled, if you need the help of the \nGovernment to lift you up and to give you some hope for a better life, \nyou don't get hope. It is taken away from you.\n  So what we are saying to low-income families who are working, trying \nto pay their bills, trying to scrape by, trying to keep their families \ntogether, trying to raise their kids, I guess what we are saying is, \nMerry Christmas, hang your stocking, and Congress is going to put a \nlump of coal in that stocking for you. That is what you get.\n  I don't understand how anyone can vote for this bill, especially at \nthis time of the year. I hope our conscience would come to the fore. We \nall know the wonderful story from Dr. Seuss. We recall reading it to \nour kids, ``The Grinch Who Stole Christmas.'' This bill is a bill only \nthe Grinch could love. No funding for avian flu, lowest increase in NIH \nfunding in 35 years, cuts education funding as No Child Left Behind \nrequirements are going up, no increase in college aid, cuts job \ntraining. I could have added a lot more--as I said, cuts in maternal \nand child health care, cuts in geriatric training, cuts in Head Start.\n  Well, if you like the Grinch, I suggest you might want to vote for \nthis bill. But we need to reject it and insist that the leadership \nprovide enough funding to write an acceptable bill. They have the power \nto do it. We did it in the Senate. I repeat, under the leadership of \nSenator Specter, on a bipartisan basis, we passed a bill here 97 to 3. \nWe can do it. If only the President of the United States just said to \nthe House leadership, We want the Senate bill, we want what the Senate \ndid to be fair and just to all our citizens, we would have this. We \nwould have it. That House of Representatives, they will do whatever the \nPresident tells them to do. And if he had waded in there and said, \nLook, we don't accept this, we will have the Senate-passed version, \nthat is what we would have. We would all vote for it and hold our heads \nup high and say we did the right thing for the citizens of our country. \nYes, leadership has the power to do it. They have the White House, the \nHouse, and the Senate.\n  What is stopping them from giving us a decent bill? As I said, we did \nit here. We did it on a bipartisan basis in the Senate. But if we pass \nthis bill now, this conference report, and give this very cruel rush--\nwell, we have to get out of here. We have to go home for Christmas. We \nhave to pass the bill. No, we don't. No, we don't. What we need to do \nis to say no, go back to the drawing board, get us a bill that is \nacceptable, and if we have to go on a continuing resolution for a month \nuntil we come back, or 2 months, until February, we have done that \nbefore. We would be better off going on a real continuing resolution, I \nsay to my friends in the Senate. We would be better off than accepting \nthis bill and putting the pressure on the White House and the House to \ncome back with a better bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is really the essence of it, Madam President. We \nneed a better bill. We should not vote for this one.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I share the concerns and frustrations expressed by the \ndistinguished ranking member of this subcommittee, Senator Harkin, and \nI believe he will agree with me that this bill, the bill that the \nSenate passed was structured as well as we could have structured it, \ngiven the allocation which we had.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I just said so, yes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. My question to the Senator from Iowa would be, on this \nconference report, where I have already said publicly in the conference \nthat I thought it was grossly inadequate, $5 billion under last year on \nhealth, which is our No. 1 capital asset in this country, and \neducation, which is a major\n\n[[Page S13607]]\n\ncapital asset--health so we can function, education to prepare us for \nthe future, and job training in the Department of Labor, I would ask \nhim if--and I have said publicly that I intend to vote against this \nbill as a protest unless my vote is needed. And I know that is unusual \nfor the chairman of the subcommittee to take that position. But I \nbelieve that Senator Harkin and the subcommittee and full Senate and I \nhave done what we can on a bill subject to limitations that we have. I \nwould ask the Senator from Iowa if there is anything more we could do \ngiven the restrictions as to allocation of what we were facing?\n  Mr. HARKIN. First, I say to my friend, and he is a dear friend of \nmine--we have exchanged chairmanships on this committee going back over \n15 years--as I said earlier in the Chamber, and I say again, the bill \nthat our chairman, Senator Specter, put together and that we brought \nout on the Senate floor, we worked it. Our staff worked it. We got a \n97-to-3 vote, I say to my friend. The bill that the Chairman brought to \nthe floor we passed 97 to 3. It was a good bill. We always want to do \nmore, but given the restrictions, that was a good bill. That is the \nbill we ought to have before us now. The problem is that the House \nwouldn't go along with it. But that doesn't mean that we have to go \nalong with it.\n  I appreciate the position the chairman is in. I have been in that \nposition, too, in the past. I appreciate the difficult position he is \nin. But I want the record to be clear that this chairman brought out a \ngood bill, a bill that was passed 97 to 3 by the Senate. I point out \nthat this chairman fought very hard for our priorities and for health \nfunding. I don't want anyone to mistake what I am saying. But I am just \nsaying that the House and I have to say the White House, maybe through \ninaction or not being involved, let it happen and are now confronting \nus with this conference report that is totally inadequate. That is \ntotally inadequate.\n  I might add to my friend from Pennsylvania that what we are facing \nnow is the result of a bad budget. That is what it is. We have a bad \nbudget forced on us. This is sort of the end result of that. But even \nwith that bad budget, we came out with a decent bill. I say to my \nfriend from Pennsylvania, I only wish the White House had been actively \ninvolved in this conference and came down and told the House \nleadership: We want nothing less than what the Senate did.\n  If we had that, we would have had a bill out here that would pass 97 \nto 3 again. It might even pass unanimously.\n  So I say to my friend from Pennsylvania, we can do better than this. \nI say to my friend, I do not enjoy voting against this bill. I do not \nenjoy it. I do not enjoy not signing the conference report. But we can \ndo better. We do not have to accept this. We can go on a continuing \nresolution, a real continuing resolution, and say to the White House \nand the House: No, we need to do better than this.\n  That is why I say to my friend from Pennsylvania--I have the greatest \nrespect and admiration for him, as he knows, and he has fought hard for \nus--sometimes at the end of the day you have to say no, we are not \ngoing to accept it. So that is our position and that is my position on \nthis bill.\n  I say to my friend from Pennsylvania, I know he has other things he \nhas to work on today on different legislation and everything, but we \nhave to send a signal to the House and the White House that this is \nunacceptable. I say to my friend, I thank him for his leadership and \nfor bringing out a good bill here in the Senate, something we were \nproud of and voted for. I was proud to work with Senator Specter on \nthat bill. I am sorry the House and, yes, I say the White House--they \nshould have been involved in this--are now confronting us with a bill \nthat is unacceptable.\n  I thank my chairman.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, to keep America strong, we need to keep \nour families and communities strong. That is why I am very concerned \nabout the fiscal year 2006 Labor, HHS and Education appropriations \nbill.\n  The Senate is scheduled to take up the final conference agreement on \nthis bill, and it is bad news for the American people. This bill is \nfilled with the wrong priorities for our country.\n  If we pass this bill as a result, it will tear apart what is left of \nAmerica's health care safety net and provide fewer investments in \neducation and workforce training.\n  Instead of investing here at home--in our people, our children, and \nour communities--this bill will move us in the wrong direction and will \nundermine America's strength.\n  If we can rebuild schools and hospitals in Iraq out of emergency \nfunding, why can't we provide the resources our own communities need \nhere at home?\n  We know that rebuilding safe and stable communities in Iraq requires \ninvestments in education, training, and health care. And the same is \ntrue in communities across America.\n  If we want to be strong here at home, we need to invest here at home, \nbut this falls far short of what we need.\n  That is really a disappointment because this bill is the most direct \ntool we have each year to improve the health and education of the \nAmerican people.\n  More than any other appropriations bill, the Labor-HHS bill directly \nimpacts almost every family and every community. This is a bill that \nfunds all of the Federal commitment on education. It provides funding \nfor our investment in biomedical research. It funds all of the Older \nAmericans Act programs. And it provides the funding to retrain our \nworkers to succeed in a very competitive global economy.\n  This is an important bill and it should be used to invest in America, \nbut instead--this bill cuts funding by $540 million from last year's \nlevel. When we add in the Medicare administrative funds, the total cut \nsoars to $1.4 billion.\n  That means we are moving in the wrong direction--and families are \ngoing to feel the impact in health care, education and job training.\n  Let me start with health care.\n  This bill cuts total health care funding by $466 million. It cuts \nprograms that help the uninsured get health care, efforts like \ncommunity health centers, the maternal child health block grant; health \nprofessions training, rural health, and CDC disease prevention \nprograms.\n  This bill also moves us in the wrong direction on disease research. \nWe can all be proud of the National Institutes of Health. It is the \nleading source of biomedical research into deadly diseases like cancer, \nMS, Parkinson's, ALS, heart disease, and AIDS. But this bill provides \nthe NIH with the smallest increase since 1970. It would move us \nbackward in our fight against cancer and other terminal illnesses. How \ncan we expect to be able to find vaccines for new global pandemics when \nwe are cutting our investment in critical research?\n  This conference report will also make it harder for uninsured \nfamilies to see a doctor. Specifically, this bill eliminates the Health \nCommunity Access Program, which I have fought to protect for many years \nnow.\n  This is a program that helps our local communities to coordinate care \nfor the uninsured and provide integrated health care services for \nvulnerable families.\n  I have seen the Community Access Program at work in my home State of \nWashington, and I know it is making a tremendous difference.\n  These are the very programs we should be investing in today. The HCAP \nprogram was authorized with broad bipartisan support in 2002. But this \nbill would eliminate this successful community-based model for helping \nthe uninsured.\n  Not only is this bill bad news for health care, it also moves us in \nthe wrong direction on education.\n  This bill represents the smallest increase in education in a decade. \nToday, schools are facing increasing requirements under No Child Left \nBehind. Today, family are facing rising college tuitions. Today is no \ntime to shortchange education. We know the burdens on our local \ncommunity are growing.\n  In the coming year, school districts will face higher academic \nstandards, and they will have to meet new requirements for highly \nqualified teachers. That means they need more help. But the conference \nreports cuts funding for the No Child Left Behind Act by 3 percent.\n  Funding in the conference report is $13.1 billion below the \nauthorized funding level.\n\n[[Page S13608]]\n\n  This bill also marks the first time in 10 years that the Federal \nGovernment will slide backward on its commitment to students with \ndisabilities. The Federal share of special education costs would drop \nfrom 18.6 percent in fiscal year 2005 to a flat 18 percent in fiscal \nyear 2006.\n  Every time we cut back our investment in special education, we are \nputting a higher burden on local school districts, children, and their \nfamilies.\n  In addition, funding for disavantaged students-through title I--will \nreceive its smallest increase in 8 years. In fact, the funding level in \nthis bill is $9.9 billion less than what Congress and President Bush \ncommitted to provide. The bill would leave behind 3.1 million students \nwho could be fully served by title I if the program were funded at the \ncommitted level.\n  Many students are feeling the impact of higher tuition. This year, \ntuition and fees grew by 7.1 percent at 4-year public universities. But \nthe conference report fails to increase the maximum Pell grant award \nfor the fourth year in a row.\n  It also fails to increase funding supplemental educational \nopportunity grants, the Work-Study Programs, and the LEAP Program, \nwhich supports State need-based aid.\n  In addition, the conference report also fails to increase funding for \nGEAR UP and the TRIO Programs, which help disadvantaged students \ncomplete high school ready to enter and succeed in college.\n  This bill also moves us in the wrong direction on helping America's \nworkers.\n  We hear a great deal about economic recovery and building a strong \neconomy. Yet this conference report will cut adult job training by $31 \nmillion. It will cut youth training by $36 million. These programs \nserve over 420,000 people nationwide. How can we hope to strengthen our \neconomy and help those who lost manufacturing jobs if we are reducing \nour investment in job training?\n  All of the tools we need to build a strong economy--and a strong \nAmerica--are on the chopping block in the Conference Reports.\n  Worst of all, this is not the end.\n  We know that there will likely be an across-the-board cut in all \ndiscretionary programs, including those funded in the Labor, HHS and \nEducation appropriations bill.\n  That means even more families will lose access to affordable health \ncare, more children and schools will go without the resources they need \nto meet the Federal mandates of the No Child Left Behind Act, and more \nworkers will see the American dream slip away when their plant closes.\n  This is not the right message to send to our families and \ncommunities.\n  Let's show them that we want to make America strong again and that we \nare willing to invest here at home.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this conference report and force the \nRepublican leadership to invest in making America stronger.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, there is time available on the bill, \nthe Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education bill, for those who \nwish to speak in favor of it. If any of my colleagues wish to do so, I \ninvite them to come to the floor at this time. If there are no speakers \nin favor of the bill on our time, I intend to utilize this time for a \ndiscussion on the PATRIOT Act, which has a very limited amount of time \nto debate and discuss these issues. But I renew my statement. If \nanybody wants to speak in favor of the bill, they should come to the \nfloor at this time and we will find time for them to speak.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/15/senate-section/article/S13608-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13608-S13627]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   USA PATRIOT AND TERRORISM PREVENTION REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2005--\n                           CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The order on the floor at this time is to go \nto the conference report to the PATRIOT Act. So under the previous \norder, the Senate will resume consideration of the conference report to \naccompany H.R. 3199, which the clerk will report.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry: I understood \nSenator Harkin had an hour and a half on Labor-HHS and that I would \nhave half an hour on Labor-HHS, and we would then go to the conference \nreport on the PATRIOT Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Pennsylvania is \npreserved, but it is contemplated that time will be used later in the \nday.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Reserved, but later?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Correct.\n  Mr. SPECTER. May I inquire when later, Madam President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At a time to be determined by leadership.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Will it be in advance of the 3:30 vote on the Labor-HHS \nbill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, while this discussion is going on, if I \ncould also make a parliamentary inquiry.\n  Once we begin on the PATRIOT Act, is it my understanding the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Pennsylvania is in control of an hour \nand the Senator from Vermont is in control of an hour?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. There will be 2 hours \nequally divided between the two leaders or their designees.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Thank you. I appreciate that, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry: We are now \nproceeding for 2 hours on the PATRIOT Act, as the distinguished senior \nSenator from Vermont has said, with 1 hour under his control and 1 hour \nunder my control?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  The clerk will now report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Conference report to accompany H.R. 3199, an act to extend \n     and modify authorities needed to combat terrorism, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nhours equally divided between the two leaders or their designees.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I encourage anyone who has issues of \nconcern to come to the floor at this time so we may consider them. This \nis a very complicated Act. We have had some debate already. On Monday, \nI spoke at some length to describe the Act. On Tuesday, Senator \nFeingold and I had an extended discussion on the act. I talked to other \nof my colleagues who have raised questions about it, specifically the \nSenators who have favored a filibuster. And anybody who has an issue \nwhich they wish to raise, I would invite them to come to the floor so \nwe can take up their concerns one by one. It will be illuminating, I \nthink, to other Senators to hear what we are doing on these issues.\n  At the outset, I will address some issues which have already been \nraised. One contention has been raised by one Senator on a change in \nthe Senate bill to the conference report on challenging efforts to \nobtain documents under section 215. The conference report permits the \nrecipient of a 215 order to ``challenge the legality of that order by \nfiling a petition [with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court].'' \nThat provision omits a phrase from the Senate bill which says that they \nmay ``challenge the legality of that order, including any prohibition \non disclosure, by filing a petition with the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court.'' And the provision is illuminated on, including \nany prohibition on disclosure.\n  Now, one Senator has contended that limits the challenge on \ndisclosure, on the so-called gag order, which is not true. Under the \nconference report, under section 215, you may challenge the order, and \nthat includes challenging a gag order on nondisclosure.\n  This phrase ``including any prohibition on disclosure'' was stricken \nby the conferees, and I believe, on a fair representation, on agreement \nby the distinguished ranking member and me. He is, of course, free to \nspeak for himself. But the reason it was stricken--whether it was with \nSenator Leahy's concurrence or not--was we did not want to limit the \ngrounds for the court on reviewing the order.\n  If you say there is a specification on prohibition of disclosure, it \nmay raise the inference that is the reason the court would challenge \nlegality. But there is no limitation on the challenge\n\n[[Page S13609]]\n\nto legality. That would enable the petitioner to challenge legality on \ndisclosure or for any other reason. So the opportunity to stop a gag \norder is preserved under the conference report.\n  A second contention which has been raised is that the conference \nreport, on section 215, should not have gone beyond the three criteria \nfor establishing a foreign power. In a closed-door briefing, the \nGovernment presented persuasive reasons to have latitude for the court \nto authorize an order for other tangible things, records, where there \nwas a terrorism investigation and there was good reason to believe \nthese other tangible records were important for that terrorism \ninvestigation.\n  That was not in the Senate bill, but that was a provision that was \ninsisted upon and pressed for by the House, and I thought it was within \nthe realm of reason, and we included it. But the protection of civil \nliberties is present in the conference report because the court has to \nfind that it is a justifiable request on a terrorism investigation and \nimportant to that terrorism investigation.\n  I have already gone into some detail on the protections in the bill \nfor delayed notice provisions, so-called sneak and peek, where the \nSenate bill had a 7-day requirement, the House bill had 180 days, and \nwe compromised at 30 days. The Ninth Circuit said that 7 days was \npresumptively reasonable. The Fourth Circuit has set the time at 45 \ndays. In putting in a 7-day notice, we were not unaware of the fact \nthat was a good negotiating position from which to start. The House \nmade a concession of 150 days, going from 180 to 30. We made a \nconcession of 30 days.\n  Bear in mind, on the delayed notice, that is where there is a \nsurreptitious, secret search. There has to be justification to get a \nsearch warrant to have a delayed notice, and it has to be shown to the \nsatisfaction of the judge that if there was not that delay, the \ninvestigation would be impeded.\n  Bear in mind, for those listening, the traditional safeguard on civil \nliberty is to interpose an impartial magistrate between the police, law \nenforcement, and the citizen, so that when you have a delayed notice \nprovision on a showing of cause, that it would impede the investigation \nif that were not the case.\n  We have already gone over in some detail in the Record the tightening \nof the provisions on roving wiretaps, where you have to identify the \nperson involved and show that individual is likely to seek to evade the \nwiretap as a justification.\n  A key provision we added on the Senate side was the sunset provision, \nwhere the Senate bill was a 4-year provision, and the House bill was 10 \nyears. The House wanted to compromise at 7, and we held fast. We had \nassistance from the White House. The President was personally notified \nabout this. The Vice President participated. We got that 4-year sunset, \nwhich is vital, so there will be a review of all of these provisions \nwithin the 4-year period.\n  Bear in mind that the sunset applies to the three controversial \nprovisions in the PATRIOT Act. It does not apply to the national \nsecurity letters because the national security letters were not \nauthorized by the PATRIOT Act. They have been in existence for decades.\n  Now I come to a key consideration under the national security \nletters, where some have objected to the conclusive presumption, where \nthere is a certification as provided for in the conference report by \nranking officials that nondisclosure is required because disclosure \nwould hinder national security or would hinder diplomatic negotiations. \nI have discussed this in the past, but it is worth repeating. The \nSenate bill that was adopted unanimously, 18 to 0, in committee, and \nwithout consent on the Senate floor, had the provision which is \nvirtually identical to the conference report. The Senate bill provides \nthat in reviewing a nondisclosure requirement:\n\n       The certification by the Government that disclosure may \n     endanger the national security of the United States or \n     interfere with diplomatic relations shall be treated as \n     conclusive unless the court finds that the certification was \n     made in bad faith.\n\n  That language is carried over in identical form in the conference \nreport, with the addition that the conference report is more protective \nof civil liberties because the certification cannot be made by just \nanybody in the Government; it has to be made by a ranking official, \nsuch as the Attorney General or Deputy or head of the FBI.\n  Again, let me invite those who have questions on the bill to come to \nthe Chamber so we can have a discussion. If anybody has challenged any \nof the provisions, I invite them to come and state their concerns. I \nbelieve it is in the interest of the consideration by the Senate that \nwe consider the bill in detail so that the Members can understand it \nand we can deal with specific objections that anyone has.\n  How much time remains of the hour in the morning session?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes 25 seconds remains.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I should note while the distinguished \nchairman, the senior Senator from Pennsylvania, is on the floor, that \nnobody has worked more diligently or with more of an effort to reach \nout to both Republicans and Democrats than he has, and to the other \nbody. In many ways, he has a thankless job, because he is committed, as \nI am, to having the best antiterrorist legislation this country can \nhave. He is committed, as I am, to having the best tools for law \nenforcement. He is committed, as I am, to making sure our liberties as \na people are protected.\n  I am concerned that in the process--not through the fault of the \ndistinguished chairman--many wished to raise further issues involving \nour liberties, and people were excluded. That is why we are running \ninto a somewhat contentious issue as to whether this conference report \nshould go forward.\n  Earlier this week, I spoke about how the world changed on September \n11, 2001. Nearly 3,000 lives were lost on American soil. In the \naftermath of the attacks, Congress moved to quickly pass antiterrorism \nlegislation. The fires were still smoldering at Ground Zero when the \nPATRIOT Act became law on October 30, 2001, just 6 weeks after that \nhorrible day. I know how hard we worked. I was chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee when we moved that legislation through.\n  Security and liberty are always in tension in our free society, and \nespecially so in the wake of the attacks of 9/11. The American people \ntoday and the next generation of American citizens depend on their \nelected representatives to strike the right balance. Preventing the \nneedless erosion of liberty and privacy requires constant vigilance and \nvision from those whom the people have entrusted with writing the laws. \nIt is the 100 men and women in this body who have to protect the rights \nand liberties of 290 million Americans.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire on the floor, Mr. \nSununu. He made reference yesterday to one of my favorite quotes from \none of our Founding Fathers, Benjamin Franklin, in which he reminded \nAmericans that those who give up their liberties for security deserve \nneither, and I might say in the long run get neither.\n  I negotiated many provisions of the PATRIOT Act and am gratified to \nhave been able to add some checks and balances that were not contained \nin the initial proposal. But as I said at the time, the PATRIOT Act was \nnot the final bill that I or any of the sponsors on either side of the \naisle would have written if compromise had been unnecessary.\n  In reviewing the PATRIOT Act this year, Congress once again tried to \nstrike the right balance between the security and the liberty that is \nthe birthright of every American. The public expects and deserves that \nwe will diligently fight to achieve that balance. But regrettably, the \nPATRIOT Act reauthorization bill that is now before the Senate does not \naccomplish the goal of balance. The bipartisan Senate bill which the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, under the leadership of the distinguished \nSenator from Pennsylvania, and then the Senate adopted unanimously--\nunanimously, Madam President--reached a better balance. Even that, \nbecause it was a matter of compromise, was not a perfect bill. None of \nus thought it was, and we knew there were matters others insisted be \nadded which we hoped to be improved in conference.\n  But the Senate bill, such as the PATRIOT Act itself, was a \nlegislative compromise achieved through good-faith, bipartisan \nnegotiations. Chairman Specter and I were able to\n\n[[Page S13610]]\n\nachieve a good enough bipartisan compromise that we were able to gain \nthe support of all the Republicans and all the Democrats serving on the \nJudiciary Committee, including Senators who sponsored the SAFE Act. As \na result of that bipartisan compromise and bipartisan effort, it passed \nunanimously in the Senate last July.\n  Then the Senate leadership very responsibly moved promptly to appoint \nconferees. But, unfortunately, the other body did not act as swiftly, \nand we lost several months that could have been used to seek common \nground between the two versions of the bill. The House delayed \nappointing conferees for several months. They pushed us up against the \nDecember 31 deadline from the sunsets in the PATRIOT Act.\n  In fact, it was only last month that the House finally acted to name \nconferees, and then the conference met only once and that was for \nopening statements. There was never a working meeting of the conference \nin which positions were debated and the conferees were able to offer \nimprovements and vote on them. There was no opportunity to debate this \nconference report at a public meeting of conferees, and no opportunity \nto offer improving amendments for consideration by the House-Senate \nconference and votes.\n  Instead--and this is most regrettable--there came a point where \nDemocratic conferees were shut out of the process. Key negotiations \ntook place only among Republican conferees and the administration, \nespecially the Department of Justice. The earlier informal bipartisan \ndiscussions of which I had been involved had been promising. \nRepublicans and Democrats were working to come together, and a good \ndeal of progress was being made.\n  Much of what is good about the conference report that is before us is \nowed to those discussions. I can't help but think what a better bill we \nwould have on the floor today had we not been locked out of those \ndiscussions.\n  I thank Chairman Sensenbrenner for acknowledging this week that we \ncame to those discussions with good ideas for accountability, for \nsunshine, for increased oversight, for judicial review, and for better \nstandards by which to measure the authorities being considered for the \nGovernment. Tentative agreements were also being reached on removing a \nnumber of extraneous provisions, particularly from the House-passed \nbill.\n  The House version of the bill was loaded with extras, many of which \nhad no connection to fighting terrorism. These provisions were tacked \nonto the bill as floor amendments, with little or no debate. Some \nraised very serious concerns. For example, the original House bill made \nsignificant procedural changes to Federal death penalty laws, including \nthe opportunity for Federal prosecutors to convene a new jury and \neffectively get a do-over whenever they fail to persuade a jury to \nimpose a death sentence. Can you imagine what this is saying? A jury \ncomes back and says we cannot agree to give this person the death \npenalty. One of the greatest things about our jurisprudence system is \nour jury system. They come back and the prosecutor says: We don't like \nthat; throw them out, bring in a new jury; let's do it over; let's keep \ndoing it over until we get the result the Government wants. This and \nother provisions were dropped or substantially modified during the \nearly days of bipartisan meetings.\n  No one will be surprised to hear that after Democrats were excluded, \nthe negotiations took a turn and resulted in a one-sided conference \nreport. The media reported in banner headlines on November 17 that \nCongress had arrived at a deal on the PATRIOT Act; it is all over, we \nare finished. A tad premature. In fact, our first draft conference \nreport was widely criticized by Members of Congress in both parties and \nacross the political spectrum. Among the Republican Senate conferees, \nthere was not the minimum support needed.\n  Since that time, I have continued to work with other Senate conferees \nto push for improvements. I also reached out to the White House. I was \nconcerned because the administration had gone along with having us \nexcluded and basically stopping the good progress we were making. But I \nspent time with them; I reached out to them. And I had many discussions \nwith Chairman Specter. The chairman and I have joked on occasion that \nwe spend more time talking with each other, more telephone calls back \nand forth to each other than anybody else. I say that as a compliment \nto Senator Specter because, as chairman, he has worked to include \nRepublicans and Democrats in all these matters. I especially commend \nthe other Senate Democratic conferees--Senators Kennedy, Rockefeller, \nand Levin. They have been constructive throughout the process.\n\n  Since November 17, when it was reported that this process had been \nconcluded, our efforts led to significant improvements in the \nconference report. We succeeded in making this a better bill than the \nearlier one being insisted upon before Thanksgiving. The current bill \ncontains 4-year sunsets, not 7 or 10-year sunsets. It no longer \ncontains a provision that would have made it a crime to merely disclose \nthe receipt of a national security letter. The ban against talking to a \nlawyer without first notifying the Government in connection with the \nreceipt of a national security letter was modified. Imagine that, it \nbasically said you can't talk to a lawyer before you check in with your \nGovernment first. We produced some improvements and better balance, and \nfor that, Americans will be better protected.\n  I believe that there is still more that we can do and should do \nbefore finalizing this important measure. There are more improvements \nthat we can make and, I believe, would have made in an open, bipartisan \nconference. There are more assurances we can include in the law so that \nthe American people can have greater confidence in the law, how it will \nbe utilized and how Congress and the courts will ensure their rights \nare protected.\n  This week, along with Senator Sununu, Senator Craig, Senator \nMurkowski, Senator Hagel and others, I cosponsored a bill to provide a \nshort-term extension of the expiring PATRIOT Act provisions so that we \ncan continue working to make additional improvements to the law. I was \ndisappointed to hear that some are saying that unless this conference \nreport is passed in this form, they would stand by to allow the PATRIOT \nAct provisions like that regarding sharing of important information \nwith our intelligence community to expire. Those of us working to \nimprove the bill are not taking that position. We want the best bill we \ncan achieve and the greater protection of Americans' civil liberties.\n  In an editorial just yesterday, USA Today chided the Bush \nadministration and its allies in Congress for ``resist[ing] calls for \nmore meaningful protection against invasion of privacy and abuse of \ncivil liberties.'' It supported the proposal that Senator Sununu and I \nhave advanced to extend the PATRIOT Act for 3 months to allow more time \nto fix what is wrong.\n  I am encouraged that an FBI spokesman is now endorsing the \nimprovements we have been able to achieve over the last month and which \nthe administration had initially opposed. I know that together we can \ndo better.\n  I did not sign the conference report in its current form. I \nunderstand that on Wednesday more than 200 Members of the House, both \nRepublicans and Democrats, voted to recommit this conference report and \ncontinue working to improve it. I have spoken to Senators on both sides \nof the aisle who would like to see us work out a better bill and \nstronger protections for the American people. I agree and will continue \nworking to achieve that. I believe that the approach Chairman Specter \nand I took of working together in a bipartisan manner is the better \napproach. I think that had we followed through with that approach we \nwould have reached a better balanced bill and the American people would \nhave more confidence in it.\n  It is not just the provisions of the law itself, but the way they are \nadministered and enforced and the perception of the American people \nthat matter. Let me give an example. As librarians and others across \nthe country raised concerns about the use of the business records \nsubpoena authority in the PATRIOT Act, Attorney General Ashcroft could \nhave defused the situation from the outset. Instead he was secretive \nand scared the American people. He would not work with or share \ninformation with the Congress. He claimed variously that the provision \nhad not been used with libraries but then obfuscated when asked whether \nnational security\n\n[[Page S13611]]\n\nletters were being used in connection with library records. He then \nclassified even the number of subpoenas served upon libraries. When \nthat number was later unclassified, is there any wonder that people \nremained concerned?\n  He could and should have worked with Congress to develop better \nstandards and review and oversight. This could have been done \nadministratively or with a legislative correction. Instead, he hoarded \nthe information, raised suspicions and attacked anyone who raised \nquestions about how government power was being used.\n  I want to express my appreciation, in particular to Chairman Specter, \nbut also to Chairman Sensenbrenner. I do not question their motivation. \nI respect them. Together they have worked with us to correct several of \nthe problems and concerns about earlier drafts of this conference \nreport. As I have noted, Chairman Specter did speak with me and we had \nmany, many discussions about these issues throughout this process. I \nappreciate his efforts. I regret that we were not able to achieve more \nof what we had achieved--both the bipartisan process and some of the \nspecifics of the Senate-passed bill.\n  Both Chairman Sensenbrenner and Chairman Specter share my interest in \ncongressional oversight, and the conference report is a better bill \nbecause of it. Throughout the early informal, bicameral discussions and \nearlier during the Senate's bipartisan consideration of this matter, I \nadvanced several ``sunshine'' provisions to facilitate oversight and \nensure some measure of public accountability for how the government \nuses its powers. The conference report contains most of these \nproposals, including public reporting and comprehensive audits on the \nuse of two controversial PATRIOT Act provisions--both business record \nsubpoenas and national security letters.\n  In addition to sunshine provisions, I proposed that we retain the \nsunset mechanism that worked so well in the original PATRIOT Act. Back \nin the fall of 2001, Republican House Majority Leader Dick Armey and I \ninsisted on 4-year sunsets for certain PATRIOT Act powers with great \npotential to affect the civil liberties of Americans. Those sunsets \ncontributed greatly to congressional oversight. The fact that they were \nincluded is the reason we are going through this important review and \nrenewal process now.\n\n  This year, I proposed and the Senate agreed to 4-year sunsets on \nthree key provisions. The House initially approved 10-year sunsets on \ntwo provisions. With steadfastness and hard work on the part of Senate \nconferees, we were able to achieve the 4-year sunsets that were in the \nSenate bill. I commend, as well, Representative Conyers and the House \nfor passing an instruction to the House conferees to abide by the 4-\nyear sunsets. Despite strong majority support in both bodies for 4-year \nsunsets and even after the House had voted to instruct its conferees, \nit took weeks to persuade Republican leaders in the House and the \nadministration to accept this commonsense measure.\n  The enhanced oversight provisions and 4-year sunsets are positive \nfeatures of the conference report to be sure, but many problems remain. \nLet me touch briefly on some of the flaws in this conference report \nthat are still troubling to Senators from both sides of the aisle and \nto those concerned about civil liberties advocates from both the right \nand the left.\n  I will start with the conference report's treatment of section 215 of \nthe PATRIOT Act, the so-called library provision. Under Section 215, \nthe government can obtain a secret order that compels access to \nsensitive records of American citizens, potentially library records, \nand also imposes a permanent gag order on the recipient.\n  Before passage of the PATRIOT Act, there were two significant \nlimitations on the FBI's power to seize business records. First, it \ncould be used only for a few discrete categories of travel records, \nsuch as records held by hotels, motels, and vehicle rental facilities. \nSecond, the legal standard for obtaining the order was demanding. The \nGovernment had to present specific and articulable facts giving reason \nto believe that the subject of the investigation was a foreign power or \nan agent of a foreign power.\n  The PATRIOT Act did away with these limitations. It both expanded \nwhat the FBI may obtain with a section 215 order and it lowered the \nstandard for obtaining it. Under current law, the government need only \nassert that something--anything--is sought for an authorized \ninvestigation to protect against terrorism or espionage, and the judge \nwill order its production. Under this provision, what counts as an \nauthorized investigation is within the discretion of the executive \nbranch.\n  The Senate, in its reauthorization bill, rightly reestablished a \nsignificant check on this power. Under the Senate bill, relevance to an \nauthorized investigation is not enough; the government must also show \nsome connection between the records sought and a suspected terrorist or \nspy. This is a fundamental protection that would not hamstring the \ngovernment, but would do much to prevent overreaching in government \nsurveillance. Unfortunately, it was stripped out in conference.\n  The conference report is deficient with respect to section 215 in two \nother respects. First, unlike the Senate bill, the conference report \ndoes not permit the recipient of a section 215 order to challenge its \nautomatic, permanent gag order. Courts have held that similar \nrestrictions violate the first amendment. Contrary to what has been \nsuggested this morning, I fought to keep the Senate language on this \npoint, to make sure that a section 215 gag order could be challenged in \ncourt. I thought it had been accepted at one point during the early, \nbipartisan negotiations. It was removed from the working draft when the \nbipartisanship ended and Democratic conferees were shut out.\n  Second, the conference report allows the Government to use secret \nevidence to oppose a judicial challenge to a section 215 order. At the \nGovernment's request, the court must review any Government submission \nin secret, regardless of whether it contains classified material. This \nhas the potential to turn an adversarial process into a kangaroo court, \nand will at a minimum make it extremely difficult for the recipient of \na section 215 order to obtain meaningful judicial review that comports \nwith due process. I proposed that we at least allow for limited \ndisclosure, with appropriate security protections, if necessary for the \ncourt to make an accurate determination. Again, this modest attempt to \nallow for meaningful judicial review was tentatively accepted during \nearly bicameral discussions, only to be stripped out when the \nadministration stepped in.\n  The conference report also falls short on its treatment of National \nSecurity Letters, or NSLs. These are, in effect, a form of secret \nadministrative subpoena. They are documents issued by FBI agents \nwithout the approval of a judge, grand jury, or prosecutor. They allow \nthe agents to obtain certain types of sensitive information about \ninnocent Americans simply by certifying its relevance to a terrorism or \nespionage investigation. Like section 215 orders, NSLs come with a \npermanent gag. The recipient of an NSL is prohibited from telling \nanyone that he has been served.\n  Proponents of this conference report have made much of the fact that \nit creates an explicit right to challenge an NSL in court. But even \nunder current law, NSLs can be, and have been, successfully challenged. \nIndeed, in recent litigation, the Government has taken the position \nthat NSL recipients have an implied right to judicial review. Making \nthis right explicit makes sense, but it does not, in itself, offer \nsignificant protection.\n  That is particularly so given the one-sided procedures set forth in \nthe conference report, which do not allow meaningful judicial review of \nNSLs' gag order. The conference report requires a court to accept as \nconclusive the Government's assertion that the gag is needed, unless \nthe court finds the Government is acting in bad faith. This raises \nserious first amendment and due process concerns. I cannot understand \nwhy anyone would insist on provisions that tie the hands of Federal \njudges and further reduce our confidence in the use of these tools. \nYet, despite strong opposition to this provision from the right and the \nleft sides of the political spectrum, House Republicans refused to \nstrip it out.\n\n  In an editorial this week, the Washington Post noted the conference \nreport's deficiencies with respect to section 215 orders and NSLs, but \ncalled them ``not unsolvable,'' adding ``it's\n\n[[Page S13612]]\n\nhard to believe the government is today getting much data through uses \nof these powers that would be forbidden were they written more \naccurately.''\n  Alternatively, Democratic conferees proposed a 4-year sunset on the \nNSL authority. While a sunset is no substitute for substantive \nimprovement, it would at least have ensured that Congress would revisit \nthis issue in depth. We would have had an opportunity, then, to study \nhow these judicial review procedures worked in practice. Again, House \nRepublicans rejected this path to bipartisan compromise.\n  The conference report's treatment of the PATRIOT Act's so-called \nsneak and peek provision is another area of concern. Section 213 of the \nPATRIOT Act authorized the Government to carry out secret searches in \nordinary criminal investigations. Armed with a section 213 search \nwarrant, FBI agents may enter and search a home or office and not tell \nanyone about it until weeks or months later.\n  It is interesting to recall that 4 years ago, the House Judiciary \nCommittee took one look at the administration's original proposal for \nsneak and peek authority and dropped it entirely from its version of \nthe legislation. As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I was \nable to make some significant improvements in the Administration's \nproposal, but problems remained. In particular, Section 213 says that \nnotice may be delayed for ``a reasonable period,'' a flexible standard \nthat has been used to justify delays of a year or more. Pre-PATRIOT Act \ncase law stated that the appropriate period of delay was no more than 7 \ndays.\n  The Senate voted to replace the ``reasonable period'' standard with a \nbasic 7-day rule, while permitting the Government to obtain additional \n90-day extensions of the delay. The conference report sets a 30-day \nrule for the initial delay, more than three times what the Senate, and \npre-PATRIOT Act courts, deemed appropriate. The shorter period would \nbetter protect fourth amendment rights without in any way impeding \nlegitimate Government investigations. The availability of additional \n90-day extensions means that a shorter initial time frame should not be \na hardship on the Government.\n  This conference report also is loaded with extraneous provisions that \nhave nothing to do with the expiring PATRIOT Act authorities, or even \nwith terrorism.\n  I am particularly concerned that the conference report modifies \nhabeas corpus law, a highly controversial move that is wholly improper \nto consider in this context. The changes to habeas added here at the \ninsistence of a small number of Republican conferees have nothing to do \nwith terrorism or even more general tools of federal enforcement. These \nchanges were not included in the PATRIOT Act reauthorization bill of \neither the House or the Senate. They were added late in the conference \nprocess, after all Democratic conferees were shut out of discussions. \nThey received no serious consideration by either body's Judiciary \nCommittee, and have been strongly opposed by the U.S. Judicial \nConference and others. And yet these modifications could have very \nserious consequences--possibly unintended consequences--in habeas cases \nthat are already pending in California and other States.\n  The conference report includes a version of the Combat \nMethamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005, a bill that, like the habeas \nprovisions, is extraneous to the PATRIOT Act reauthorization. The \nversion in the conference report contains troubling provisions that I \nwish could have been debated fully before we were forced to vote on \nthem in this context. A portion of the bill lowers the threshold of the \namount of money or drugs necessary for a defendant to qualify as a \n``kingpin'' and to therefore be subject to a mandatory life sentence. \nThis is an excessively harsh sentence for a pool of people who are not \ntruly drug kingpins. No one has sympathy for producers and dealers of \nmethamphetamines, but the punishment must fit the crime, and in these \ncases, mandatory life is disproportionate.\n  During early negotiations on the conference report, I fought to \nstrike title II of the House bill, which included provisions that \nvastly expanded the Federal death penalty and removed important \nprotections for the criminally accused. I already noted one \nparticularly problematic provision, which allowed Federal prosecutors a \n``do-over'' whenever they failed to persuade a jury to impose a death \nsentence. Another provision was designed to carve out a category of \nhomicides that would be eligible for capital punishment despite the \nfact that the defendant did not himself kill, intend to kill, or \nknowingly create a grave risk of death. Yet another provision would \nhave substantially narrowed the jury's power to consider, as a reason \nnot to impose the death penalty, the fact that other equally guilty \noffenders in the same case were escaping such punishment. These \nextraneous and ill-considered provisions were ultimately dropped from \nthe conference report, for which we should all be grateful.\n  House Republicans did, however, insist on keeping other death penalty \nprovisions in the conference report. The most objectionable of these \nwill revive a small group of pending death penalty prosecutions for \naircraft hijacking murders committed in the 1970s and 1980s. \nSpecifically, it is designed to overrule the district court decision in \nUnited States v. Safarini, which struck the death penalty for a 1986 \nhijacking offense on the grounds that the Federal Death Penalty \nProcedures Act of 1994 could not be retroactively applied to a pre-1994 \ncrime, at least absent clear congressional intent to do so.\n\n  To my knowledge, Congress has never enacted death penalty legislation \nintended to allow the execution of a tiny number of known offenders for \ncrimes they are alleged to have committed from one to three decades \npreviously. Whether the Government can ultimately persuade the courts \nthat this does not violate the letter of the Ex Post Facto and Bill of \nAttainder clauses, it certainly violates their spirit. It is telling \nthat the Department of Justice, in its testimony before the House \nJudiciary Committee, strongly recommended adding in a severability \nclause, in case this provision was ultimately held invalid by a court \nof law. I share the Department's skepticism regarding the \nconstitutionality of this wrong-headed provision, and deeply regret its \ninclusion in the conference report.\n  The reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act must have the confidence of \nthe American people. I believe what we passed in the Senate would have \nthe confidence of the American people. This conference report would \nnot.\n  Congress should not rush ahead to enact flawed legislation to meet a \ndeadline that is within our power to extend. We owe it to the American \npeople to get this right.\n  The bipartisan bill I introduced with Senator Sununu and others to \nprovide a three-month extension for the expiring provisions of the \noriginal PATRIOT Act will give us the time to achieve the best bill for \nall Americans.\n  This is a vital debate. It should be. These are vital issues to all \nAmericans. If a brief extension is needed to produce a better bill that \nwould better serve all of our citizens then by all means, let us take \nthat time.\n  We should not finalize the conference report on the PATRIOT Act \nwithout fully addressing the privacy and civil liberties concerns that \nremain in the conference report. It is our job in Congress to work as \nhard as it takes to protect both the security and the freedoms of the \npeople we represent.\n  A nation built on freedom, as America is, can do better, and if we \nwork together, we will do better.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished senior Senator from \nCalifornia 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The Senator is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the ranking member very much. \nI would like to make a brief statement. I am not sure I can do it in 5 \nminutes. I may have to ask unanimous consent for a little additional \ntime.\n  Today the Senate is taking up the conference report to accompany the \nPATRIOT Act. I am the original Democratic cosponsor of the unanimously \npassed Senate bill, as well as cosponsor of the Combat Meth Epidemic \nAct and the Port Security Crimes Act, both of which are incorporated in \nthe conference report. Thus, it is only after careful consideration \nthat I have determined to vote against cloture tomorrow, and I would \nlike to take a moment to explain why.\n\n[[Page S13613]]\n\n  I fear that it is going to be a very divisive and partisan vote \ntomorrow. The USA PATRIOT Act has been a valuable tool in our effort to \ncombat terror, but it has also become a divisive point of contention \nbetween Democrats and Republicans and, as a result, doesn't have the \nbroad support of the American people. Thus, it is extremely important \nthat every effort be made to reach an accommodation before debate \nbecomes contentious and even more partisan.\n  Outside the beltway, the USA PATRIOT Act has come to be terribly \nmisunderstood. Many believe it is related to Guantanamo Bay and the \ndetention of prisoners. Others believe it authorizes torture or the \nsecret arrest of Americans. It does none of these things.\n  At the same time, some have irresponsibly sought to characterize \nanyone who seeks to improve or criticize the law as somehow playing \ninto the hands of the terrorists. They have implied that the USA \nPATRIOT Act will expire in its entirety on December 31, and we will be \nleft with no defense against terrorist acts. This, too, is untrue.\n  What is true is that when it comes to national security, it is so \nimportant to build consensus. Our efforts to combat terror in general, \nand the authorities in the PATRIOT Act specifically, are diminished in \neffectiveness if they are not seen by most Americans as the product of \nbipartisan effort in Washington.\n  I believe our Nation's safety requires this body to reach compromise \non this bill.\n  That is why, when Senator Specter asked me to join him in introducing \nthe Senate bill, I agreed. I want to say something. Senator Specter has \nbeen a wonderful chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee. He listens, \nhe is open, he is smart, he is legally pristine, and he has been a fine \nleader for the committee.\n  I believed Senator Specter, working with Senator Leahy and the \nmembers of the Judiciary Committee, would be able to build consensus, \nto reach compromise, and deliver legislation that the American people \ncould be confident represented bipartisan agreement, not politics.\n  My confidence in Senators Specter and Leahy and my colleagues on the \ncommittee was well placed. In July, the committee unanimously reported \nthe bill favorably, and shortly thereafter the Senate, again \nunanimously, passed the bill.\n  Having a USA PATRIOT Act reauthorization bill, supported by Senators \nCornyn and Schumer, Kyl and Feingold, Hatch, Kennedy, and every single \nMember of this body gave me great comfort, and I believe was an \nimportant step toward healing the divisive partisanship that has come \nto be associated with the bill.\n  Unfortunately, that spirit seems to have ended. The conference report \nprocess, instead of bringing unity, appears to have had the opposite \nresult: dividing my colleagues by failing to adequately take into \naccount differing views on elements of the bill. The simple result is \nthat in the next day we are likely to divide into two camps.\n  In the end, of course, we will extend the PATRIOT Act's expiring \nprovisions in some form because despite the rhetoric, nobody doubts \nthat the provisions will be extended. What is at issue is whether and \nto what extent modifications are made.\n  What will be lost is the much needed sense that the PATRIOT Act \nrepresents a broad consensus. That may be more important than the \nspecific details of provisions and issues. I believe it is. The bottom \nline is that having a consensus bill is of paramount importance. So I \nrise today because I still believe----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from California how much \nmore time she requires.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. May I have 5 minutes more, please.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield 5 additional minutes to the Senator \nfrom California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator from Vermont.\n  Yesterday, I urged Majority Leader Frist to work as hard as he can to \nbring people back to the table before the vote. The day before, I urged \nAttorney General Gonzales to work with Senators Leahy and Specter \ntoward the same end. I have said the same thing to Senators Specter and \nLeahy personally, and today I renew this request.\n  Press reports today quote insiders saying that efforts to reach \ncompromise have been abandoned. Some seem to believe that a filibuster \nfight would be an opportunity to force Democrats into bad votes, thus \nsecuring partisan advantage in upcoming elections.\n  Others seem to believe that the American people can be tricked into \nthinking that Members such as Senators Craig, Sununu, Murkowski, Hagel, \nObama, Durbin, Feingold, Salazar, and Kerry, all of whom signed a \nmoving letter yesterday explaining why they would vote against cloture, \nare somehow helping terrorists. Still others, counting the votes, think \nthe opportunity to embarrass the administration is too good to miss.\n  I reject these positions. Instead, I ask respectfully that we get \nback to work.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to carefully read the letter sent by \nthis group of Senators. While I do not agree with every one of their \npoints, the key issues they raise have merit and should be addressed.\n  The most important of the issues they raise involve section 215--the \nso-called library provision--and provisions governing judicial review, \nparticularly of national security letters. I believe on these two \nissues, as well as some of the others, continued good-faith negotiation \nwill result in solving the problems in a way that will be acceptable to \na vast majority of this body and will not in any way diminish the \nability of our law enforcement and intelligence organizations to do \ntheir job.\n  Congress has a long and honorable tradition of putting aside party \npolitics when it comes to national security. We were able to do that in \nthe Senate with this bill. So it is critical that this approach be \ncarried forward to the end.\n  I believe the unanimously passed Senate bill represents that \ncompromise. And while I understand that some accommodations must be \nmade to the House, these cannot be so great as to destroy the consensus \nin the Senate that we have built.\n  I know that Senator Specter and Senator Leahy have worked long and \nhard. I also know that Senator Leahy made some compromises to vote for \nthe Senate bill that passed this body unanimously. I asked Senator \nSpecter and Senator Leahy to please try once again to achieve the \ncompromise that we had when the Senate bill passed this body \nunanimously.\n  I believe national security deserves no less, and I believe the \ndistinguished leadership of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Specter \nand Senator Leahy, can achieve this if given the opportunity and if the \nleadership puts its clout behind bringing the House on board as well.\n  Absent that, I will vote for the Sununu legislation to provide an \nelement of time. I also ask that the meth bill, as well as the port \nsecurity bill, be added to his legislation. I thank the ranking member \nand the chairman and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, while the Senator from California is on \nthe floor, I want to thank her for the complimentary comments, and I \nwant to thank her for being a very productive and constructive member \nto the Judiciary Committee not only this year while I have been \nchairman but for many years. She and I had a 30-minute conversation \nyesterday by phone, after working hours, talking about these issues. If \nthere are any specific points that trouble the Senator from California, \nI would be glad to discuss them with her, not only to try to deal with \nany issue she has, but I find that is a good method for acquainting all \nthe Senators with what is at issue in the bill.\n  I note there were no specific issues raised, and I am not asking that \nspecific issues be raised. I heard what the Senator from California \nsaid, and I agree with her about the point of consensus. Senator Leahy \nand I have established a superb relationship, with bipartisanship, \nwhich has made the committee function this year, I think, very \nsuccessfully. I do not think anyone could fault our efforts to come to \nterms. We just could not do it with the\n\n[[Page S13614]]\n\nHouse of Representatives, in a bicameral system, as to what we could \naccomplish.\n  I congratulate Chairman Sensenbrenner for going the extra mile. But \nif we could just run it through the Senate without a bicameral \nlegislature, it would be a little different. Then we would have the \nSenate bill.\n  But there is one thing I would disagree with the Senator from \nCalifornia about--when she says we are going to have a bill. We may not \nhave a bill. The majority leader has said he is not going to go along \nwith the 3-month extension. There is a real issue as to whether the \nHouse will take up a 3-month extension. We face many situations in the \nclosing days of the Congress where the House finishes its work and \ndeparts. We have taken a lot of House bills where we had no choice, \nwhen they were gone. But we may well not have a 3-month extension, and \nthis bill may well expire. That is an alternative which has to be \nconsidered by every Senator. I believe there are some Senators who \nwould say they will take the responsibility for having the bill expire, \nthe act expire. Some will take that.\n  If cloture is not invoked and somebody says, Arlen Specter, go back \nand work on it some more, I will salute and I will be a good soldier \nand I will go back and work on it some more. But there are going to \nhave to be a lot of moving parts coming into place before there is \ngoing to be an extension beyond December 31. I think people ought to \nconsider that.\n  When the majority leader says he is not for it--if he will not take \nit up, there will be none. Even if he does take it up and even if we \npass it, which we might not--if it is not taken up by the House, there \nwill be none. So I believe we have to consider the alternative that \nthere will not be a bill if this bill is not passed. That brings me \nback to my point about the specific objections.\n  I see Senator Sununu in the Chamber, and I am anxious to have a \ncolloquy with him, if he is willing to do so. But I just wanted to \nthank the Senator from California and raise those considerations.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I wonder, Mr. President, if you will allow me a brief \nresponse to the chairman and manager of the bill.\n  Mr. SPECTER. May I suggest it be on the time of Senator Leahy.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I don't want to take Senator Leahy's time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. How much time is remaining to the Senator from Vermont?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 38 minutes. The \nSenator from Pennsylvania has 45 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. And the last colloquy with the Senator from Pennsylvania--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It was on the time of the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I very much appreciate the conversation we had last \nnight, where I tried to share this view. I thank the Senator for \nlistening.\n  It seems to me, and Senator Leahy will certainly correct me if I am \nwrong, that the crux of the problem revolves around two sections of the \nbill. It seems to me there is more than one way to solve that problem. \nI just think if the two of you got together, and the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee of the House, that there might be consensus \nreached. I believe the rest of the bill certainly can go into play. I \ndo not see any problems with those, on my part. But I think Senator \nLeahy, who has participated in this--let me say another thing.\n  I believe there is a real problem in these conferences where people \nget shut out at certain points. It is counterproductive. I would urge \nthat not happen in the future because when it does, I believe it \nconditions, negatively, the entire remainder of the conference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on my time, if the Senator from \nCalifornia would identify the two sections she is concerned with, I \nwould appreciate it.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. It is the national security letters and section 215.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Senator from California and yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I also thank the Senator from California \nfor her involvement. Nobody wants to kill the PATRIOT Act by this \naction. I know our distinguished majority leader has said he would \noppose the extension. We will see what happens in that vote. Many of us \nsay we will oppose things, and they happen. I am talking about the 3-\nmonth extension. Even if the other body has left, they always leave \nback a couple of people who can do things by unanimous consent.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire is in the Chamber. How much time does \nhe wish?\n  Mr. SUNUNU. May I have 4 minutes to touch on a few points?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Let me begin by addressing a concern that was just \nraised. It was suggested that if cloture is not invoked tomorrow that \nthere might not be a 3-month extension and the expiring provisions of \nthe PATRIOT Act, which are now law, would effectively be killed. Why \nwould there not be a some short-term extension of the PATRIOT Act of 3 \nmonths or 6 months? It would be because some Member of Congress--I hope \nno one in the Chamber at the moment--but some Member of the House or \nSenate thinks that we will be better off without a PATRIOT Act, rather \nthan with a 3-month extension.\n  I suggest, No. 1, that is absolutely irresponsible, and, No. 2, that \nanyone who would make that argument is suggesting that the President, \nChairman Specter, and the ranking member, Senator Leahy, are insincere \nin their suggestion that the tools provided to law enforcement under \nthe PATRIOT Act are extremely important tools that law enforcement \ngenuinely needs.\n\n  Anyone who would be willing to oppose a temporary extension and \nprevent some elements of the PATRIOT Act to remain in force is either \nbehaving irresponsibly or they are arguing--and it may be a heartfelt \nbelief on that person's part that current law actually is not as \nimportant as they had previously suggested. I believe everyone can \ndecide for themselves what they think the likely option, the almost \ncertain option would be if cloture is not invoked.\n  With regard to the substantive concerns, there are many. But let me \nfirst address the issue of the national security letters. Under the \nconference report, there is no meaningful judicial review of a national \nsecurity letter or its accompanying gag order because the threshold \nthat has to be met by an individual or a business served with a \nnational security letter is a showing of bad faith on the part of the \nFederal Government. You will never win that argument in court. You will \nnever be able to meet that high a threshold. Therefore, even in the \nmost egregious cases, you will never overturn the national security \nletter or its accompanying gag order.\n  The suggestion that this concern is moot because similar language was \nin the Senate-passed version is irrelevant because that Senate-passed \nversion also included a real standard on Section 215 subpoenas, which \nrequired the individual to be connected to a terrorist or spy; it \nincluded a judicial review of the gag order associated with a 215 \norder; and it included a 7-day notification period for delayed notice, \nor sneak and peak search warrants. All of this, which again, we \napproved in the Senate package, has been scrapped.\n  When we saw the Senate bill, many of us were not happy with that \nnational security letter language. But in that bill we had other \nsubstantial gains for civil liberty protections, and those have been \nleft at the doorstep by this conference report. To come back and say to \nus now that our concerns about national security letters do not count \nbecause they were part of some previous compromise that is no longer \nbefore us avoids the substantive concerns we have raised.\n  There are other problematic provisions that were put into the bill in \nconference that were not part of the Senate bill. Under the conference \nreport, you have to tell the FBI if you want to challenge a national \nsecurity letter or 215. That means you have to tell the FBI you have \nhired an attorney and you have to tell the FBI the name of the \nattorney.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. I ask for 1 additional minute.\n\n[[Page S13615]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield an additional minute.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. I am not a lawyer. I am an engineer by training. But I \nknow of no other provision in law where that is required. Even if it is \nrequired in a few very limited cases in law, I believe this will \nprovide a chilling effect on our right to counsel. I believe such a \nrequirement is an unnecessary limitation on our civil liberties.\n  I have one final point about the arguments made by the administration \nand by some here in the Senate. The suggestion was made that changes do \nnot need to be made because there has been no evidence of abuse of the \nexisting law. We do not seek to insert protections for civil liberties \nin law because we do not trust a particular person. The Framers enacted \nthe fourth amendment to the Constitution, not because they didn't trust \nGeorge Washington but because they wanted to protect these freedoms in \nperpetuity.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the Senator from New Hampshire is wrong \non what this law provides. When he picks up the national security \nletter and says it may be challenged only on the bad faith requirement, \nhe is wrong. There may be a challenge and the national security letter \nmay be quashed under the express terms of the conference report if it \nis unreasonable or oppressive. The national security letter was not \ncreated by the PATRIOT Act, but we took this occasion to put civil \nliberty safeguards in this bill on the national security letter by \neliminating the prohibition against consulting with a lawyer. Today, if \nyou get a national security letter, you can't talk to a lawyer.\n  The conference report gives an explicit right to talk to a lawyer. \nThere had been a provision that before you talked to a lawyer you had \nto tell the FBI who the lawyer was. Senator Leahy raised an objection \nto that point, and he was right, and it was corrected. Yet if the FBI \nasks you who your lawyer is, then you have to tell them. But you don't \nhave to go to the FBI first and disclose who your lawyer is.\n  But there are significant changes in the conference report beyond the \nbad-faith issue that the Senator from New Hampshire talks about, and we \nought to recognize that. But this conference report goes a long way to \nprotect civil liberties by specifically saying you can go to a lawyer \nand get it quashed for certain reasons.\n  As to the bad-faith requirement, the Senator from New Hampshire skims \nlightly over the fact that the Senate bill was even tougher than the \nconference report by going on to other sections. That is obscuring the \nissue. Take up the bad-faith requirement. I already read it a couple of \ntimes, this morning and on Monday and on Tuesday. But the Senate \nlanguage was identical.\n  But the conference report is more protective of civil liberties \nbecause, while the Senate bill said the Government had to certify \nanybody in the Government, the conference report requires a ranking \nofficial.\n  But the Senator from New Hampshire then skips over to the 7-day \nrequirement on notification.\n  There is already a protection of civil rights because the court has \nto make a finding that the delayed notice is important to the \ninvestigation, or will hinder the investigation.\n  To have the Fourth Circuit saying ``45 days'' when you have the \ncurrent law saying ``reasonable,'' which could be anything, as a \nbargaining matter, we come with the Senate report at 7 and the House is \nat 180. We compromised at 30, and I think that is not unacceptable. Is \nit what Arlen Specter would like, or what Senator Sununu would like?\n  But when the Senator from New Hampshire talks about getting an \nagreement where the House and Senate disagrees and you have an impasse, \nyou don't have a bill.\n  Chairman Sensenbrenner went the extra mile. Is he going to go \nfurther? That is a big question? If there is an impasse, there is no \nbill.\n  To repeat, if cloture is not invoked, we don't have a bill, and I \nwill go back to work. I will go back to the drawing board, and I will \ntry to get a bill. But that doesn't say that there will be a bill when \nthe majority leader has said he is not going to take up an extension \nand you have to get agreement from the House.\n  On the section 215 provision, the conference report does give \nadditional leeway beyond the three-pronged test. But we still have \njudicial review which you do not have today; and that is the \ntraditional way of interposing the impartial magistrate between the \ncitizen, on the one hand, and the law enforcement officers on the \nother. There have to be many hurdles gone through to get a terrorism \ninvestigation authorized. It is only a terrorism investigation where \nthe court can allow the latitude to get somebody's records where it is \nimportant to the investigation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I ask to be yielded 1\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I want to be courteous to my colleagues \nwho wish also to speak, so I will briefly address a couple of the \npoints raised.\n  First, I never suggested that the ability, allowed under the \nconference report, to hire a lawyer to challenge an NSL is an \nimprovement. I am for that. I don't know that is some great show of \nbenevolence on the part of the Federal Government that now for the \nfirst time you will actually be allowed to contact a lawyer if you are \nserved with a national security letter. So I appreciate that. But this \nis about much more than that simple fact.\n  Judicial review is important. But to have a meaningful judicial \nreview you have to have at least a threshold, that the recipient of a \nNSL may actually be able to achieve. I suggest that the showing of \noppressive or abusive behavior by the Federal Government, the showing \nof bad faith, is simply too high a threshold to make that judicial \nreview process meaningful.\n  Finally, I come back to the suggestion that if this bill fails on \ncloture, we will not have a bill, and portions of the PATRIOT Act and \nthe lone wolf provision will expire. I do not take that to mean that \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania will not support a 3-month extension. I \nhope and I believe that he would in such an event. I hope and I believe \nthat the House would support such an extension of the expiring \nprovisions because having them remain in place on a short term basis of \n3 months or 6 months, is much more important than having these \nprovisions expire.\n  If those who do not agree with my opposition to cloture on the \nconference report really think they will have no bill, then obviously \ntheir arguments that the PATRIOT Act is a very important piece of \nlegislation don't have credibility.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, when the Senator from Hew Hampshire talks \nabout a high bar for upsetting a national security letter, he overlooks \nthe provision that you can quash, if it is unreasonable.\n  If the judge finds it is unreasonable, is that too high a bar?\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I will address the question and the \nconcern. I think the threshold is too high. But I would prefer that \ntime be provided to others--there are a number of others on the floor--\nwho support my position and oppose cloture.\n  Mr. SPECTER. On my time, I redirect the question to the Senator from \nNew Hampshire who says the bar is too high.\n  Is it a high bar to quash a national security letter, if a court \nfinds it is unreasonable?\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, that is not the only basis on which these \nwill be reviewed. The national security letter and the gag order \nrequire showing of bad faith on the part of the Government. I believe \nthat standard as written in the conference report will prove to be too \ngreat of a threshold for individuals or businesses to have any \nreasonable chance of meeting. We have had 30,000 national security \nletters issued. To the best of my knowledge, none of them have been \noverturned. I think we owe the public a clear, reasonable, and \npragmatic standard in order for those to be overturned. I do not \nbelieve this conference report includes such a standard.\n\n[[Page S13616]]\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the Senator from New Hampshire is mixing \napples and oranges. When he talks about bad faith, he is talking about \ndisclosure. When he talks about a motion to quash a national security \nletter for its being unreasonable, it may be quashed on that ground \nalone.\n  I am not going to ask the question again. I asked it twice. On \nneither occasion was there an answer that it was too high a bar to \nquash a national security letter if it is unreasonable. I will let my \ncolleagues decide that who are voting on this.\n  If the court has latitude to quash the national security letter \nbecause it is unreasonable, this is a fair standard.\n  When the Senator from New Hampshire--if I could have his attention \nbefore he leaves--talks about 30,000 national security letters, I \nalready said on the floor that is the Washington Post. But that is not \naccurate. I have invited my colleagues, and I will not ask the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire if he has sought a classified briefing. But I can't \ntell you what the answer to that is. Although I have asked the \nDepartment of Justice to release information to show the Washington \nPost statement of 30,000 is out of line and not accurate, I ask my \ncolleagues not to vote on this bill based on what they read in the \nWashington Post.\n\n  Where you have a contested issue--and I put this before the Senate on \nMonday--go to the Department of Justice, they will give you a \nclassified briefing and tell you what the facts are. Don't vote on this \nbill by what you read in the Washington Post.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, one concern I have is, the Senator from New \nHampshire is correct, you have an extraordinarily high bar in trying to \noverturn a gag order. It is extraordinarily high and raises in my mind \nsome significant first amendment questions.\n  As to the 30,000, it is difficult to get an answer to this because \nthe Justice Department has been remarkably tightlipped. They have not \nanswered questions. Many times in the normal course of oversight they \nwould not answer the questions. I don't know how many of my letters \nthat have gone down there have been unanswered on these issues. It is \nextremely difficult to get an accurate and complete answer from this \nDepartment of Justice. That is one of the reasons we are so concerned.\n  I might say, the idea that we have to have a classified briefing \nwhich can't be questioned and is totally in the hands of the Department \nof Justice is one of the things that concerns Americans in the PATRIOT \nAct.\n  I yield 1 minute to the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin and 4 \nminutes to the distinguished Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the point the chairman was discussing \nwith the Senator from New Hampshire, it is the Senator from \nPennsylvania who is mixing apples and oranges on the NSL requests.\n  Let me point out these proceedings where you are supposed to \nchallenge an NSL--they are in secret. They are in secret. The person \nchallenging the NSL cannot see what the Government is arguing. So it is \nall well and good to say there is review of the NSL, but the challenge \nis not done in a fair proceeding. It is the chairman mixing apples and \noranges.\n  This is the second time the chairman has urged me to get a classified \nbriefing. I did and it did not change my view of the underlying points \nbeing made, whether the Washington Post was completely accurate or not. \nI had that briefing and I tell you I didn't have the same reaction the \nSenator had.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. On my time, what apples and oranges am I mixing, I ask \nSenator Feingold?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. By not acknowledging the difference of the kinds of \nproceedings that take place with regard to an NSL and normal criminal \nproceedings. Those are different kinds of proceedings.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Of course they are different.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. That makes a difference on how one regards the ability \nto challenge.\n  And the secrecy, the person challenging the NSL cannot even see what \nthe Government has. That is very different than a normal criminal \nproceeding.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Wisconsin does \nnot know the difference between an apple and an orange. This is not a \ncriminal proceeding. If you have a criminal proceeding and a search \nwarrant, you go into a court with a motion to quash and you put on \nwitnesses, although some of those may be in camera.\n  I was a district attorney for 8 years and there are occasions where \nthey are in camera. If there are national security issues involved, \nthey are consistently in camera on a variety of procedures.\n  To say that I am mixing apples and oranges when you compare this to a \ncriminal proceeding simply indicates the Senator from Wisconsin does \nnot know the definition of an apple.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized for 4 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I have enormous respect for Chairman Specter and Senator \nLeahy, and will say what is so troubling about this particular period: \nVirtually every single day, almost every day, we see another report \nabout the administration trying to skew the bounds between fighting \nterrorism ferociously and protecting the civil liberties of the people \nof our country.\n  The front page of the paper today: Secret Pentagon databases are \nkept. Essentially, the administration, when somebody digs it up, finds \nout that all of this is being done--again in secret.\n  As I have said many times, the two concepts--security and civil \nliberties--are not mutually exclusive, and when crafting legislation, \nthey be approached in tandem. In fact, it is my view that the promotion \nof American security and the protection of Americans' rights and \nfreedoms should be mutually reinforcing principles. If one goal is \nabandoned for the other, or one goal carries less importance than the \nother, then a new solution must be found.\n  A new solution is certainly needed in this case. The PATRIOT Act \nconference report reflects the wholesale rejection of this two-pronged \napproach and relegates civil liberties to second class status.\n  The conference report strips out those Senate provisions that helped \nensure good Congressional oversight. It limits the ability of law-\nabiding Americans to defend themselves from possible PATRIOT Act \nabuses. These changes do not make the PATRIOT Act a more effective tool \nfor fighting terrorism; ultimately, they leave Americans more \nvulnerable to violations of privacy and the PATRIOT Act more \nsusceptible to abuse.\n  I am not going to go through the whole bill, but would like to \nhighlight one issue in particular that Oregonians have raised with me--\nNational Security Letters. National Security Letters authorize the FBI, \nwithout judicial approval, to obtain Americans' sensitive information.\n  Senator Specter has enormous technical legal skills, and I am very \nconcerned about the national security letters, as well. I sit on the \nIntelligence Committee. Of course we cannot get into any aspect of what \ngoes on in those debates, but it seems to me any way you parse the \nlegal language with respect to the conference report and the national \nsecurity letters, it is not balanced. It is, once again, skewed against \nthe rights of the individual.\n  The Washington Post recently reported that the FBI is using National \nSecurity Letters to go on fishing expeditions, and the FBI issued at \nleast 30,000 NSLs in the last year alone. In these fishing expeditions, \nthe FBI reportedly casts a wide net, gathering personal information on \ninnocent Americans.\n  The Post article describes the experience of George Christian of \nConnecticut. Mr. Christian manages digital records for three dozen \nConnecticut libraries and reportedly received an NSL seeking ``all \nsubscriber information, billing information and access logs of any \nperson'' who used a specific computer at a certain library branch. The \nFBI reportedly instructed Mr. Christian that he could never talk to \nanyone about the request. In spite of this apparent gag order, he \ndecided to challenge the NSL. The court files are\n\n[[Page S13617]]\n\nsealed, but the Post reported that the judge described the basis for \nthe NSL as laughably vague.\n  With the FBI issuing at least 30,000 NSLs a year, how many other \nAmericans like Mr. Christian are out there? How many Americans have had \npersonal information turned over to the federal government--who they've \ncalled, where they've traveled, what they've bought--because someone \ndidn't have the time or the money to fight an unreasonable NSL? Who is \ngoing to have access to all the information the FBI has reportedly \ngathered that may now be in vast government databases? If any one NSL \ncan be used to gather information on thousands or even tens of \nthousands of Americans, one can only guess how many Americans have \nalready been affected by these fishing expeditions.\n  As pointed out in the Post article, the FBI acknowledged from the \nbeginning that the NSL was an incredible power that had to be used \njudiciously. As one FBI employee stated in a 2001 memo sent to all 56 \nfield offices:\n\n       NSLs are powerful investigative tools, in that they can \n     compel the production of substantial amounts of relevant \n     information . . . However, they must be used judiciously.\n\n  Thirty thousand NSLs a year doesn't sound judicious to me. And 30,000 \nNSLs a year shouldn't sound judicious to the citizens of Oregon.\n  The reporting on NSLs cries out for proper congressional oversight to \nensure that abuse of NSL powers does not occur. For starters, Americans \nmust be armed with the necessary tools to challenge unreasonable \nNational Security Letters. But the conference report further inhibits \nthe ability of Americans to challenge NSLs.\n  More specifically, the conference report requires an NSL recipient \nwho consults with an attorney to give the name of the attorney to the \nFBI. Talk about a chilling effect on the right to counsel! I am not \naware of a provision like this existing in any other area of law.\n  For instance, the conference report imposes criminal penalties on an \nNSL recipient who speaks out in violation of an NSL gag order. So even \nif the NSL recipient believes that the letter is unconstitutional and \nthat his rights have been violated, he could go to jail for 5 years.\n  It is provisions in the conference report like these, which expand \nthe federal government's powers and make it more difficult for ordinary \nAmericans and Congress to challenge abuses of that power, that give me \nserious pause. And there are not just one or two of them. Look in the \nsections concerning requests for business and library records, roving \nwiretaps, sneak and peak searches, and of course NSLs: there is a \nrecurring pattern here and it is very disturbing.\n\n  There are those who claim that there have been no abuses of the \nPATRIOT Act. With all due respect, that is, at best, disingenuous. At \nleast two courts have held that the FBI used its NSL power in an \nunconstitutional manner.\n  And remember, we are talking about powers that include gag rules--so \nhow many others are out there challenging PATRIOT Act activities in \nsilence?\n  There are those who will say, ``I haven't done anything wrong and I \nhave no problem with the government doing what needs to be done to \nfight terror--if they end up with my personal information, but don't \nuse it against me, so be it.''\n  I wonder how that innocent person would feel if the FBI were watching \nover his shoulder as he surfed the Internet, standing by his side and \nnoting whom he calls and when, or standing next to him at the cash \nregister as he pays for a anniversary gift for his wife. Because I'll \nbet he wouldn't be ok with this. And while technology has made \nsurveillance less obvious, this is exactly what some of the more \ncontroversial PATRIOT Act powers allow the government to do with only \nthe vaguest of reasons and little or no oversight.\n  The obligation to demonstrate that the government is not abusing an \nindividual's rights should not be on the shoulders of that individual. \nThat burden should be squarely on the government's shoulders. The 9-11 \nCommission endorsed this notion, recommending that ``the burden of \nproof for retaining a particular governmental power should be on the \nexecutive . . . .''\n  With respect to the overall bill, in our part of the world we are \nterribly concerned about what is going on with methamphetamine. Senator \nSmith and I have worked very closely on a bipartisan basis with our \ncolleagues to get a good anti-meth program. The administration comes \nalong at the 11th hour and politicizes this meth issue at a time when \nwe could pass it with a 100-0 vote.\n  As a cosponsor of the Combat Meth Act, I intend to continue to fight \nfor the passage of the meth bill but not as a part of this badly flawed \nlegislation. And while my decision was made more difficult by the fact \nthat legislation addressing the meth crisis was included in the \nconference report, I will be opposing the conference report and \nopposing cloture.\n  I want it understood I am anxious to work with my colleagues on a \nbipartisan basis, but given this particular climate and the need to \nconstantly keep the teeter-totter balance--fighting terrorism \naggressively, protecting the civil liberties of our country--it seems \nto me we have to be very judicious with respect to how tools such as \nthe national security letter are being used. Any way you cut it, my \ncolleagues, I don't see that taking place.\n  So more time is needed to make the necessary corrections to the \nconference report to ensure that the PATRIOT Act Reauthorization \npromotes Americans' security and protects their rights and freedoms. \nThe Senate should not be coerced into accepting a piece of legislation \nthat allows the Federal Government to reach, unchecked, further into \nthe personal life of every American, with fewer means of appeal and \nless oversight.\n  I therefore urge my colleagues to support the proposal submitted by \nSenator Leahy and Senator Sununu extending the expiring provisions of \nthe PATRIOT Act for 3 months. I ask unanimous consent that my statement \nbe printed in the Record.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, without getting into methamphetamine, \nwhere we have accommodated the interests of the Senator from Oregon and \nother Senators by putting them on this bill because it is a measure \nwhich ought to proceed, let me ask the Senator from Oregon, when he \ncomplains about the national security letters, I ask whether the \nconference report is not a big step over existing law? National \nsecurity letters have been in existence for decades.\n  Mr. WYDEN. National security letters----\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have the floor. I have not propounded \nthe question yet.\n  National security letters have been in existence for decades. While \nwe take up the PATRIOT Act, we have used this occasion to add \nprotections so that whereas today they are secret, we have explicitly \nprovided the right to consult with a lawyer. I don't disagree there \nought to be that right without providing it explicitly. Somebody ought \nto be able to go to a lawyer, but if they get a national security \nletter today, they are betwixt and between.\n  Originally, this legislation had a requirement you had to tell the \nFBI who the lawyer was. The FBI wanted that provision because there are \nsome lawyers who have been alleged to be involved in collusion with the \nterrorist organizations. As I said earlier, Senator Leahy objected to \nthat and I agreed that you ought to be able to hire your own lawyer. If \nthe FBI asks, okay, it is a fair request and you can tell them.\n  Then we provided you can quash those national security letters if \nthey are unreasonable. If you go to a judge and you say, this is \nunreasonable, now the standard of reasonableness is all over the law, \nwhat a reasonable man would do. Is that too high of a bar? There is \njudicial review.\n  You come to the point of disclosure where you have the issue as to \nwhether disclosure will impede the investigation. All through the law, \nthere are limitations on disclosure where there is a legitimate law \nenforcement concern about not impeding an investigation. The \ndetermination as to whether you have a national security issue or are \nimpeding diplomatic relations is a pretty touchy subject. We passed a \nSenate bill with a provision that on national security letters--until \nnow there has been no challenge possible at all.\n\n[[Page S13618]]\n\n  We put statutory challenges in our Senate bill, and renewing a \nnondisclosure requirement, the certification by the Government--anybody \nin the Government, no delineation as to who--``that disclosure may \nendanger the national security of the U.S. or interfere with diplomatic \nrelations shall be treated as conclusive unless the court finds the \ncertification was made in bad faith.'' That is a pretty tough standard. \nBut that was the Senate bill. Then in the conference report, we kept \nit. The Senator from Oregon was one of 100 Senators who did not object \nto the PATRIOT Act being passed by unanimous consent. But in the \nconference report we said let's do a little more here. Before you have \na certification, let's make sure it is somebody who has a lot of \nresponsibility--the attorney general, Director of the FBI, deputy \nattorney general, et cetera.\n  My question to the Senator from Oregon is this: Aren't those at least \nsomewhat meritorious in protecting civil liberties? Should we have \ngotten in conference--in a tough conference where Chairman \nSensenbrenner, head of the House Judiciary Committee, went the extra \nmile--should this bill go down? Should this bill be filibustered \nbecause of that provision?\n  Mr. WYDEN. As my friend knows, I think virtually everything the \nSenator from Pennsylvania does is meritorious. I am troubled, though, \nabout where we are with the national security letters. Yes, they \nexisted for years, but they were greatly expanded with the PATRIOT Act. \nWe know that. I am also concerned as we consider this kind of legal \nlanguage that there will be a chilling effect on the exercise of the \nright to counsel, and I get that again without being able to go into \nthe details because of my examination of the issue. I am not going to \ndebate the Senator's good-faith efforts; they have always been to try \nto strike a balance. But I am concerned that something that even the \nGovernment--the executive branch admits this is a tool that should be \nused carefully, at a time, as I said, when you open the morning \nnewspaper and every day you see another effort to not strike this \nbalance. I think we ought to stay at this national security letter \nissue and deal with concerns raised here with respect to secrecy and \nexercise of right to counsel.\n  My good friend from Pennsylvania and I have worked together on so \nmany issues, and I want him to know of my desire to do it and my \nrespect for his ability to get into some of these technical questions \nin a fashion that is almost unparalleled.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I want to call my colleagues' attention to the fact that \nwe received a letter from nine Senators yesterday who are opposed to \nthe PATRIOT Act. We have a detailed reply which is now being \ncirculated. Again, I ask my colleagues to deal with the specifics. \nAnybody who has any concerns about any specific provisions, come to the \nfloor and we are prepared to discuss them and see if we can satisfy \nthose concerns. Beyond that, I will inform our colleagues as to what \nthis bill is all about so there will be as much information as possible \nbefore the vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask how much time remains for the \ndistinguished Senator from Pennsylvania and how much time does the \nSenator from Vermont have following the discussion the Senators from \nPennsylvania and Oregon had?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 24 minutes; the \nSenator from Pennsylvania has 28 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I suggest the absence of a quorum with the time charged \nequally to both sides.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I object. I don't want any time lost on the quorum call.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I withdraw that request and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we don't have a whole lot of time to \ndebate this bill. The Senator from Vermont is right. He and I are due \nat a meeting on asbestos. The Senator and I are due on many important \nmeetings. I invite anybody who has a question or a doubt about this \nbill to come to the floor and raise their concerns. If not, I will join \nmy colleague in suggesting the absence of a quorum so we can step \nacross the hall to a meeting.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Colorado on the \nfloor. I understand he wishes to speak on this. I ask the Senator how \nmuch time would he require?\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Approximately 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Colorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the PATRIOT Act \nconference report currently before the Senate.\n  I start by beginning to make absolutely clear my commitment to law \nenforcement and our fight against terrorism. I served as Attorney \nGeneral for the State of Colorado for 6 years, and I am intimately \nfamiliar with the specific needs of law enforcement in the fight \nagainst terrorism and with the paramount importance of police work in \nthis area. The peace officer's badge I carried with me was a constant \nreminder of the dedication, performance, and sacrifice that our men and \nwomen in law enforcement make every day as they work to keep us safe. \nAt the end of the day, we will keep America safe when the 800,000 men \nand women who work in local, Federal, and State law enforcement are \nable to do their jobs and have the tools with which to do their jobs.\n  Accordingly, I wholeheartedly support extending all of the law \nenforcement powers provided by the USA PATRIOT Act. On September 11, \n2001, the magnitude of the terrorist threat was something that \ngalvanized the Nation, and it is imperative that we give law \nenforcement officers the tools they need to investigate and prosecute \nterrorists within our borders so that we never face another attack like \nthe ones we saw 4 years ago.\n  While I strongly support measures that allow for the greater \ninformation sharing, it is worth noting that as the 9/11 Commission \ndetermined, even without the powers of the PATRIOT Act it was well \nwithin the reach of law enforcement to prevent the September 11 \nterrorist attacks. We knew al-Qaida was operating within our borders. \nWe knew suspected terrorists were in flight schools in America learning \nhow to fly planes. As the Presidential Daily Brief of August 2001 \nclearly showed, we knew of the possibility that Osama bin Laden was \ndetermined to strike our Nation with airplanes.\n  We had the information to prevent those attacks. Yet we failed to \nprotect the homeland. As my colleagues know, the key goal of the \nPATRIOT Act was to lower the ``wall'' between our law enforcement and \nintelligence agencies that too often prevented the necessary sharing of \ninformation among them. That wall is real and existing; it is a legal \nwall and a cultural wall that is present even today. That wall was \nrecently alluded to in the report card by the 9/11 Commission. That \nwall exists because in our history of intelligence gathering, every \nagency has operated within its own silo.\n  There was very ineffective information sharing about the bad guys \nlaterally across the Federal Government agencies. That wall also exists \nwith the failure to share information between the Federal Government \nand State and local law enforcement.\n  We must do more to break down that wall as we move to a more coherent \nand integrated approach to go after the bad guys. To the extent the \nconference report before us breaks down that wall of communication and \ncontinues to provide the tools to law enforcement to fight the war on \nterror, its provisions are positive, and I support them.\n  In addition, there are a number of other provisions in the conference \nreport that are not related to the PATRIOT Act that are also deserving \nof the support of the Senate. For example, it contains provisions of \nthe Combat Meth Act which I helped introduce at the beginning of this \nsession. This legislation would place restrictions on the sale of \nproducts that contain the primary ingredients in methamphetamine to \nmake it harder for criminals to produce the drug in the first place. \nThe conference report also contains provisions to strengthen port \nsecurity and combat terrorist financing.\n  Without question, the legislation before us contains provisions that \nare worthy of support, but I am disappointed about the bill's failure \nto adequately protect the civil liberties of Americans.\n\n[[Page S13619]]\n\n  Today, December 15, 2005, marks the 214th anniversary of the \nratification of the Bill of Rights in 1791. Among the freedoms \nenshrined in the Constitution is the fourth amendment's guarantee that \nthe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, \nand effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be \nviolated. Let me state that again because that is what is at stake in \nthis debate. The right of the people to be secure in their persons, \nhouses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures \nshall not be violated.\n  It is ironic that we are now considering passing legislation that \nwould greatly undermine that principle. Instead, we should take this \noccasion to reflect on the importance of the liberties guaranteed to \nall of us by that document and to understand that we can give law \nenforcement officers the tools they need to fight terrorists without \nsacrificing our constitutional rights and freedoms.\n  I have worked very hard with my colleagues to achieve that goal. \nEarlier this year, I joined with five colleagues from both sides of the \naisle in introducing the SAFE Act. I am proud of the leadership and \ncourage shown by Senators Craig, Durbin, Sununu, Feingold, and \nMurkowski. That legislation, the SAFE Act, would have extended all of \nthe expiring sections of the PATRIOT Act. It would also have placed \nreasonable limitations on the way those powers are used to protect \nAmerica's fundamental freedoms.\n  As the Senate began its work on the process of reauthorizing the \nPATRIOT Act, I continued to work closely with the SAFE Act sponsors to \nincorporate our commonsense proposal into the Senate reauthorization \nbill. Although the legislation reported out of the Senate Judiciary and \nIntelligence Committees was not perfect, it took important steps to \nprotect the freedom of innocent Americans and passed the full Senate \nwith unanimous support from among the Republican, Democratic, and \nIndependent membership of this body.\n  That is why my colleagues and I fought so hard to see that the \nconference committee remained true to the Senate-passed bill. \nUnfortunately, when the details of the draft conference report were \nreleased in the week before Thanksgiving, it became clear that the \nconferees had retreated from the modest civil liberties protections \nincluded in the Senate bill.\n  My colleagues and I renewed our request that the civil liberties \nconcerns be addressed. We did not ask for all the provisions of the \nSAFE Act. We did not even ask for all the provisions in the Senate \nlegislation. Although we could have easily put this issue behind us now \nif the House had taken up and passed the bill we unanimously adopted in \nthis Chamber, we simply asked the conferees to make modest changes to a \nhandful of critical provisions. Yet those changes were not made.\n  Let me review what some of the remaining concerns are with respect to \nthe conference report.\n  First, section 215. One of the most controversial provisions of the \nPATRIOT Act is section 215. Section 215 allows the Government to go to \na secret court to obtain financial, library, medical, travel, and a \nwhole host of other kinds of records that fall under the extremely \nvague definition of ``any tangible thing.'' The conference report would \nalso impose an automatic permanent gag order preventing the holder of \nthose records from revealing information about the request. It would \nnot permit the recipient to challenge the gag order.\n  To be clear on that point, in order to obtain a search order under \nsection 215, all the Government has to do is to go to a secret court, \nthe secret FISA court, and claim that the order is relevant to an \nongoing terrorist investigation, an application that the court has no \ndiscretion, no authority whatsoever to reject. It simply has to do what \nthe Government asks it to do.\n  The legal standard of relevance is extremely low. ``Relevant \nevidence'' is a very low threshold that can provide no protection to \nthe civil liberties we are trying to protect.\n\n  In contrast, the Senate bill would have restored a clear and specific \nstandard of individualized suspicion, meaning that the Government would \nhave to show that the records in question are linked to a suspected \nterrorist or an agent of a foreign power. In addition, the Senate bill \nwould give the recipient of a FISA order the right to challenge the gag \norder and to receive meaningful judicial review of that order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for another 3 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, another controversial provision of the \nPATRIOT Act is section 505, which authorizes the use of national \nsecurity letters. National security letters are requests for certain \nspecific categories of information, including financial records, \nbusiness dealings, and telephone and e-mail records.\n  Under the conference report, NSLs can be issued without the prior \napproval of a judge and can be authorized by any of several dozen FBI \nfield offices. The Washington Post recently reported that the \nGovernment now issues 30,000 NSLs a year--100 times more than historic \nnorms. I respect and honor my friends and the leadership in the Federal \nBureau of Investigation with whom I have worked for many years, but \nwhen we start issuing 30,000 NSLs a year, we ought to make sure there \nis some oversight with respect to how those NSLs are issued.\n  As with section 215, the conference report does not allow meaningful \njudicial review of an NSL's gag order. Because the Government does not \nneed a judge's approval to send an NSL, meaningful judicial review of a \ngag order is a critical safeguard and is simply missing in the \nconference report.\n  I wish to finally spend just a second speaking about the sneak-and-\npeek searches under section 213. My colleagues and I expressed concern \nabout the sneak-and-peek searches where the target of the search is not \nidentified or notified for a period of several days or even weeks.\n  Prior to the enactment of the PATRIOT Act, law enforcement could \ndelay notification of a search warrant in certain limited cases. The \nPATRIOT Act significantly lowered the standard for delayed \nnotification, allowing sneak-and-peek searches in any case where \n``immediate notification of the warrant may have an adverse result.'' \nThe conference report before us is not much better, as it allows the \nGovernment to wait up to 30 days to notify the target of a property \nsearch.\n  I believe we can do better, and I believe the proposal which has been \nintroduced on a bipartisan basis to allow us an additional 90 days to \ntry to work through some of these issues on the PATRIOT Act could, in \nfact, result in the kind of PATRIOT Act that receives a unanimous vote \nof the Senate.\n  In my own State, liberal and conservative newspapers have said that \nthis Senate has an obligation to protect the constitutional liberties \nof Americans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I ask unanimous consent for 30 additional seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. The Rocky Mountain News said last month that we in the \nSenate should hang tough because fundamental freedoms of America are at \nstake.\n  The Colorado Springs Gazette, a very conservative newspaper, said \nthose insisting on added protections for civil liberties and stricter \nsunset provisions are doing the right thing by holding their ground.\n  The Denver Post editorial said: We support a bipartisan effort to \nblock final passage unless safeguards are reinstated.\n  I believe the Senate can do better in helping us move forward in the \nfight against terror, giving law enforcement the tools they need in \nthat ongoing battle, and at the same time assuring that we are \nprotecting the cherished freedoms of our democracy enshrined in our \nConstitution and the Bill of Rights.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, with all due respect, I think we do not \nneed any newspaper editorials to tell the Senate to hang tough or to \ntell Senators to hang tough or to tell this Senator to hang tough. I \nthink we have hung tough, mighty tough.\n\n[[Page S13620]]\n\n  Let me take up the specifics about what the Senator from Colorado has \nhad to say.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, we have many speakers on our side, and I \njust want to be clear that this time is charged to the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is in control of the time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. There is no doubt about that. I sought recognition, and \nit is on my time. There is no doubt about that at all.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I just wanted to clarify that.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The interruption of the Senator from Wisconsin can be \ncharged on his time.\n  As to section 215, the Senator from Colorado is wrong. The conference \nreport provides that there may be a ``challenge to the legality of the \norder by filing a petition with the FISA court,'' and that petition can \ntake up the gag order.\n  When he talks about the standards, there are the three criteria from \nthe Senate bill, but there is an additional provision that the judge, \njudicial review on a terrorism investigation which has been authorized \nby going through quite a number of hurdles, those records are important \nfor a terrorism investigation. If the Senator is talking about library \nrecords, it has to be the Director of the FBI or the Assistant \nDirector, or the number-three man. They cannot be delegated. So there \nare really safeguards and protections for civil liberties in this bill. \nWe hung tough and we got them.\n  When the Senator from Colorado talks about the conference report on \ndelayed notice, so-called sneak and peak, not much better, I will let \nmy colleagues evaluate whether the Senator from Colorado is right or \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania is right. Currently, under the PATRIOT \nAct, the only limitation is a reasonable period of time, which can be \nanything. The Senate bill came in at 7 days. The House bill came in at \n180 days. The Fourth Circuit has said that 45 days is a reasonable \nperiod of time.\n  Bear in mind that these delayed notice warrants are not issued unless \nthe impartial judicial official standing between the citizen and the \nlaw enforcement officer, the judicial official, is satisfied that there \nought to be a delay. If there is a customary search-and-seizure warrant \nwhich goes out, the target knows they have been served, but these are \nsurreptitious. These are secret. There has to be a showing that the \ninvestigation will be harmed. When we put in 7 days, we were not \nunaware that there would be negotiations and that the House came in at \n180 days. I think we had a pretty good result from the Senate's point \nof view to concede 23 days and the House conceded 150 days.\n  So if the Senator from Colorado thinks that is ``not much better,'' I \nwill rely on my colleagues to decide whether the Senate bill is not a \nwhole lot better as a result of what we did.\n  When he talks about the national security letters, I made this point \nseveral times on the floor, but perhaps the Senator from Colorado has \nnot heard it because he continues to assert the Washington Post story. \nThere have been briefings available, as I said earlier, and the Senator \nfrom Colorado can get one from the Department of Justice, that 30,000 \nfigure is wrong. I cannot say what it is because it is classified, and \nI have asked the Department of Justice to make it an unclassified \ndisclosure, which they have not done so far. I ask the Senator from \nColorado, and I ask all of my colleagues, not to vote on this bill \nbased on what they read in the Washington Post. If they have some \nconcerns, come to the floor and we will find time to listen to their \nconcerns and we will see if we can satisfy them, and certainly in that \nprocess inform other Senators as to what this bill is all about.\n  I think we have come to grips with the concerns which the Senator \nfrom Colorado has articulated.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President----\n  Mr. SPECTER. I have the floor, Mr. President--on the national \nsecurity letters. We have put in safeguards. The national security \nletter can be quashed if it is unreasonable. The conference report has \nset the Senate standard for the conclusive presumption, and I think we \nhave been cognizant of civil rights.\n  I take second place to no one--I know the Senator from Colorado's \nrecord as an attorney general and a protector of civil rights, and I \nhave great respect for it, but I take second place to no one in my \ntenure in the Senate on protecting civil rights, and I think this bill \ndoes that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, a point of inquiry: May I respond to the \nSenator from Pennsylvania on his time for 30 seconds?\n  Mr. SPECTER. No, the Senator may not respond on my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania does not yield.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Thirty seconds?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty seconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Go ahead, on my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, first and foremost, I want to say that I \nhave the utmost respect for the Senator from Pennsylvania as a leader \nand mentor of all of us. Second, I disagree with his conclusions with \nrespect to the protections for civil liberties because when there is a \nsecret court and the leadership of the FBI essentially in charge of \ngiving those protections to these kinds of provisions in the PATRIOT \nAct, it is not going to the point where we need to go to protect our \ncivil liberties.\n  I yield the floor and I thank my good friend and colleague from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. One more point before I yield to the Senator from \nArizona. It is a secret court because they are discussing national \nsecurity matters. National security matters are always classified. We \nare briefed in Senate 407 all the time. We go to a secret room where \nthere are classified materials. There is nothing unusual about that.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I do want to agree with one thing my \ncolleague from Colorado said just a moment ago. He said the fundamental \nfreedoms of Americans are at stake. I agree with that. But they are not \nthreatened by the U.S. Government. They are threatened by foreign \nterrorists who struck us on September 11 and who have continued to \nthreaten us since that time.\n  There was much criticism of our Government as a result of our failure \nto prevent that attack on September 11, particularly when the 9/11 \nCommission reported that there were some things that could have been \ndone that just might at least theoretically have prevented that attack. \nWe quickly acted in the Congress to put in place the legal mechanisms \nto enable our law enforcement and intelligence people to begin \nprotecting the American people. What we found was that there were a lot \nof loopholes in our laws that needed to be filled in order to give our \nlaw enforcement and intelligence people the weapons, the tools, the \nsupport that they needed to protect us.\n  We did that with the PATRIOT Act. However, because of concerns that \npossibly some of these authorities could be abused, we said we are \ngoing to sunset them so that we have to come back and reconsider what \nwe did, and that is what we are all about here now.\n  As a result of significant debate in this body and in the other body, \nwe each passed different versions of a reauthorization of the PATRIOT \nAct, and since then accommodated those differences in what is called a \nconference committee. We are now considering that compromise between \nthe House and Senate versions in a compromised conference committee \nreport. Those of us who helped to write the original PATRIOT Act and \nwere very anxious to get these authorities in place believe that in \nsome respects we have gone too far. We have leaned over too far \nbackward to those who are so afraid that somehow somebody's freedom \nmight be stepped on in this country, that they have not enabled us to \nfight the terrorists that are the real enemy. They have not given us \nthe tools we need. But in order to get the conference committee \nresolved and get the bill on the floor here, we agreed to sign the \nreport and have this debate.\n\n  Now we find there are people on the other side who insist on having \nit all\n\n[[Page S13621]]\n\ntheir way. Every single thing they want has to occur or else they are \ngoing to filibuster the bill. What does that mean? It means they are \ngoing to talk it to death, refuse to allow us to have a final vote on \nit, with the result that the PATRIOT Act is gone on December 31.\n  They say: We will agree to extend it for a little while. That is no \nanswer. We have a process. We have gone through the process. It has \nbeen very difficult. It has been long. It has been hard. We have gotten \na product that is the result of compromise. That is the way we work in \nthe Senate and in the House and in this country, and that compromise \nhas to be voted on, yes or no. If you don't like it, then vote no.\n  Here is what I suggest. We are at war. We have to be responsible and \nserious about what we do. I will say it right now, if the filibuster \nresults in this act ceasing to exist, if there is no more PATRIOT Act \nnext year and an attack occurs in this country and it could have been \nprevented by the provisions of the PATRIOT Act, then everyone who votes \nto support a filibuster will have to answer for that attack.\n  There were some things we could have done in the past. I would like \nto refer to what they are because, from the 9/11 Commission, we know \nthat some of the things we put in the PATRIOT Act might prevent an \nattack in the future, some of the very things that are being criticized \nby those who are suggesting they might filibuster. Let me give just a \nlittle bit of the detail.\n  We now know that one of the things that stood in the way of a \nsuccessful investigation was the previous law, gaps in our terrorism \nlaw that prevented the FBI from doing certain things--in particular, to \nexploit leads that related to al-Qaida.\n  We came tantalizingly close to substantially disrupting or even \nstopping this terrorist plot. The investigation to which I refer \ninvolved a person by the name of Khalid Al Mihdhar. He was one of the \neventual suicide hijackers of American Airlines flight 77, which \ncrashed into the Pentagon, killing 58 passengers and crew and 125 \npeople on the ground. An account of the pre-September 11 investigation \nof Mihdhar is provided in the 9/11 Commission's staff statement No. 10. \nHere is what that statement says:\n\n       During the summer of 2001 a CIA agent asked an FBI official \n     * * * to review all of the materials from an Al Qaeda meeting \n     in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia one more time. * * * The FBI \n     official began her work on July 24, of 2001. That day she \n     found the cable reporting that Khalid Al Mihdhar had a visa \n     to the United States. A week later she found the cable \n     reporting that Mihdhar's visa application--what was later \n     discovered to be his first application--listed New York as \n     his destination. * * * The FBI official grasped the \n     significance of this information.\n       The FBI official and an FBI analyst working the case \n     promptly met with an INS representative at FBI Headquarters. \n     On August 22 INS told them that Mihdhar had entered the \n     United States on January 15, 2000, and again on July 4, 2001. \n     * * * The FBI agents decided that if Mihdhar was in the \n     United States, he should be found.\n\n  At this point, the investigation of Khalid Al Mihdhar came up against \nthe infamous legal ``wall'' that separated criminal and intelligence \ninvestigations at the time. That is a wall, by the way, which will be \nre-erected if this filibuster succeeds and the PATRIOT Act falls. That \nwall, everyone agrees, had to come down. The Joint Inquiry Report of \nthe House and Senate Intelligence Committees describes what happened \nnext:\n\n       Even in late August 2001, when the CIA told the FBI, State, \n     INS, and Customs that Khalid al-Mihdhar, Nawaf al-Hazmi, and \n     two other ``Bin Laden-related individuals'' were in the \n     United States, FBI Headquarters refused to accede to the New \n     York field office recommendation that a criminal \n     investigation be opened, which might allow greater resources \n     to be dedicated to the search for the future hijackers. * * * \n     FBI attorneys took the position that criminal investigators \n     ``cannot'' be involved and that criminal information \n     discovered in the intelligence case would be ``passed over \n     the wall'' according to proper procedures. An agent in the \n     FBI's New York field office responded by e-mail, saying: \n     ``Whatever has happened to this, someday someone will die \n     and, wall or not, the public will not understand why we were \n     not more effective in throwing every resource we had at \n     certain problems.''\n\n  You would think we would have learned the lesson of 9/11. If the \nfilibuster succeeds, those who vote for the filibuster will be voting \nto allow this wall to be reerected. The very wall that we tore down \nwith the PATRIOT Act so the FBI and CIA could talk to each other, the \nvery wall that might have, had we torn it down before 9/11--that wall \nmight have prevented us from discovering two of the key people involved \nin 9/11, and had we stopped them from getting on the airplane, we might \nhave stopped at least one of the attacks of 9/11.\n\n       Whatever has happened to this, someday, someone will die, \n     and wall or not, the public will not understand why we were \n     not more effective in throwing every resource we had at \n     certain problems.\n\n  Unfortunately, this grim prediction turned out to be true; almost \n3,000 people died.\n  We then acted to make sure it would never happen again. Now there are \npeople threatening to filibuster the PATRIOT Act, which will go out of \nexistence on December 31 if the filibuster succeeds, and people will \nwonder how it is that this wall was resurrected after the experience we \nhad.\n  Here is what the 9/11 Commission said about the effect of the wall \nbetween the criminal and intelligence investigations with respect to \nthe investigation of Khalid al Mihdhar:\n\n       Many witnesses have suggested that even if Mihdhar had been \n     found, there was nothing the agents could have done except to \n     follow him onto the planes. We believe this is incorrect. \n     Both Hazmi and Mihdhar have been held for immigration \n     violations or as material witnesses in the Cole bombing case. \n     Investigation or interrogation of these individuals, and \n     their travel and financial activities, also may have yielded \n     evidence of connections to other participants in the 9/11 \n     plot. In any case, the opportunity did not arise.\n\n  As we know, Mr. President, the PATRIOT Act dismantled this legal wall \nbetween intelligence and criminal investigations. It was enacted too \nlate to prevent 9/11, but it will prevent future acts of terrorism \nunless we allow it to expire.\n  I would like to talk about another key investigation prior to \nSeptember 11. I will probably have to get just about 5 more minutes of \ntime. Before I do, let me make just this one point about those who say \nwe do not have to let it expire, we could just extend it for another 3 \nmonths or so.\n  Why do they say that? Because they think they can get some more \nconcessions. The House of Representatives is done making concessions, \nand I agree with them. I would say the concessions already made could \ngo too far, could hamper our law enforcement capability of catching \nterrorists or infiltrating their organizations or finding evidence to \nimplicate them in crimes. Nonetheless, that time is passed. There is no \nmore conference committee to go back to. We have reached all of the \ncompromises, and not everybody can get everything they want. I \ncertainly have not gotten everything I want. But I understand that at a \ncertain point, the people of the United States have to pull together \nand act in a unified way to ensure that we have a law in place that \nwill help us fight this war on terrorism.\n  I think it is extraordinarily selfish to say we have to have our way \nor no way, let the Act expire. Oh, we will maybe let it go for another \n3 months. What kind of uncertainty does that create? Three months, \nusing one set of procedures and not knowing what the law is going to \nbe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. KYL. I ask the Senator from Pennsylvania how much more time he \ncan yield me?\n  Mr. SPECTER. We have only 10 minutes left. Senator Cornyn wants to \nspeak. I need to engage Senator Craig in a dialog.\n  Mr. KYL. I will not ask for any more time, then, except to say at a \nlater time I will tell the story of Zacarias Moussaoui and how the \nPATRIOT Act helps to resolve the situation we couldn't resolve with \nZacarias Moussaoui, either, and had we done that, he may not have been \ninvolved in the 9/11 activities.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEAHY. How much time do I have remaining, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 8 minutes 22 \nseconds. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 9\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield my remaining time to the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank my colleague from Vermont for yielding. I am glad \nI\n\n[[Page S13622]]\n\nhave been able to follow my colleague, my friend and associate from \nArizona, and to say to him: Senator, you are wrong.\n  You are just flat wrong--that this Senate or this Congress is going \nto allow the PATRIOT Act to expire.\n  I find it fascinating, if not almost humorous, that I am on the floor \ndefending the position of Jon Kyl and my chairman, Arlen Specter, who \nbrought a bill to the floor which brought unanimity to the Senate; that \nthey accepted, that the House rejected, in part; and that they are now \nsaying we should not revisit it again. It is a phenomenally unique \nresponsibility.\n  Folks, when we are dealing with civil liberties, you don't compromise \nthem, and you don't let the bad guys win.\n  The Senate of the United States and the Congress and this President \nwill not let the bad guys win. But we are sure not going to compromise \ncivil liberties.\n  How do you do it? The check and balance that has always been within \nthe law is what we strive for today.\n  When I began to become involved in the PATRIOT Act, looking at its \nreauthorization, I knew it would be an uphill battle. I knew it would \nbe an uphill battle because Americans have grown to be frightened. But \nnow they have grown to be emboldened when they recognized that some of \ntheir freedoms were and are at risk.\n  I began to work, as did some of my colleagues. And out of that, \nknowing it must be reauthorized, we produced a piece of legislation.\n  I must say Chairman Specter took us seriously. I am pleased he did. \nThe Judiciary Committee took us seriously. I am glad they did. Out of \nthat commitment came a work product of which all of us were very proud. \nAnd it passed the Senate unanimously.\n  I think those charges are simply untrue, that somehow we wanted to \ndestroy the act or that we wanted it to expire and go away. I know the \nrest of the country doesn't believe us anymore in that sense because \nthey now understand the importance of the balance we are striving to \ncreate.\n  I also find it very unique that we are talking about and focusing on \na very small part of the PATRIOT Act itself. It is not sweeping change \nwe are proposing. It is not sweeping change we hope to achieve by \nopposing cloture and asking the House to reconsider the work we have \ndone. Is it an impossible task and is it a leap too far? Not at all.\n  Look at the House vote yesterday. Two hundred and twenty four voted \nfor the conference report we are now considering. That isn't the \nimportant vote, fellow Senators. The important vote was the 202 who \nagreed that we ought to agree with the Senate on what they had \naccomplished. That is simply 13 short of a majority in the House. \nRarely--and we know that, those of us who have been around a while--do \nyou ever get the House to agree with the Senate as much as the House \nagrees with the Senate on this issue.\n  I am very confident, if the Senate revision of the PATRIOT Act and \nthe reauthorization provision we provided, which passed the Senate \nunanimously, had been on the floor of the House yesterday and that had \nbeen the document being voted on, the vote would not have been 224; it \nwould have been 240 or 250 or possibly 300. It is very possible that \nthey would have been able to achieve that kind of broader support. Why? \nFor all of my colleagues who have joined the debate today, and this is \nwhy I think the issues we are talking about are so important.\n  If we had wanted to kill the PATRIOT Act, we would not have gone as \nfar as we have to work with the chairman and the ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee to fine-tune it and to make sure those safeguards \nare in place.\n  Americans clearly understand we are at war. That does not need to be \nrestated on the floor of this Senate. Blood has been spilled on our \nsoil, and we know that.\n  We recognize the very important task at hand, and the authority we \nhave given our security organizations and our intelligence and law \nenforcement organizations in this area.\n  But it is incumbent upon me, and it is incumbent upon all of us, to \nmake sure that we don't gray or in some way make it easier for free \ncitizens to have their rights violated, either by accident or if by a \nrogue investigator who found he or she could use the privilege granted \nhere to somehow leverage a situation of a free citizen. And that is not \nwhat we are about.\n  There is so much to be said here, and my time is very limited.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the ``Dear Colleague'' letter that many \nof us sent out yesterday to our colleagues that breaks down part by \npart what we have done be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 14, 2005.\n       Dear Colleague: Prior to the Thanksgiving recess, several \n     Senators expressed strong opposition to the draft Patriot Act \n     reauthorization conference report that was circulated by the \n     conferees. We were gratified that Congress did not attempt to \n     rush through a flawed conference report at that time, and we \n     hoped the conferees would make significant improvements to \n     the conference report before we returned to session this \n     month.\n       We write to express our grave disappointment that the \n     conference committee has made so few changes to the \n     conference report since then. And now, in the last week of \n     the session, the Senate is being asked to reauthorize the \n     Patriot Act without adequate opportunity for debate. If the \n     conference report comes to the Senate in the same form that \n     it was filed in the House last week, we will oppose cloture \n     on the conference report. We urge you to do the same.\n       As you know, the Senate version of the bill, passed by \n     unanimous consent in July, was itself a compromise that \n     resulted from intense negotiations by Senators from all sides \n     of the partisan and ideological divides. That bill did not \n     contain many Patriot Act reforms that we support, but it took \n     important steps to protect the freedoms of innocent Americans \n     while also ensuring that the government has the power it \n     needs to investigate potential terrorists and terrorist \n     activity. Although the conference report contains some \n     positive provisions, it unfortunately still retreats too far \n     from the bipartisan consensus reached in the Senate. It fails \n     to make some vitally important reforms and in some areas \n     actually makes the law worse.\n       Last week, Chairman Specter circulated a Dear Colleague \n     suggesting the conference report as drafted addresses the \n     concerns raised about potential civil liberties abuses. We \n     credit Chairman Specter for improving the conference report. \n     However, the most important substantive reforms from the \n     Senate bill were excluded from the conference report. The \n     original cosponors of the SAFE Act (Senators Craig, Durbin, \n     Sununu, Feingold, Murkowski, Salazar) identified several \n     items before Thanksgiving as problematic and indicated they \n     would not support the conference report unless additional \n     changes were made in those areas. Those issues were not \n     adequately addressed. They include the following:\n       The conference report would allow the government to obtain \n     library, medical and gun records and other sensitive personal \n     information under Section 215 of the Patriot Act on a mere \n     showing that those records are relevant to an authorized \n     intelligence investigation. As business groups like the U.S. \n     Chamber of Commerce have argued, this would allow government \n     fishing expeditions targeting innocent Americans. We believe \n     the government should be required to convince a judge that \n     the records they are seeking have some connection to a \n     suspected terrorist or spy, as the three-part standard in the \n     Senate bill would mandate.\n       Some conferees argue that the language in the conference \n     report would permit the government to use the ``relevance'' \n     standard only in limited, extraordinary circumstances, and \n     that the Senate bill's three-part standard would continue to \n     apply in most circumstances. To the contrary, the conference \n     report never requires the government to demonstrate that the \n     individual whose records are sought is connected to a \n     terrorist or spy; rather, it permits the ``relevance'' \n     standard to be used in every case.\n       It has also been asserted that the government should not be \n     required to abide by the three-part Senate standard because \n     the Department of Justice demonstrated in a classified \n     setting that ``circumstances may exist in which an individual \n     may not be known to a foreign power or be a recognized \n     terrorist but may nevertheless be crucial to an authorized \n     terrorism investigation.'' We are convinced, however, that \n     the three-part standard provides the necessary flexibility in \n     such circumstances. Indeed, the government need only show \n     that the records they seek are relevant to the activities of \n     a suspected terrorist or spy, a very low burden to meet, but \n     one that will protect innocent Americans from unnecessary \n     surveillance and ensure that government scrutiny is based on \n     individualized suspicion, a fundamental principle of our \n     legal system.\n       Unlike the Senate bill, the conference report does not \n     permit the recipient of a Section 215 order to challenge its \n     automatic, permanent gag order. Courts have held that similar \n     restrictions violate the First Amendment. While some have \n     asserted that the FISA court's review of a government \n     application for a Section 215 order is equivalent to judicial \n     review of the accompanying gag order, the FISA court is not \n     permitted to make an individualized decision about\n\n[[Page S13623]]\n\n     whether to impose a gag order when it issues a Section 215 \n     order. It is required by statute to include a gag order in \n     every Section 215 order; the gag order is automatic and \n     permanent in every case. The recipient of a Section 215 order \n     is entitled to, but does not receive, meaningful judicial \n     review of the gag order.\n       The conference report does not sunset the National Security \n     Letter (NSL) authority. In light of recent revelations about \n     possible abuses of NSLs, which were reported after the Senate \n     passed its reauthorization bill, the NSL provision should \n     sunset no more than four years so that Congress wi1l have an \n     opportunity to review the use of this power.\n       The conference report does not permit meaningful judicial \n     review an NSL's order. It requires the court to accept as \n     conclusive the government's assertion that a gag order should \n     not be lifted, unless the court determines the government is \n     acting in bad faith. As a result, the judicial review \n     provisions do not create a meaningful right to review that \n     comports with due process.\n       The conference report does not retain the Senate \n     protections for ``sneak and peek'' search warrants, as \n     Chairman Specter's letter suggests. The conference report \n     requires the government to notify the target of a ``sneak and \n     peek'' search within 30 days after the search, rather than \n     within seven days as the Senate bill provides and as pre-\n     Patriot Act judicial decisions required. That seven-day \n     period was the safeguard included in the Senate sneak and \n     peek provision. The conference should include a presumption \n     that notice will be provided within a significantly shorter \n     period in order to better protect Fourth Amendment rights. \n     The availability of additional 90-day extensions means that a \n     shorter initial time frame will ensure timely judicial \n     oversight of this highly intrusive technique but not create \n     undue hardship on the government.\n       While the issues discussed above are the core concerns \n     about the conference report that the original cosponsors SAFE \n     Act asked to be modified, they are not the only problems that \n     we see with the conference report. There are a number of \n     other areas where we believe the conference report falls \n     short.\n\n\n              ``Library Records'' Provision (Section 215)\n\n       Unlike the Senate bill, the conference report requires a \n     person who receives a Section 215 order to notify the FBI if \n     he consults with an attorney and to identify the attorney to \n     the FBI. This will have a significant chilling effect on the \n     right to counsel. There is no such requirement any other area \n     of law.\n       The conference report would give the government unilateral \n     authority to keep all its evidence secret from a recipient \n     who is challenging a 215 order, regardless of whether the \n     evidence is classified. This will make it very difficult for \n     the recipient of a Section 215 order to obtain meaningful \n     judicial review that comports with due process.\n       Under the conference report, the target of a Section 215 \n     order never receives notice that the government has obtained \n     his sensitive personal information and never has an \n     opportunity to challenge the use of this information in a \n     trial or other proceeding. All other FISA authorities \n     (wiretaps, physical searches, pen registers, and trap and \n     trace devices) require such notice and opportunity to \n     challenge.\n\n\n                national security letters (section 505)\n\n       The conference report would allow the government to issue \n     NSLs for certain types of sensitive personal information \n     simply by certifying that the information is sought for a \n     terrorism or espionage investigation. This would allow \n     government fishing expeditions targeting innocent Americans. \n     As business groups have argued, the government should be \n     required to certify that the person whose records are sought \n     has some connection to a suspected terrorist or spy.\n       Unlike the Senate bill, the conference report requires a \n     person who receives an NSL to notify the FBI if he consults \n     with an attorney and to identify the attorney to the FBI. \n     This will have a significant chilling effect on the right to \n     counsel. There is no such requirement in any other area of \n     law.\n       Unlike the Senate bill, the conference report for the first \n     time imposes criminal penalties on an NSL recipient who \n     speaks out in violation of an NSL gag order, even if the NSL \n     recipient believes his rights have been violated.\n       The conference report for the first time gives the \n     government the power to go to court to enforce an NSL, \n     effectively converting an NSL into an administrative \n     subpoena. An NSL recipient could now potentially be held in \n     contempt of court and subjected to serious criminal \n     penalties. The government has not demonstrated a need for \n     NSLs to be court enforceable and has not given any examples \n     of individuals failing to comply with NSLs.\n       The conference report would give the govemment unilateral \n     authority to keep all its evidence secret from a recipient is \n     challenging an NSL, regardless of whether the evidence is \n     classified. This wi1l make it very difficult for an NSL \n     recipient to obtain meaningful judicial review that comports \n     with due process.\n       As with Section 215, the conference report fails to require \n     notice to the target of an NSL if the government seeks to use \n     the records obtained from the NSL in a subsequent proceeding, \n     and fails to give the target an opportunity to challenge the \n     use of those records.\n\n\n               ``Sneak and Peek'' Searches (Section 213)\n\n       The conference report does not eliminate the catch-all \n     provision that allows sneak and peek searches any time that \n     notice to a subject would ``seriously jeopardize'' an \n     investigation. This exception could arguably apply in almost \n     every case.\n\n\n                     Roving Wiretaps (Section 206)\n\n       The conference report does not include meaningful checks on \n     ``John Doe'' roving wiretaps, a sweeping power never \n     authorized in any context by Congress before the Patriot Act. \n     A John Doe roving wiretap does not identify the person or the \n     phone to be wiretapped. Unlike the Senate bill, the \n     conference report does not require that a roving wiretap \n     include sufficient information to describe the specific \n     person to be wiretapped with particularity.\n       The conference report does not require the government to \n     determine whether the target of a roving intelligence wiretap \n     is present before beginning surveillance. An ascertainment \n     requirement, as has long applied to roving criminal wiretaps, \n     is needed to protect innocent Americans from unnecessary \n     surveillance, especially when a public phone or computer is \n     wiretapped.\n\n\n     pen registers and trap and trace devices (section 214 and 216)\n\n       The conference report retains the Patriot Act's expansion \n     of the pen/trap authority to electronic communications, \n     including e-mail and Internet. In light of the vast amount of \n     sensitive electronic information that the government can now \n     access with pen/traps, modest safeguards should be added to \n     the pen/trap power to protect innocent Americans, but the \n     conference report does not do so.\n\n\n              domestic terrorism definition (section 802)\n\n       The conference report retains the Patriot Act's overboard \n     definition of domestic terrorism, which could include acts of \n     civil disobedience by political organizations. While civic \n     disobedience is and should be illegal, it is not necessarily \n     terrorism. This could have a significant chilling effect on \n     legitimate political activity that is protected by the first \n     Amendment.\n       It is not too late to remedy the problems with the \n     conference report and pass a reauthorization package that we \n     can all support. The House could take up and pass the bill \n     the Senate adopted by unanimous consent in July, or, if the \n     additional modest but critical improvements to the conference \n     report that the original cosponsors of the SAFE Act laid out \n     priot to Thanksgiving are made, we believe the conference \n     report can easily and quickly pass both the House and the \n     Senate this month.\n       We appreciate that since Thanksgiving, the conferees agreed \n     to include four-year sunsets of three controversial \n     provisions rather than seven-year sunsets. But we should not \n     just make permanent or, in the case three provisions, extend \n     for another four years the most controversial provisions of \n     the Patriot Act. The sunsets this year provide our best \n     opportunity to make the meaningful changes to the Patriot Act \n     that the American public has demanded. Now is the time to fix \n     these provisions.\n       We urge you to join us in opposing cloture on the \n     conference report, and in supporting our call for the \n     conferees to make additional improvements. We still have the \n     opportunity to pass a good reauthorization bill this year. \n     But to do so, we must stop this conference report, which \n     falls short of the meaningful reforms that need to be made. \n     We must ensure that when we do reauthorize the Patriot Act, \n     we do it right. We still can--and must--make sure that our \n     laws give law enforcement agents the tools they need while \n     providing safeguards to protect the constitutional rights of \n     all Americans.\n           Sincerely,\n         Larry E. Craig, John E. Sununu, Lisa Murkowski, Chuck \n           Hagel, Barack Obama, Dick Durbin, Russ Feingold, Ken \n           Salazar, John F. Kerry.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me, for a moment, touch on something I \nthink is important. This issue has spread beyond these walls and beyond \nthis building.\n  The Idaho Legislature, my legislature in Idaho, by a resolution, a \nhouse joint memorial and a senate joint memorial to the Congress, asked \nthat we support the SAFE Act. The SAFE Act was the passage of \namendments that the Senate Judiciary Committee incorporated within our \nversion of the reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act that passed this body \nunanimously.\n  From the beginning, those of us who have concerns about PATRIOT have \nhad an uphill battle. Practically before the ink was dry on our bill--\nand certainly well before any committee had reviewed it--we faced a \nveto recommendation. Before they even read our reform proposals, some \nof PATRIOT's defenders charged us with wanting to repeal the law and do \naway with all the tools it provided law enforcement to protect our \ncountry against terrorism.\n  Those charges were not true when we began, and they're not true \ntoday. We are not trying to undo PATRIOT. If some Senators still \nbelieve that, well, the rest of the country does not.\n\n[[Page S13624]]\n\n  Most of PATRIOT isn't even at issue today--just a small part of the \nlaw is up for renewal. Of that small part, we are only focusing on a \nfew controversial and very important provisions. And even for those few \nprovisions in the small part of the law up for renewal, we are asking \nfor modest checks and balances, not repeal. And we have even been \nflexible about what shape those reforms should take. We introduced the \nSAFE Act, offering one way to ``fix'' what we saw as problems, but in \nthe end, we accepted a Senate Judiciary Committee bill that took a \ncouple of different approaches.\n  Here is an interesting reaction: When we are dealing with \nconstitutional freedoms, just a little can make all the difference. \nSome are saying that we are asking for so little, we should just drop \nit altogether. Our point is that it would take very little to close the \ngap and provide the assurances we are seeking. Our ask is very do-able. \nThe conference on this bill was squeezed into the very end of the year; \nchanges were being made in the conference agreement even up to the day \nof its filing. We believe a limited timeframe would allow further \ndiscussion and an opportunity to get beyond whatever political issues \nare in the way. Some of us have even introduced legislation that would \nextend the expiring provisions of PATRIOT for 3 months, for this \npurpose.\n  Furthermore, it's worth emphasizing that our concerns are not about \ninsignificant or technical issues--they relate to what happens when \ninnocent Americans come within the sphere of surveillance in \nantiterrorism investigations.\n  Regardless of what Americans think about the PATRIOT Act's \neffectiveness, they also care about preserving their freedom within the \nfight against terrorism.\n  Let me read the resolution passed by the Idaho State Legislature \nearlier this year on the subject:\n\n  A Joint Memorial to the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States in Congress Assembled, and to the Congressional \n   Delegation Representing the State of Idaho in the Congress of the \n                             United States\n\n       We, your Memorialists, the House of Representatives and the \n     Senate of the State of Idaho assembled in the First Regular \n     Session of the Fifty-eighth Idaho Legislature, do hereby \n     respectfully represent that:\n       Whereas, citizens of the state of Idaho strongly believe \n     that basic civil liberties must be preserved and protected, \n     even as we seek to guard against terrorist and other threats \n     to the national security; and\n       Whereas, there are some principles of our democracy which \n     are so fundamental to the rights of citizenship that they \n     must be preserved to guard the very liberties we seek to \n     protect; and\n       Whereas, legislation known as the SAFE Act has been \n     introduced in the Congress of the United States to adopt \n     amendments to the Patriot Act which would address some of the \n     most problematic provisions of the Act; and\n       Whereas, the SAFE Act amends the Patriot Act to modify the \n     provision regarding the roving wiretaps to require that the \n     identity of the target be given and that the suspect be \n     present during the time when surveillance is conducted; and\n       Whereas, the SAFE Act revises provisions governing search \n     warrants to limit the circumstances when the delay of notice \n     may be exercised and to require reports to the Congress when \n     delays of notice are used; and\n       Whereas, the SAFE Act requires specific and articulable \n     facts be given before business records are subject to \n     investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation; and\n       Whereas, the SAFE Act provides that libraries shall not be \n     treated as communication providers subject to providing \n     information and transaction record of the library patrons; \n     and\n       Whereas, it is appropriate that the Legislature of the \n     State of Idaho, on behalf of the citizens of Idaho, express \n     support of the efforts of Senator Larry Craig to adopt the \n     SAFE Act, and encourage the full support of the Idaho \n     congressional delegation.\n       Now, therefore, be it Resolved by the members of the first \n     Regular Session of the Fifty-eighth Idaho Legislature, the \n     House of Representatives and the Senate concurring therein. \n     That the Idaho Legislature endorses the efforts to amend the \n     Patriot Act to assure that it works well to protect our \n     security but that it does not unnecessarily compromise \n     essential liberties of the citizens of the United States. We \n     urge the congressional delegation representing the State of \n     Idaho in the Congress of the United States to support \n     legislation introduced by Senator Larry Craig, known as the \n     SAFE Act.\n\n  This is just one of hundreds of such statements issued by states, \ncities, and communities across the Nation on this subject.\n  I have actually heard colleagues saying that because there have been \nno publicly reported abuses of PATRIOT Act powers, there is no \njustification for changing the law. Since when do we have to wait for \nthe Constitution to be breached to take action? Since when do the \nAmerican people have to justify demanding checks and balances that will \nmake sure there can be no such abuses? Since when did it become the \nAmerican people's burden of proof to support protecting their civil \nliberties?\n  I thought the government worked for the people, and not the other way \naround\n  We are not the ones who should have to be justifying a call for \nchecks and balances. It's up to the government to prove those checks \nand balances are not workable and not in the best interests of the \nNation.\n  Now, we have heard a lot about the civil liberties protections that \nhave been included in this conference report. I stand second to none in \ngiving credit to our Judiciary Committee chairman, Arlen Specter, for \nachieving these reforms. I well know the opposition he was up against, \nand I am very pleased he was able to persuade conferees--as he \npersuaded some in this body--that we can have both: protection of the \nprivacy and civil liberties of innocent citizens, and aggressive \nfighting against terrorism.\n  It is worth noting that even those of our colleagues who opposed our \noriginal SAFE Act proposals ended up supporting the Senate bill that \ncontained civil liberties reforms. Today these same colleagues are \npraising the conference report's provisions along those lines--and my \nmessage to them is: why not go just a little further toward the \nSenate's version in some of these areas? You voted for them once \nbefore--why not again?\n  That's how much confidence I have in Chairman Specter--that with this \nadditional expression of support from the Senate, he will be able to \nmake a few last--but important--improvements.\n  The other body voted yesterday on the PATRIOT Act conference report, \nand a motion to reject that report and instead accept the entire \nSenate-passed version was narrowly defeated, 202-224. This is a \nremarkable vote. The U.S. House is a body of 435 Members. 215 is the \nmajority, they were 13 short of passing the Senate bill, the very \nreform I am asking for today. But those of us seeking more time for \nnegotiations aren't asking that the entire conference report be \ndefeated; we aren't asking for the House to swallow the entire Senate \nbill. Instead, we have identified a few areas where we believe \nimprovements could and should be made, and I think the House vote shows \nthese changes would be welcomed by a substantial number in that body.\n  To those of my colleagues who are telling us to ``quit while we're \nahead,'' I say: where would we be if they had stopped at the First \nAmendment of the bill of Rights? Should they have quit while they were \nahead, and forgotten about those other nine amendments?\n  These are important issues. let's allow a little more time for the \nprocess to work, and respond to the concerns that our citizens have \nexpressed.\n  1. The changes we are seeking:\n  The conference report that we are voting on would allow the \ngovernment to obtain library, medical and gun records and other \nsensitive personal information under Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act on \na mere showing that those records are relevant to an authorized \nintelligence investigation. As business groups like the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce have argued, this would allow government fishing expeditions \ntargeting innocent Americans. We believe the government should be \nrequired to convince a judge that the records they are seeking have \nsome connection to a suspected terrorist or spy, as the three-part \nstandard in the Senate bill would mandate.\n  Some conferees argue that the language in the conference report would \npermit the government to use the ``relevance'' standard only in \nlimited, extraordinary circumstances, and that the Senate bill's three-\npart standard would continue to apply in most circumstances. To the \ncontrary, the conference report never requires the government to \ndemonstrate that the individual whose records are sought is connected \nto a terrorist or spy; rather, it permits the ``relevance'' standard to \nbe used in every case.\n  It has also been asserted that the government should not be required \nto\n\n[[Page S13625]]\n\nabide by the three-part Senate standard because the Department of \nJustice demonstrated in a classified setting that ``circumstances may \nexist in which an individual may not be known to a foreign power or be \na recognized terrorist but may nevertheless be crucial to an authorized \nterrorism investigation.'' We are convinced, however, that the three-\npart standard provides the necessary flexibility in such circumstances. \nIndeed, the government need only show that the records they seek are \nrelevant to the activities of a suspected terrorist or spy, a very low \nburden to meet, but one that will protect innocent Americans from \nunnecessary surveillance and ensure that government scrutiny is based \non individualized suspicion, a fundamental principle of our legal \nsystem.\n  Unlike the Senate bill, the conference report does not permit the \nrecipient of a Section 215 order to challenge its automatic, permanent \ngag order. Courts have held that similar restrictions violate the First \nAmendment. While some have asserted that the FISA court's review of a \ngovernment application for a Section 215 order is equivalent to \njudicial review of the accompanying gag order, the FISA court is not \npermitted to make an individualized decision about whether to impose a \ngag order when it issues a Section 215 order. It is required by statute \nto include a gag order in every Section 215 order; the gag order is \nautomatic and permanent in every case. The recipient of a Section 215 \norder is entitled, but does not receive, meaningful judicial review of \nthe gag order.\n  The conference report does not sunset the National Security Letter, \nNSL, authority. In light of recent revelations about possible abuses of \nNSLs, which were reported after the Senate passed its reauthorization \nbill, the NSL provision should sunset in no more than four years so \nthat Congress will have an opportunity to review the use of this power.\n  The conference report does not permit meaningful judicial review of \nan NSL's gag order. It requires the court to accept as conclusive the \ngovernment's assertion that a gag order should not be lifted, unless \nthe court determines the government is acting in bad faith. As a \nresult, the judicial review provisions do not create a meaningful right \nto review that comports with due process.\n  The conference report does not retain the Senate protections for \n``sneak and peek'' search warrants, as Chairman Specter's letter \nsuggests. The conference report requires the government to notify the \ntarget of a ``sneak and peek'' search within 30 days after the search, \nrather than within 7 days, as the Senate bill provides and as pre-\nPATRIOT Act judicial decisions required. That 7-day period was the key \nsafeguard included in the Senate sneak and peek provision. The \nconference report should include a presumption that notice will be \nprovided within a significantly shorter period in order to better \nprotect Fourth Amendment rights. The availability of additional 90-day \nextensions means that a shorter initial time frame will ensure timely \njudicial oversight of this highly intrusive technique but not create \nundue hardship on the government.\n  Unlike the Senate bill, the conference report requires a person who \nreceives an NSL to notify the FBI if he consults with an attorney and \nto identify the attorney to the FBI. This will have a significant \nchilling effect on the right to counsel. There is no such requirement \nin any other area of law.\n  Unlike the Senate bill, the conference report for the first time \nimposes criminal penalties on an NSL recipient who speaks out in \nviolation of an NSL gag order, even if the NSL recipient believes his \nrights have been violated.\n  The conference report for the first time gives the government the \npower to go to court to enforce an NSL, effectively converting an NSL \ninto an administrative subpoena. An NSL recipient could now potentially \nbe held in contempt of court and subjected to serious criminal \npenalties. The government has not demonstrated a need for NSLs to be \ncourt enforceable and has not given any examples of individuals failing \nto comply with NSLs.\n  The conference report would give the government unilateral authority \nto keep all its evidence secret from a recipient who is challenging an \nNSL, regardless of whether the evidence is classified. This will make \nit very difficult for an NSL recipient to obtain meaningful judicial \nreview that comports with due process.\n  As with Section 215, the conference report fails to require notice to \nthe target of an NSL if the government seeks to use the records \nobtained from the NSL in a subsequent proceeding, and fails to give the \ntarget an opportunity to challenge the use of those records.\n  The conference report does not eliminate the catch-all provision that \nallows sneak and peek searches any time that notice to a subject would \n``seriously jeopardize'' an investigation. This exception could \narguably apply in almost every case.\n  Many of my colleagues say the PATRIOT Act is just giving law \nenforcement powers in terrorism investigation what they already have in \ndrug investigation.\n  Well not here. The conference report does not include meaningful \nchecks on ``John Doe'' roving wiretaps, a sweeping power never \nauthorized in any context by Congress before the PATRIOT Act. A John \nDoe roving wiretap does not identify the person or the phone to be \nwiretapped. Unlike the Senate bill, the conference report does not \nrequire that a roving wiretap include sufficient information to \ndescribe the specific person to be wiretapped with particularity.\n  The conference report does not require the government to determine \nwhether the target of a roving intelligence wiretap is present before \nbeginning surveillance. An ascertainment requirement, as has long \napplied to roving criminal wiretaps, is needed to protect innocent \nAmericans from unnecessary surveillance, especially when a public phone \nor computer is wiretapped. Yes, new technology is challenging but \nshould not allow our privacy rights to be swept away.\n  The conference report retains the PATRIOT Act's expansion of the pen/\ntrap authority to electronic communications, including e-mail and \nInternet. In light of the vast amount of sensitive electronic \ninformation that the government can now access with pen/traps, modest \nsafeguards should be added to the pen/trap power to protect innocent \nAmericans, but the conference report does not do so.\n  The conference report retains the PATRIOT Act's overbroad definition \nof domestic terrorism, which could include acts of civil disobedience \nby political organizations. While civil disobedience is and should be \nillegal, it is not necessarily terrorism. This could have a significant \nchilling effect on legitimate political activity that is protected by \nthe First Amendment.\n  While the issues discussed above are the core concerns about the \nconference report that the original cosponsors of the SAFE Act asked to \nbe modified, they are not the only problems that we see with the \nconference report. There are a number of other areas where we believe \nthe conference report falls short.\n  Unlike the Senate bill, the conference report requires a person who \nreceives a Section 215 order to notify the FBI if he consults with an \nattorney and to identify the attorney to the FBI. This will have a \nsignificant chilling effect on the right to counsel. There is no such \nrequirement in any other area of law.\n  The conference report would give the government unilateral authority \nto keep all its evidence secret from a recipient who is challenging a \n215 order, regardless of whether the evidence is classified. This will \nmake it very difficult for the recipient of a Section 215 order to \nobtain meaningful judicial review that comports with due process.\n  Under the conference report, the target of a Section 215 order never \nreceives notice that the government has obtained his sensitive personal \ninformation and never has an opportunity to challenge the use of this \ninformation in a trial or other proceeding. All other FISA \nauthorities--wiretaps, physical searches, pen registers, and trap and \ntrace devices--require such notice and opportunity to challenge.\n  The conference report would allow the government to issue NSLs for \ncertain types of sensitive personal information simply by certifying \nthat the information is sought for a terrorism or espionage \ninvestigation. This would allow government fishing expeditions\n\n[[Page S13626]]\n\ntargeting innocent Americans. As business groups have argued, the \ngovernment should be required to certify that the person whose records \nare sought has some connection to a suspected terrorist or spy.\n  Again, what is important is to understand and plead with our \ncolleagues--that how you negotiate is through power and leverage, not \nto give up and walk away. I am not going to suggest that the chairman \ndid that at all. He and I dialogued many times over the course of the \nlast 2 weeks as to what we might do to gain greater position, to gain \nthe Senate position with the House.\n  My compliments to him for the successes that are in the conference \nreport because there are some. But my frustration is that what we did \nin the Senate in this very important instance has not been adhered to. \nThose safeguards have not been put in place to the extent that we had \nasked. And I believe it is reasonable and right to say: No, let us live \nfor 3 more months with the current law while we attempt to achieve even \ngreater protection for the private citizens of this country but most \nimportantly recognize that the law enforcement community needs that \ntime to ask permission and to show that they have very real reason to \nbelieve that somebody is involved.\n  I think it has been a very excellent debate which has gone on on the \nfloor of the Senate. But there is a reality check. That reality check \nis a vote on the conference report, and I ask my colleagues to vote \nagainst cloture so that we can reenter this debate one more time with \nthe House to make sure we get it right so that the first amendment and \nthe fourth amendment are not, in some way, in jeopardy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have worked very closely with the \ndistinguished Senator from Idaho, as he noted, on this matter, with \nlots of discussions and lots of dialog. He and I worked together on the \nRuby Ridge investigation, as Senator Leahy was involved on the other \nside of the aisle. That was a high watermark of congressional oversight \nprotection of the individual rights.\n  I have a long history with Senator Craig and agree with him that you \ndon't compromise on civil liberties. What you do with civil liberties \nis you protect them.\n  But I submit to my colleague from Idaho that we have protected.\n  I ask him: He starts off with the delayed notice. The pejorative term \nis ``sneak and peek.'' Delayed notice is when the law enforcement \nofficial shows the judge, the impartial arbiter between the citizen and \nlaw enforcement, that there are reasons to have delayed notice.\n  Ordinarily, you have a search-and-seizure warrant. The target knows \nthat right away.\n  The current bill provides for ``reasonable period of time,'' which \ncould mean anything. Some have gone for enormous periods of time. The \nHouse came in at 180 days and the Senate came in at 7 days. We were not \nunaware in picking 7 days we were starting a negotiating track. We were \nnot going to have our entire way. The Fourth Circuit said 45 days is \npresumptively reasonable and we ended up with 30.\n\n  I ask my colleague from Idaho, is it a compromise of civil liberties \nto have a 30-day notice period where you change the existing law from \nwhat is reasonable--which means anything--and the House comes down 150 \ndays and we go up 30 days; is that a compromise?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I know my chairman thinks that is a success. First, we \nhave broken and entered a private citizen's home without telling them. \nDoes it take 30 days for law enforcement to determine that what they \nhave found is so valuable that they cannot tell the citizen they have \nbroken into their home? Why not 7 days? And then go to a judge and \nprove your worth with the evidence you have established by that \n``break-in''--because that is what you have done. My home is my \nsanctuary. We have said, yes, we are going to let you break and enter, \nsneak and peek, but we are going to make sure it is very limited.\n  So I don't view 30 days as a compromise. Seven days. You were right \nto begin with. You are wrong now.\n  Mr. SPECTER. You cannot take all my time.\n  I will ask another question but may make the argument----\n  Mr. CRAIG. If the Senator will yield, I will be kinder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. No, no.\n  Mr. CRAIG. All right.\n  Mr. SPECTER. All of this effort to get the floor and I will yield \nright away? Absolutely not.\n  The point of the time is not to show what they have gotten is \nvaluable. The time is in order to enable them to conduct an \ninvestigation. They got the order initially because they showed a \njudge, an impartial magistrate, that there was a reason to think if the \ntarget knew, it would impede the investigation.\n  I will let my 98 colleagues evaluate whether that is a compromise on \ncivil liberties.\n  The letter which the Senator from Idaho refers to, which was filed \nyesterday and printed in the Record, I have already put the reply into \nthe Record, which we circulated today. In that letter, the assertion \nmade that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court is not permitted \nto make an individualized decision about whether to impose a gag order \nwhen it issues a section 215 order is incorrect. That is not right. The \nstatute provides there may be a petition to have the court review the \n215 order and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court has the \nauthority at that point to say there will be no gag order.\n  When the Senator from Idaho puts in his letter that they want a \nsunset on the national security letter, I point out to him the PATRIOT \nAct does not establish the national security letter. That has been in \nexistence for decades.\n  Mr. CRAIG. It is broadening of the application, not the \nestablishment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Regular order, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The PATRIOT Act does not establish the national security \nletter. But the PATRIOT Act was used as a vehicle for extending civil \nrights, which the Senator from Idaho is concerned about. He is a civil \nlibertarian and so am I. When he introduced the so-called SAFE Act to \ncut back on the PATRIOT Act, and he came to me and asked, Would you \ncosponsor it, I immediately said yes. But when we structured the \nPATRIOT Act, we took a look at the national security letters and we \nsaid, this is an occasion where we ought to rein in the national \nsecurity letter. And we did so by saying the recipient did not have to \nkeep quiet--which you have to do under existing law--but you could go \nto a lawyer. I don't think you ought to have to have legislative \nauthority to go to a lawyer. But we made no bones about it. We were not \ngoing to leave that to chance, and we said you can go to a lawyer. Then \nthat lawyer could go to court and quash the national security letter if \nit is unreasonable.\n  The standard of ``reasonable'' is all over the law. It is what a \nreasonable person would do. It controls tort law, accidents, reasonable \npersonal negligence, it controls antitrust law, reasonable restraints. \nThe court has plenary authority, full authority to quash the national \nsecurity letter if it is unreasonable.\n  Now, when you come to the point about disclosure, you are dealing \nwith some pretty tough stuff. You are dealing with national security. \nThe Senate bill that went through without objection by anyone, \nincluding the Senator from Idaho, has a provision that there is a \nconclusive presumption if the Government certifies that it will impede \nnational security or harm foreign relations. But in the conference \nreport, in part because Senator Craig was vigilant in talking to us \nabout the conference report, we said, that is not enough. It ought to \nbe on the Government, some law enforcement officer in the field. We put \nin the requirement it had to be the Attorney General or Deputy Attorney \nGeneral, head of the FBI, or Assistant Attorney General--all positions \nwhich are confirmed by the Senate, so they are ranking positions.\n  We saw to it that the national security letter was reined in. We also \nsaw to it that the wiretaps were reined in. Then we had the big \nargument about the sunset. I almost had a feeling in one long telephone \nconversation with Senator Craig about 10 days ago that if we got a 4-\nyear sunset, which was a\n\n[[Page S13627]]\n\ngolden prize--the House wanted 10 years and the Senate had 4 years; the \nHouse wanted the compromise on 7, halfway between; we said no, we are \nnot going to do that. This was a matter of great importance to many \nSenators, especially to Senator Craig. So we can review all of this and \nwe can have oversight. I almost thought if we got 4 years, we would get \nSenator Craig. He is nodding in the negative.\n  Mr. CRAIG. It was third on my list.\n  Mr. SPECTER. We did not get Senator Craig.\n  Mr. President, when the six Senators wrote a letter with a lot of \nconcerns, we responded with a seven-page letter. When yesterday we \nreceived a letter with nine Senators, we responded with an eight-page \nletter which the staff has worked on. We have had extraordinary staff \nworking on all sides. This goes for my staff, this goes for Senator \nLeahy's staff. The Judiciary Committee has not had any time off. We had \nan August recess for the Senate but not for the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator is expired.\n  Mr. SPECTER. In that event, I stop.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/15/senate-section/article/S13627-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13627]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to spend a few minutes of my time \ntalking about the Labor-HHS bill and a lot of the comments we have \nheard in the Chamber over the last couple days as to what we are and \nare not doing. I thought the American public should have a good \nperspective about what has happened in terms of the growth of this \ndepartment since the fiscal year 1998 started.\n  This is a tight budget. I commend those who are in charge of it. It \nis a vast improvement over what we have done in other years. There is \nno question there are some unmet needs that can be claimed out of this \nappropriations bill. That is the time we face in our country. The \nFederal Government cannot meet every need.\n  In regard to history, Health and Human Services from 1998 to 2005, \nover that 8-year period, in real dollars has increased at over 10 \npercent per year. It has actually increased over 13 percent per year, \nbut we have had inflation of 3 percent. So what we have seen is an \nactual doubling of the size of that component of the Federal Government \nfrom September 30 of 1997 to today. It has doubled in size. Education \nis the same. Actually, education more than doubled in size, net of \ninflation. That is in terms of real dollars. So when we hear the words \nthat we can't do what we are doing, I would have our fellow colleagues \nlook down the road a little bit. This is just a taste of what we are \ngoing to be facing if we don't start making the choices based on \npriority.\n  I tell you, we are on an unsustainable path even with this bill. We \ncannot meet those needs that need to be met if we continue to not \nprioritize in the functioning of the Federal Government.\n  Again, I take seriously the claim that we would take away food stamps \nfrom people who have no other source of nutrition. But I also take \nseriously the claim and the knowledge reported by the Department of \nAgriculture and the Food Stamp Program that last year they paid out \n$1.6 billion in food stamps to people who were ineligible, who had \nother sources of income. And yet they continued to spend $1.6 billion.\n  Why is all this important? It is important because this last year, \nending September 30, we spent $538 billion more in that fiscal year \nthan we took in. So the debate has to be in the context of what are we \ndoing to our children and our grandchildren. We have to make a measured \nbalance about how we make these decisions.\n  The decision of trimming programs that are not effective and doing \nthe hard oversight--the real thing that is lacking is us doing the work \nof oversight. We have opportunities lost when we don't put money into \nthose programs that are more effective and take money from those \nprograms that are less effective.\n  The debate is centered about us and our constitutional duties to do \noversight but also in terms of the future and what kind of heritage and \nlegacy in terms of debt are we going to leave to our children.\n  Overall, the Congress has done a good job with this bill. There are \nstill tons of waste in this bill. This bill totaled has $602 billion \nworth of spending in it.\n  I have one last comment, and that is there is $55 billion for the new \nMedicare Part D Program, of which only 1 out of every 15 people who are \neligible for that program is a new person who would not have had drugs. \nSo we are going to pay for 14 people who had insurance or other \ncoverage to cover one additional person. And none of that money is paid \nfor. That $55 billion is coming from our grandchildren.\n  This is a program on which I did not have an opportunity to vote. I \nwould have voted against it. I also didn't have an opportunity to \nattach it to a supplemental, which I would have offered, to eliminate \nor freeze this program because our children and our grandchildren \nabsolutely cannot afford it. It is $8.7 trillion between now and 2050 \nthat we are going to put into this brandnew program that is starting \ntoday that helps 1 in 15. It helps 1 in 15 who need it. And yet we are \nsaying it is OK for our children to pay that bill.\n  I commend Senator Specter on his hard work on the bill. This is the \nfirst time in years that the hard choices have been made. I remind our \ncolleagues that as we face the future with Social Security, Medicare, \nand Medicaid and a war and natural disasters, hard choices is what we \nare here for. Yes, as Senator Kennedy said today, we do need to be \nconcerned about those who can't take care of themselves, but I put \nforward to my colleagues that with $600 billion--that is $20,000 per \nman, woman, and child in this country--we ought to be able to take care \nof them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have traveled throughout my home State \nof Washington throughout the past month. A lot of people have told me \ntime and time again they want our country to be strong again, and to be \nstrong we need to invest right here at home, in our people, in our \ninfrastructure, and in our communities. But today the Republican \nleadership is trying to push us in the wrong direction by cutting those \ncritical investments. Republicans today are attempting to interpose an \nacross-the-board spending cut that will hurt our families, it will hurt \nour local communities, and it will even jeopardize the housing and \nsafety of the American people.\n  I am speaking out today to explain how those misguided cuts will \naffect housing for vulnerable families and the safety of every American \nwho plans to fly this holiday season.\n  I thank Senator Byrd for his tremendous leadership and his speaking \nout about this misguided Republican plan.\n\n[[Page S13628]]\n\nAs the ranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on \nTransportation, Treasury, the Judiciary, Housing and Urban Development, \nand related agencies, I am here today to tell my colleagues that an \nadditional 1-percent to 2-percent cut across the board will not be \nharmless. It will chip away at the Federal safety net that protects our \nvulnerable neighbors, and it will undermine the safety of our \ncommercial aviation system.\n  Before I turn to those details, I want to make a broader point about \npriorities. There is something very wrong with the idea behind these \nbroad, across-the-board cuts. Here is what the leadership in the \nRepublican Party is saying with these cuts: When we need to rebuild in \nIraq, we will pay for it out of the Treasury. But when we need to \nrebuild American cities such as New Orleans and Biloxi, we can only do \nit on the backs of vulnerable Americans. We can only do it by cutting \nother priorities at home.\n  That is the wrong message. It is the wrong priority, and America can \ndo better than that. That Republican idea should offend every American \ntaxpayer who believes that the first and greatest responsibility of our \nFederal Government should be the well-being of our own people. \nNonetheless, that is the position of the Republican leadership in this \nCongress. As a result, we are now being told that, if we want to help \nthe victims of Hurricane Katrina, we have to cut every Federal program \nacross the board, no matter how much those cuts will hurt our safety, \nour economy, or our security.\n  Some Senators may try to suggest that a small cut will not have a big \nimpact. I can tell you, as a member of the Appropriations Committee, \nthat is not the case. Let me talk about some of the specific ways these \ncuts will undermine American families in areas such as transportation \nand housing and in aviation. I know those areas well because I have \nworked on them as the ranking member on the Transportation and Treasury \nand HUD committee.\n  First of all, these cuts will mean less progress in reducing highway \ncongestion. We will lose more than $720 million in highway construction \nfunds, and with that 34,000 good-paying jobs. Americans will waste more \ntime in traffic, businesses will lose productivity, and our economy \nwill suffer.\n  Second, those proposed Republican cuts will make life harder for the \nvictims of Hurricane Katrina and for the vulnerable families throughout \nour country. Hurricane Katrina revealed the harsh truth about poverty \nin America in 2005. Many people lost what little they had. There are \nstill thousands of victims of that hurricane who are without adequate \nhousing. Some of them are living in tents. Some are still in hotels, \nwondering when they are going to be thrown out. Others are doubled up \nwith their relatives. And still others have been dispersed all across \nthe country, wondering how they are going to pay for housing when they \nare earning no income. Neither FEMA nor HUD have done an adequate job \naddressing the critical housing needs of these Americans.\n  So here we are trying to address those needs with a supplemental \nappropriations bill, and Republican leadership is saying if you want to \nhelp these Katrina victims, you have to cut housing assistance for \nother vulnerable families. I think that is the wrong way, to say the \nonly way we will help the victims of Hurricane Katrina is by taking \nhousing away from other needy families. Those cuts would mean that more \nthan 35,000 families will lose the help in housing that they get today \nthrough HUD's tenant-based housing assistance program.\n  Those cuts also threaten to eliminate transitional housing for 1,200 \nhomeless citizens. Think about it. Cutting housing for the homeless, \ntaking help away from 35,000 vulnerable families right before the \nholidays--that does not reflect my values and that does not reflect my \npriorities.\n  In the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, public housing \nagencies across America opened their doors and sought to make emergency \nhousing available to the citizens who had to evacuate New Orleans. I \nsaw it even in my home State where housing agencies worked hard, \nthousands of miles away from the gulf coast, to help these families. \nMost of those housing agencies already had long waiting lists of low-\nincome families waiting for a unit or for a voucher. By accommodating \nthose Hurricane Katrina victims, those housing agencies effectively \npushed their own local citizens further down that very long waiting \nlist.\n  We should not now make it worse by eliminating vouchers for 35,000 \nfamilies in order to pay for the additional aid for the Katrina \nvictims. We must not come to the aid of victims of Hurricane Katrina by \ncreating still other victims around the country through these misguided \ncuts.\n  These cuts will hurt jobs and transportation. They will hurt the \nhomeless and other families who are living on the brink. And these cuts \nwill affect the safety of our air travel in this country.\n  I addressed the Senate on this issue of aviation safety on October 6, \nand I did so because I thought it was critical that all Senators \nunderstand the relationship between the funding levels we provide to \nthe FAA and the ability of that agency to ensure that the American \npeople are safe when they board an aircraft.\n  The holidays are upon us. Thousands of American families are going to \nboard planes shortly to gather with their families across America. When \nthey do, they have the right to expect that we in Congress are doing \neverything in our power to ensure that they will continue to benefit \nfrom the safest aviation system in the world.\n  Yet the reality is that the FAA is facing an unprecedented budget \nchallenge in adequately staffing its air traffic control facilities \nwith fully trained professionals. And the agency is also challenged \nwhen it comes to deploying an adequate number of fully trained aviation \nsafety inspectors to oversee the safety practices of our Nation's \nairlines.\n  As I explained back on October 6, over the last few years our \nnational aviation enterprise, airlines, airports, and the FAA, have \nbeen under an unprecedented amount of financial pressure. We now have \nno fewer than six airlines in bankruptcy, and that number could grow.\n  In the interest of cutting costs, airlines have been cutting back on \nstaff, renouncing their pension plans, and outsourcing an increased \npercentage of their aircraft maintenance.\n  I know many Senators like me who travel home every weekend have \nnoticed those changes in the services the airlines offer. Staffing is \nleaner than ever, and flight delays and mechanical problems are on the \nrise.\n  Airlines are now contracting out their aircraft maintenance work to \nthird parties, including, my colleagues should know, many overseas \nvendors who are known as foreign repair stations.\n  Let me say that again.\n  Aircraft maintenance work is being contracted out to overseas vendors \nwho are known as foreign repair stations.\n  In the past, airlines maintained their planes with experienced \nveteran unionized mechanics. Today, they outsource more than 50 percent \nof their maintenance work to independent operators. Airlines, such as \nNorthwest, send some of their aircraft as far as Singapore and Hong \nKong for heavy maintenance. We have one major carrier, JetBlue, that \nsends a large portion of its all-airbus fleet to be maintained in El \nSalvador, Central America. That is where those planes have mechanics \nthat work on them. America West Airlines, now merged with U.S. Airways, \ndoes the same thing. This outsourced work needs adequate oversight, and \nit needs inspection if the American people are going to be safe.\n  How has the FAA responded to this growing threat to aviation safety? \nBecause of across-the-board cuts in the prior appropriations bills, the \nFAA has actually downsized its safety workforce by more than 300 \npersonnel, including more than 230 inspectors. That is right. We have \ngotten rid of more than 230 inspectors, the very professionals who are \ncharged with ensuring that maintenance operations are meeting adequate \nsafety standards.\n  That was not the intent of the transportation appropriations \nsubcommittee in either the House or the Senate. Indeed, just last year \nthe Transportation appropriations bill provided every penny the \nPresident requested for the FAA's safety office. But the FAA still had \nto drop the number of inspectors because of the across-the-board cut \nthat was imposed by the Republican leadership.\n\n[[Page S13629]]\n\n  It also resulted from the fact that Congress granted all civilian \nFederal employees a higher pay raise than the Bush administration asked \nfor, but none of the appropriations subcommittees were given adequate \nfunding allocations to fully fund those pay raises.\n  Now we know the FAA's inspection efforts are falling short. We have \ntroubling reports today from the Department of Transportation's \nInspector General, from the Government Accountability Office, and the \nNational Transportation Safety Board.\n  Yet despite all those dangers, the FAA had to go ahead and decrease \nthe number of FAA safety inspectors dramatically last year because of \nthose across-the-board cuts. No one can stand up today and say that an \nacross-the-board cut has no impact.\n  Let us fast-forward to right now, this year. I am very proud to say \nthat the House and Senate Appropriations Committees have worked to \naddress this safety vulnerability. Both committees provided increased \nfunds over and above the levels requested by the Bush administration to \nbring the number of safety inspectors back to reasonable levels.\n  In the fiscal year 2006 Transportation-Treasury-HUD appropriations \nbill that the President signed a few weeks ago, we provided $8 million \ndollars to boost employment in the FAA safety office by 119 inspectors. \nThat is not going to restore all of the safety inspectors that we lost \nlast year. But it will move staffing in this critical function in the \nright direction.\n  But if Congress enacts an across-the-board cut, it will completely \neliminate all of the progress we just made in ensuring safety in our \nskies.\n  An across-the-board cut that threatens to be included in the final \nappropriations bill this year could cut the FAA's operations account by \nover $160 million and then put the FAA's budgetary situation right back \nwhere it was. That will require downsizing of the FAA inspector \nworkforce while the critical workload continues to grow.\n  The situation is almost identical when it comes to the FAA's efforts \nto avoid the continued attrition in the ranks of our air traffic \ncontrollers. It is estimated that 73 percent of the FAA's air traffic \ncontrollers will be eligible to retire over the next decade.\n  In the fiscal year 2006 Transportation appropriations bill just \nsigned into law, we provided almost $25 million to hire an additional \n1,250 air traffic controllers. That funding is essential in order to \nreplace the over 650 air traffic controllers who are expected to retire \nover the course of the next year and to build that workforce back up so \nwe can handle retirements in the future.\n  Another across-the-board cut this year will completely nullify our \neffort to hire an adequate number of air traffic controllers. Such a \ncut will put America's flying public at great risk.\n  As I said, those across-the-board cuts have a meaningful impact, and \nthey recklessly eliminate initiatives that are critical to the safety \nof American citizens.\n  If Senators don't want to take my word for it, they need to listen to \nthe word's of George Bush's FAA Administrator, Marion Blakey. I have \nhad several discussions with her about this topic in the last few \nweeks. She recently sent me a letter. I will read a portion of it. It \nsays:\n\n       Over the past two years, we experienced a net loss of 1,000 \n     controllers and 231 safety inspectors. I don't believe \n     Congress intended that to happen, but that has been the \n     impact of unfunded pay raises.\n       I am concerned it is going to happen again if Congress \n     adopts an across-the-board reduction in the final bill.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter I received \nfrom the Bush administration's FAA Administrator, Marion Blakey, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  Federal Aviation Administration,\n       Dear Senator Murray: Before you complete work on the TTHUD \n     bill, I would like to speak to you about the FAA's budget. \n     Last fiscal year we significantly reduced costs, including \n     contracting our Flight Service Stations and eliminating more \n     than 400 non-safety jobs. Unfortunately, these efforts were \n     not enough to cover our shortfall. Over the past two years, \n     we experienced a net loss of 1,000 controllers and 231 safety \n     inspectors. I don't believe Congress intended that to happen, \n     but that has been the impact of unfunded pay raises and \n     rescissions.\n       I an concerned it is going to happen again if Congress \n     adopts an across-the-board reduction in the final bill.\n                                                    Marion Blakey,\n                                                   Admiminstrator.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, in conclusion, I want to implore my \ncolleagues to heed the warning of the FAA Administrator and me. We have \nto reject this absurd and reckless policy.\n  If we can declare an emergency under the Budget Act and provide the \nfunding necessary to rebuild Iraq without offsets, then surely we can \ndo the same when it comes to rebuilding Mississippi and Louisiana.\n  We certainly should not be cutting essential services to all \nAmericans across the country, especially low-income Americans, for the \npurpose of funding the needs of the victims of Hurricane Katrina. Those \ncuts will simply create another wave of victims.\n  As I just outlined, it will put the well being of Americans at risk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/15/senate-section/article/S13629-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13629-S13630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              PATRIOT ACT\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, 4 years ago, following the most devastating \nattack in our history, this Senate passed the USA PATRIOT Act in order \nto give our Nation's law enforcement the tools they needed to track \ndown terrorists who plot and lurk within our own borders and all over \nthe world; terrorists who, right now, are looking to exploit weaknesses \nin our laws and our security to carry out attacks that may be even \ndeadlier than those that took place on September 11.\n  We all agree we need legislation to make it harder for suspected \nterrorists to go undetected in this country. And we all agree that we \nneeded to make it harder for them to organize and strategize and get \nflight licenses and sneak across our borders. Americans everywhere \nwanted to do that.\n  Soon after the PATRIOT Act passed, a few years before I even arrived \nin the Senate, I began hearing concerns from people of every background \nand political leaning that this law, the very purpose of which was to \nprotect us, was also threatening to violate some of the rights and \nfreedoms we hold most dear; that it does not just provide law \nenforcement the powers it needed to keep us safe but powers it did not \nneed to invade our privacy without cause or suspicion.\n  Now, in Washington, this issue has tended to generate into the \ntypical either/or debate: Either we protect our people from terror or \nwe protect our most cherished principles. I suggest this is a false \nchoice. It asks too little of us and it assumes too little about \nAmerica.\n  That is why, as it has come to time to reauthorize the USA PATRIOT \nAct, we have been working in a bipartisan way to do both, to show the \nAmerican people we can track down terrorists without trampling on our \ncivil liberties, to show the American people that the Federal \nGovernment will only issue warrants and execute searches because it \nneeds to do so, not because it can do so.\n  What we have been trying to achieve under the leadership of a \nbipartisan group of Senators is some accountability in this process to \nget answers and see evidence where there is suspicion.\n  Several weeks ago, these efforts bore fruit. The Judiciary Committee \nand the Senate managed to pass a piece of bipartisan legislation that, \nwhile I cannot say is perfect, was able to address some of the most \nserious problems in the existing law. Unfortunately, that strong \nbipartisan legislation has been tossed aside in conference. Instead, we \nhave been forced to consider a piece of rushed legislation that fails \nto address the concerns of Members of both parties as well as the \nAmerican people.\n  This is legislation that puts our own Justice Department above the \nlaw. When national security letters are issued, they allow Federal \nagents to conduct any search on any American, no matter how extensive, \nhow wide ranging, without ever going before a judge to prove the search \nis necessary. All that is needed is a signoff from a local FBI agent. \nThat is it.\n  Once a business or a person receives notification they will be \nsearched, they are prohibited from telling anyone about it and they are \neven prohibited from challenging this automatic gag\n\n[[Page S13630]]\n\norder in court. Even though judges have already found that similar \nrestrictions violate the first amendment, this conference report \ndisregards the case law and the right to challenge the gag order.\n  If you do decide to consult an attorney for legal advice, hold on; \nyou will have to tell the FBI you have done so. Think about that: You \nwant to talk to a lawyer about whether your actions are going to be \ncausing you to get into trouble, you have to tell the FBI that you are \nconsulting a lawyer. This is unheard of. There is no such requirement \nin any other area of the law. I see no reason why it is justified here.\n  If someone wants to know why their own Government has decided to go \non a fishing expedition through every personal record or private \ndocument, through the library books you read, the phone calls you have \nmade, the e-mails you have sent, this legislation gives people no \nrights to appeal the need for such a search in a court of law. No judge \nwill hear your plea; no jury will hear your case. This is plain wrong. \nThere are Republican Senators as well as Democratic Senators who \nrecognize it is plain wrong.\n  Giving law enforcement the tools they need to investigate suspicious \nactivities is one thing and it is the right thing. But doing it without \nany real oversight seriously jeopardizes the rights of all Americans \nand the ideals America stands for.\n  Supporters of this conference report have argued we should hold our \nnoses and support this legislation because it is not going to get any \nbetter. That is not a good argument. We can do better. We have time to \ndo better. It does not convince me I should support this report. We owe \nit to the Nation, we owe it to those who fought for our civil \nliberties, we owe it to the future and our children to make sure we \ncraft the kind of legislation that would make us proud, not legislation \nwe would settle for because we are in a rush. We do not have to settle \nfor a PATRIOT Act that sacrifices our liberties or our safety. We can \nhave one that secures both.\n  There have been proposals on both sides of the aisle and in both \nHouses of Congress to extend the PATRIOT Act for 3 months so we can \nreach an agreement on this bill that is well thought through. I support \nthese efforts and will oppose cloture on what I consider to be this \nunacceptable conference report.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote yes on this \nmotion to instruct the conferees to support something that 72 Senators \nhave already supported in letters they have signed in the past, 72 \nMembers of this body, and I have the list for anyone who would like to \nsee it when they come to the Chamber.\n  This is to support a bill that is currently law, the Continued \nDumping and Subsidy Offset Act. It is a bill that has helped companies \nin 48 States across this country. More importantly, it has helped \nworkers in 48 States across this country. It has helped employers who \ncreate additional jobs. The idea is to compensate companies that have \nbeen victimized by illegal foreign dumping in this country. Instead of \ngiving money to the Treasury, it goes to these companies, and these \ncompanies have the right then to reinvest and create jobs.\n  Some people have argued this is some sort of special interest. I ask \nMembers of the Senate, when in the world did it become a special \ninterest to protect American jobs?\n  This is a proven way to fight back against illegal trade. It is a \nproven way to protect American jobs. I urge a ``yes'' vote.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I wish to join my Republican colleagues, \nSenator DeWine, Senator Specter, and Senator Craig, all of whom have \nalready spoken so eloquently in support of a motion introduced by \nSenator DeWine yesterday to instruct conferees on the budget bill to \nstrike an ill- conceived House provision that would repeal the \nContinued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act, also known as CDSOA.\n  To repeal or abandon this trade law would be a travesty. The \nContinued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act was enacted to save American \nmanufacturing and our agricultural producers from wave after wave of \nunfairly dumped foreign imports.\n  CDSOA remains one of the most successful trade programs ever enacted. \nIt maintains America's corporate competitiveness; it enables small and \nmedium-sized businesses--and family-owned businesses--to invest in \ntheir futures. It keeps American workers employed, so they can receive \nhealth and pension benefits. This law is about American jobs. As \nSenator DeWine said yesterday, this law is not about rewarding special \ninterests: It is about keeping American jobs.\n  Five years ago, a bipartisan majority of the Senate approved our \namendment to give U.S. companies injured by unfair trade the ability to \ninvest in their factories and workers with funds collected by the \nCustoms Service from unfairly traded imports. I particularly appreciate \nthe continued strong support that Senator DeWine and many of our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle continue to express in \nsupport of this law. In fact, three-fourths of the Senate has publicly \npledged support for the law.\n\n[[Page S13631]]\n\n  Before this law was enacted, the Customs Service imposed antidumping \nand countervailing duties on dumped and unfairly subsidized imports--to \nmake foreign exporters stop dumping and charge a fair price. Despite \nCustoms' efforts, unfair foreign traders refused to trade fairly. \nInstead, they continued to dump--year after year. And the prices of the \ndumped foreign imports from China, Canada, the European Union, Japan, \nand other countries continued to unfairly undercut the prices of \nAmerican-made products sold here in the United States.\n  Faced with eroding U.S. market share, American producers struggled to \nstay afloat, unable to invest in new plants or equipment or to meet \ntheir payrolls. This was particularly true for small businesses and \nmany of our Nation's family farmers, ranchers, and aquacultural \nproducers. Even today, valiant producers of shrimp and crawfish \ncontinue to suffer from having endured a double whammy: unending unfair \ntrade and Hurricane Katrina.\n  CDSOA was enacted to restore conditions of fair trade, so that jobs \nthat should stay in the United States are not sent overseas or \n``outsourced'' as the result of unfair competition. Under the law, each \nyear, Customs distributes duties collected from unfair imports to those \nAmerican companies and workers who can prove that they have been \nmaterially injured by unfair trade.\n  While the amounts distributed under the program are not large from a \nbudget perspective---approximately $226 million for fiscal year 2005--\nthe law is critically important to American companies and workers who \ncontinue to work hard to stay in business, even when foreign producers \nrefuse to stop dumping. American companies that rightfully receive \ndistributions under the law include producers of crawfish, garlic, \nfurniture, honey, lumber, wheat, shrimp, catfish, semiconductor chips, \nbearings, mushrooms, crawfish, pasta, steel, raspberries, cement, and a \nlong list of others--all of which deserve to be reimbursed under the \nlaw for having suffered the negative effects of bringing successful \ntrade cases against illegally traded imports year after year after \nyear.\n  There was a claim on the Senate floor earlier this week that CDSOA \nclaims may be fraudulent. That shows a basic misunderstanding of the \nlaw. To receive reimbursement under the law, companies must certify, in \nwriting, that they have made qualifying expenditures in their workers \nand facilities. CDSOA reimburses them for those expenditures. And \nCustoms may verify any claim submitted to make certain that a request \nfor reimbursement is valid. So there are very careful safeguards in \nplace under the law to be certain that funds are distributed fairly, \nhonestly, and legally.\n\n  Critics of the Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act also argue \nthat the WTO has ruled against the law, so we should abandon it. But \nthe WTO was wrong in opposing it. The WTO was overzealous in ruling \nagainst the law; it overreached. The WTO decision against this trade \nauthority was technically beyond the scope of the WTO' legal mandate. \nThe WTO incorrectly read into international agreements a prohibition \nagainst our law that was never agreed to by any U.S. trade negotiator. \nThe WTO has no legal basis to request that the United States repeal \nthis law.\n  Nearly 800 American companies and workers in nearly every State of \nthe Nation receive distributions under its provisions. It is critical \nto family-owned businesses, like Warwood Tools in Wheeling, WV, and to \nWheeling-Pittsburgh Steel, and to Mittal Steel's facilities in Weirton, \nWV. It is equally important to the thousands of steelworkers in Ohio, \nPennsylvania, and elsewhere across the Nation. They, and all hard-\nworking Americans, deserve to continue to receive these funds so long \nas foreign traders keep dumping. If our trading partners don't like \nthis trade law, I have only two words for them: stop dumping.\n  In the fiscal year 2004 and 2005 Consolidated Appropriations Acts--\nand, now, in the fiscal year 2006 Commerce, Justice, Science, and \nRelated Agencies Appropriations Act--both Houses of Congress included \nlanguage that directs the administration to negotiate a solution to the \nWTO dispute concerning this law. In fact, the conference report on the \nCJS bill that contains this language was approved by the Senate on \nNovember 16 by an overwhelming vote of 94 to 5.\n  Pursuant to these congressional directives, the administration last \nyear put this trade law on the table in the Doha Round of trade \nnegotiations, and the USTR even told our trading partners that it \nagrees it is ``beyond question that countries have the sovereign right \nto distribute duties as they deem appropriate.''\n  Even if the WTO disagrees with the law, any retaliation by other \ncountries against us is negligible--equal to only a few hours of trade \namong a few of our trading partners.\n  Currently, the United States and other nations are seeking to \ncomplete negotiations in the Doha Round of international trade talks by \nthe end of 2006. Now is not the time to weaken the hand of our trade \nnegotiators by attempting to repeal one of our Nation's most prominent \nand effective trade laws.\n  In fact, now is the time to do more to hold foreign unfair traders \naccountable, not less.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to join me in support of this \nmotion to instruct the conferees to strike from the budget \nreconciliation bill any provision that would repeal this critical trade \nlaw.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this proposal is a motion to instruct which \nhas no binding effect and, thus, I assume Members are just going to \nvote the way they feel like voting.\n  I will point out this: No. 1, the effect of this motion, if it had a \nbinding effect, would be to take $3 billion away from the Federal \nTreasury and give it to specific companies in violation of a WTO \nruling. It may have made sense at one time, but since the WTO ruling, \nit makes no sense. Because of that ruling, other companies are now \nbeing penalized inappropriately because we continue to assess this \nfine.\n  No. 2, it is very hard for me to understand why, in a bill that is \nsupposed to be reducing the deficit, we would want to increase the \ndeficit by passing this type of instruction. Therefore, I oppose the \nmotion to instruct.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The \nyeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The Legislative Clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, on rollcall vote 354, I voted ``yea.'' It \nwas my intention to vote ``nay.'' Therefore, I ask unanimous consent \nthat I be permitted to change my vote since it will not affect the \noutcome.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The foregoing tally has been changed to reflect the above order.)\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask that the Record show that I \nwould have voted ``aye'' on rollcall vote 354, the DeWine motion to \ninstruct conferees on S. 1932. I continue to support the Continued \nDumping and Subsidy Offset Act, and I agree that its repeal should not \nbe included in the conference report.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I regret that I was unable to vote this \nafternoon on the DeWine motion to instruct conferees with respect to S. \n1932, the deficit reduction bill.\n  The DeWine motion to instruct conferees was crafted with the goal of \npreventing Senate conferees to S. 1932 from agreeing with the House \nprovision that repeals the Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act of \n2000 (CDSOA) during conference deliberations. Despite widespread \nsupport for this provision of law, the House companion bill repeals \nCDSOA. I have been a supporter of CDSOA since it was first crafted by \nSenator Mike DeWine of Ohio.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the Record reflect that, had I been here, I \nwould have voted in favor of Senator DeWine's motion to instruct \nconferees to not repeal CDSOA during conference deliberations on S. \n1932.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my letter of November 29, 2005, to the \nHonorable Charles Grassley, Chairman, Committee on Finance, on the need \nto maintain CDSOA, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Dear Chairman Grassley: I write today concerning a \n     provision contained in H.R. 4241, the House-passed savings \n     reconciliation bill, that repeals the Continued Dumping and \n     Subsidy Offset Act of 2000 [P.L. 106-387]. The Senate \n     companion bill, S. 1932, does not include this repeal. I am \n     optimistic that the Senate will not concur with the House \n     action during conference deliberations on this bill. Please \n     know that I was a cosponsor of the free-standing bill \n     introduced by Senator Mike DeWine that was the blueprint for \n     this amendment.\n       Over two years ago, the World Trade Organization (WTO) \n     ruled that the Byrd Amendment is inconsistent with the United \n     States' WTO obligations. The WTO has since authorized eight \n     WTO members to retaliate against the United States. Canada, \n     the European Union, Japan and Mexico have imposed about $115 \n     million in retaliation on U.S. exports after the United \n     States failed to meet a December 2003 WTO deadline for \n     repealing the act.\n       However, in H.R. 2673, the Fiscal Year 2004 Consolidated \n     Appropriations Act, Congress included a provision that \n     directs the Bush Administration to immediately initiate WTO \n     negotiations to recognize the ability of WTO members to \n     distribute monies collected from antidumping and \n     countervailing duties, and to provide regular reports on such \n     negotiations.\n       Earlier this year, 25 Republican Senators wrote to Majority \n     Leader Frist urging that the Senate not agree to any \n     provisions that would repeal CDSOA. Prior to that letter, \n     over 70 Senators wrote to President Bush expressing the view \n     that U.S. negotiators needed to re-engage WTO members and to \n     continue to push for maintaining CDSOA. It was the view of \n     these Members that U.S. trade laws are designed to insure a \n     level playing field for U.S. industries and their workers \n     that are being harmed by unfair trade.\n       As you may recall, the Bush administration stated in its \n     November 2002 appeal ``[T]he Panel in this case has created \n     obligations that do not exist in the WTO Agreements cited. \n     The errors committed are serious and many about a statute \n     which, in the end, creates a payment program that is not \n     challenged as a subsidy.''\n       With this in mind, I urge you to oppose efforts to repeal \n     CDSOA during House-Senate conference negotiations on H.R. \n     4241 and S. 1932, the spending reconciliation bills.\n       Thank you for your kind consideration of this request.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Rick Santorum,\n                                             United States Senate.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                      Motion to Instruct Conferees\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, what is the regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). There is 2 minutes evenly \ndivided.\n  Mr. GREGG. Is that on the Kohl proposal?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I call up my motion, which is at the desk, \nto reject the $16 billion cut to the child support program which is in \nthe House bill but which is not in the Senate bill. The House position \nwill result in $24 billion in child support payments going uncollected, \nand would impact families in every single State. The child support \nprogram is a proven success and it has won high praise in the \nPresident's 2006 budget for providing a $4 return on every dollar \ninvested in the program.\n  The House conference report is opposed by a wide range of interests, \nincluding the National Governors' Association and the National \nConference of State Legislatures. I strongly urge my colleagues to join \nme in sending a message to the conferees that the Senate will not \nsupport cutting benefits for over 17 million children.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. The motion of the Senator from Wisconsin is not binding so \nI am sure they will vote as they please. It is well-intentioned and I \nagree with the concept. However, there are issues within the child \nsupport questions which should be subject to conference and which, if \nyou read the motion literally and which if it had any binding effect, \nwould undermine our capacity to have flexibility in conference.\n  Specifically, for example, under the law today, you can use Federal \nmoney and make the State match, so what is happening is States are \ntaking Federal money, and instead of using their State dollars to \nmatch, they are using Federal money to get more Federal money. That \nmakes no sense at all.\n  The House has corrected this program. This language would undermine \nthat. I hope we do not support the motion to instruct. The conference \nwill do a good job on this. It does not need this instruction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senators were necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Georgia (Mr. Chambliss), the Senator from South Carolina \n(Mr. Graham), the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Isakson), the Senator from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Santorum), and the Senator from Louisiana (Mr. \nVitter).\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden), \nthe Senator from California (Mrs. Boxer), the Senator from Washington \n(Ms. Cantwell), and the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Dodd) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nCalifornia (Mrs. Boxer) would vote ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will just take 30 seconds because the \nother 30 seconds will be taken by the chairman of the HELP Committee. \nAll this motion does is insist that the student aid program--which \nprovides $8 billion more for Pell eligible students--that passed out of \nour committee, virtually unanimously, will be affirmed in the \nconference. Effectively, we are taking what was the bipartisan \nagreement in our committee under the leadership of Senator Enzi and \ninstructing the conferees to support that position.\n  Many of our colleagues have voiced their public support for this \nmotion, including Senators Durbin, Harkin, Dodd, Reid, Lieberman, \nKerry, Reed, Corzine, Clinton, and Lautenberg.\n  If you are for American competitiveness in the global economy, you \nwill vote for this motion.\n  If you are for a strong national security, you will vote for this \nmotion.\n  If you are for opportunity for every American, you will vote for this \nmotion.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in doing what is right for American \nfamilies, especially at Christmas, and send a strong message that \nstudents need our help now.\n  I yield 30 seconds to the Senator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I concur with what the Senator from \nMassachusetts just said. As the body will remember, the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee had the heaviest lifting in \nthe savings bill, and we met that requirement. We met that requirement \nwhile we provided for some grants for both low-income and people who \nwould major in math and science and some special languages.\n  I would appreciate the support of this body on this instruction. I \nhave been negotiating with the House for 5 full days, and this is one \nof the issues that is still up. This instruction would help us in that \nnegotiation. I would appreciate the support.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nsupport Senator Kennedy's motion to instruct conferees. The motion \ninstructs Senate conferees to insist on preserving the Senate \nprovisions that increase need-based financial aid in S. 1932. Forty \nyears ago, President Johnson sought to increase accessibility to \neducation by signing into law the Higher Education Act of 1965. In \nPresident Johnson's words, ``To thousands of young men and women, this \n[Act] means the path of knowledge is open to all that have the \ndetermination to walk it . . . a high school senior anywhere in this \ngreat land of ours can apply to any college or any university in any of \nthe 50 States and not be turned away because his family is poor.''\n  Access to higher education has long been and remains a great American \ngoal. The good news is that the number of students enrolling in \ninstitutions of higher education has nearly doubled over the past 35 \nyears--from 8.5 million in 1970 to approximately 16 million in 2005. \nThe bad news is that, despite the importance of a college education in \nthe 21st century, so many millions of young adults never make it to \ncollege. Sadly, many fail to make it to college due to financial \nconstraints.\n  Never has higher education played such a critical role in closing the \ngap between the haves and the have-nots. Over the course of their \nlifetime, college graduates earn over $1 million more than those \nwithout college degrees. Today, 6 out of every 10 jobs require some \npostsecondary education and training. By 2010, the number of jobs \nrequiring advanced skills will grow at twice the rate of those \nrequiring only basic skills.\n  In addition to the individual benefits of earning a college degree, \ninvesting in and producing more college-educated Americans is vital to \nour Nation's growth. Economists estimate that the increases in the \neducation level of the U.S. labor force between 1915 and 1999 directly \nresulted in at least 23 percent of the overall growth in U.S. \nproductivity.\n  Unfortunately, the cost of a college education is far out of reach \nfor many American students and is hitting poor families the hardest--\nnot just those from poverty-stricken areas but those who come from \nfamily farms and those who may be new immigrants. According to the \nCollege Board, the inflation-adjusted, real increase in tuition, fees, \nand room and board at public colleges over the last 5 years has been 2 \npercent. At 4-year private schools, the same costs have increased by 17 \npercent.\n  Federal financial assistance is simply not keeping pace with rising \ncollege costs. In the 1970s, the maximum Pell grant for low-income and \nworking class families covered about 40 percent of the average cost of \nattending a 4-year college. Now it only covers about 15 percent. Smart, \nhardworking kids from low-income backgrounds deserve a chance to go as \nfar as their talents will take them. According to Postsecondary \nEducation Opportunity, a higher education research group, the \npercentage of the Nation's poorest students who earned a bachelor's \ndegree by age 24 increased only from 7.1 percent in 1975 to 8.6 percent \n2003. The students left behind represent a huge untapped resource for \nour country.\n  Recently, many reports have sounded the alarm that America is losing \nits edge as the world's technological innovator to countries such as \nChina and India. These countries are moving from being the world's \nsupplier of low-wage, high-labor work to becoming the world's \ntechnological leaders by investing in their talent pool. In recent \nyears, Americans have felt the effects of the impact of education as \nnewly educated workers from China and India compete for prime jobs once \nheld in the United States. According to the National Academies, in \n2004, China graduated 600,000 engineers and India 350,000, while the \nUnited States produced only 70,000 engineers. To keep America's edge, \nwe must recognize the value of investing in higher education and \nprovide our young adults with the assistance they need so that they can \ncompete in the global economy.\n\n  The Senate provisions included in S. 1932 that increase need-based \nfinancial aid--Pell grants and new need-based aid programs such as \nProGap and SMART grants--will help many deserving students reach their \neducational potential. In contrast, the House fails to seize an \nopportunity to expand Pell grants and other need-based aid. Instead, \nthe House bill includes provisions that would make college more \nexpensive for families. These provisions include: No. 1, a temporary \nincrease in origination fees for direct loan borrowers; No. 2, repeal \nof a scheduled reduction in the maximum student loan interest rate--\nfrom 8.25 percent to 6.8 percent for students and from 9 percent to 7.9 \npercent for parents; No. 3, imposing a new 1 percent borrower \norigination fee that will make it more expensive to consolidate loans; \nand No. 4, requiring lenders to charge student and parent borrowers a 1 \npercent insurance fee on student loans.\n  By insisting on the Senate provisions, we will boost need-based aid \nand in turn help the United States maintain its competitive edge. But \nmost importantly, we will be a step closer to living up to the promise \nthat President Johnson made to America's youth 40 years ago: providing \naccess to higher education for those determined to realize the American \ndream.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there is 2 minutes \nequally divided on the Reed motion to instruct conferees. The Senator \nfrom Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I offer this motion along with my colleague, \nSenator Collins from Maine. I will shortly yield to her the last 30 \nseconds. I also offer it on behalf of myself and other Senators, \nincluding Senator Lautenberg.\n  The reality is very clear to so many poor families in this country. \nEnergy prices are rising, temperatures are falling, and they are going \nto be in a very vulnerable and very disadvantaged position. This \namendment would add $2.9 billion in additional funding for LIHEAP. It \nwould bring it up to the authorized level of $5.1 billion.\n  We have considered this proposal in various procedural means four \ntimes. A majority of the Senate has always supported it. I hope it \ncontinues to do so.\n  I yield my remaining time to Senator Collins.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this \nmotion to instruct the conferees to add $2.9 billion for the LIHEAP \nprogram. The time is growing late. In northern Maine, the high \ntemperature earlier this week--the high temperature--was 12 degrees. \nLet's act now to avert a real crisis for low-income families across \nthis country.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today for one very simple reason--to \nask for the support of my colleagues for the Reed-Collins-Kennnedy-\nSnowe motion to instruct the conferees to S. 1932, to add $2.92 billion \nfor the Low Income Home Energy Assistant Program, or LIHEAP. This \nfunding, along with the expected $2.18 billion in fiscal year 2006 \nappropriations, will confirm the commitment we made just this past July \nand bring LIHEAP up to the level of $5.1 billion we authorized in the \n2005 Energy bill.\n  In the Nation's colder States such as Maine, the days are \nrelentlessly marching toward winter, the clock is ticking as the \nthermometer edges ever downward and it would be unconscionable for \nCongress to adjourn for the year without providing critical, additional \nassistance for LIHEAP at a time when home heating oil prices have been \npredicted to increase by up to 44 percent this coming winter.\n  There should be no mistake--this is an emergency and a crisis that is \nno longer an impending crisis as I have been saying for months--it is \nnow here. I feel very strongly that it would be an abrogation of our \nresponsibility to stand by and allow more and more of our elderly on \nfixed incomes and low-income people, including children, to suffer \nbecause of a lack of heat.\n  This past week, it was reported to one of my Maine offices that two \nelderly people--who have already used up their entire LIHEAP allotment \nfor a winter that has not yet officially arrived--were admitted to the \nhospital with hypothermia. In one of the households, the residence was \nso cold the water in the toilet bowl was frozen. It has been said that \na society is judged by how it treats its most vulnerable citizens. What \na failing grade we would get for LIHEAP. The fact is, countless \nAmericans don't have room in their budget for such a surge in home \nheating prices--but surely, in looking at our national priorities, we \ncan find room in our budget to help Americans stay warm this winter.\n  It does not take a crystal ball to predict the dire consequences when \nhome heating oil in Maine has risen to $2.59 per gallon, up 66 cents \nfrom a year ago, kerosene prices average $2.72 a gallon, 52 cents \nhigher than this time last year, and propane is at $2.20 per gallon, 17 \ncents higher than last year. Some projections have a gallon of heating \noil reaching $3.00 later in the winter.\n  So understandably, we are hearing the mounting concern ``how will I \npay for home heating oil when it's already almost 30 percent more than \nlast year, and I struggled to make ends meet then?'' ``How will I \nafford to pay half again as much for natural gas?'' People need to know \nnow that they can count on us--U.S. Congress--for assistance, not the \nmost disruptive country leader in the Western Hemisphere who comes \nbearing gifts of discounted oil to our communities and States. This \ncountry should take care of its own.\n  Home heating oil in my State is a necessity of life--so much so that \n73 percent of households in a recent survey reported they would cut \nback on, and even go without, other necessities such as food, \nprescription drugs, and mortgage and rent payments. Churches, food \npantries, and local service organizations are all hearing the cry and \nsensing the growing need.\n  Because of the supply disruptions caused by the Gulf hurricanes at a \ntime when prices were already spiraling up, prices have been driven \neven higher and are directly affecting low-come Mainers and how they \nWill be able to pay for their home heating oil, propane and kerosene \nthis winter. A recent Wall Street Journal quoted Jo-Ann Choate, who \nheads up Maine's LIHEAP program. Ms. Choate said, ``This year we've got \na very good chance of running out.'' Eighty-four percent of the \napplicants for the LIHEAP program in the State use oil heat. Over \n46,000 applied for and received State LIHEAP funds last winter. Each \nhousehold received $480, which covered the cost of 275 gallons of \nheating oil.\n  The problem this winter is that the same $480 will buy only 172 \ngallons, which a household will use up in the first 3 to 4 weeks in \nMaine. What will these people do to stay warm for the four or five \nmonths left of winter? The water pipes will freeze and then break, \ndamaging homes. People will start using their stoves to get heat. The \nMortgage Bankers Association expects that the steep energy costs could \nincrease the number of missed payments and lost homes beginning later \nthis year. My State is anticipating at least 48,000 applicants this \nwinter, so there will be less money distributed to each household \nunless we can obtain higher funding for the LIHEAP program.\n  Ms. Choate says that Maine plans to focus on the elderly, disabled, \nand families with small children, and is studying how to move others to \nheated shelters. This is why our efforts are so very important. And it \nisn't just Maine. It is happening in all of the Nation's cold weather \nStates. Quite simply, without increased funding, we are forcing the \nmanagers of State LIHEAP programs to make a Solomon's choice as to who \ngets served.\n  The facts are that LIHEAP is projected to help 5 million households \nnationwide this winter. But that is only\n\n[[Page S13635]]\n\nabout one-sixth of households across the country that actually can \nqualify for the assistance. So this is a perennial fight we wage even \nwhen prices aren't as high as today. And now, that battle becomes all \nthe more pivotal.\n  I Thank Senators Reed and Collins for their leadership on this motion \nto instruct the conferees for increased LIHEAP funding, and I am proud \nto stand shoulder to shoulder with them to secure what is, in essence, \nliterally life-or-death funding for our most vulnerable Americans. The \ncold weather won't wait--and neither should we when it comes to helping \ncitizens survive through the coming winter.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, let's remember what this amendment does in \nthe context of the LIHEAP issue. This amendment will add $2.9 billion \nto the national debt and pass that debt on to our children in order to \npay for energy costs which are being incurred today.\n  The correct way to do this is the way we proposed in the Senate, as \nRepublicans, which is to pay for it. That is what we will do in the \nconference. There is already $1 billion additional money for LIHEAP in \nthe conference, and it will probably go up. The difference between \nthose dollars and what is being proposed in this amendment is we \nactually pay for it.\n  It is inappropriate to go to this number, which is a 130-percent \nincrease in the LIHEAP program, when spending on oil is estimated to go \nup by 28 to 30 percent or maybe even 40 percent. Increasing the program \nby 130 percent when the oil costs are going up 30 to 40 percent is \ninconsistent on its face.\n  It is especially inconsistent when one is taking that bill and giving \nit to one's children and their children's children so they end up \npaying for today's oil costs rather than their oil costs 2 or 3 years \nfrom today or two or three generations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The yeas and nays were previously ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, obviously somewhere in the next few days--\nwe don't know when yet--we are going to be wrapping up our business \nhere, and that will mark the end of the first session of the 109th \nCongress. Before we leave, Members on both sides of the aisle are very \nconcerned that we will not have provided the assistance to the small \nbusinesses in the Gulf States region that they desperately need in \norder to recover from the effects of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.\n  The effect is that literally hundreds of thousands of small \nbusinesses are in desperate need of assistance throughout that region. \nWithout the jobs those small businesses provide, the economy of the \ngulf coast is going to have a much harder time coming back.\n  Since Hurricanes Katrina and Rita hit the gulf coast, regrettably--\nthis has been commented on again by Senators on both sides of the \naisle; it is not a partisan issue--there has been a stunningly slow \nresponse by the Administration to provide relief to small businesses.\n  The administration has now sent up three pieces of emergency \nlegislation--three supplemental emergency spending bills worth more \nthan $62 billion--and yet we have not adopted any direct relief for \nsmall businesses.\n  The latest supplemental request asks for $471 million in additional \nfunding for SBA disaster loans and the SBA Inspector General. But, \nfrankly, giving more money to the disaster loan program doesn't address \nsmall business needs. It's too narrow in scope and is not delivering \nrelief with urgency.\n  Senator Lott has talked about the problems--Senator Cochran has too--\nand there is a recognition that you have a lot of small businesses that \ncan't wait till their disaster loans are processed or disbursed. They \nneed access to capital immediately.\n  It is a matter of record now, commented on in many national journals, \nthat the SBA has done a completely inadequate job--abysmal may be a \nbetter word--of getting disaster loan funds into the hands of small \nbusinesses in the gulf region.\n  It is not because of the lack of funds or the lack of employees. The \nSBA has enough funding to grant $1.4 billion in disaster loans, and \n$249 million for administration and staff. The staffing has been \nincreased from some 800 employees to 4,000 employees.\n  As of Monday of this week, almost 39,000 small businesses had applied \nfor\n\n[[Page S13636]]\n\nSBA disaster loans. Yet with all of these resources, both personnel and \nmoney, only 9,200 loans have been actually processed, which is 25 \npercent, and only 2,600, which is 7 percent, had actually been \napproved. Only 240 had actually seen a disbursement of money.\n  In addition, as of last week, the SBA had handed out only 10 of its \nnew gulf opportunity loans the administration's answer to the business \ncommunity's call for bridge loans.\n  We were assured by the SBA Administrator several weeks ago in a \nbipartisan committee hearing that those loans were on track, that they \nwould respond rapidly, that they had enough people in place, that they \nwere going to get the money out, and, indeed, here we are with the same \nrecord that was the incentive to have that hearing in the first place.\n  These loans, I might add, have an interest rate of as much as 13.5 \npercent. Why would we be providing a 13.5 percent loan to people who \nhave been hit when you are trying to do it as a matter of disaster \nresponse? Frankly, that is beyond me.\n  The program has generated irate complaints from the very people whom \nit has been set up to try to help. One small business owner who called \nmy office referred to the SBA and FEMA as ``blackwater mercenaries.'' \nThey feel set upon, not helped. We are not going to help the small \nbusinesses down there until we pass comprehensive small business \nassistance.\n  Senators Lott and Cochran have stated that the pace of reconstruction \nin their home State of Mississippi and the other Gulf States is \n``unacceptable.''\n  Despite the assertion of the administration that the Nation's ``small \nbusiness sector is vibrant,'' Senator Lott has said that the slow pace \nof approving disaster loans ``is preventing small businesses from \ncoming back and jobs from returning or being created. Not unexpectedly, \nthe unemployment rates in the two largest coastal counties, Harrison \nand Jackson, are more than quadruple the national average.''\n  Senator Lott is absolutely correct, and we need to do something about \nit.\n  So far, the best efforts of the Senate have been stymied. One bill \npassed 96-0 in the Senate during consideration of CJS. That was dropped \nin conference. Another bipartisan bill, S. 1807, the Small Business \nHurricane Relief and Reconstruction Act, has been blocked by the White \nHouse since September 30. That is almost 2\\1/2\\ months.\n  Small business owners such as Dr. Edward Lang and Dr. Angela Lang, \nwho rushed to complete their disaster loan application in the weeks \nfollowing the hurricane, believing that assistance was going to be \nthere, have been told that everything was going to be done to help \npeople recover. They have gone months now without hearing any response \nfrom the SBA whatsoever.\n  In the immediate aftermath of the storm, their small but successful \npodiatry office based out of New Orleans was deluged with 5 feet of \nwater.\n  With their savings all but gone, and the ever-shrinking list of \npatients, all of whom have been displaced by the storm, the Langs are \nin dire need of assistance. They want to stay there. They want to \nrebuild their business there. It is essential to New Orleans that \npeople who make that choice are empowered to be able to do so.\n  Despite repeated offers from out-of-state hospitals, they are \nsticking by their plan to try to rebuild in the city they love and the \nplace they want to work. But the cold shoulder they received from the \nSBA is a virtual death sentence for their livelihood. They are just one \nexample of countless other gulf coast businesses that have been ignored \nby the very governmental agencies that exist to serve them. On its \nface, that is unacceptable.\n  The request that has been put forward by the Small Business Committee \nfor $720 million is a little more than 1 percent of the $62 billion the \nadministration has requested for Katrina relief. This legislation is a \nvery small cost compared to the total amount of money the Government is \nputting in, but an enormous return for the small businesses that need \nit.\n  Once again, we are seeing a situation where big business is able to \nwalk away with most of the funding while the vast majority of the job \nbase is in small business, and they are not getting the assistance they \nneed.\n  What our bill does is to authorize $450 million for the impacted \nStates to provide immediate assistance to small businesses struggling \nto get on their feet. It authorizes additional funding for SBA's \npartners--such as the small business development centers that are out \nin the field trying to provide business counseling to the many people \nand to the owners who are trying to determine what comes next.\n  There are too many businesses on the verge of bankruptcy in the \nhurricanes' wake. Since the goal shared in a bipartisan way by all of \nthe Senate and the House is to try to get those businesses to be \nleveraged as best as possible, to be able to return as soon as \npossible, and each small business that returns helps the other small \nbusinesses to be able to return, all of those things will make a \ndifference. Tax breaks will help. But the fact is, tax breaks are not \nenough because tax breaks do not make an impact until you file your \ntaxes. They have nothing to do with the assistance one needs now to be \nable to have cash in the pocket, to be able to survive the gap. Small \nbusinesses need that additional relief, access to capital, immediate \nand longer-term.\n  Our bill also addresses the Administration's failure to contract with \nsmall businesses to rebuild the region. The New York Times reported \nmore than 80 percent of FEMA contracts alone were awarded on the no-bid \nlimited competition basis. This bill we have introduced--Senator Snowe, \nmyself, and other members of the committee--encourages greater \ncompetition by implementing a 30-percent goal for prime contracts and a \n40-percent subcontracting goal. With billions of dollars being \nallocated to relief and reconstruction, it is important to demand fair \ncompetition. We need to ensure that America's small businesses are not \nleft behind.\n  The citizens of the gulf region are courageously and desperately \ntrying to rebuild their communities. The empty promises of several \nweeks ago, ``we will do what it takes, we will stay as long as it \ntakes,'' are ringing in their ears. Frankly, they are wondering where \nthe actions are to back that up.\n  According to Mike Allen of Time magazine, one Presidential adviser is \nquoted as saying recently:\n\n       Katrina has fallen so far off the radar screen you can't \n     even find it.\n\n  We need to find it. We need to put small businesses back on the radar \nscreen. We need to follow through on the commitments to the victims of \nthese devastating hurricanes. We need to ensure that we do not leave \nthe citizens of the Gulf States behind.\n  There is bipartisan support to do this. The Senate passed this \nlegislation previously.

Mr. President, over the next few moments I will be \naddressing an issue that affects potentially thousands of people today \nwho are without therapy or who have debilitating diseases, and then \nbegin a brief discussion on what is called the cord blood bill.\n  The bill, broadly supported in a bipartisan way, has widespread \nsupport in the Senate, as well as in the House of Representatives.\n  As my colleagues know, we plan to take up and debate the policy and \nissues related to Federal support and oversight for embryonic stem cell \nresearch early next year.\n  And I look forward to what I know will be a full debate on the \nscience and ethics surrounding this important research.\n  Today, I ask consent to move forward with bipartisan legislation to \nencourage a technology that is producing cures and saving lives now.\n  This legislation is needed now.\n  Every day, patients young and old die waiting for transplants of \nhematopoetic cells because they can't find a suitable match.\n  Diseases like leukemia, sickle cell anemia, and as many as 70 other \nblood and genetic diseases have been helped or cured by Cord blood \ntransplants.\n\n[[Page S13637]]\n\n  Cord blood is a healthy byproduct of normal pregnancies, and is \nharvested from the placenta after the baby is safely delivered.\n  The placental byproducts yield blood cells that are genetically \nimmature, but have the remarkable ability to help recreate blood cells \nin patients who have diseases that traditionally have only helped \nthrough bone marrow transplants.\n  This bill provides for the creation of a public inventory of 150,000 \nunits of cord blood which is estimated to provide well matched \ntransplants for 80-90 percent of the population in need.\n  These are units that can be available in days, not months, with a \nsuccess rate in patients as high as 80-90 percent, as compared with 40-\n50 percent with traditional bone marrow transplants.\n  Because the cells are initially less mature and more pliable there is \nless chance of rejection, and therefore fewer complications.\n  In fact, over 7,000 cord blood transplants have been successfully \ndone here in this country, and around the world.\n  Leukemia is a devastating blood disease that has been treated by \ntraditional bone marrow transplants.\n  Unfortunately, although there is a large group of potential bone \nmarrow donors in the United States and Europe, testing, harvesting and \ntransplanting bone marrow cells can take often months, with less \ndependable success.\n  Although this is important technology, cord blood transplants may \nprovide an alternative that has already shown to be faster, safer, and \npotentially reach a larger group of patients affected with leukemia.\n  Nonmalignant blood conditions such a Sickle cell and Fanconi's anemia \nare also devastating to those affected by the disease.\n  Sickle cell anemia affects as many as 50,000 African Americans, while \nmany more are carries of the disease. Although very few unrelated cord \nblood transplants have occurred, the success has been staggering--\nSickle cell anemia can be cured.\n  Krabbe's disease is a genetic disease that affects only 1 in 100,000, \nbut as many as 1 in 125 Americans are carriers of the genetic \ndeficiency.\n  To date more than a dozen patients have had a cord blood transplant \nand have been cured of the disease.\n  Passage of this bill is especially important for minorities. For \nexample, African American patients have the lowest success rate in \ngetting a transplant from an unrelated bone marrow donor.\n  A long time member of my staff, Cornell Wedge, experienced this first \nhand. His brother, Robert Wedge Sr., was diagnosed with leukemia and in \nspite of sibling typing and numerous bone marrow drives aimed at \nincreasing minority donation, his brother passed away still waiting for \na match.\n  While tragic, this is not uncommon.\n  It can take months to properly screen, match, test and retest \npotential donors of traditional bone marrow transplant recipients.\n  Once we establish and collect a national cord blood inventory, we can \nsignificantly increase the chance of every individual in need to obtain \na nit for transplantation. Furthermore, because of the relative \nimmaturity of cord blood, rejection of the transplants are fewer and \nless severe.\n  I want to thank my colleagues, Senators Hatch, Burr, Ensign, \nBrownback, Dodd and Reed for spearheadng the effort to produce a \nbipartisan bill with broad support.\n  The House of Representatives passed H.R. 2520 with overwhelming \nbipartisan support.\n  Furthermore, Chairman Enzi and others in the Senate have worked in a \nbipartisan manner to achieve the compromise language represented in the \nbill as reported out of committee.\n  I'm told the House will move quickly on this bill as soon as the \nSenate completes action.\n  There is no question that this issue enjoys broad bipartisan support \nin the Senate.\n  We have a responsibility to authorize this program and provide \nappropriate guidance regarding the establishment of the program.\n  I will let my colleagues discuss the specifics of the legislation, \nbut I must ask, how can we deny any longer the many patients waiting \ntoday to find that match?\n  Indeed, the patients don't understand.\n  This is literally a matter of life and death.\n  Proverbs 27:3 says ``Do not withhold good from those who deserve it \nwhen it is in your power to act.'' It is within our power to act.'' And \nI hope we do.\n  We have a responsibility in this body to authorize this program and \nprovide appropriate guidance so we can establish this program and get \nit up and running. There may be several of my colleagues who want to \ncomment on the specifics of the program.\n  I will ask consent at this point and hope that we do get agreement \nand then further comments can be made.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of Calendar No. 256, H.R. 2520, the cord blood bill. I \nask unanimous consent that the amendment at the desk be agreed to, the \nbill, as amended, be read a third time and passed, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I want to \nfirst pay my respects to Senator Frist and his leadership. He has been \na leader in this area. He knows it well. We served on the same \ncommittee together when our leader came here to the Senate. I also \ncommend Senator Frist for his leadership on the stem cell issue, a very \ncourageous stand.\n  I want to make it very clear that I support the cord blood bill. I am \na cosponsor of it. What's more, I joined with Senator Specter 2 years \nago to create the National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Program, and as \nour leader said, we included $10 million for that purpose in the fiscal \nyear 2004 Labor-Health and Human Services appropriations bill. We have \nbeen funding that program ever since. When I say I want this bill to \npass, I have a record to back that up.\n  But I have said for months that we should consider the cord blood \nbill at the same time that we take up H.R. 810, the Stem Cell Research \nEnhancement Act. That is what the House of Representatives did. On May \n24, the House approved both bills. We have been waiting in the Senate \nto do the same thing. Senator Specter and I, along with Senators Hatch, \nFeinstein, Kennedy, and Smith all agree. Let's have up-or-down votes on \ncord blood and H.R. 810, as the House did. The House did them together. \nThen we can send them to the President.\n  We keep hearing that we want to bring up H.R. 810. In fact, I pay my \nrespects to the leader for his very courageous speech. On July 29, our \nleader said he would vote for the bill. But we just can't seem to bring \nit up on the Senate floor. Members keep coming up with new bills to try \nto confuse things. They want to vote on 5 or 6 or 7 bills, some of \nwhich have nothing to do with stem cells or cord blood. I understand \nthere is a lot of pressure on Senators to take up the cord blood bill \nbefore the end of the year. I have no problem with that, but under one \ncondition--that we also take up H.R. 810.\n  I reserve the right to object. I ask the leader if he would modify \nhis request to include H.R. 810 in his amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator so modify his request?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, reserving the right to object to the \nrequest for a modification, all of these issues are critically \nimportant to promoting the health and welfare of patients as we look to \nthe future, especially with embryonic stem cells, diseases that occur \ntoday. But it is going to take some while to have the research fully \ndeveloped to be able to apply it. I believe it has huge promise, as I \nhave said on this floor many times. The reason I feel strongly about \nseparating the bills now is that bill is contentious in the sense that \nit is going to take a lot of debate. This is the embryonic stem cell \nbill that my distinguished colleague from Iowa refers to. It is going \nto take some time that I will give on the floor of the Senate early in \nthe year and have committed to do so because of its importance. It is \nimportant to address that in order for that research to be amplified. \nMuch of that research needs to be\n\n[[Page S13638]]\n\namplified for cures that may occur 5 or 10 years down the road.\n  The reason I feel strongly, since there is probably unanimous consent \non the substance of this bill, that we should move ahead is that we can \nbenefit people who are dying today from diseases such as Fanconi's \nanemia, diseases such as a whole range of leukemias, childhood leukemia \nespecially, where cord blood is so particularly powerful, diseases such \nas Krabbes, a pretty rare disease for which there is no treatment today \nexcept for the therapy that is applied in terms of cord blood. The \nreason I think we can justify, and should justify, separating these \nbills is that we all agree on the substance. It is a good bill. The \nleadership of Senator Harkin and Senator Specter have brought us to the \npoint that funding has begun. But now is the time to make this registry \navailable nationwide.\n  The one problem with cord blood today is that it is powerful. It is \nmore powerful than a regular bone marrow transplant, but the quantity \nthat you get out of the placental byproducts has to be accumulated. You \nneed to accumulate it from several different sources. But you do have \nto have a degree of genetic matching. Therefore, the only way to take \nadvantage of it is to have a national registry where you can go to a \ncomputer and see where it is all over the country. Then you pull it \ntogether to treat a child who is dying from leukemia today. Therefore, \naction on this bill will save lives, literally.\n  We always exaggerate. A lot of people exaggerate the politics about \nsaving lives in a lot of legislation we do. But I do believe that by \nestablishing the registry and the communications network, which has not \nbeen done in spite of the funding, we can have a dramatic impact.\n  Since we have the House bill, we have the bill that we are requesting \ntoday, and I have assurances that the House will deal with it before we \nleave in the next 48 hours, we literally can pass a bill that we all \nagree upon.\n  There are a number of other bills. One is the embryonic stem cell \nbill. But there is an alternative therapy bill. There are a whole range \nof bills that are very important that we need to take up that are going \nto take several days on the floor to look at ethical and scientific \nissues. We are committed to doing that in the early part of the year. \nThis is an important topic, and that is why I will object to the \nmodification because I believe the embryonic stem cell does deserve \nmore thought than we can possibly give it in the next 48 hours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest of the majority leader?\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Reserving the right to object, I want to enter into \nthis discussion. I deeply appreciate the majority leader bringing the \nissue up. I appreciate the comments of my colleague from Iowa. He and I \nhave been around this debate for some time. I personally want to bring \nup a human cloning ban. That is something I have had in the mill for 4 \nyears. Each session we are getting close. I think it ought to be \nincluded right now and moved forward. Yet I recognize it has some \ncontentiousness to it, as does my colleague from Iowa raising the \nembryonic stem cell issue. It has a contentious debate on it. I have \nobjections, as a number of my colleagues do, to the use of young human \nlife for research purposes.\n  The reason that we should go forward with this type of proposal the \nleader is putting forward is there is nobody opposed to cord blood \nresearch in the entire 100 Members here. Everybody supports cord blood \nresearch. It is real cures today. I have two pictures of people who are \nbeing treated right now, have been treated. This is Keone, sickle cell \nanemia, cord blood cured. Another one, the next one, Krabbes disease, \n3-year-old, cured, cord blood. The problem is, we don't have a big \nregistry of it around the country. So it is a real hit and miss. Some \npeople are lucky enough to find it; others don't and die today.\n  With embryonic stem cell research, the researchers who are the most \nsupportive of it are looking at decades before we have cures. We are \nresearching on it today.\n  We can cure more kids such as Erik Haines today or more will die if \nwe don't take up what the majority leader is asking for us to do, a \nbill for which there is unanimous support. There is not a single person \nwho does not support a cord blood registry and getting the banking of \nit up so more people can live today.\n  So I hope my colleagues will look at this and say they don't object. \nThe Senator from Iowa supports the bill; he is one of the sponsors. \nLet's let this one through, and next year I would love to have a debate \non embryonic stem cell research. I would love to debate that and have a \ndebate about cloning. Let's do that and let's have this robust \ndiscussion where we don't have agreement.\n  But here we can save lives today. I am not going to object. I would, \nthough, ask that the majority leader's proffer be accepted so we can \nsave some lives today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Further reserving the right to object, and I will object, \nwith all due deference to my friend from Kansas, and he is my friend, \nthese two need to be together as they were in the House. I keep hearing \nabout we will bring this up and debate stem cells. I didn't come \nprepared with pictures. I can show you pictures of people dying today \nbecause they could use stem cell transplants right now. My friend from \nKansas says decades. No. It will be decades if we keep diddling around \nand not doing anything. I hear that we will bring it up and debate it. \nI have heard that for half a year.\n  Unless the majority leader can give us a date certain--give us a \ndate--hopefully before May 24, 2006--if the majority leader can give us \na date before then when we will bring up H.R. 810--if they want to \nbring up these other bills, fine, as separate bills, not as amendments \nto H.R. 810; bring them up separately and we will debate and vote on \nthem, fine. I have no problem with that. But unless the majority leader \ncan give us a date certain and not more of this ``maybe we will debate \nit sometime in the future,'' I will object. I reserve the right to \nobject and I ask the majority leader, can he give us a date certain by \nwhich the Senate will take up H.R. 810 as a freestanding bill without \namendments? If they want to bring up other bills, the cloning bill, \nthat is fine, too--not as an amendment to H.R. 810, but as a separate \nbill. I ask the majority leader, can he give us a date certain by which \nthis Senate will set aside time to bring up H.R. 810 as a freestanding \nbill without amendment, debate it, and vote it up or down?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the case, I think, to be made is whether we \ncan address this particular bill, where 100 percent of the body is for \nit. It will save lives today and tomorrow. There is a whole range of \nbills. We have the embryonic stem cell bill and we heard about the \ncloning bill. There is the alternative embryonic stem cell bill. We \nhave about six or seven bills which I have tried to bring to the floor \nunder a unanimous consent request objected to by the other side, where \nwe bring each of these bills separately, freestanding, to the floor. \nThat has been objected to by the other side of the aisle. Since that \ntime, I have committed that we will be addressing these bills early \nnext year. I cannot give a specific date. I cannot even tell people \nwhat we will be voting on tomorrow morning in this body, given our \nschedule. But the commitment is to address these issues in the early \npart of next year.\n  If we don't pass this now, people will be suffering who are waiting \nfor transplants if they cannot find a suitable match. Yet if we were to \npass this bill with this registry, the registry will put together a \npublic inventory of 150,000. One person waiting for a transplant that \nis lifesaving for otherwise untreatable diseases or treatable by a \ntraditional bone marrow transplant--we will have 150,000 units then in \na registry where you go to a computer and get a match and that \ntransplant can take place. You can match as many as 80 or 90 percent of \nthe people who are waiting today if we had this registry. The neat \nthing is that these units are available not within months but days. For \ntransplants, people usually have to wait months, but this is the sort \nof thing where once you have the registry, you wait not months but days \nto get the transplant.\n  One last point is that with these cord blood transplants, outcome is \nbetter\n\n[[Page S13639]]\n\nthan with the traditional bone marrow transplants with more mature \ncells. Cord blood cells are less mature and less pliable than the more \nadult cells for traditional bone marrow transplants.\n  With that, I am disappointed that we have heard this objection \ntonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I echo the disappointment of the leader and \nwill make a couple comments on the debate we have already had. I know \nit is not in the leader's power to bring up a bill that is unamendable. \nIt is possible for the leader--and the leader has made speeches in \nsupport of having the embryonic stem cell--to bring up a bill, but when \nit comes before the body, it can be amended any number of ways. So it \nis not possible for any leader to be able to give the guarantee that \nhas been asked for today.\n  Another important part of this debate is that we don't just have the \n100 Senators in this body agreeing that this is important, necessary, \nand immediate legislation; we also have the House agreeing that this is \nimportant, necessary, and immediate legislation. This is something for \nsaving lives now. This isn't a big thing to go into the research area. \nThis is treatment that is readily available.\n  We have preconferenced this bill already with the House, so it is not \na matter of debate or discord between the House and the Senate. I am \nnoticing at this time of the year that there is quite bit of that. \nThere are more fights between the House and Senate than between the \nRepublicans and Democrats. I hope we can get all of the debate resolved \nthat we have before us. This is one that ought to only take a few \nminutes, and it could be done yet today and to the President for \nsignature tomorrow because of the preconferencing we have done. That is \nunusual for a bill. If any one of the stem cell bills were able to be \neven unanimous consented within this body, we would be able to take it \nup as we have a number of bills, such as the pension bill, which was \nnot easy. To have one come up with absolutely an up-or-down vote isn't \ngoing to happen around here.\n  I know we were looking forward to the debate. We expected it. Then a \nlittle thing called Katrina happened. The time we would have been \ndebating that, we were debating lives in a little different manner, \ntrying to come up with solutions. We still have some of those \noutstanding. Time for debate here is a very precious thing, \nparticularly as we are winding up a session. I appreciate the leader \nsaying he would definitely bring it up early next year. I know that is \nabout as strong a commitment as anybody can make around this body.\n  While we are on this bill, I want to express my support for its \npassage, and I want to particularly commend Senator Hatch for his work \non it. In fact, the base bill we worked with was Senator Hatch's bill. \nHe brought a lot of us along with him on getting an understanding of \nwhat this does and what it could do, and he not only had the experience \nwith the bill he submitted, but has been working on this in various \nstages for years. He has a tremendous body of knowledge he was willing \nto share and able to share. That is what brought everybody into the \npicture. He worked with Senators Burr, Ensign, Dodd, and Reed to \ndevelop the HELP Committee product that now also the House can support. \nI appreciate his efforts, as well as the others within the HELP \nCommittee, to reach this delicate compromise.\n  I also thank my colleagues who were critical to legislation, which \nwould be Senators Kennedy, Brownback, Kyl, and others. They played a \nsignificant role. Given that this is a preconference agreement with the \nHouse, I appreciate the work of Representative C.W. Bill Young and \nChris John, Chairman Joe Barton, and others in the House who have \nworked with us to help develop this language, to take the \ncontentiousness out, to get it to the point where it is now. One of the \nunfortunate things with preconferencing and unanimous consent is that \nwithout the wild debate on things, the media normally doesn't pick up \nwhen something significant happens around here.\n  This is one of those issues that is so critical, and we need to get \nit to the people who need it now. We ought not have a contentious \ndebate just for the sake of getting the word out that we have done it. \nThis is something the media ought to latch onto, if it gets completed, \nand help us get the word out that it has been done and get it into \nplace.\n  The compromise we passed out of the HELP Committee in June recognizes \nthe valuable contributions made by stem cells from both bone marrow and \ncord blood. This legislation establishes a sibling cord blood program \nin which qualified cord blood banks have the option of providing free \ncollection and storage of cord blood units for families with an ill \nchild or parent who could be treated with a cord blood transplant. In \nthis way, we can ensure that sick children have the best possible \nchance to receive a closely matched transplant while still emphasizing \nthe availability of private cord blood bank donations.\n  To make it easier for patients to have access to cord blood and bone \nmarrow, this legislation also requires cord blood and bone marrow \nprograms to collaborate in providing patient advocacy and case \nmanagement services to patients. In this manner, patients can have \naccess to single point of access to determine the best option for their \ntransplant.\n  Additionally, this critical bill requires the Food and Drug \nAdministration to provide a report on its progress in developing \nlicensure requirements for cord blood units, given that such \nrequirements will help improve the quality of units provided to \npatients nationwide.\n  Finally, I wish to mention a new outcomes database included within \nthe legislation which provides the opportunity for the Health Resources \nand Services Administration and other researchers to examine the \nclinical benefit of a variety of these therapeutic products, including \nbone marrow and cord blood.\n  All of these critical changes will help improve the quality of care \npatients receive each day.\n  This week, I read about a little boy who benefited from a cord blood \ntransplant. This little boy was born in December 1999.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). Regular order has been called \nfor. Does the Senator object?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, thank you for the opportunity to continue. I \nknow there are others who want to speak on this briefly, too.\n  I read about this boy who was born in December 1999. At age 1, he was \ndiagnosed with a disease causing progressive damage to the brain and \nadrenal glands. Left untreated, it would lead to his eventual death. \nFor this little boy, an unrelated cord blood or bone marrow transplant \nwas the only known cure for his disease.\n  When he was just 2 years old, because of the disease progression, he \nreceived a cord blood transplant. Two years post-transplant, he is \ndoing extremely well. He is a healthy, normal little boy. If you met \nhim, you never would guess what he had been through and what awaited \nhim without this transplant.\n  It is for this little boy and others that we are focusing on this \ncritical legislation right now. Like others, I do think that it is \nimportant for us to discuss the broader issues of stem cells on the \nSenate floor. However, it is neither the time nor the place for such a \ndebate. But we can help people now by passing this legislation which \nhas broad bipartisan support. You can't get more bipartisan than 100 \npercent. So I urge my colleagues not to hold up this critical \nlegislation until that other debate occurs. I urge my colleagues to \nthink of this little boy and other little boys and adults and people in \nbetween who would benefit from cord blood or bone marrow transplants.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am hopeful that my dear friend and \ncolleague from Iowa, Senator Harkin, will withdraw his objection. I \nthink everybody in this body knows it was only after years of study--a \nvery sincere study--that I came out for embryonic stem cell research, \nas well as cord blood stem cell research.\n\n[[Page S13640]]\n\n  I mention to my colleague from Iowa that the majority leader, even \nthough he was against embryonic stem cell research, has had the courage \nto come out for it. Upon reflection and study, he has as great a desire \nto pass embryonic stem cell research as I do. So when we get down that \nroad of being able to help the living with these tremendous maladies we \nhave, it may be the final answer to health care costs as well. But we \nhave to start now.\n  There is a difference. This bill is the cord blood research bill. I \ndo not know one person in this whole body who is against it. Not one. I \ndon't know one person in the House of Representatives who is against \nit. Not one. And by the way, we have preconferenced this bill. It is \nvery difficult to preconference bills. But virtually everybody realizes \nthat if we can pass the cord blood bill, we will go way down the road \nof being able to help people with these serious problems, especially \nthese young children, as mentioned by our distinguished chairman, \nSenator Enzi.\n  I am grateful for all of the people he mentioned in his illustrious \nremarks. There have been a lot of people who have worked on this issue. \nI think we should take the majority leader's word as a supporter of \nembryonic stem cell research that he will bring that bill up for a \ndebate. There are others who also want to debate their particular \npoints of view with regard to embryonic stem cell research, but \nvirtually everybody is for cord blood research.\n  I believe we should give unanimous consent to immediately call up and \nadopt H.R. 2520, the Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Act. We should \npass this bill immediately. Patients cannot afford to wait until next \nyear, their families cannot afford to wait until next year, and we in \nthe Congress cannot afford to wait until next year.\n  Passage of this legislation offers us a rare opportunity to make a \ndifference in the lives of those who either have a serious illness or \nhave a family member who suffers from a serious illness. I don't think \nwe should let this opportunity pass. This is the season of the year \nwhen we try to put others before ourselves.\n  As everyone knows, I have been working on this issue for 3 solid \nyears and, in fact, with my original cosponsors--Senators Brownback, \nDodd, and Specter--introduced the first bill on this issue in the 108th \nCongress. I am pleased that I have introduced legislation with Senators \nDodd, Burr, Ensign, and Reed to put aside our differences and let this \nlegislation pass once and for all. It is the right thing to do because \nit is in the best interest of my fellow citizens.\n  My goal, which I share with the other sponsors of this bill, is to \ncreate the best possible system to provide patients, clinicians, and \nfamilies with access to these lifesaving treatments. I believe H.R. \n2520 does this by ensuring that the number of bone marrow donors and \ncord blood units available for transplant and research increases in the \nnear future.\n  The integrated system will include not only the international bone \nmarrow donor registry but also a network of qualified cord blood banks \nwhich will collect, test, and preserve cord blood stem cells. In \naddition, the system will educate and recruit donors, facilitate the \nrapid matching of donors and recipients, and quickly make such cells \navailable for transplant centers for stem cell transplantation. The \nestablishment of a national infrastructure for transplant material will \nhelp save the lives of many critically ill Americans.\n  We need to be sure that our Nation can meet the needs of patients and \nphysicians by providing a strong future for both bone marrow and cord \nblood transplantation in this country.\n  My personal goal is to ensure that the amount of transplant material \navailable for patient care and research continues to increase in the \ncoming years. The only way that goal may be accomplished is through \nstrong Federal support. It is the only way.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues and doing everything \npossible to provide transplant patients with the best possible options \nby ensuring a strong future for bone marrow and cord blood \ntransplantation in this country.\n  Mr. President, this is a good bill. I hope my colleague from Iowa \nwill think this over because this puts us down the road of being able \nto get on top of some of the most innovative and important and \nremarkable health care processes this country and any country has ever \nseen.\n  If we do not pass this bill in this timeframe and it gets mixed up in \nthe whole panoply of embryonic stem cell research, it could take at \nleast another year, maybe 2 years, before we get even cord blood \nlegislation passed by Congress. Why should patients have to wait \nanother year or 2 for such a life-saving bill to pass the Congress?\n  There are many illnesses where cord blood transplantation and \nresearch have already made the difference in people's lives.\n  I think I have made my point, and I urge my colleagues to pass this \nbill as quickly as possible.\n  It is apparent we are not going to be able to do the cord blood \nresearch because of objection, but I hope that my colleague will \nreconsider and allow this to happen before the week is out. I know my \ncolleague from Iowa is very sincere. He has been one of the leaders on \nstem cell research in this country, and he certainly has a right to do \nwhatever he wants, but I am thinking of the thousands, if not millions, \nof people who could benefit from this research if we get it going with \nFederal Government help at this time.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the USA \nPATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act. This bill gives our \nnational security and law enforcement communities, including the FBI, \nthe tools they need to fight the war against terrorism, while at the \nsame time adding new provisions to protect the civil liberties and \nprivacy that all Americans rightfully expect and cherish.\n  The first responsibility of our national government is to protect the \ncitizens of our country from foreign threats.\n  My fellow citizens of Utah and all of my fellow Americans expect that \nthe Federal Government will help protect them against terrorist attacks \nbut to do so in a fashion that does not open the lives of ordinary, \nlaw-abiding Americans to unjustified government intrusion. The PATRIOT \nAct protects our citizens by helping to keep us physically safe and \nprotects our essential civil liberties.\n  The PATRIOT Act Conference report before us makes permanent 14 of the \n16 expiring PATRIOT Act provisions, all of which have proven extremely \nuseful over the last 4 years in preventing and prosecuting terrorism. \nSometimes lost in the often charged political debate over the PATRIOT \nAct is the fact that there is broad, in fact almost universal, \npolitical consensus that each and every one of the major elements of \nthe PATRIOT Act is essential to protecting the American public.\n  One hard and true measure of this reality is that there is wide \nagreement that 14 of the 16 expiring provisions in the PATRIOT Act \nought to be made permanent. That is what this bill does. Another \nmeasure is that no major component of the PATRIOT Act is being repealed \nnor, to my knowledge, is anyone making any serious effort to repeal any \nmajor component of the PATRIOT Act. There is a simple reason for this \nsimple fact. Overall, the PATRIOT Act is operating well and has not \nbeen abused. The PATRIOT Act is necessary to help protect the American \npublic from terrorists.\n  The bill before us renews, for a 4-year period, the remaining 2 of \nthe 16 expiring provisions of the PATRIOT Act that are not made \npermanent in this bill. Frankly, many of us think that these two \nprovisions, section 206--the roving wiretaps, and section 215--the \nbusiness records section, also ought to be made permanent. I know of no \nserious expert in counterterrorism or law enforcement who is calling \nfor the repeal of either of these two important provisions or who \nbelieves that they will not be renewed again in 4 years. The fact is \nthat the main reason that these two provisions have not been made \npermanent is not because they are fundamentally deficient. The reason \nis that there is an understandable concern shared by virtually everyone \nthat there ought to be vigilant congressional oversight in the area of \ncounterterrorism generally, and the PATRIOT Act specifically. Adopting \nthese two sunset provision merely ensures that Congress will do what it \nis doing already--conducting consistent\n\n[[Page S13641]]\n\nand careful oversight of the PATRIOT Act.\n  I welcome this scrutiny and debate. We need to stay on top of how \nthis important counterterrorism law is being implemented and enforced. \nWe need, as we have done in this bill, make any necessary refinements \nthat will improve the PATRIOT Act. I think the record is clear that \nCongress has not shirked its duty when it comes to conducting vigorous \noversight of the PATRIOT Act. I understand that this year alone \nCongress has held some 23 hearings on various elements of the PATRIOT \nAct and that Department of Justice officials have testified at 18 of \nthese hearings.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee has held literally dozens of hearings \non elements of the PATRIOT Act since it passed it 2001. During the \n108th Congress, when I chaired the Judiciary Committee, we held some 30 \nhearings that touched on aspects of the PATRIOT Act.\n  Under Senator Specter's capable leadership, the Judiciary Committee \nheld an additional series of more than a half dozen hearings this year \nthat focused on the PATRIOT Act and that does not even count \nconfirmation hearings for senior Department of Justice officials, such \nas the Attorney General, at which there have been a substantial number \nof questions related to the PATRIOT Act.\n  This House Judiciary Committee has held a similar comprehensive set \nof hearings on the PATRIOT Act.\n  We have heard from all the major critics of the PATRIOT Act. I think \nthat the bill before us today shows that we have listened to, and where \nappropriate, have responded to the legitimate concerns of the critics. \nFrankly, in a number of areas I think we have bent over backwards to \naddress concerns that were more hypothetical than real. To put a point \non it, as Attorney General Gonzales says in his Washington Post op-ed \npublished yesterday:\n\n       During this important debate, Republicans and Democrats \n     have discovered that concerns raised about the [PATRIOT's] \n     act's impact on civil liberties, while sincere, were \n     unfounded. There have been no verified civil liberties abuses \n     in the 4 years of the [PATRIOT] Act's existence.\n\n  That is a good record by any measure. As with any complex piece of \nlegislation, we should not be surprised that if one day some \nadministrative official, intentionally or otherwise, does abuse their \ndiscretion under the statute. Unfortunately, that is only human nature. \nBut just because someone applies the law in an abusive fashion, it does \nnot follow that the law needs to be repealed.\n  I think it is a testament to the professionalism to the men and women \nof the FBI--led by its able Director Bob Mueller--and other law \nenforcement agencies that, to date, there have been no documented cases \nof PATRIOT Act abuse. Let me just say that many critics of the act have \ntried their best to make the facts match their critiques but have \nfailed to marshal any definitive evidence.\n  We should all understand that the chief reason for the bill's \ninclusion of a 4-year sunset of two provisions acts chiefly as a belt \nand suspenders approach to help ensure that Congress will continue our \nextremely active oversight of the PATRIOT Act. In fact, the House bill \ncontained a 10-year sunset renewal period for the two provisions that \nwill not be made permanent.\n  While it would have been possible to compromise somewhere between the \n4-year Senate renewal time period and the 10-year House sunset period, \nthe conference report--which no Democrat signed--contained the lower \nSenate number of 4 years.\n  It always leaves you a little empty when you make a major compromise \nand your colleagues pushing for particular provisions still do not sign \nonto the compromise package. Whatever happened to compromise around \nhere? The PATRIOT Act reauthorization has been through several drafts \nas the conference process has taken place. I do not necessarily support \nevery change that we have made but I have always believed that \ncompromise is part of the process of legislation.\n  I think that a fair reading of the record reveals that in the grand \nscheme of things the issues that have generated the remaining \ndisagreement on the PATRIOT Act are relatively minor issues. No one is \ntalking about repealing any major part of the PATRIOT Act although some \nof the outside groups would have you believe that the PATRIOT Act is \nsomehow un-American and a threat to civil liberties.\n  Hogwash. I support the efforts of our law enforcement and \nintelligence officials in combating terrorism. They continue to fight \nterrorists who would wreak havoc and death on America. It seems to me, \nand many others, that we should at least give law enforcement the same \ntools to investigate and stop terrorists that we give to combat mail \nfraud or internet pornography and organized crime. Now that the shock \nand pain of 9/11 has begun to fade, I hope we do not go backwards in \nour efforts to prevent terrorism. We should not make it tougher for our \nlaw enforcement and intelligence officers to obtain and share \ninformation critical to investigate terrorists than we allow for common \ncriminals.\n  Let me specifically address four provisions of the PATRIOT Act that \nare often misunderstood at best, and sometimes outright misrepresented \nby many in this debate. First, section 206--this is the multipoint or \nroving wiretap provision. Section 206 is an essential provision \nthat addresses the terrorists' use of evolving technology by allowing \nlaw enforcement to obtain a wiretap order that covers the \ncommunications of a specific individual even when that person--whose \nname we may not know--changes telephones and locations to evade \ninterception. We live in a day of relatively cheap and disposable cell \nphones, a reality that terrorists make use of each day to avoid \ndetection.\n\n  The PATRIOT Act reauthorization bill requires a full description of a \nspecific target in both the application and the court order, even if \nthe target individual's actual identity is unknown. The act also \nrequires the specific facts be alleged and documented that show how the \ntarget's actions may thwart surveillance efforts. Additionally, the act \nrequires the FBI to notify the court within 10 days after beginning \nsurveillance of any new phone. This notice must include the facts and \ncircumstances that justify the FBI's belief that each new phone is \nbeing used, or is about to be used, by the target.\n  Second, section 213 of the PATRIOT Act covers delayed notice search \nwarrants. This may be the most misrepresented provision of the PATRIOT \nAct in recent years. Its critics sometimes refer to it pejoratively as \nthe sneak and peak provision. They suggest that it somehow gives the \nFBI carte blanche to rummage through each American home without ever \ntelling the target individual what is being searched and why. That is \nsimply not true.\n  Delayed notification search warrants always involve judicial review. \nIn fact, delayed notification search warrants are a creature of \njudicial creation and first appeared about 20 years ago when judges \nagreed that there were some occasions when the interests of justice \nmade it prudent not to tip-off suspected criminals that their premises \nwere about to be searched.\n  Former Deputy Attorney General Jim Comey, a distinguished career \nfederal prosecutor, explained at a PATRIOT Act field hearing held in \nSalt Lake City last year that he was personally involved in several \ninvestigations of suspected drug dealers in which judges agreed to \nallow the FBI to secretly search for drugs before effectuating arrest \nwarrants in order to be able to bring to justice the greatest number of \nthose involved in the drug ring.\n  In the same way that we have used the judicially created and \nsanctioned delayed notification search warrants to bring drug dealers \nto justice for over 20 years, I am certain that we want to continue to \nbring this same technique to bear against suspected terrorists so we \ncan stop or catch the most senior members of a terrorist cell and to \ngive us the best chance to understand who is involved, and what they \nare plotting to do against us.\n  Let me repeat again. Under this bill, delayed notification warrants \nalways require a judge to find that delayed notification is justified.\n  And what was the big flap over this greatly debated provision?\n  Not, as some would have it, whether this was an un-American trampling \nof rights. No, the debate among conferees\n\n[[Page S13642]]\n\nwas whether the initial period for the duration of this special type of \nsearch warrant would be 7 days, which was in the Senate bill, or 180 \ndays, which was in the House bill.\n  Stop the presses, the conference report contains a decidedly un-\nshocking, 30-day compromise time period. And more important than the \npresumptive 30-day period contained in the final bill is the fact that \na judge can effectively make the 30 days either shorter or longer \ndepending on the facts and circumstances of the application before the \ncourt.\n  The bill permits extensions of the delay period, but only upon an \nupdated showing of the need for further delay. Also, it limits any \nextensions to 90 days or less, unless the facts of the case justify a \nlonger delay. Moreover, the bill also adds new public reporting on the \nuse of delayed notice warrants.\n  Despite all of the exaggerated hoopla over the so-called sneak and \npeek provision, I am aware of no member of Congress that has taken the \nposition that delayed notification search warrants should be eliminated \nand I am certainly aware of no information that this provision has ever \nbeen abused in the relatively few times it has been exercised under the \nPATRIOT Act during the last 4 years.\n  If it is constitutional and effective to use delayed notification \nwarrants against drug dealers and child pornographers--which it is--I \nam all for using this tool against suspected terrorists--and that is \nwhat this bill continues to allow.\n  I doubt many Americans would be for a policy that would mandate that \nthe FBI to knock on the door and tell every suspected member of al-\nQaida that,\n\n       Hi, we are here from the FBI and we would like to see if \n     you are making a dirty bomb in your basement and please don't \n     tell your housemates and associates that we have been here \n     searching your home.\n\n  Delayed notification warrants are here to stay and will and should be \nused when circumstances justify as determined by a judge.\n  Third, section 215. Section 215 is often misleadingly called by its \ncritics as the library records provision. Given the great amount of \ndiscussion this provision has engendered, I would like to first note \nfor the record that before this authorization bill that the word \nlibrary was nowhere to be found in this provision.\n  I love libraries. I love books. I have nothing but the greatest \nrespect for librarians and patrons of libraries. Nobody in Congress \nwould ever sit by and allow the Federal Government to undertake fishing \nexpeditions to find out who is reading what in libraries.\n  At the same time, I do not think anyone wants libraries to become \nsafe havens for terrorist research and other terrorist activities such \nas electronic mail communications with computers paid for by American \ntaxpayers.\n  Under the new compromise bill, the law for the first time now does \nrefer to libraries--but only in the most bend over backward sense that \nit allows a very limited, select group of senior government officials, \nconsisting of the FBI Director, the Deputy FBI Director and the \nExecutive Assistant Director for National Security to authorize the FBI \nto seek a court order under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act \nfor relevant library, book sales, firearms sales, tax return, \neducational or medical records.\n  This authority may not be further delegated to anyone else in the \nFBI. Obviously, this was a compromise that was made in response to the \ngreat concerns that many voiced about library and other sensitive \npersonal records. I can live with this compromise but since there was \nnot one documented case of abuse of this provision under existing law, \nI just hope we have not unintentionally created a bottleneck in the \nsystem by requiring the personal involvement of the senior-most FBI \nofficials when local FBI agents might need to act as quick as possible.\n  There is a good argument to allow this authority to be delegated down \nfurther. I, for one, am uncertain why each of our 78 Senate-confirmed \nU.S. attorneys and each of the 56 career FBI Special Agents-in-Charge \nof local FBI Field Offices should not have this discretion. We entrust \nthem with broad responsibility to protect us from a wide range of \ncrimes each and every day and there seems no reason why we should not \ntrust them to recommend which applications for business records should \nbe brought before a judge.\n  I would remind my colleagues that one of the ways the Unibomber, Ted \nKaczynski, was caught was through a garden-variety search of library \nrecords. I am aware of no complaints that the Unibomber was apprehended \nand I hope that no one takes the position that illicit users of \nlibraries such as the Unibomber should be informed that, by the way, \nMr. Kaczynski, the FBI was in last week comparing your withdrawal \nrecords with the Unibomber's written Manifesto and we thought you would \nbe interested that they were asking about where you lived.\n  Section 215, the business records section allows the FBI to seek \ncourt orders--and let me repeat that--to seek court orders--to obtain \nbusiness records from third parties in intelligence and terrorism \ncases.\n  The revisions in the law requires applications for orders for \nbusiness records to include a statement of facts showing reasonable \ngrounds to believe that the things sought are relevant to an authorized \ninvestigation to protect against terrorism or espionage.\n  Prior to this change there was no explicit relevance standard. \nBecause of concerns that were raised, the relevance standard has now \nbeen codified. The administration supported this change. I support this \nchange. Some, including my friend from New Hampshire, Senator Sununu, \nclaim that the relevance standard contained in the bill is too broad.\n  Let us put this issue in perspective. The relevance standard has been \nused for years in the issuance of grand jury subpoenas. All across the \ncountry, dozens of these subpoenas are issued under the general \nrelevance standard each and every day. For example, grand jury \ninvestigations routinely are conducted in conjunction with records--\nbusiness records relevant to the case at hand.\n  As a matter of fact, in many criminal law contexts, including health \ncare fraud and sexual exploitation cases, federal investigators--\nwithout prior judicial review--can issue what are called administrative \nsubpoenas for relevant documents.\n  I believe that there are over 300 Federal statutes that contain the \ntype administrative subpoena authority that is not included in either \nthe current PATRIOT Act or in the reauthorization bill.\n  In some ways it is more difficult for the Federal Government to \ninvestigate suspected terrorists than it is to investigate Medicare \nfraud.\n  Leaving aside the wisdom of not allowing administrative subpoena \nauthority for terrorism investigations, I think it is fair to say that \nthe revision of section 215 that now contains an explicit relevance \ntest is strictly in the mainstream of American criminal law.\n  It is not a new concept to have to go before a judge and convince him \nor her that the Government needs certain relevant records, such as \nhotel or car rental bills, to investigate potential criminal activity.\n  If the judge does not think it is a bona fide investigation and is \njust a fishing expedition, the judge can deny the request.\n  The revised version of the PATRIOT Act section 215 requires the \nGovernment to certify that the business records sought are relevant to \nan authorized investigation to obtain information not concerning a U.S. \ncitizen or to protect against international terrorism or clandestine \nintelligence activities.\n  Further, the revision to section 215 creates a three-part test that \npresumes such information is relevant if it pertains to:\n  (1) a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power;\n  (2) the activities of a suspected agent of a foreign power under \ninvestigation; or\n  (3) an individual in contact with, or known to, a suspected agent of \na foreign power under investigation.\n  Some have argued that this three part test is not strong enough or \ncan be circumvented but the judges serving on the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court are neither potted plants nor is there any reason to \nbelieve that they will rubberstamp any application that is placed \nbefore them.\n  The new language includes additional procedural protections for \nsection 215 orders including:\n\n[[Page S13643]]\n\n  (1) The explicit right for recipients to consult legal counsel and to \nseek judicial review;\n  (2) The requirement that a senior FBI official approve requests for \ncertain sensitive documents, such as library records;\n  (3) The use of minimization procedures to limit the retention and \nprohibit the dissemination of information concerning U.S. persons;\n  (4) Audits by the DOJ inspector general; and\n  (5) Enhanced reporting to Congress and the public on section 215 \nactivities.\n  These are important protections, not all of which I believe are 100 \npercent necessary, but all of which I will support in the spirit of \ncompromise.\n  Judicial review and approval is still required for every application \nfor business records under section 215. All of these new provisions are \nintended to act to further safeguard against any potential abuse. Some \nduring this debate have claimed that the new, explicit relevance \nstandard on section 215 will allow the Government to sweep up the \nrecords of many innocent Americans.\n  We all share the concern about the Government getting too big for its \nbritches. None of us would want to be on the wrong end of a misguided \nFederal investigation in which some overzealous bureaucrat with \nseemingly unlimited resources acted in an arbitrary and unfair way that \ncould destroy our family's reputation and life savings. But that is not \nwhat the PATRIOT Act sanctions.\n  There is certainly no evidence that this is how the business records \nsection of the PATRIOT Act has acted during the last 4 years.\n  Americans are right to have a healthy skepticism of government. A \nlarge part of what our job as Senators in Washington is to watch over \nGovernment agencies like the FBI and IRS.\n  Nobody wants Big Brother looking at our neighbor's personal \nfinancial, medical or library records without a very good reason. And \nthat is exactly what the new protections that we have added to section \n215 are intended to do--help make sure that when the Government \ninvestigators want to examine business records, they have a very good \nreason for looking at the records.\n  Let me repeat once again, the very same type of relevance standard \nthat is being put into place in section 215 of the PATRIOT Act has long \nbeen the law of the land when grand juries routinely subpoena records \nin connection with many, many types of criminal investigations.\n  Again, these requests will not be in the hands of some rogue Federal \nagent--or an abusive grand jury--judges must decide on the issuance of \na business records order under section 215.\n  We added additional congressional and public reporting provisions to \nhelp us in our oversight function. Additional audits by DOJ's inspector \ngeneral will also act to check potential abuses.\n  Moreover, the Conference report requires the Justice Department to \npromulgate minimization procedures for every section 215 business \nrecord order that will direct the FBI not to retain or disseminate \ndocuments that are obtained incidentally.\n  The other day my friend, the junior Senator from New Hampshire, \nsuggested that section 215, as amended, will place an undue burden on \nthose entities required to produce records. I do not believe this and \nneither should you.\n  The conference report before us says that no section 215 order can be \nissued for material that would be beyond the scope of a grand jury \nsubpoena, and since a grand jury subpoena can be quashed if it is \nunreasonable or oppressive, any section 215 application can be set \naside or modified if it is unreasonable or oppressive.\n  In addition, the conference report expressly allows the recipient of \na section 215 order to challenge an order and permits the judge to set \naside any order found unlawful.\n  There are well-developed legal tests that can guide the courts to \ndecide when these requests are, and are not, relevant. As well, judges \nare well equipped to know when these requests are, and are not, \nreasonable and will rule accordingly.\n  Fourth, finally, let me address the issue of National Security \nLetters or NSLs. National Security Letters allow the FBI to obtain \ncertain third-party materials in intelligence cases. The bill before us \nadds further protections in this area. For example, the bill makes \nclear that recipients of such letter are free to disclose the receipt \nof this letter to their legal counsel.\n  I guess we can only hope that suspected terrorists do not share the \nsame attorney and a whole terrorist cell will not be tipped off.\n  The bill provides further clarification that these requests may be \nchallenged in court.\n  The bill makes clear that reviewing courts may modify or set aside \nthe request if compliance would be unreasonable, oppressive, or \notherwise unlawful.\n  The conference report language also permits judicial review of the \nnondisclosure requirement that attaches with NSLs.\n  The revised PATRIOT Act bill fosters congressional oversight by \nrequiring the DOJ inspector general to conduct audits of the FBI's use \nof National Security Letters.\n  As well, the conference report adds annual public reporting on NSLs. \nSome are suddenly now loudly complaining in the last few weeks that the \nstandard for obtaining an NSL--which is a showing of relevance--is too \nlow.\n  Where were the complaints about this standard before now?\n  National Security Letter and the standards and practices that apply \nto them predate the original PATRIOT Act which passed in the fall of \n2001 in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks.\n  The Senate bill--which was approved unanimously by the Judiciary \nCommittee and by the full Senate by unanimous consent--did not make any \nchanges in the standards for the issuance of National Security Letters. \nNor did the House bill.\n  What is going on here?\n  It sounds a little like a case of, even if it ain't broke, let's fix \nit.\n  Yet in the spirit of mutual respect and compromise, I am not opposed \ntrying to improve what is already working well, particularly if changes \nare important to many both inside and outside of the Congress. That is \nwhat has been done with respect to NSLs during the House-Senate \nConference process.\n  As has been referred to repeatedly in this debate, part of the \nconcern stems from a series of articles that appeared in The Washington \nPost that reports that some 30,000 of these letters have been issued in \nrecent years.\n  As Senator Specter and others have pointed out, the Department of \nJustice is prepared to give any member a classified briefing that sets \nthe record straight on this topic.\n  There is scant, if any, evidence that NSLs have been abused.\n  NSLs can only be used to obtain a very limited range of documents--\nmostly financial and communications records. They cannot, as some have \nalleged during this debate, be used to acquire medical records.\n  I said before and will repeat again that the conference document \nexpressly allows a recipient of a National Security Letter request to \nchallenge the request in court and have it set aside or modified if a \njudge determines it is unreasonable.\n  You would not know this from the way that some are describing this \nprovision during this debate.\n  In fact, the conference report vehicle is actually more protective of \ncivil liberties than the provision in the Senate bill, which was \napproved by unanimous consent earlier this year.\n  Specifically, the compromise language before us today requires a set \nof senior officials, including the Attorney General, Deputy Attorney \nGeneral, Assistant Attorney General, or FBI Director to certify that \ndisclosure will harm national security or diplomatic relations.\n  The Senate-passed bill gave that level of deference whenever any \nunspecified government officials made that certification. By confining \nthe authority to issue NSLs to the most senior officers in DOJ and the \nFBI, the conference report helps ensure that it will be used with \nappropriate discretion.\n  Some are criticizing the so-called gag order provisions of the NSL \nprocedures that forbid public disclosure of on-going national security \ninvestigations involving NSLs.\n  But do we really want to let our sworn terrorist enemies know \nprecisely\n\n[[Page S13644]]\n\nwhat communication and financial records that we are examining in our \nattempts to thwart future terrorist attacks?\n  I think not. Nor do I think the American public wants a system that \ninordinately tips our hand to our enemies.\n\n  At the end of the day, I think that the compromises made with respect \nto NSLs in this bill should be recognized as a good faith effort to \nstrengthen the rights of those who have legitimate challenges to the \nreasonableness of the governmental request for information.\n  In the spirit of compromise and in recognition that many citizens \nhave expressed concerns about this bill and are just now focusing on \nthe longstanding NSL procedures, I think it appropriate to make these \naccommodations so long as we do not unduly burden legitimate law \nenforcement needs and longstanding practices.\n  Let me summarize my position on the PATRIOT Act.\n  I support the Conference report revisions to the PATRIOT Act, \nalthough I do not favor each and every particular change.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote yes on cloture and yes on final passage.\n  I congratulate the House of Representatives for its leadership in \npassing this bill yesterday with a bipartisan vote.\n  I commend my friend, Chairman Jim Sensenbrenner, for his leadership \nof this conference committee.\n  I commend my friend, Senator Specter, for his leadership in working \novertime to achieve a broad bipartisan consensus on this bill.\n  I want also commend all of my fellow conferees, including all of \nthose Democratic conferees who did not sign the conference report.\n  These are important issues and I understand and respect that many in \nCongress and the American public comes to this debate from different \nperspectives. I do not question anyone's patriotism just because they \nare raising questions and concerns about this revised version of the \nPATRIOT Act. I might question their wisdom and judgment as pertaining \nto this particular bill but never the ism.\n  I hope that it comes time to vote that my colleagues will recognize \nthat this is a good, compromise bill.\n  I understand that not everyone will agree with every jot and tittle \nof this bill--I certainly do not.\n  On balance the PATRIOT Act has worked well and we have every reason \nto believe that these changes will make the PATRIOT Act work even \nbetter.\n  This bill is good for Americans and bad news for the terrorists.\n  That is the way it should be.\n  I strongly disagree with those who would filibuster the motion to \nproceed to this conference report.\n  Let this body have the same up and down vote that the House held on \nWednesday.\n  A three-month extension just shows the American public that this body \ncannot even do one of those rare and unusual must-do pieces of \nlegislation in a timely fashion.\n  As well, no doubt some political pundits will likely interpret a 3-\nmonth punt on the PATRIOT Act as a short-term political defeat for the \nadministration.\n  But this is a double edged sword: The American public will not be \npleased if, after they have had the time and opportunity to reflect on \nthe facts, they come to the conclusion that failure to accomplish a \ncomprehensive renewal and strengthening of the PATRIOT Act before the \nend of this year is interpreted by our enemies as somehow inviting or \neven enabling further terrorist attacks on U.S. soil.\n  The Senate should vote to send this bill to President Bush's desk.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter to the Senate and House of \nRepresentatives from the board of directors of the 9/11 Families for a \nSecure America be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               9/11 Families for a\n\n\n                                               Secure America,\n\n                              Staten Island, NY December 14. 2005.\n     To the United States Senate and House of Representatives:\n\n       The members of 9/11 Families for a Secure America ask you \n     to vote ``yes'' on the conference report to HR 3199, the \n     Reauthorization of the Patriot Act.\n       Our families understand that an important reason the 9/11 \n     mass murderers were able to ``succeed'' in their conspiracy \n     was the existence of ``the wall'' that blocked information \n     sharing between law enforcement and the intelligence \n     community. The Patriot Act removed that ``wall'' temporarily \n     and it is important to now remove it forever so that the next \n     9/11 killers are not aided by the laws of our own country.\n       The Conference Report addresses many of the objections \n     expressed by some Members to HR 3199 as passed by the House, \n     and is a most reasonable compromise. It is quite apparent \n     that the remaining objections, expressed by a few Members, \n     are based upon theoretical possibilities for abuse of civil \n     liberties. However, the four year history of the Patriot Act \n     has shown what the Washington Post calls ``little evidence of \n     abuse, and considerable evidence that the law has facilitated \n     needed cooperation.''\n       Thus, the objections of the opponents of HR 3199 are simply \n     illusions. In contrast, it is not an illusion that nineteen \n     foreign terrorists took advantage of our government's refusal \n     to give its law enforcement and intelligence officers the \n     logical and obvious tools needed to catch the conspirators \n     prior to September 11, 2001. The result was the murder of our \n     parents, spouses, children and friends. We are convinced that \n     the reality of 9/11 outweighs the minor, hypothetical \n     objections that have been raised.\n       Some Members may think the final version of HR 3199 not \n     quite perfect, but defeat of the Patriot Reauthorization \n     means freedom of operation for terrorists and more needless \n     deaths of innocent Americans. We think that concern for the \n     safety of this country demands that these Members compromise \n     and accept something that may be a little less than what they \n     view as perfection. Please vote ``yes'' on the conference \n     report to HR 3199.\n           Sincerely,\n       The Board of Directors, 9/11 Families for a Secure America:\n\n       Bruce DeCell, Sergeant, NYPD (retired), father in law of \n     Mark Petrocelli, age 29.\n       Bill Doyle, father of Joseph, age 24, WTC North Tower.\n       Lynn Faulkner, husband of Lynn, WTC South Tower.\n       Peter & Jan Gadiel, parents of James, age 23, WTC, North \n     Tower 103rd floor.\n       Grace Godshalk, mother of William R.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak briefly about the \nprogress on the war in Iraq and, importantly, the well-being and morale \nof our troops in the field.\n  Last week, the State of South Dakota lost two of its sons in Iraq, \nSSG Daniel Cuka, 27, from Yankton, SD, and SFC Richard Shield, 40, from \nTabor, SD. Both served in the 147th Field Artillery of the South Dakota \nNational Guard and were killed by improvised explosive devices while \nriding in their humvees.\n  They were assigned the mission of assisting in the training of Iraqi \npolice. Three other members of their battery were also wounded. South \nDakota is now in the process of grieving for and honoring these two \nbrave men who answered the call of duty.\n  One week after this tragic loss, an historic event occurred today in \nIraq that gives particular meaning and value to the lives and sacrifice \nof these two men. Today Iraq held a national election to fill \nparliamentary seats and it appears that there was a massive turnout of \nvoters from each of the major ethnic and religious groups, including \nfrom the Sunni population that only a few months ago rejected any \nparticipation in the political process.\n  This election is only the latest in a series of milestones giving \ntestimony to the great progress that has already been made in our \neffort to transform this country into a true democracy. Granted, it \nwill be a long road to the kind of democracy we have in this country. \nBut it was a long and bumpy road in our own journey. The fact that this \nIraqi election occurred at all, is amazing considering where the people \nof Iraq were 5 years ago, without freedom to determine their future and \nunder the heel of Saddam Hussein's tyranny.\n\n[[Page S13645]]\n\n  Despite the naysayers in this country, optimism among Iraqis is \nbecoming infectious. Of course, optimism and support for what we are \ndoing has always been prevalent among our troops. Thanks to them and \nthe sacrifices they are making, we are on the cusp of delivering \nsomething very special into the hands of the Iraqi people--the ability \nto shape and control their own lives, lives free from the tyranny of \ndictators, free from radical Islamic intimidation, and free from \nhopelessness.\n  Let us dispell the fiction that America is not making progress in \nIraq, right here and right now. Under United States training and \nguidance, 97 Iraqi battalions are now conducting security operations \nthroughout Iraq. In July of last year, there were only 5 Iraqi \nbattalions equipped and trained to fight.\n  Currently, 33 battalions have assumed their own areas of operation. \nLast year at this time, the Iraqi security forces did not have control \nover any areas of operation. Iraqi border police are now manning 170 \nborder compounds and 22 ports of entry. Over 75,000 Iraqi policemen are \npatrolling Iraqi cities. In the last election in January, 130,000 Iraqi \nsecurity forces successfully protected polling sites all over the \ncountry and inspired a wave of pride throughout the country and a sharp \nincrease in recruitment. We anticipate that in the election that \noccurred today, over 225,000 Iraqi security forces provided security to \nthe polling places.\n  In the January election almost a year ago, 8.5 million Iraqis turned \nout to vote, defying terrorists threats. In the October referendum, 10 \nmillion voters turned out. We expect significantly greater numbers in \nthis election, including from the Sunni population whose Mullahs are \nnow encouraging their people to get out and vote after opposing their \nparticipation in previous elections. Progress is clearly being made. To \nsay otherwise is simply inaccurate and demoralizing to our troops in \nIraq who are risking their lives to achieve these great milestones.\n  I would like to read a portion of an email sent to me by the mother \nof a South Dakota soldier stationed in Iraq.\n\n       Dear John, I am a commissioner in Corson County, McIntosh, \n     SD. I also, happen to be a mother of 2 children in the Army. \n     My son is now in Iraq, stationed at Ar Ramadi--not a very \n     nice place right now! The purpose of this email is to ask you \n     to pass on to Congress the fact that all their back stabbing \n     and finger pointing is very devastating to the families of \n     the sons and daughters now in Iraq. If they think they are \n     representing the families by doing what they are doing on the \n     Hill and in the press they are sadly mistaken. I don't want \n     my son to be where he is, but anyone with any kind of sense \n     knows that we cannot just pick up and desert the Iraqi's at \n     this point. . . .  Please, Please get this message out that \n     this is not what the parents, husbands, wives, and families \n     need to hear from our leaders. We have enough worry every \n     waking moment knowing our kids are in harms way. We don't \n     need the politicians using our loved ones in order for them \n     to further their political future.\n\n  The two fallen soldiers who are being honored today at a memorial \nservice in South Dakota gave their lives for a cause greater than \nthemselves. Those family members they left behind deserve to know their \nsacrifices were not in vain.\n  We will win this war and Iraq will be a free independent democracy. \nWhen our work is finished, Iraq will provide a vision and a clear path \nfor other countries in the Middle East to follow toward freedom and \ndemocracy. As Americans, we cannot leave the Iraqi people with anything \nless.\n  I ask unamious consent that a written statement honoring and paying \ntribute to Sergeants Cuka and Schild, two American heroes, be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Mr. President, South Dakota has paid a heavy price in the \n     effort to make Iraq a functioning democracy and the world a \n     safer place. To date, fifteen South Dakota soldiers have made \n     the ultimate sacrifice in Afghanistan and Iraq, nine of whom \n     died from hostile fire. About 85 percent of South Dakota's \n     National Guard members have been mobilized. Earlier this \n     month, two brave soldiers from my state paid the ultimate \n     price, and three more were wounded. I rise today to give \n     voice to the tremendous sympathy all South Dakota citizens \n     have for the families and friends of each of the courageous \n     soldiers our state has lost and this month, specifically, \n     Army Sgt. 1st Class Richard Schild and Army Staff Sgt. Daniel \n     M. Cuka. On December 4th these two soldiers of the South \n     Dakota National Guard were killed by roadside bombs in Iraq \n     as they went about the dangerous and critically important \n     mission of training the Iraqi Police Force in one of \n     Baghdad's police districts. They have made the ultimate \n     sacrifice in service to our nation, and we as a nation will \n     be forever in their debt.\n       The soldiers of Battery C of the 147th Field Artillery unit \n     arrived in Baghdad only very recently, and have already been \n     exposed to the horror of war, and the deaths of some of their \n     friends. South Dakota has a very small population, Mr. \n     President, and word of the deaths of our citizen soldiers \n     fighting the war on terror has hit us very hard. I am proud \n     of our state's outpouring of support during this time of \n     great personal tragedy for the loved ones Sgt. Schild and \n     Sgt. Cuka have left behind. I know the communities of Yankton \n     and Tabor will miss them very much.\n       The lives of these two soldiers are emblematic of the many \n     citizen soldiers currently serving in Iraq. Sgt. Cuka \n     graduated from Yankton High School in 1996 and married his \n     wife Melissa in 2000. They had two young children, Abby, who \n     is 5 years old, and Alex, who is 2. Sgt. Cuka led an active \n     life, and dedicated his life to serving and protecting the \n     public. Apart from serving nearly ten years in the National \n     Guard, he served with Yankton Area Search and Rescue, and his \n     unit has retired his call number, the highest honor it can \n     bestow. He worked for Wilson Trailers in Yankton, and still \n     found time to attend classes at Mount Marty College.\n       Sgt. Schild was the office manager of Bon Homme Yankton \n     Electric Cooperative. He and his wife Kay also have two young \n     children. He was serving in Iraq along with his brother, \n     Brooks. After graduating from Mount Marty College, he joined \n     the National Guard. It is clear that Sgt. Schild was highly \n     dedicated to doing his duty, and had a strong sense of \n     community. Even though events in the Middle East made it seem \n     likely he would be called to active duty, Sgt. Schild still \n     re-enlisted. Even while he was in Iraq, Sgt. Schild was still \n     concerned about his community being without power due to a \n     severe winter storm late last month. In fact, the National \n     Guard helped to mitigate the effects of that storm. It is \n     humbling to be able to represent a community that has people \n     like Sgt. Schild and Sgt. Cuka.\n       The human toll during wartime always gives us pause to \n     reflect on what we are fighting for in the war on terror. \n     Throughout America's history, we have faced determined \n     enemies on the battlefield, and we have been victorious. In \n     this war, we face a determined enemy that lurks in the \n     shadows, far from anything that can be characterized as a \n     battlefield. Sgt. Schild and Sgt. Cuka fell to an enemy \n     that could not face them on the battlefield.\n       The challenges faced by our soldiers in Iraq are far more \n     complicated and delicate than the challenges of a traditional \n     battlefield. While our soldiers make every possible effort to \n     avoid civilian casualties, they face an enemy that hides \n     among civilians, and an enemy that rejoices in maximizing \n     civilian casualties. Sgt. Schild and Sgt. Cuka died while \n     helping the vast majority of peaceful Iraqi citizens develop \n     the means to protect themselves, build a democracy, and \n     enforce the law. They were part of an effort to make the \n     world a safer and freer place for us and for future \n     generations of Americans.\n       When I think on the deaths of Sgt. Schild and Sgt. Cuka, \n     and indeed all of the deaths of our soldiers in the war on \n     terror, I am reminded of a passage of Scripture that says \n     ``Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his \n     life for his friends.'' To the families of Sgt. Schild and \n     Sgt. Cuka, please know that all South Dakotans have lifted \n     you up in our hearts, and that you are in our thoughts and \n     prayers. If there is anything we can do for you, we will do \n     it. I hope it may provide some small measure of comfort to \n     you to know that Sgt. Schild and Sgt. Cuka have laid down \n     their lives for their friends, and we are forever grateful.\n\n  Mr. THUNE. What they gave to the State of South Dakota, to this great \ncountry and to the people of Iraq should never be forgotten.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today marks a proud and momentous day in \nIraq's history. Today, on December 15,\n\n[[Page S13646]]\n\n2005, 15 million registered voters will go to the polls to choose their \nfirst permanently elected government in modern Iraqi history. Along \nwith them, Iraqis from all around the world will cast their votes for \nfreedom, for Iraq's future--including Iraqi Kurds in my home town of \nNashville, Tennessee.\n  As it so happens, Nashville is home to the largest Kurdish population \nin the United States of approximately 8,000 Iraqi expats. This past \nJanuary, over 3,000 of our Kurdish neighbors voted in the historic \nJanuary 30 elections which put Iraq on the road to independent, \ndemocratic self-rule. Tennessee election organizers predict that the \nturnout for today's vote will be double that number.\n  Iraqis from all around the region are converging on Nashville to cast \ntheir votes in solidarity with their brothers and sisters of their \nnative land.\n  Susan Dakak, whose family moved from Baghdad to Tennessee 27 years \nago, tells the Chattanooga Times Free Press, ``This is a dream come \ntrue. I never thought in my life that Iraq would get to where it is \npolitically.''\n  Susan and her husband, Janan, plan to travel from Knoxville to \nNashville, and they plan to bring their 9-year-old son with them to \nwitness the personal and historic moment of casting their ballots as \nfree citizens. And as Susan understands, her vote is not just for her \nbirth country, but for her adopted country, as well.\n  Susan and Janan's votes, along with the millions of Iraqis voting \ntoday, are critical to helping defeat the terrorists and vanquishing \ntheir violent aspirations.\n  As Susan explains:\n\n       This will be the beginning of the end of all of the \n     violence. The new Iraqi government will know that it will be \n     their responsibility to clear the terrorists out of the \n     country.\n\n  In the short run, today's broad participation will further isolate \nthe terrorists and constructively engage Iraqis across ethnic and \nsectarian lines. And in the long run, a peaceful, united, stable and \nsecure democracy in the heart of the Middle East will expose the \nbrittle and intolerable tyranny of the terrorist enemy. And it is \nprecisely this outcome that our terrorist enemies fear.\n  Early in the conflict, a letter from Al Zarqawi was intercepted by \ncoalition forces. In it, he wrote that a free and prosperous Iraq would \nreject his vision of a medieval, fundamentalist state. He recognized \nthat if Iraqis became accustomed to self-determination and self-rule, \nthey would refuse to submit to a tyrant and they would reject his \nextreme interpretation of Islam.\n  Furthermore, Iraq would become a model for the entire Middle East \nregion, driving out extremism and heralding in moderation and peace. Al \nZarqawi understands the power of freedom. That is why he is bent on its \ndestruction. But as this remarkable year of steady progress has proven, \nhe cannot and will not succeed. The desire of freedom is too strong and \nits logic is too irreducible.\n  Democracy is on the march and today 15 million Iraqis are heading to \nthe polls. Once again, they are showing the world their extraordinary \ncourage and determination to join the modern, free world.\n  America pledges to stand with the Iraqi people in that worthy effort \nas they strive to secure the blessings of liberty.\n  As Tahir Hussain, president of the Nashville Kurdish Forum, told a \nTennessee paper on this week:\n\n       We say that everybody should have a voice in Iraq, and \n     everybody should be equal. And today is the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/15/senate-section/article/S13646-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13646-S13647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       SENATOR EUGENE McCARTHY: A GREAT AMERICAN HAS PASSED AWAY\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in my book, ``Child of the Appalachian Coal \nFields,'' I discussed the Senate class of 1958. That class, which \nincluded 15 Democrats and 3 Republicans, constituted the largest \nturnover over in Senate history, and from that class of Senators came a \nnumber of Senate leaders and Presidential candidates. Most important, I \npointed out, while elected during the Eisenhower administration, the \nclass of 1958 ``tackled some of the greatest foreign and domestic \nproblems ever to face the Nation, and they played critical roles in \nenacting the Great Society programs and ending the war in Vietnam.''\n  One of the most remarkable members of that remarkable class was \nSenator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota, who passed away this weekend. He \nplayed critical roles both in enacting the Great Society programs and \nending the war in Vietnam.\n  It was my privilege and my pleasure to serve with Eugene McCarthy in \nthe U.S. House of Representatives and here in the Senate as members of \nthe class of 1958.\n  While serving together, I came to appreciate that Senator McCarthy \nwas a truly gifted and talented person with an extraordinary \nbackground. He was, without question, one of the more unusual Members \nto sit in this chamber. He was a poet, professor, philosopher, and \nauthor, and had been a military intelligence official during World War \nII and a semiprofessional baseball player.\n  In the Senate, as throughout his life, Senator McCarthy did not \nhesitate to go his own way. He did not hesitate to stomp out of a \nSenate hearing, and he was willing to espouse unpopular views. But he \nalways did so with an open heart, an open mind, and deep sincerity and \ndedication. Therefore, even when I disagreed with him, which was quite \noften in those early years, my respect for him continued to increase.\n  And I developed a deep appreciation for his abilities, his wit, his \nwarm personality, and his strong determination to make ours a better \ncountry. One of his first assignments in the Senate was chairing the \nSelect Committee on Unemployment, which helped focus national attention \non the problems of joblessness and poverty throughout the country. By \nholding hearings in Beckley, Welch, Fayetteville, and Wheeling, WV, as \nwell as other economically distressed regions of the country, the \nSelect Committee helped undermine the false claims of the so-called \nRepublican prosperity of the 1950s, and, as a result, helped provide \nthe ground work for the Great Society legislation that came a few years \nlater.\n  As I said earlier, it was members of the class of 1958 who also \nhelped to end the war in Vietnam. Although all of us had voted for the \nTonkin Gulf Resolution, many of us came to regret it. Senator McCarthy, \nto his great credit, was one of the first to speak out against the war. \nHe did so by announcing his break with the Johnson administration, and \nrunning against the President for the Democratic presidential \nnomination. ``The Administration,'' he said, ``seems to have set no \nlimit to the price which it is willing to pay for a military victory.''\n  No one expected much from McCarthy's challenge. He was a little-known \nSenator taking on President Johnson, who at the time, seemed all \npowerful.\n  But, as most of us know, in the 1968 New Hampshire Democratic \nprimary, Senator McCarthy stunned the Nation and shocked the political \nworld. His near victory helped to drive President Johnson out of the \nPresidential race. That contest showed how unpopular the war was. It \nfocused attention on, despite the administration's claims to the \ncontrary, just how disastrous its policies were in Southeast Asia. It \nbrought home to the American people an issue that was dividing the \ncountry and costing billions of dollars and thousands of American \nlives. Furthermore, Senator McCarthy's campaign helped embolden a \ngeneration of young Democratic Party activists.\n  When Senator McCarthy announced that he would be leaving the Senate \nin 1970, I was one Senator who approached him and tried to change his \nmind. When I was unsuccessful, I came to the Senate Floor to pay \ntribute to him. Senator McCarthy, I said, ``has made his mark upon our \nparty, he has made his mark upon our country, and he has made an \nindelible mark upon the hearts of all in the Senate who are privileged \nto call him friend.'' I said, ``he proves the truth of that verse of \nScripture that states, `He that hath friends must show himself \nfriendly.' ''\n  I have never wavered in those opinions that I expressed 35 years ago. \nIn fact, our friendship became stronger, as did my admiration of him.\n  Mr. President, our country has lost a good and talented man, and a \ngreat American. I will miss my friend. Our country needs more men like \nhim.\n\n     God give us men!\n     A time like this demands strong minds,\n     great hearts, true faith, and ready hands.\n\n[[Page S13647]]\n\n     Men whom the lust of office does not kill;\n     Men whom the spoils of office cannot buy;\n     Men who possess opinions and a will;\n     Men who have honor; men who will not lie.\n\n     Men who can stand before a demagogue\n     And brave his treacherous flatteries without winking.\n\n     Tall men, sun-crowned;\n     Who live above the fog,\n     In public duty and in private thinking.\n     For while the rabble with its thumbworn creeds,\n     It's large professions and its little deeds,\n     mingles in selfish strife,\n     Lo!

Mr. President, before we adjourn, the Congress will be \nasked to vote on an across-the-board cut for every agency and program \nin the Federal Government. The Congressional majorities have put this \nNation on an irresponsible fiscal path, one that promises years of \nrecord-breaking red ink, inflationary pressures, and multiplying \nFederal debts. Instead of making tough choices on spending priorities, \nor perhaps limiting the massive tax breaks going to Nation's richest \ncitizens, or finding ways to lessen the burden of the war in Iraq on \nthe American citizens, the Republican Congressional leadership is \nexpected to take the expedient route of an across-the-board funding \ncut.\n  This may not seem like a big deal. What's 1 or 2 percent? But to the \nfamilies across this country, that 1 or 2 percent can mean a world of \ndifference, especially when it is coupled with the freeze in services \nthat has already been applied to Federal initiatives.\n  Take, for an example, community health centers which provide basic \nhealth care for some of our most isolated citizens. This arbitrary \nRepublican plan would mean that 55 clinics would be shuttered, and \n73,000 Americans would see their health care held hostage by budget \ngames. A 2 percent cut in the Food and Drug Administration budget would \nforce unacceptable delays in the amount of time that it takes to \napprove new lifesaving drug and medical devices.\n  At a time when the Congress is considering tax cuts for the wealthy, \nafter a 2 percent cut, food packages for 65,922 elderly participants \nwould vanish. A 2 percent cut in the WIC program would reduce the \nnumber of meals for 175,234 economically struggling women, infants, and \nchildren. More than 35,000 families would lose access to safe and \naffordable housing. Under this Congressional leadership, the rich get \nricher, while tens of thousands of poor and the elderly have to \nstruggle for food and shelter.\n  The House has passed four tax cut bills, totaling $95 billion, and \nthe Senate has passed tax cuts which add up to $58 billion. The vast \nmajority of these tax cuts are aimed at improving the economic \nportfolios of the wealthiest Americans at the expense of those \nAmericans who are barely scraping by. At the same time that this \nCongress is pushing forward with unwise tax cuts, these across-the-\nboard cuts would weaken further the Nation's crumbling infrastructure \nand rob the economy of new jobs. In fact, a $720 million cut in highway \nconstruction, as put forward under the Republican blueprint, would \nslash more than 34,200 construction jobs from our economy. How many \nheadlines about companies cutting payrolls by the tens of thousands \nwill it take before this Congress stands up and puts the American \npeople first? American families deserve to know that the safety net is \nnot filled with holes. But instead of offering assurances, this \nRepublican plan only serves to jeopardize the future of many Americans.\n  Children in school districts with a high median income would also \nsuffer. These school districts, which receive title I funding, would \nhave to scramble to fill a $257 million reduction. That kind of cut \nwould hamstring the education of more than 200,000 students around the \ncountry. At the same time, special education funding would drop by $214 \nmillion, and the number of children in Head Start would be cut by \n19,000. Cutting the funds for classroom education may achieve short-\nterm fiscal goals for the Republican majority, but it creates long-term \nproblems for the Nation's future.\n  Don't care about the classrooms? Think that school districts can \nabsorb this cut with higher property taxes? Then what about our \nveterans? Each day, new veterans come home from the wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. They join our proud men and women who have served in World \nWar One and World War Two, in Korea, in Vietnam, in the first Gulf War, \nand in so many places around the world. These men and women have made \nus proud. Many of these 21st century veterans have specialized health \ncare needs. The battlefields of today are inflicting wounds unlike \nthose experienced by the soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines of past \nwars. Veterans' health care is a responsibility that we must never \nshirk.\n  But what do these veterans get in return for their service? More \nbudget cuts from this Congressional majority. The GOP plan means cuts \nin treatment for approximately 236,000 patients. It means that 1.4 \nmillion outpatient visits would disappear. Waiting lists would likely \nrise by about 176,000 veterans. In addition, the VA will not be able to \nexpand specialty and mental health services at existing sites as \nplanned.\n  But the short-sighted effects of this Republican cut to America's \nworking families, classrooms, and veterans are only one aspect of \nbackwards priorities of this Republican funding plan. Just this week, \nthe President reiterated his effort to protect the American people from \nfuture terrorist attacks. But how much safer will the American people \nbe if the Republican blueprint for budget cuts is signed into law? How \nmuch safer will the Nation be with 800 fewer FBI agents?\n  Similar cuts would face the Drug Enforcement Agency. Under this \nRepublican scheme, the DEA would be forced to cut its planned force by \n200 agents. The President and his team have stated that drug profits \ncontribute to terrorism. Does anyone think that it is a good idea to \ncut more than 200 agents from the DEA?\n  Border Security would be cut by $96.5 million. As a result, 200 of \nthe promised new border agents would go unhired. Detention and removal \nefforts for illegal aliens would be sliced by $20 million. All of us \nknow that the U.S.-Mexico border already is terribly porous. But, \ninstead of investing in new agents and tightening security on our \nborders, this Republican effort would undermine our effort to secure \nour borders.\n  What about our airport security? That is not immune from these \nRepublican budget games. The Transportation Security Administration, \nwhich is responsible for the screening of passengers at our airports, \nwould also be targeted for stiff reductions. As a result of this \nmisguided GOP blueprint, more than 1,000 TSA screeners would lose their \njobs. This is on top of the 2,000 person reduction in screeners already \napproved by this Congress. At the same time, funding for explosive \ndetection equipment for baggage and passengers would be decreased by \n$12 million. And safety in the skies would be placed at risk.\n  We all watched the Coast Guard perform marvelously after Hurricane \nKatrina devastated Mississippi and Louisiana. But rather than \nreinforcing the Coast Guard's ability in future disasters, the 2 \npercent rollback would reduce cutter patrol hours by at least 10,000 \nhours and aircraft hours by at least 2,000 hours. And military \nrecruiting would be reduced by 60 percent--or 1,158 Coast Guard \npersonnel.\n  I urge my colleagues to think again about this fiscal foolishness. \nThink about what it means for our children and for the safety of our \nfamilies. Think about what it means for our veterans and for our \nsecurity.\n  The American people elect Members of Congress to lead, to make tough \nchoices, and to place the best interests of the Nation at the forefront \nof our work. This across-the-board cut is not leadership, and it is not \nin the best interests of the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/15/senate-section/article/S13647-2", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13647-S13649]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as chair of the Senate Committee on Small\n\n[[Page S13648]]\n\nBusiness and Entrepreneurship, I rise in support of amendment No. 2529 \nwhich was unanimously adopted into S. 1042, the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for fiscal year 2006. This amendment will restore \nmuch needed transparency in the small business contract goaling program \nadministered by the Small Business Administration, promote \ninternational competitiveness of our Nation's small businesses, and \nensure fair access of small businesses to Federal prime contracts and \nsubcontracts for performance overseas.\n  Currently, many small contractors play a critical role in maintaining \na strong domestic defense industrial base and supporting the Global War \non Terror. Yet many of these small firms face serious obstacles \nobtaining prime contracts and subcontracts to perform internationally \nthe work they are already performing so ably domestically. Simply put, \nthis amendment would clarify that the Small Business Act applies to \nFederal overseas contracts.\n  In the 2001 report, ``Small Business: More Transparency Needed in \nPrime Contract Goaling Progam,'' the Government Accountability Office \ncriticized the Small Business Administration, SBA, the Department of \nDefense, DOD, and other agencies for excluding contracts from the \ncalculations of small business contracting achievements toward the \nstatutory goals established in the Small Business Act based on tenuous \nrationales. On its face, the Small Business Act applies to all Federal \nprocurements, including all overseas contracts. However, recently there \nhas been some resistance to implementing the Small Business Act as \nwritten. Some agencies, like the Department of Defense, go as far as to \nexempt all overseas-related contracts from the act. Others, such as the \nDepartment of State, exempt contracts for performance abroad if they \nare also awarded abroad but not if they awarded domestically. As a \nresult, prime contracting and subcontracting requirements of the Small \nBusiness Act are rendered unenforceable with regard to many military \nand reconstruction projects, and fair access for small businesses is \nseriously diminished.\n  Based on fiscal year 2000 dollars, the GAO found that approximately \n$8.4 billion in overseas defense contracts were excluded from counting \ntoward the Federal Government's small business performance. Under the \nSmall Business Act, $1.93 billion of these contracts should have been \nawarded to small businesses. The SBA's and the DOD's rationale for \nexcluding overseas contracts was that small firms have little chance of \ncompeting for these contracts in the first place.\n  The excuse given by the SBA and other agencies to the GAO in 2001 did \nnot hold then, and it surely does not hold now. With an expanded \nFederal presence in recent years, the dollar volume of overseas \ncontracts has been steadily increasing, and small firms have been \nplaying a substantial part in supporting Federal operations abroad. \nIndeed, every major contract for the reconstruction for the \nreconstruction of Iraq funded by the $18.4 billion in 2003 emergency \nsupplemental appropriations has a minimum 10 percent requirement for \nsmall business subcontracting and a 23-percent subcontracting goal. Our \nexperience with Iraq reconstruction proves that American small \nbusinesses are capable to perform overseas even in the most dire \ncircumstances.\n  Congress clearly meant what it said in the Small Business Act that \nprocurement goals must be calculated against ``total purchases'' of the \nFederal Government. My amendment reaffirms congressional policy that \nthe Small Business Act applies to all contracts and subcontracts \nregardless of geographic place of award or performance. This amendment \ndirects Federal agency heads with jurisdiction over acquisitions to \nensure that all contracts and subcontracts, regardless of geography, \nare covered by the Small Business Act. Under my amendment, agencies \nwill be able to give due note and recognition to the specific \nrequirements and procedures of any other Federal statute or treaty, \nsuch as the provisions governing foreign military sales, which may \nexempt any Federal prime contract or subcontract from the application \nof the Small Business Act in whole or in part.\n  I urge my colleagues to help keep America's defense industrial base \nand America's global competitiveness strong by supporting fair access \nto prime contracts and subcontracts by our small businesses.\n  Mr. President, as chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I rise today in support of my amendment No. 2530 to \nS. 1042, the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2006, \nto promote fair access to multiple-award contracts. I am pleased that \nthis amendment was adopted unanimously, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it in conference. Since the enactment of the Federal \nAcquisition Streamlining Act, FASA, in 1994, Federal agencies are \nincreasingly relying on contracts and acquisition services offered by \nother agencies, specifically, the General Services Administration's \nMultiple Award Schedule/Federal Supply Schedule contracts, MAS/FSS, \nGovernment-wide acquisition contracts, GWACs, and multiagency \ncontracts, MACs, to purchase goods and services. These contracting \nmechanisms were authorized by Congress in the belief that they would \nencourage the Government to buy commercially available products and \nservices and would open the Federal contracting market to businesses, \nespecially small businesses, which have previously focused only on the \nprivate, commercial markets. Essentially, these indefinite-delivery, \nindefinite-quantity contracts are framework agreements on prices and \nother terms for any future sales to the Government. In the procurement \ncommunity, these contracts are popularly known as ``hunting licenses'' \nbecause they permit preapproved contract holders to secure Government \nwork with very limited competition as a result of direct marketing to \nFederal agencies. Federal contracting officials can place task orders \nagainst these contracts with their preferred, preapproved vendors. This \namendment is a modest response to numerous complaints from \nrepresentatives of small businesses and small business trade \nassociations that the actual process for receiving task orders under \nmultiple award contracts, such as the Federal Supply Schedules and \nmultiagency contracts, tends to be biased in favor of large businesses \nand experienced Government contractors.\n  Small business representatives testified before my committee that \nthey invest time, effort, and resources to negotiate multiple award and \nmultiagency contracts with the GSA or with another executive agent \nmanaging a Government-wide acquisition contract or a multiagency \ncontract. Consultants have been known to charge small firms as much as \n$25,000 for guiding them through dense, time-consuming paperwork \nrequired to receive Government preapproval for one such contract. \nHowever, there are serious concerns that small firms do not reap \ncommensurate benefits in the form of task orders. For instance, in \nrecent proceedings before the White House Acquisition Advisory Panel, a \nrepresentative of the General Services Administration, GSA, indicated \nthat total Multiple Award Schedule/Federal Supply Schedule sales \nreached $31.1 billion in fiscal year 2004. GSA further indicated that \nsmall businesses hold 79.6 percent of total MAS/FSS contracts, but \naccount only for 37.1 percent of sales dollars. At first glance, this \nlevel of small business participation is commendable. It exceeds the \nstatutory Government-wide goal of awarding 23 percent of Federal \ncontract dollars to small businesses. However, the significant \ndisparity between these numbers confirms the complaints of small \nbusinesses about the barriers they have been facing in Federal \nindefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contracts. I look forward to \nworking with the GSA, the Small Business Administration, and other \nagencies towards a greater parity between small business participation \nin the Schedule program itself and their share of contract dollars \nawarded through this program.\n  In the acquisition world, there is a perception that contracting \nofficers routinely persist in limiting upcoming task order \nopportunities to a maximum of three companies on any particular GSA \nSchedule instead of the three-company minimum as required by law. This \nsituation is a recurring subject of bid protest decisions. In addition, \nmany multiple-award contract holders do not receive a fair notice of \nupcoming task orders.\n  Earlier this year, an article in the Veterans Business Journal asked\n\n[[Page S13649]]\n\n``What Happened to Public Law 108-183?'' This law, codified in the \nSmall Business Act, created the contracting preference for small \nbusinesses owned by service-disabled veterans. The article pointed out \nthat many service-disabled veterans feel frustrated at the multiple-\naward contract regulations which undermine the weight of the \ncongressionally established preference and preclude disabled veterans \nfrom obtaining set-aside multiple-award acquisitions.\n  The Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship has \nattempted to mitigate many of these problems. Back in 1994, the Federal \nAcquisition Streamlining Act included a change to the Small Business \nAct that created an exclusive reservation for small businesses \nconsisting of all contracts valued at more than $2,500 but not more \nthan $100,000. Federal agencies attempted to exempt themselves from \nthis provision by regulation. In response, I inserted corrective \nlanguage in S. 1375, the 50th Anniversary Small Business Administration \nReauthorization Act. This act, passed unanimously by the Senate during \nthe 108th Congress, included a provision to ensure that task orders on \nmultiple award schedules and multiagency contracts valued at more than \n$2,500 but not more than $100,000 are reserved for small businesses.\n  This amendment builds on my prior efforts by establishing a \ncongressional policy that each agency's orders placed under multiple \nawards contracts must meet statutory small business goals. To \nfacilitate this policy, the amendment authorizes Federal agencies using \ndefense contracting authorities to conduct small business set-aside \ncompetitions in the context of multiple-award contracts. My amendment \nalso directs the SBA administrator to provide to my committee a \ncomprehensive report on participation of small businesses in multiple-\naward contracting.\n  The measures adopted by the Senate through this amendment are only \nsome of many steps and initiatives which my committee has been pursuing \nto increase the access of multiple-award contracts to small businesses. \nI hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting these efforts.\n  Mr. President; as chair of Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I rise today to address a bipartisan amendment to S. \n1042, the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2006 from \nthe Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship concerning \nmuch needed improvements to the Small Business Innovation Research, \nSBIR, Program and the Small Business Technology Transfer, STTR, \nProgram. Amendment No. 2531 is based on my original amendments S.A. \n1536 and S.A. 1537 and builds on language reported by the Senate Armed \nServices Committee and on legislative initiatives proposed by the Small \nBusiness Committee's ranking member, Senator Kerry. I would like to \ncommend Senator Kerry, as well as Senators Warner and Levin, the \nleaders of the Senate Armed Services Committee, for their bipartisan \ncooperation on the important subject of accelerating innovation and \nprocurement of innovative technologies by the Federal Government. I \nalso want to thank Dr. Charles Wessner and others at the National \nAcademy of Sciences who have worked on a congressionally authorized \nstudy of the SBIR program, the Small Business Technology Council, the \nAssociation for Manufacturing Technology, and numerous representatives \nof Federal agencies, small businesses, and representatives of large \nprime contractors for the insights into the work of the SBIR and the \nSTTR programs which they have provided to my committee over the years.\n  Today, the Federal Government spends approximately $2.3 billion on \nphase I and phase II awards for the SBIR and the STTR programs, with \n$2.2 billion spent through the SBIR awards to small businesses. The \nDepartment of Defense is the major participant in this program, \naccounting for approximately $1.1 billion in SBIR spending and \napproximately $50 million in STTR spending. These funds provide a \nsubstantial stimulus to the American innovation system, and it is the \ntask of this Congress to ensure that these funds are wisely spent. A \nkey part of this effort is strengthening the existing science and \nresearch requirements for the small business research and development \nprograms. This amendment directs the Department of Defense to base its \nSBIR and STTR research and development priorities on the Department's \nmost current Joint Warfighting Science and Technology Plan, the Defense \nTechnology Area Plan and the Basic Research Plan and to solicit input \nfrom program management officials.\n  In addition to the phase I and phase II awards, the Department of \nDefense awarded over $456 million in phase III contracts in fiscal year \n2004. But the need for innovative technologies in our defense \nprocurement is far greater. The SBIR and the STTR authorities enable \ncontracting officers to quickly buy high-tech products and services for \nour warfighters. Unfortunately, the commercialization rate from \nresearch and development to product acquisition has been hampered by \npoor commercialization planning and increasing SBIR program \nadministration costs. Since 1998, Congress and the Department of \nDefense have sought to increase commercialization but without much \nprogress. To address this problem, my amendment authorizes a \nCommercialization Pilot Program at the Department of Defense and \ncomponent military departments. Under this program, the Secretary of \nDefense and the military Secretaries would be required to identify SBIR \nprograms with potential for accelerated transition into the acquisition \nprocess. The amendment authorizes the use of one percent of SBIR phase \nI and phase II funds for administrative expenses of this pilot. \nCongress will be kept abreast of this pilot through detailed evaluative \nreports.\n  As cochair of the Senate Task Force on Manufacturing, I have been \nconcerned about the deteriorating manufacturing base of our Nation and \nespecially the impact of this trend on the defense industrial base. To \nstem this decline, President George W. Bush signed Executive Order \n13329, Encouraging Innovation in Manufacturing, in February 2004. This \norder directs Federal agencies which participate in the Small Business \nInnovation Research Program and the Small Business Technology Transfer \nProgram to give ``high priority'' to manufacturing-related research and \ndevelopment projects to the extent permitted by law. The amendment \nincorporates this Executive order into law and directs the Small \nBusiness Administration and all other relevant agencies to fully \nimplement its tenets.\n  Finally, the amendment will expand the ability of Federal agencies \nand prime contractors to use phase II and phase III awards under SBIR \nand STTR for testing and evaluation of innovative technologies \ndeveloped by small businesses for use in technical or weapons systems. \nInsertion of SBIR or STTR technologies into large, integrated systems \nis often not possible without significant testing efforts. By \nclarifying that either phase II or phase III may be used for these \npurposes, the amendment will provide additional incentives to agency \nprogram managers and to large systems integrators to commercialize the \nfruits of the SBIR and the STTR research.\n  Our Nation's small businesses are also our Nation's innovators. They \nsecure approximately 13 times more patents than large businesses. I \nurge this Congress to support in conference my measure for keeping \nAmerica secure in war and in competitive internationally.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/15/senate-section/article/S13649-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13649-S13650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            ANTI-SEMITIC STATEMNTS BY THE PRESIDENT OF IRAN\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to register my outrage against \na series of vehemently anti-Semitic comments made by Iranian President \nMahmoud Ahmadinejad. These remarks, all of them vile and baseless, \nshould be condemned by the Senate. Let me describe some of these \nremarks for the Record.\n  At a conference in Tehran on October 26, President Ahmadinejad said, \n``Israel must be wiped off the map . . . The Islamic world will not let \nits historic enemy live in its heartland.''\n  Then, on December 8, he continued his assault, saying ``Some European \ncountries insist on saying that Hitler killed millions of innocent Jews \nin furnaces . . . Although we don't accept this claim . . . If the \nEuropeans are honest they should give some of their provinces in \nEurope--like in Germany,\n\n[[Page S13650]]\n\nAustria or other countries--to the Zionists and the Zionists can \nestablish their state in Europe.''\n  And, just yesterday, President Ahmadinejad claimed that ``They have \nfabricated a legend under the name `Massacre of the Jews', and they \nhold it higher than God himself, religion itself and the prophets \nthemselves''\n  Mr. President, I do not even know where to begin. Insidious rhetoric \nsuch as this is designed to do nothing other than stir hatred and \nincite hostility.\n  I have walked the grounds at Auschwitz. I have seen the crematoria. \nTo claim that one of the greatest tragedies in the history of humanity \nis merely a fabrication to advance a political agenda is simply beyond \nthe pale. But what is worse is that these comments are not isolated. \nThey are a part of persistent, state-sponsored anti-Semitism that is \nnow commonplace in the administration of President Ahmadinejad.\n  On the eve of the elections in Iraq, one of the greatest democratic \nmilestones in the history of the modern Middle East, I hope that we can \nwork to move past this gross intolerance on the part of the Iranian \nPresident.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/15/senate-section/article/S13650-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 FREE GUN LOCKS FROM PROJECT CHILDSAFE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, tragedies involving children and guns \ncontinue to repeat themselves with alarming frequency around the \ncountry. According to local police, at least five Detroit children have \nbeen accidentally shot and killed this year alone. Just last week a \nthree year old boy in Detroit nearly lost his life when he accidentally \nshot himself in the chest with his father's gun.\n  Following that shooting, Detroit police spokesman James Tate said, \n``It appears this could have been prevented if a gun lock was on and \nthe gun was secured. It's unfortunate that we end up responding to \nthese types of scenes when there are free gun locks readily available \naround the city.''\n  One source of free gun locks is Project ChildSafe, the Nation's \nlargest firearm safety education program. This program has provided \nmore than 35 million ``firearm safety kits'' to gun owners around the \ncountry, including more than 517,500 in Michigan this year. Each \nfirearm safety kit includes a free gun lock and materials to educate \nfirearms owners about safe gun storage practices.\n  Free gun locks from Project ChildSafe are available year round \nthrough many local police departments. According to Project ChildSafe, \nif a local law enforcement agency does not have safety kits available \nfor residents who request them, that agency may contact their \ngovernor's office to receive a supply. In addition, Project ChildSafe \nrepresentatives attend a number of major public events including State \nfairs, sportsmen's festivals, and community safety days to distribute \nfirearm safety kits. More information on safe gun storage practices and \nhow to acquire a free gun lock can be found on the Project ChildSafe \nwebsite at www.projectchildsafe.org.\n  The Project ChildSafe website also includes information concerning a \nnumber of safe gun storage practices to reduce the risk of \nunintentional shooting. In addition to using a gun lock, Project \nChildSafe suggests locking up ammunition in a location separate from \nthe firearm. Statistics show this additional precaution can have a \ndramatic impact on the risk of unintentional shooting. A study \npublished earlier this year in the Journal of the American Medical \nAssociation found that the risk of unintentional shooting or suicide by \nminors using a gun is reduced by as much as 61 percent when ammunition \nin the home is locked up. Simply storing ammunition separately from the \ngun reduces such occurrences by more than 50 percent.\n  Common sense alone tells us that safe firearms storage practices, \nincluding the use of gun locks, reduces the risk of accidental \nshootings. I hope that firearms owners in Michigan and around the \ncountry join those who have already chosen to take advantage of the \nfree gun locks and educational materials provided by Project ChildSafe \nso that fewer children are killed and seriously injured in accidental \nshootings.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/15/senate-section/article/S13650-2", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ELECTIONS IN IRAQ\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Mr. President, one of the most important issues facing \nmankind is the problem of human-induced climate change. The broad \nconsensus within the scientific community is that global warming has \nbegun, is largely the result of human activity, and is accelerating.\n  Global warming will result in more extreme weather, increased \nflooding and drought, disruption of agricultural and water systems, \nthreats to human health and loss of sensitive species and ecosystems. \nWe must take action now to minimize these effects, for the sake of our \nchildren, our grandchildren, and future generations.\n  Over the last 2 weeks, 189 countries met in Montreal to discuss the \nimportant issue of global climate change. These countries met in a \nspirit of cooperation and in hopes of agreeing on the next steps for \nreducing harmful emissions of greenhouse gases. These countries, \nincluding the United States, have all already agreed, under the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to take steps to \n``prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate \nsystem.'' These past 2 weeks were a test of their resolve.\n  Unfortunately the United States, led by the Bush administration \ndelegation, attempted to slow, stall, and block the progress of these \ntalks. This is unconscionable, given that the United States is the \nlargest single emitter of greenhouse gases. Fortunately the U.S. \nnegotiators' efforts were not completely successful, and an agreement \nwas reached to have additional talks commencing next year. Although \nthat is a small step and not nearly enough, it is vastly preferable to \nthe outcome this administration wanted, which amounts to no action at \nall.\n  In advance of the Montreal meetings, I joined with 23 other Senators \nin sending a letter to President Bush, reminding the administration of \nits legal obligation to participate in the Montreal talks. \nUnfortunately, but perhaps not surprisingly, the administration \ndisregarded this obligation.\n  A decision to block further discussions on missions reduction \ncommitments cannot be viewed as consistent with the obligations of the \nUnited States under the treaty.\n  While the U.S. has refused to ratify the Kyoto Protocol despite the \nfact that 157 nations have become parties, actions to block those \ncountries from moving forward with additional commitments under that \nProtocol is also inconsistent with the U.S. Framework Treaty \nobligations.\n  In our letter to the President, we noted that just this year the \nSenate, by a vote of 53-44, approved a resolution calling for mandatory \nlimits on greenhouse gases within the United States. We wrote this \nletter and distributed it to interested parties at the negotiations to \nensure that other countries\n\n[[Page S13651]]\n\nunderstand that not everyone in the United States agrees with the Bush \nplan for prolonged inaction.\n  To this end, members of my staff traveled to Montreal and met with \nrepresentatives and negotiators from other countries. They also met \nwith public interest groups, business groups, and others interested in \ntaking positive action on climate change. They witnessed firsthand how \nthe Bush administration worked very hard to dissuade other countries \nfrom agreeing to even discuss further commitments. This is not the \nposition that our Nation should be taking. We should be leading the way \non climate change, not burying our head in the sand.\n  From the outset, even before they left Washington, the \nadministration's delegation insisted that any discussion of future \ncommitments was ``a non-starter'' and that any discussion about future \ncommitments prior to 2012, which marks the end of the first set of \nKyoto commitments, was premature. They continued at the conference to \nmake this point to all parties. And when the rest of the world decided \nto engage in actual negotiations about discussions of further \ncommitments under both the Framework Convention and the Kyoto Protocol, \nthe U.S. stated bluntly that such discussions were unacceptable and \npointedly walked away from the negotiating table.\n  The good news is that the rest of the world stayed at that table and \ntalked throughout the night and into the next morning, reaching \nagreement on a set of decisions for further discussions. And when those \ndecisions were brought into the light of day, and it became apparent \nthat the United States would have to state its opposition publicly, \nbefore all 189 countries, the U.S. was forced to agree to return to the \nnegotiating table and to allow talks to continue next year.\n  This means that 157 countries have agreed to discuss additional \ncommitments under the Kyoto Protocol, even without the U.S. as a party, \nand that 189 countries, including the U.S., have agreed to look at the \nissue of further steps under the Framework Convention. Despite \narguments to the contrary, cooperative international agreements to \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions remain a reality, and slow, but \nsignificant, progress is taking place to strengthen those commitments.\n  The overwhelming majority of Americans support taking some form of \naction on climate change. A recent poll by the Program on International \nPolicy Attitudes, sponsored by the Center for International and \nSecurity Studies at the University of Maryland, found that 86 percent \nof Americans think that President Bush should act to limit greenhouse \ngases in the U.S. if the G8 countries are willing to act to reduce such \ngases. All the G8 countries except the U.S. are signatories to the \nKyoto treaty and therefore have already committed to such action.\n  In addition, the study found that 73 percent of Americans believe \nthat the U.S. should participate in the Kyoto treaty. Finally, the \nstudy found that 83 percent of Americans favor ``legislation requiring \nlarge companies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 2000 levels by \n2010 and to 1990 levels by 2020.'' Thus, in one way or another, more \nthan 80 percent of Americans favor taking real action on climate \nchange. The current administration is completely out of step with the \nAmerican public on this issue.\n  States, regions and even localities are taking on climate change \nrelated commitments. Nine Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic States are \nworking together through the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, RGGI, \nto develop a cap-and-trade system for carbon dioxide, CO2, \nemissions from power plants. On June 1, 2005, California Governor \nArnold Schwarzenegger signed an executive order setting greenhouse gas \nemissions targets for the State. The order directs State officials to \ndevelop plans that would reduce California's greenhouse gas emissions \nto 2000 emissions levels by 2010 and 1990 levels by 2020. The U.S. \nConference of Mayors adopted an agreement, sponsored by Seattle Mayor \nGreg Nickels, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to levels that mirror \nthe Kyoto Protocol limits. California has also adopted a greenhouse gas \nemission standard for automobiles, and a number of States, including \nVermont, have followed suit and adopted the same standards. These \nactions confirm that there is widespread political desire and \nmotivation to take action within the United States to reduce greenhouse \ngas emissions.\n  I have sponsored legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from \npowerplants, which are a large source of carbon dioxide, a principal \ngreenhouse gas. My bill, S. 150, the Clean Power Act, would reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2010. This would be a very \nimportant first step by the United States towards combating global \nwarming that would show the rest of the world that we are serious about \ndoing our part. Congress needs to act to provide a mandate and \nundisputed authority to this and future administration negotiators.\n  I am both discouraged and heartened by the outcome of the talks in \nMontreal. Those of us who care about stopping climate change did \neverything we could to help aid these talks, and despite the Bush \nadministration resistance, the international dialogue on climate change \nwill continue.\n  But a dialogue is not nearly enough, and the consequences of \nadditional delay are dire. The U.S. has been and remains the largest \nemitter of greenhouse gases. It has a responsibility to its own people \nand to the people of the world to be a leader on this issue. Thus far, \nit has been anything but a leader and these talks highlighted that \nfact.\n  I look forward to the day when I can once again be proud of the \nUnited States role in these talks, when we can enter these negotiations \nhaving done our part. I believe that is what we agreed to in 1992, when \nthe Senate ratified the climate treaty and it is high time we live up \nto our obligation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/15/senate-section/article/S13651-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  ANWR\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, over the past year, and on more \noccasions than I'd like to remember, I have talked about the abuse of \nprocess that proponents of drilling in the Arctic Refuge have resorted \nto in their attempts to pass an unpopular and misguided measure. Sadly, \nthe Senate faces the very same issue today. Let me unequivocally state \nthat talk of attaching an extraneous and obviously controversial \nprovision regarding the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to the \nDepartment of Defense appropriations conference report--a provision \nthat was not included in either the House or Senate version of the \nbill--is flat out irresponsible and should be rejected.\n  This last-ditch effort to attach the Arctic Refuge drilling provision \nto the Department of Defense appropriations bill--or any other bill \nthat is a ``must pass'' before we adjourn for the year--really reflects \npoorly on this body. And, what does it mean for greater mischief down \nthe line? That whenever we can't move an unpopular proposal through the \nregular legislative process, there's no need to worry: you just attach \nit to an important funding bill? Is this the precedent that we, members \nof both parties, want to set? I sincerely hope not.\n  Let me be very clear: I would prefer to be talking about setting a \nnew path for our country's energy policy--a path that reduces our use \nof fossil fuels while favoring renewable sources of energy. \nUnfortunately, some of my colleagues are dead set on looking to the \npast, instead of to the future, for our sources of energy and are even \nwilling to go so far as to use the bill that funds our men and women in \nuniform as a vehicle for their controversial measure. I am deeply \ndisappointed by this latest move.\n  I strongly urge any of my colleagues who are currently trying to add \nlanguage to the Defense appropriations bill, or any other bill we need \nto consider in the coming days, that would open up the Arctic Refuge to \noil and gas development, to reconsider those efforts. Continuing down \nthat path, the path of circumventing established legislative processes \nto move measures that can't pass on their own merits, is an \nirresponsible abuse of the rules under which we operate that should be \nrejected out of hand.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/15/senate-section/article/S13651-2", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13651-S13652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           DR.

Dr. Maung, herself a Burmese \nrefugee, has dedicated her life to helping those fleeing political and \neconomic turmoil in\n\n[[Page S13652]]\n\nBurma. Few Burmese refugees are granted official refugee status in \nThailand, making it almost impossible to obtain healthcare, employment \nor education.\n  On the outskirts of the town of Mae Sot, Dr. Maung started a \nmakeshift facility to treat her malaria stricken fellow refugees as \nthey began crossing by the thousands into Thailand, following the \nBurmese junta's brutal crackdown on the democracy movement in 1988. Mae \nTao is now a thriving clinic treating around 70,000 people a year. From \nproviding maternity care and family planning to treating infectious \ndiseases and fitting landmine victims with prosthetics, the Mae Tao \nclinic represents hope, safety and a brighter future for some of the \nmost vulnerable people in the world. This is a mission we should do \neverything we can to support.\n  Dr. Maung's tireless efforts have not stopped with the Burmese \nrefugee population in Thailand, as she trains medical teams to deliver \nhealth services to remote villages in Burma. Unable to return to her \nhomeland, Dr. Maung continues to be a fearless advocate for democracy \nand justice for the people of Burma--on both sides of the border.\n  We can and must do more to support this courageous woman, and her \nwork to ensure that the refugee population in Thailand is granted basic \nrights, including healthcare and education, for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/15/senate-section/article/S13652-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    A NEWSPAPER FAMILY FOR 30 YEARS\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, keeping a community connected and \ninformed is one of the most important functions of a local paper. In \nCottonwood, ID, this job has been attended to with care and expertise \nby Pat Wherry and her late husband Bob for the past 30 years. In 1975, \nPat and Bob took the helm of the Cottonwood Chronicle and Bob, until \nhis death, and Pat have been serving the community of Cottonwood \nthrough their hard work and diligence ever since. Their two sons are \ninvolved in the businesses as well, each currently holding positions as \neditors, one at the Chronicle and the other at the Lewis County Herald. \nBob passed away in 1996, but Pat has stayed with the paper, working \nhours that as many involved in small papers know far exceed 40 hours \nper week.\n  The Cottonwood Chronicle is one of the oldest papers in Idaho, first \nwearing the banner of the ``Cottonwood Reporter'' in 1892. It has been \nthe Cottonwood Chronicle since around 1910. At one time, the Wherry \nfamily also owned both the Valley News in Meridian and the Lewis County \nHerald in Nez Perce, but later sold the Valley News. They have devoted \ntheir time, resources and energy to keeping the people in these \ncommunities educated and involved. Editors of small papers especially \nserve many functions--they are the source of news and schedules of \nevents. They are the keepers of community opinion and concerns. Pat \nespecially is a strong and proud advocate for Cottonwood and I always \nappreciate her information she shares about the exciting things \nhappening in this growing community. I congratulate Pat and her sons \nGreg and Steve and wish them well as they continue in their good \nwork.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/15/senate-section/article/S13652-2", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              APPRECIATION FOR THE WORK OF LYNN ROSENTHAL\n\n Mr. CRAPO, Mr. President, today I recognize outgoing executive \ndirector of the National Network to End Domestic Violence, Lynn \nRosenthal.

With dignity, poise, and energetic \nconviction, as executive director of NNEDV, Lynn has been an invaluable \nvoice of education on domestic violence issues for Members of Congress. \nShe speaks for those who cannot speak for themselves, those imprisoned \nin their homes, victims of cruelty with no way out and no hope.

This is the Lakers' third \nchampionship in the past 4 years, and it crowns a perfect 13-to-0 \nseason. I particularly salute the Lakers' coach, Chuck Martin, who is \nin his second season with the team.\n  The Lakers' championship victory came in a game that was thrilling to \nthe end. After finishing the first half down 14-to-7, the Lakers fought \nback against Northwest Missouri State. A stunning 82-yard scoring drive \nin the fourth quarter gave the Lakers their first lead of the game with \njust over 4 minutes left to play. Northwest Missouri mounted an \nimpressive drive of its own, but the Lakers' defense stopped the \nBearcats at the 4-yard line as time expired. In this stirring finish, \nthe Lakers showed the skill and poise of true national champions.\n  Grand Valley is now one of only three schools, including North Dakota \nState and North Alabama, that have won three or more Division II \nNational Championships in football. And the seniors on the Laker team \nhave tied the NCAA record for the most wins in a 4-year period.\n  Winning is becoming a tradition at Grand Valley. The volleyball team \nrecently won the Division II championship. The water polo team won a \nnational club title in November. And Mandi Long-Zemba recently won the \nDivision II individual cross-country title as the cross-country team \nplaced second overall.\n  Congratulations to all of the magnificent athletes at Grand Valley \nState University on a tremendous year, and best of luck for continued \nsuccess.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of \nCarmen McCormick. She was a brave young woman, beloved by her family \nand friends, who dedicated her life to the nation she loved through \nhonorable service in the U.S. Navy.\n  Gunner's Mate First Class McCormick enlisted in the Navy in April of \n1999 and completed her basic training at the Recruit Training Command \nin Great Lakes, IL. Upon completion of basic training, she attended \nGunner's Mate ``A'' school, and later continued her technical training \nat the Naval Training Center in San Diego. Ultimately, her duty led her \nto the Mayport Naval Station in Jacksonville, FL.\n  To those who served beside her, McCormick was a tremendous asset as a \ntalented technician and recognized expert in all aspects of ordnance \nhandling, but she was also a trusted leader and a friend whom they came \nto know and love.\n  Tragically, she was involved in a serious automobile accident on the \nnight of November 11, 2005. Her shipmates joined her at the hospital \nshortly after the accident and later joined her family in a constant \nvigil by her bedside, and throughout the hospital, until the moment she \npassed away on November 13. She would have been 26 years old next \nmonth.\n\n[[Page S13653]]\n\n  Although Carmen may no longer be with us, I pray that her friends and \nfamily have found some sense of solace knowing that she was not alone \nat the end of her life's journey but was surrounded by loved ones who \nsought to comfort her with their presence and their prayers. I would \nlike to share the family's appreciation for the U.S. Navy officials who \nhelped everyone through the difficult issues that arose from Carmen's \nend-of-life care. She had devoted herself to service and looked forward \nto a promising career in the Navy, and in her final moments they did \neverything they could to ensure she was treated with the honor and \nrespect she deserved.\n  Of particular assistance and comfort to the family were Carmen's \ncommanding officer, LCDR Tim Sullivan, as well as Senior Chief Joseph \nAdamo, LT Tim Johnson, CAPT Charles King, and ADM Annette Brown. Their \ncompassion and understanding made a tragic situation a little more \nbearable.\n  My thoughts and prayers go out to the friends and family of Carmen \nMcCormick, particularly her parents, Michael Flanigan and Leslie Santa \nMaria. Although her time with us was far too short, her spirit and her \nlove will remain in our hearts forever.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/15/senate-section/article/S13653-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE SAN LUIS VALLEY\n\n Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I today recognize the \nextraordinary contributions of the San Luis Valley, in my home State of \nColorado, to our national heritage and to the history of the West.\n  As a native son of the San Luis Valley, I know how hard the peoples \nof the region have fought to protect their traditions, their language, \ntheir art and architecture, and the stories of their ancestors. They \nhave fought to protect treasured ranchlands, sand dunes, waterways, and \nmountain peaks. And they have fought to protect a rural way of life \nthat cherishes family, faith, and hard work.\n  To support the stewardship efforts of the valley's peoples, and to \nensure that the national treasures of the region are preserved for \ngenerations to come, I have introduced legislation to create the Sangre \nde Cristo National Heritage Area in the San Luis Valley.\n  This legislation will direct the National Park Service to assist \ncitizens, organizations, and local governments in Alamosa, Costilla, \nand Conejos Counties in developing a management plan to guide the \ncontinued stewardship of the region's cultural and natural resources. \nThough this bill provides local communities assistance from the Federal \nGovernment, I am proud that the National Heritage Area Program rewards \na consensual, locally driven approach to management rather than a top-\ndown, federally dominated approach.\n  This bill provides economic assistance to a region that has paid an \neconomic price for preserving its rural way of life. The towns of San \nLuis and Antonito, among the oldest settlements in Colorado, have \nsuccessfully preserved their moradas, placitas, historic churches, \nreligious celebrations, and historic festivals, yet the counties they \nare in, Conejos and Costilla, are two of the four poorest in America. \nThis bill helps these communities leverage their cultural capital to \nspur economic development by providing up to $10 million to rebuild \nhistoric structures, develop interpretive exhibits, and attract \ntourism.\n  The cultural and historic value of the Sangre de Cristo National \nHeritage Area is immeasurable. Since people first settled in the San \nLuis Valley over 11,000 years ago, the region has been home to Ute, \nNavajo, Tiwa, Tewa, Kiowa, Hispano, and Anglo peoples, among others. \nThe cultures, lifestyles, and cosmologies of the valley's settlers have \nconverged, conflicted, and coalesced through the centuries, and have \nleft an unmistakable imprint on the peoples who inhabit the Valley \ntoday. The region was dubbed ``The Land of the Blue Sky People'' in \nhonor of the Utes, the oldest continuous residents of what is now \nColorado, and is the home of Mount Blanca or Sisnaajini, the sacred \nmountain that, according to folklore, marks the eastern boundary of the \nNavajo world. Seventeenth century Spanish, still spoken by about 35 \npercent of the population of the Sangre de Cristo region, testifies to \nthe strong influence of Hispano settlers, while the narrow gauge rails \nof the Rio Grande Railroad recall America's era of westward expansion.\n  In addition to its remarkable historical landmarks and cultural \ntreasures, the San Luis Valley's natural wonders attract visitors from \naround the world. The valley is home to 3 National Wildlife Refuges, 15 \nState Wildlife Refuges, a National Forest, 2 National Forest Wilderness \nAreas, and the Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve. These \npublic lands, and thousands of acres of private lands in between, are \nhome to a rich array of plants and animals, from the pika of the alpine \ntundra to the pronghorn of the prairie and the sandhill cranes among \nthe dunes.\n  This legislation will help protect these crown jewels of the American \nlandscape by supporting a local, consensus-based approach to land \nmanagement. Because the best management policies come through \ncooperation, not coercion, this bill maintains strong protections for \nprivate property owners. The Federal funds in this bill cannot be used \nto purchase private property and the management plan cannot restrict \nthe rights of property owners on their own lands.\n  For generations the peoples of the San Luis Valley have worked hard \nto be good stewards of their land and water. They have worked hard to \npreserve their culture and a rural way of life. And they have worked \nhard to create this National Heritage Area.\n  They are looking for our help now to protect a place so central to \nColorado peoples, so emblematic of the Western landscape, and so much \nat the core of the American experience.\n  Let us honor the contributions of the San Luis Valley to our Nation's \nheritage by designating the Sangre de Cristo National Heritage \nArea.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/15/senate-section/article/S13653-2", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13653-S13654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                U.S. MILITARY PERSONNEL SERVING IN IRAQ\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, today is a historic day for the \npeople of Iraq as they go to the polls to freely elect a permanent 275-\nmember Iraqi National Assembly. It is important to remember that these \nelections in Iraq would not have been possible without the bravery and \nsacrifice of the U.S. Armed Forces who have served and are currently \nserving in Iraq helping to provide the Iraqi people with the freedom \nand democracy that they deserve.\n  Our service members who are serving in Iraq are promoting democracy, \nrestoring and repairing public services, working to prevent terror \nattack, and destroying the insurgency in a country that hasn't known \nfreedom in decades.\n  As we focus on the meaning of Thursday's election in Iraq, it is \nimportant to realize the extraordinary bravery exhibited by our service \nmembers.\n  One unit in particular, the 4th Civil Affairs Group, CAG, U.S. Marine \nCorps Reserve, based in Washington, DC was deployed to Iraq during the \nJanuary 30, 2005 elections of a temporary Iraqi National Assembly. \nThese marines, many of whom are from my State of Pennsylvania, helped \nto promote democracy, restore and repair public services to the Iraqi \npeople, and prevent terror attacks by insurgents. This particular unit \nplayed an active role in the election day operations in January by \nsetting up polling locations and participating in security patrols to \nprotect voters and voting sites and was an integral part in the United \nStates' battle for Fallujah. Also during its deployment, the 4th CAG \nworked to install new electricity transformers in the Iraqi city of \nRamadi, the capital city of the al Anbar Province, also known as one of \nthe most dangerous cities in Iraq. And I would be remiss if I failed to \nmention that the deputy commander of this unit of brave marines was \nWilliam Reynolds, now proudly serving as Senator Specter's chief of \nstaff.\n  One marine in particular from that unit, CPL William Cahir, has \nwritten about his experiences in Iraq. Corporal Cahir, originally from \nState College PA, was a journalist before September 11, 2001. After \nseeing the horrific terrorist attacks that occurred in our country on \nthat day, Bill Cahir felt compelled to serve our country and joined the \nMarine Corps. As part of the 4th CAG of the Marine Corps Reserve, \nCorporal Cahir was deployed to Iraq.\n  During his deployment to Iraq, Corporal Cahir, along with other \nmembers of the 4th CAG, helped to establish a\n\n[[Page S13654]]\n\nCivil Military Operations Center in Ramadi. On election day in January \nin Iraq, Corporal Cahir and the 4th CAG were responsible for protecting \na polling site in Ramadi.\n  Having returned from his deployment to Iraq, Corporal Cahir has since \nreturned to his civilian job. As a journalist, Bill Cahir covers a \nmultitude of stories but has since focused many of those stories on his \nown personal experiences in Iraq and the experiences of other service \nmembers.\n  In one article he wrote for The Express-Times, a newspaper from \nEaston, PA, Mr. Cahir told the story of two service members--COL James \nT. Anthony, a marine reservist from Nazareth, PA, and LTC Stanley B. \nSmith, Jr., an Army officer with the Army's 98th Division, \nInstitutional Training. Both service members were on their way to Camp \nTaji in Baghdad to begin their deployments to Iraq.\n  In his article, Bill Cahir documented the sentiments of these two \nservice members during their deployments. Colonel Anthony had recounted \nhis observations of the training of Iraqi soldiers, ``U.S. Marines, \nsoldiers and sailors, along with their commanders, `did a fantastic job \nreally pushing the ball forward when it comes to training Iraqi \nsecurity forces, not just in terms of numbers but in terms of \nefficiency and effectiveness.'''\n  Lieutenant Colonel Smith also recounted his experiences in Iraq when \nhe said, ``I am able to feel a sense of pride in accomplishment here in \nseeing real results in the form of construction that has been completed \nas planned and Iraqi units operating with installations that contribute \nto mission readiness.''\n  Mr. President, these stories from our soldiers are just a few more \nexamples of the success in Iraq that our troops are contributing to. \nEach and every one of our service members has contributed to the \npromotion of democracy, the security, and the rebuilding of Iraq.\n  I applaud the marines of the 4th Civil Affairs Group and all of the \nservice members who are serving or who have served our Nation in Iraq. \nThe bravery that they have displayed and the progress they have made in \nIraq is remarkable, and it needs to be told.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/15/senate-section/article/S13654-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              AIMEE'S LAW\n\n Mr. SANTORUM.

I believe that 3 years is \nmore than adequate time to implement this critical protection for my \nconstituents.\n  Aimee's Law is named after Aimee Willard, a college senior from \nsuburban Philadelphia who was brutally raped and murdered by a \nconvicted murderer who was released early in Nevada and crossed State \nlines to kill again in Pennsylvania. Aimee's mother, Gail, became a \ntireless advocate to prevent such unnecessary tragedies from happening \nto other families, culminating in the passage of Aimee's Law in the \nU.S. Senate by an 81-to-17 margin and its final inclusion in H.R. 3244, \nthe Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act conference \nreport, which also included the Violence Against Women Act \nReauthorization, Pub. L. 106-386. Aimee's Law is narrowly tailored to \naddress the heinous crimes of murder, rape, and child molestation.\n  The law is designed to protect the residents of one State from the \nnegligence of another State. The law assists States which recognize \nthat the primary responsibility of State and local governments is to \nmaintain public safety. Sexual predators have the highest rate of \nrecidivism of any category of violent crime. The law simply provides \nthat States where a subsequent similar violent crime occurs because of \nan early release will be reimbursed for the prosecution and \nincarceration costs through a reduction of future Federal funds from \nthe allocation of the State where the original violent crime and \nconviction occurred.\n  I wish to state for the record that I will not object to the \n``technical changes'' of Aimee's Law in H.R. 3402 as the Department of \nJustice assures me that the law will be implemented within six months. \nWhile I think that it is unacceptable that it has taken this long to \ntake the appropriate steps to implement this law, I am hopeful that \nAimee's Law will finally and effectively be implemented in the very \nnear future so other families do not suffer the same fate as the \nWilliards.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/15/senate-section/article/S13654-2", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO DICK FORD\n\n Mr. TALENT. Mr. Present, today I rise to honor the \naccomplishments of Dick Ford, one of the most respected broadcast \njournalists in the St. Louis area. After more than 50 years of media \nservice around the country, Mr. Ford will be retiring today, December \n15, 2005. He will be greatly missed by viewers in the St. Louis area \nand in the field of journalism as a whole.\n  After receiving a bachelor of science degree in political science \nfrom the University of Pittsburgh and serving on active duty aboard an \naircraft carrier in the Mediterranean, Dick began his professional \ncareer in 1951 and went on to work in a number of States as a reporter, \nnews director, and anchor.\n  After having established himself as a prominent journalist, Mr. Ford \ncame to the St. Louis area where he began working at KSDK-TV. In July \n1992, he joined KTVI Fox 2, from which he will retire.\n  In his distinguished career, Mr. Ford has been honored with the \nprestigious Emmy Award, among other recognitions of his journalistic \ntalent and integrity.\n  The many hallmarks of his career include a training mission in an F-4 \nPhantom jet, live reports from Rome when Sister Philippine Duchesne was \ncanonized, reports on a nuclear submarine and from the flight deck of \nan aircraft carrier and travels to Saudi Arabia to report on Desert \nStorm.\n  In addition to his passion for journalism, Dick Ford is a committed \nfather and husband. He is also passionate about the community of St. \nLouis. Mr. Ford currently works with the USO and the St. Patrick's Day \nParade Committee, among other St. Louis area organizations.\n  In his work, both as a journalist and a community leader, Dick has \nwon the respect of his colleagues and viewers alike. I have appreciated \nvery much Dick's dedication and professionalism. He sought more than \njust the story--he wanted to get the story right. In his interviews \nwith me, he never hesitated to ask the tough questions, but he was \nalways fair about it.\n  Dick, congratulations on your many contributions to the great State \nof Missouri and your tremendously successful career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/15/senate-section/article/S13654-3", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13654-S13655]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO TERRY R. LITTLE\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to \nrecognize the service of an outstanding leader and public servant. \nAfter more than 38 years of combined military and civil service, Mr. \nTerry R. Little will soon retire from the Department of Defense, DOD, \nand move into private life.\n  Mr. Little is one of the most seasoned weapons acquisition program \nmanagers in the DOD. He has over 24 years of program management \nleadership in seven major weapon acquisition programs including two \nhighly classified missile programs, the AIM-9X Short Range Air-to-Air \nMissile, the Joint Direct Attack Munition, the Small Diameter Bomb, the \nJoint Air-to-Surface Stand-off Missile, and the Kinetic Energy \nInterceptor Program. Each of these weapon systems has delivered, or \npromises to provide, unparalleled advancements in capability at \naffordable costs for the defense of our Nation. His creative ingenuity, \ntenacious organizational drive, and superior personal leadership \ndirectly enabled these advancements.\n  Mr. Little is currently the Executive Director of the Missile Defense \nAgency, MDA. In this capacity, he is responsible for acquisition, \npersonnel, and administrative policy. His intellectual commitment for \nexcellence and genuine concern for people have aided immeasurably to \nthe day-to-day operation of the Agency. His professional achievements \nare numerous, impressive, and reflect his dedication and commitment for \nachieving the highest standards of professionalism and integrity in the \nservice of the United States.\n\n[[Page S13655]]\n\n  Terry Little has devoted his adult life to improving the DOD \nacquisition process. He has inspired teamwork and efficiency in many \nvenues, and he has trained the next generation of acquisition managers \nto continue his legacy. For these and his many other contributions, \nAmericans owe Mr. Little a debt of gratitude for a lifetime of selfless \nservice and for his profound contributions to our Nation and our \nsecurity. Those of us in the Senate will miss his leadership and \ncontributions. We wish him and his family all the best in the years \nahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/15/senate-section/article/S13655-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13655]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/15/senate-section/article/S13655-2", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13655]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/15/senate-section/article/S13655-3", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13655]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    REPORT RELATIVE TO THE EXPORT OF ACCELEROMETERS TO THE PEOPLE'S \n            REPUBLIC OF CHINA'S MINISTRY OF RAILWAYS--PM 33\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  In accordance with the provisions of section 1512 of the Strom \nThurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999 \n(Public Law 105-261), I hereby certify that the export of 36 \naccelerometers to the People's Republic of China's Ministry of \nRailways, for use in a railroad track geometry measuring system, is not \ndetrimental to the U.S. space launch industry, and that the material \nand equipment, including any indirect technical benefit that could be \nderived from such export, will not measurably improve the missile or \nspace launch capabilities of the People's Republic of China.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to amend the Reclamation Wastewater and Groundwater \nStudy and Facilities Act to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to \nparticipate in the Prado Basin Natural Treatment System Project, to \nauthorize the Secretary to carry out a program to assist agencies in \nprojects to construct regional brine lines in California, to authorize \nthe Secretary to participate in the Lower Chino Dairy Area desalination \ndemonstration and reclamation project, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Santa \nAna River Water Supply Enhancement Act of 2005.\n  This legislation authorizes Federal assistance through Title XVI for \nprojects developed by local communities to reduce their dependence on \nwater from the Colorado River. It helps California develop safer and \nmore reliable water supplies.\n  Congressman Gary Miller along with Congressmen Calvert, Dreier, \nRoyce, Cox and Rohrabacher introduced similar legislation in the House. \nTheir bill passed the House in October.\n  The projects in this bill will increase the region's water supply by \n200,000 acre-feet annually and are prototypes for providing water \nsupplies to new communities throughout the arid Western States.\n  The Orange County Water District's Groundwater Replenishment System \nis an innovative approach to reuse water resources within one of the \nmost populated counties in the Nation. Seventy-two thousand acre feet \nof reclaimed water will be produced annually for indirect potable use. \nThis is enough water to meet the needs of more than 300,000 people each \nyear. This bill authorizes $51.8 million for the groundwater \nreplenishment system, just 10 percent of the actual cost of the \nproject.\n  Another project in the bill expands desalination facilities in the \nChino Basin, providing a fourfold increase in the ability to desalinate \ngroundwater\n\n[[Page S13662]]\n\nsupplies. The Chino Basin groundwater desalters will be the primary \ndrinking water supply for 40,000 new homes in Riverside and San \nBernardino Counties.\n  This legislation also authorizes $40 million to construct regional \nbrine sewer lines that will enable our communities to safely dispose of \nthe brine generated from the ``desalted'' groundwater supplies.\n  In order to naturally treat the regions water and remove \ncontamination from the Santa Anna River, I am also seeking Federal \nsupport for the construction of wetlands. This concept holds the \npromise of efficiently improving the quality of our groundwater \nsupplies without costly control technologies.\n  The creation of a Center for Technological Advancement of Membrane \nTechnology will foster research efforts to improve membrane design and \ntesting. Research conducted at this facility will help develop \ntechnologies to increase the stability of our water supply.\n  I believe the ever-growing demand for water throughout Southern \nCalifornia can be satisfied through local supplies. Regional watershed \nplans, coordinating water use throughout multiple jurisdictions, are a \ncritical tool to reach this goal. All of the projects in this \nlegislation were developed on a regional basis and the Federal cost \nshare of each project is less than 20 percent.\n  I am pleased to introduce this legislation as it holds the key to \nproviding a roadmap for other communities' efforts to meet the \nchallenges posed by a scarce potable water supply.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2106\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide additional appropriations for the Low-\nIncome Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981 for fiscal year 2006 and to \namend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide a refundable tax \ncredit for residential energy cost assistance, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n\n[[Page S13663]]\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to help \nfamilies bear the dramatic increase in cost for home heating bills this \nwinter.\n  The bill, the Household Energy and Taxpayer Assistance Act of 2005, \nappropriates enough money to fully fund the Low Income Energy \nAssistance Program at its authorized level and provides for a tax \ncredit up to $300 per family to offset home heating bills.\n  I cannot overstate the urgency of this legislation. This week, \nnatural gas prices hit record highs. On the New York Mercantile \nExchange, January futures rose to $15.78 per million BTUs. Prices have \nmore than doubled since last year.\n  What does that mean for the consumer?\n  The Energy Information Administration predicts that the average \nhousehold heating with natural gas his winter will pay $281 more for \nfuel this winter than they did last winter. That is a 38 percent \nincrease. Households using home heating oil can expect to pay $255 \nmore, and propane users could see a $167 increase.\n  Those heating with electricity will likely see a $46 increase in the \ncost to heat a home.\n  The bill that I am proposing includes two proposals that Congress \nshould enact immediately to mitigate these price spikes for households.\n  First and foremost, my legislation fully funds the Federal Low Income \nHome Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP. Despite projections for \nastronomical energy costs, the conference agreement for the Labor, HHS, \nEducation appropriations bill funds this essential home heating program \nat less than 50 percent of its authorized level.\n  And today the Senate will be considering that conference report. The \ncurrent funding level for LIHEAP is unacceptable. As energy prices \ncontinue to skyrocket, we should not be shortchanging this vital \nprogram.\n  In recent years, a growing need for help with home heating bills has \nconsistently outstripped available funding, which has remained flat.\n  That is why Congress responded by increasing the authorization for \nthe program to $5.1 billion in the recently enacted energy bill. But \nCongress hasn't appropriated anywhere near as much for this program as \nit could.\n  Current appropriations legislation provides only about $2.2 billion \nin 2006.\n  My bill would appropriate an additional $2.9 billion for the LIHEAP \nprogram. Funding for heating assistance in my home State of Montana \nwould be at least $35 million, about $20 million more than last year.\n  Montanans and other hard-working families should not have to choose \nbetween their home energy bills and affording other basic necessities.\n  Energy is a basic need, and without LIHEAP assistance, many Montanans \nwouldn't be able to heat their homes. That's why I'm working to help \nease the burden of high heating costs.\n  In addition, this bill establishes a temporary tax credit to help all \ntaxpayers to defray a portion of their heating bills this winter. That \nmeans families can add up their home energy bills, and when tax time \ncomes around they can get 20 percent of that expense back, for heating \nfuel or utility costs. That credit will provide as much as $200 for an \nindividual or $300 for a family.\n  The credit is also refundable. Low-income Americans who don't owe any \nFederal income taxes would still get that rebate against their heating \nbills.\n  Americans can't wait until spring for this assistance.\n  In its current edition, U.S. News & World Report introduces us to \nMervalene Eastman, an unemployed woman on the Crow Indian Reservation. \nMonth-to-month, $100 jumps in her heating bills last year put her \nbehind in her bills. Medical problems forced her to leave her job as an \nemergency dispatcher, and then she lost natural gas service.\n  Things are so tough she sometimes needed to use her electric oven for \nheat, especially on cold nights. I am deeply troubled by the thought \nthat more Americans will go without heat this winter. I am concerned \nfamilies will face a choice between food on their table or heat during \nthe night. They should not have to make that decision. We should pass \nthis legislation and give millions of families an early present this \nholiday.\n  Now is the time to act, and I urge my colleagues to join me helping \nto provide this much needed relief.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENSIGN (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Lugar, Mr. DeWine, \n        Mr. Allen, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. \n        Bayh, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Isakson, \n        Mr. Smith, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. Nelson of Nebraska):\n  S. 2109. A bill to provide national innovation initiative; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss important new \ninnovation legislation that will address concerns about our country and \nour ability to compete in the global marketplace. Today, Senator \nLieberman and I introduced the National Innovation bill with bipartisan \nsupport from Senator Lugar, Senator DeWine, Senator Bingaman, Senator \nAllen, Senator Alexander, Senator Chambliss, Senator Bayh, Senator Bill \nNelson, Senator Kohl, Senator Cornyn, Senator Isakson, Senator Ben \nNelson Senator Leahy and Senator Smith as original cosponsors. We \nencourage all of our colleagues to join us in this important effort.\n  Today the World is becoming dramatically more interconnected and \ncompetitive. In order to remain globally competitive, the United States \nmust continue to lead the world's innovation. Innovation fosters the \nnew ideas, technologies, and processes that lead to better jobs, higher \nwages, and a higher standard of living.\n  Unfortunately, in the disciplines that foster innovation in the 21st \nCentury--science, technology, engineering, and mathematics--America is \nsteadily losing its global edge:\n  The trouble signs are numerous:\n  Less than 6 percent of high school seniors plan to pursue engineering \ndegrees, down from 36 percent from a decade ago.\n  In 2000, only 17 percent of undergraduate degrees earned in the \nUnited States were in the hard sciences.\n  In the same year 56 percent of China's undergraduate degrees were in \nthe hard sciences.\n  Next year, China will likely produce six times the number of \nengineers that we will graduate in the United States.\n  We must address these long-term competitive challenges to America's \neconomic vitality and national security now or risk losing our \nessential leadership position on innovation. The National Innovation \nAct will help America meet these interconnected challenges by \naddressing three primary areas of importance to maintaining and \nimproving United States' innovation in the 21st Century: 1. increasing \nresearch investment 2. increasing science and technology talent, and 3. \ndeveloping an innovation infrastructure.\n  I am a fiscal conservative, and current Federal budget constraints \nwill require prioritization of spending. New programs must be funded \nthrough existing funds or through identifiable funding offsets whenever \npossible. I look forward to working with Senator Lieberman and the \nother cosponsors in this effort.\n  Increased support of basic research through should be a national \npriority.\n  Our bill would increases the national commitment to basic research by \nnearly doubling research funding for the National Science Foundation \n(NSF) by FY 2011. The National Science Foundation plays a critical role \nin underwriting basic research at colleges, universities, and other \ninstitutions throughout our nation.\n  NSF supported basic research in chemistry, physics, nanotechnology, \nand semiconductor manufacturing has brought about some of the most \nsignificant innovations of the last 20 years. For example, the World \nWide Web, magnetic resonance imaging and fiber optics technology all \nemerged through basic research projects that received NSF funding.\n  Because our nation's long-term future economic strength depends in \nlarge part on the support we give to basic research projects now, the \nNational Innovation bill also establishes the Innovation Acceleration \nGrants Program, which encourages Federal agencies funding research in \nscience, technology, engineering, and mathematics to allocate at least \n3 percent of\n\n[[Page S13664]]\n\ntheir Research and Development (R) budgets to grants directed toward \nhigh-risk frontier research.\n  Three percent of overall R budgets from federal agencies may not \nseem like a lot, but this is an important starting point. Although our \nbill does not specifically require it, I encourage federal agencies \nengaged in R to dedicate an even greater percentage of their budgets \nto basic research.\n  Along with strategic investment in the innovation economy, the \nFederal Government also needs to examine various barriers that impede \ninnovation in the United States.\n  Our bill instructs the National Academy of Sciences to study factors \nsuch as tort litigation that may impede American businesses from \nengaging in innovation risk-taking and provide recommendations on how \nbest to address these issues. Litigation, taxation, and the substantial \ncosts of regulatory compliance impact innovation and need to be \naddressed.\n  Innovation must be a major priority as the United States looks to \nretain and strengthen its economic leadership and national security in \nthe 21st Century. The National Innovation Act will help ensure that the \nFederal Government does exactly that by increasing research investment, \nincreasing science and technology talent, and developing an innovation \ninfrastructure.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2109\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States is the most innovative Nation in the \n     world. Since our Nation's founding, exploration, opportunity, \n     and discovery have remained essential to fulfilling our \n     Nation's strategic economic and political objectives.\n       (2) In the 21st century, a well-educated and trained \n     workforce, investment in research and development, and a \n     regulatory and physical infrastructure that supports \n     innovators are essential to ensuring that the United States \n     continues to lead the global economy on innovation.\n       (3) America's future economic and national security will \n     largely depend on the creativity and commitment of our Nation \n     to unleash its innovation capacity.\n       (4) The world has become dramatically more interconnected \n     and competitive. Cutting edge research, world-class \n     education, and highly skilled labor pools are no longer \n     within the sole purview of the United States.\n       (5) The United States investment in basic research is \n     currently insufficient to meet the challenges we face.\n       (6) Federal support for basic research in the physical \n     sciences has consistently lagged behind that given to the \n     life sciences in recent years.\n       (7) Traditional measurements of innovation capacity focused \n     solely on inputs, such as research and development spending, \n     number of patents and value of physical infrastructure. The \n     traditional measurements are necessary but are not sufficient \n     metrics for innovation in the 21st century's knowledge \n     economy.\n       (8) Current Federal budget constraints require \n     prioritization of spending and new programs must be funded \n     through existing funds or through identifiable funding \n     offsets whenever possible.\n       (9) A national, private sector-led, and government \n     supported plan is required if the United States is to \n     adequately respond to the challenges of increased global \n     competition and take advantage of the opportunities this \n     changing global dynamic presents.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n       (1) make innovation a fundamental economic priority for the \n     United States;\n       (2) create the most fertile policy environment for \n     innovation to occur;\n       (3) develop greater numbers of American scientists, \n     mathematicians, and engineers;\n       (4) enhance the quality of math and science education at \n     all levels;\n       (5) increase the Federal Government's investment in basic \n     research, especially in the physical sciences;\n       (6) direct greater funding toward multidisciplinary and \n     frontier research where tomorrow's innovations are most \n     likely to occur;\n       (7) secure a strong advanced manufacturing base in the \n     United States to ensure that as innovations occur, America is \n     poised to reap the benefits via the creation of new jobs and \n     investment; and\n       (8) examine both the incentives for, and barriers to, \n     innovation to better understand what additional policy \n     changes are warranted.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, today I rise with my colleague Senator \nEnsign to introduce the National Innovation Act, S. 2105. This Act is \nabout building a new century of progress and prosperity for our Nation \nby spurring a new wave of American innovation--better known around the \nworld as ``American ingenuity.''\n  Our Nation was founded by innovators. Washington, Jefferson, Franklin \nand many of our other Founding Fathers not only created a new republic, \nbut in their spare time were inveterate experimenters and inventors, as \nwell, who believed that innovation would be important to the growth and \nsecurity of their new nation.\n  The generations that followed took up the call. Whitney, Bell, \nEdison, Fulton, Morse, Ford, Colt, the Wrights--I don't even have to \nsay their first names and you know who they are and what they did.\n  Now we face a new century with new challenges--a global age where \ncompetition can come as easily from across an ocean as from across the \nstreet. We got a wake up call earlier this week about how tough the \nchallenge is when it was announced that China had overtaken the United \nStates as the world's largest exporter of high-tech products. According \nto statistics released by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \nDevelopment (OECD), China shipped $180 billion worth of such goods \nworldwide last year, exceeding U.S. exports valued at $149 billion. \nEven more significant, however, is the fact that the historical \nparadigm, one that has fueled much of our economic growth in the \ntechnology sector in this country, is quickly changing. China now \nimports far fewer components for tech goods, choosing instead to \nproduce them itself. The OECD noted that between 2000 and 2004, the \nU.S. and EU shares of China's total imports in such components dropped \nfrom 27 to 12 percent. Instead of relying solely on its lower labor and \nproduction costs to assemble high-tech goods from components produced \nin places like the United States and Europe, China increasingly does it \nall itself now. Chinese scientists now develop many of the newest \ntechnologies. Their engineers now design the latest cutting-edge \nproducts, and their factories continue to assemble and spit out the \ngoods, all the while steadily lowering costs. Many of the people \ninvolved are educated here or in Europe, though even that is changing, \nin part due to our restrictive immigration policies and technology \ntransfer rules. If this continues unabated, the highest-end and best-\npaying jobs, key to the innovation-driven economy, could be found in \nShanghai and not in American tech centers.\n  In May of 2004, I released a White Paper on the topic of outsourcing. \nWhen I issued that White Paper, I stated that the first thing we should \ndo was to stop blaming others and face the hard facts ourselves. Since \nthat time, there are even more hard facts we need to face, including \nthe statistics I just mentioned, all of which point to the urgent need \nfor action if the American economy is going to adapt to the fundamental \nchanges and growing competition in the global economy. Forrester \nResearch Inc., a Cambridge, MA research firm that has been studying \nthis issue, has estimated that by 2015, 3.3 million high-tech and \nservice industry jobs will move overseas. Deloitte Consulting has \nestimated that approximately 2 million jobs in the financial services \nsector, which signifies nearly 15 percent of the industry's total, \ncould move overseas in the next five years. But even more importantly, \nwe are not just losing jobs. I fear we are beginning to lose critical \npieces of our innovation infrastructure, and with them, our competitive \nedge in the global marketplace. What we always believed was our \nnation's ultimate competitive advantage--our high-end R and \ntechnological prowess--is increasingly under siege. I said in 2004, the \noutsourcing of jobs is just the tip of an economic iceberg that America \nis sailing towards. If the most recent statistics tell us anything, \nit's that we are even closer to that iceberg than ever before.\n  Luckily, these developments have not gone unnoticed. Earlier this \nyear, the Council on Competitiveness--drawing on the insights of many \nexperts from industry and academia, and led by Sam Palmisano of IBM and \nWayne Clough of Georgia Tech University--circulated a report with \ndetailed recommendations on how to reinvigorate our innovation economy. \nThe National Innovation Act, which Senator Ensign and I are introducing \ntoday, is based on the Council's recommendations. This is a strongly \nbipartisan bill, cosponsored by 16 of our colleagues in the Senate. \nFurther, this bill is wholeheartedly supported by members of the \nbusiness and academic communities in this country, many of whom are \neager to see a reinvigoration of American ingenuity. A few exmples of \nthese supportive statements include the following: George Scalise, \nPresident, Semiconductor Industry Association: ``U.S. leadership in \ntechnology has been the cornerstone of America's\n\n[[Page S13671]]\n\nstrategies for driving economic growth and ensuring national security. \nU.S. leadership is being challenged as never before. The National \nInnovation Act of 2005 addresses a number of the most critical issues \ninvolving technology leadership, especially those related to federal \nsupport for basic research. . . . We are especially pleased to support \na bipartisan approach to ensuring U.S. technology leadership. The \nissues at stake--national security and our standard of living in the \n21st century--are far too important to become entangled in partisan \npolitics.''\n  Nicholas M. Donofrio, Executive Vice President, IBM Corporation: \n``IBM applauds the introduction of the National Innovation Act of 2005 \n. . . Innovation underpins American economic growth and national \nsecurity. In today's era of global opportunity and change, the rewards \nflow to those who innovate and turn disruptive shifts to their \nadvantage. America has a long, proud history of recognizing when change \nis required and rising to the challenge. We are at such an inflection \npoint today. The National Innovation Act of 2005 will create synergies \namong America's academic, business and government communities to ensure \nthe future growth of the United States. I urge all Senators to support \nthis legislation.''\n  Deborah L. Wince-Smith, President, Council on Competitiveness: ``On \nbehalf of the Council's 180 CEOs, university presidents and labor \nleaders, I applaud the Senators' efforts and desire to ensure the \nUnited States remains the most competitive economic power in the world. \nWe must, as a nation, innovate to compete and to prosper. This \nlegislation is a critical step forward towards that goal.''\n  Dave McCurdy, CEO, Electronic Industries Association: ``EIA is \nthrilled by today's introduction of the National Innovation Act of 2005 \n(NIA), which includes so many measures that can help the U.S. remain an \neconomic leader in the global high-tech economy. It is an ambitious \npiece of legislation that spans the policy spectrum, but with the \ncommitment and support of policymakers from both sides of the aisle, we \nhope to see these important provisions quickly begin to take effect and \nfuel the U.S. innovation engine.''\n  John J. Castellani, President, Business Roundtable: ``On behalf of \nBusiness Roundtable, an association of 160 chief executive officers of \nAmerica's leading companies, I applaud Senator Ensign and Senator \nLieberman for their leadership on this critical issue. Maintaining our \ncompetitive edge in today's world economy is a top priority of the \nbusiness community, and the National Innovation Act of 2005 is an \nimportant step in the right direction.''\n\n  The list of organizations and companies that have already endorsed \nthis bill includes many of the major players in the field, companies \nand organizations working to keep America at the cutting edge of \ntechnology development, including the following: American Chemical \nSociety, American Mathematical Society, ASTRA (Alliance for Science & \nTechnology Research in America), Athena Alliance, Bell South, Business \nRoundtable, Center for Accelerating Innovation, Computing Research \nAssociation, Council on Competitiveness, Council of Scientific Society \nPresidents, Electronic Industries Alliance, Federation of American \nScientists, IBM, IEEEE-USA, Progressive Policy Institute, Semiconductor \nIndustry Association, SEMI North America, and TechNet. In addition, \nmany academic institutions and organizations support our bill because \nthey recognize the importance of expanding education in science, math, \nand engineering. We have received strong indications of support from \nthe academic community, including the Association of American \nUniversities (AAU), the Council of Graduate Schools (CGS) and Georgia \nInstitute of Technology.\n  While I won't describe every provision of this far-reaching bill \ntoday, a section-by-section summary accompanies this statement in the \nRecord, I will say that the National Innovation Act addresses three \nbroad categories--talent, investment, and infrastructure--all of which \nare key to America's regaining our competitive position among our \ntrading partners.\n  Number one, Talent: Innovation requires the incubation of curious \nminds. That means we absolutely must educate and train our science and \nengineering talent base that is essential to our continued global \neconomic leadership.\n  The number of jobs that require technical training is increasing at \nfive times the rate of other occupations. To encourage more students to \nenter these technical professions, our legislation increases Federal \nsupport for graduate fellowships and trainee programs in science, math, \nand engineering by more than $800 million over 5 years. Specifically, \nthe legislation expands the National Science Foundation's (NSF) \nGraduate Research Fellowship Program by 1,250 fellowships and extends \nthe length of each fellowship from 3 to 5 years. These fellowships are \nportable fellowships which afford students the greatest flexibility in \nchoosing graduate programs that fit their needs and interests. The \nlegislation also expands the NSF Integrated Graduate Education and \nResearch Traineeship (IGERT) program by 1,250 new traineeships. In the \nIGERT program, grants are awarded to universities to develop cross-\ndisciplinary training programs for students in areas including science, \nmath, engineering, and policy.\n  The legislation also expands upon existing Department of Defense \nefforts and creates new programs in order to encourage more students to \nenter the fields of science, math, and engineering. Specifically, \nprovisions are included to expand the Defense Department Science, \nMathematics, and Research for Transformation (SMART) scholarship \nprogram by $41.3 million per year over five years and to expand the \nNational Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship program by \n$45 million per year over five years. A new competitive traineeship \nprogram, which will initially include 80 students, is created to \nprovide interdisciplinary training in science and engineering to \nstudents who are encouraged to work for at least ten years in the \nDepartment of Defense after graduation.\n\n  This legislation also supports new and existing Professional Science \nMaster's degree programs. These Master's programs typically try to \nprovide cross-disciplinary training within the science, math, and \nengineering disciplines, and also to couple traditional technical \ndisciplines with business, entrepreneurial, and business law training. \nGraduates of these programs will comprise a cadre of technical \nprofessionals with broad skills in both business and science that will \ngive our industry an edge.\n  If we are to develop talent at the graduate levels, we must also \nemphasize science, math, and engineering at the K-12 and undergraduate \nlevels. The results from the International Student Assessment of 2003 \nshowed that U.S. 15-year-olds performed below the international average \nin math and science literacy. In order to bolster our highly-skilled \nscience and engineering workforce, we must improve performance in our \nelementary, middle, and high schools.\n  Recognizing that new approaches must be realized, this legislation \nestablishes a grant program of $10 million in 2007 and $20 million in \n2008 and 2009 to help primary and secondary schools develop new \nexperientially-based teaching techniques in math and science. It \nfurther addresses the issue of improving talent in scientific \ndisciplines by expanding the existing Technology Talent program to the \nscope originally intended. The Technology Talent program provides \ncompetitive grants to undergraduate universities to develop new methods \nof increasing the number of students earning degrees in science, math, \nand engineering. It is essential that we increase the number of college \ngraduates with the skills to contribute to the science and technology \nworkforce, yet this program has never been fully funded.\n  Number two, Investment: Great ideas need research money if they are \nto move from imagination to market. But, federal R spending as a \npercentage of GDP has been in steady decline since the mid-1960s. It is \nless than half of what it was then. This bill bolsters the mission of \nthe National Science Foundation (NSF) by more than doubling its \nresearch budget from $4.8 billion in 2004 to nearly $10 billion in \n2011. Support for NSF is essential as it funds the full range of \nscientific disciplines and it encourages multidisciplinary approaches \nto problem solving. When it was created in 1950, Congress envisioned \nNSF as one of the primary catalysts for research ``to promote the \nprogress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and \nwelfare; [and] to secure the national defense.'' In order for NSF to \ncontinue to meet our tremendous needs in all these areas, which notably \nremain as vital today as they did back then, it needs more funding. At \nthe same time, we must recognize that we, as a country,\n\n[[Page S13672]]\n\nface difficult choices in how we allocate our resources. Hard choices \nmay have to be made, but we cannot avoid the reality that an investment \nsuch as the increase in NSF's research budget that our bill calls for \ntoday, is absolutely necessary if we are to generate the talent base we \nneed to remain competitive. It is my belief that this investment will \npay vast dividends in the long run for the American people and for the \nAmerican economy. I also believe we will pay dearly if this investment \nis not made soon.\n  Congress is making steady progress toward finding reasonable ways to \naccommodate the needs of our five major research agencies. Our bill \nconcentrates on two agencies: we double the authorization for NSF and \nwe ask the Department of Defense (DOD) to spend 3 percent of its budget \non science and technology, DOD's 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3, programs consistent \nwith Defense Science Board recommendations. The research budget for \nlife sciences at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has been \ndoubled in recent years and this legislation attempts to bring research \nin the physical sciences up to the same high level of funding. A major \nincrease for NASA science research is now under consideration in \nconference and the Congress passed a significant increase in the \nauthorization for Energy Department Science research as part of the \nenergy bill this summer. So, our bill addresses the remaining top R \nagencies--NSF and DOD.\n  Our bill also creates an ``Innovation Acceleration Grants'' program \nto stimulate high-risk research by urging federal research agencies to \nallocate at least 3 percent of their current R budget to breakthrough \nresearch--the kind of research that gave us fiber optics, the Internet \nand countless other technologies relied on every day in this country \nand around the world. We anticipate this funding would be used for \n``grand challenges,'' for what is sometimes referred to as \n``connected'' or ``translational'' research, which moves from \nfundamental discoveries through the development and procurement stages. \nWe also anticipate that agencies would step outside the peer review \napproach, which can be too cautious, and empower talented program \nmanagers to drive novel and promising ideas forward. While it doesn't \nmandate that these agencies spend at least 3 percent of their budgets \non high-risk frontier research projects, this provision sets a \nrealistic and reasonable strategic goal. It is our hope and expectation \nthat agencies will view the 3 percent allocation as a starting point \nand will take the initiative to expand from there. The Innovation \nAcceleration Grants program is designed to be a streamlined mechanism \nto support those grants that are making progress and not support those \nthat are floundering. The program has built-in and specially-designed \nmetrics to ensure that granting agencies closely monitor the projects \nthey support, renewing those with strong performance and phasing out \nthose that don't show enough real promise for the types of cutting-edge \nadvancements that are truly innovative. It is important that it is \ndesigned in this manner because a cautious approach to these issues \ncannot work. In order to face the challenge, we need to take risks and \nbe patient. However, in an environment of increasingly tight fiscal \npressures, we also must recognize that risk taking can, and often does, \nlead to dead ends. While many high-risk projects may fail, those that \nsucceed can bring tremendous benefit. The urgency of the threats we \nface today warrants a balanced approach. We must continue to encourage \nthe groundbreaking experimentation, tinkering and longer-term outlook \nthat made this country great. But we also must continue to take stock \nof our progress and make sure we are heading toward the ultimate goal \nof reestablishing the foundational elements of our tremendous successes \nover the last 50 years, and more.\n\n  Switching gears briefly, I think it is also important to note that \nthe government cannot do this alone. The private sector in this country \nneeds to continue to lead the charge. Private sector investment in \nresearch in this country, after a sharp rise in the 90's, has been \neroding in recent years in part because companies have moved some R \noperations outside the United States. About $17 billion a year in R \nnow flows overseas to nations like China and India. And as that \nresearch money leaves our shores, the high-skilled 21st century jobs we \nneed to compete sail away with them.\n  Our bill tries to help stem the tide by making the current Research \nand Experimentation (R) tax credit permanent and extending it to a \ngreater number of enterprises; the same provision that appears in the \nInvest in America Act of 2005, sponsored by Senators Hatch and Baucus \nwith 44 bipartisan cosponsors. These two Senators deserve the credit on \nthis. We are simply trying to emphasize their efforts. Making the \ncredit permanent allows our private entrepreneurial spirit to continue \nto drive the economic growth of this great nation and at the same time \nensures that other countries like China do not lure away our talent and \ninvestment, and ultimately the innovation that comes from them. It \ngives our companies a powerful and reliable long-term incentive to \ninclude domestic R as a significant component of their strategic \nplans. Since the original enactment of the research credit in 1981, a \npublic-private partnership has developed, through which the federal \ngovernment has worked with businesses of all sizes to ensure that \nresearch expenditures continue to be made here in the United States. \nThe reward has been the creation of many innovative technologies, well-\npaying jobs, and an increased growth rate in our economy. The \nimportance of this effort cannot be understated.\n  At the same time that firms are investing more money in R, they \nmust improve their ability to manage the technological innovations that \nresult from this research. The emerging area of ``service science'' \nrefers to both research and training regimens that are now starting to \ndevelop and to teach individuals how to apply technology to solving \ncomplex problems in the service and industrial sector. Eighty percent \nof our economy is service-based, yet we do very little R in this \narea. We now face intense service competition from countries like \nIndia, taking advantage of global IT systems. If we don't improve our \nservices productivity, increasingly we won't be able to compete. This \nlegislation asks the Director of the National Science Foundation to \nconduct a study for Congress on how the federal government should best \nsupport service science through research, education, and training.\n  Number three, Infrastructure: Once we have helped assure the \neducation foundation to give people the basic skills they need to use \ntheir creativity, and the resources they need to support their \nexperimentation, we must then reinvent and transform our manufacturing \nprocesses and technologies so that we can secure the gains from the \nfruits of all this labor. In this era of tough international \ncompetition, if we don't manufacture the goods we innovate here in the \nU.S., we will forfeit our global economic leadership and our children's \nprosperity to other nations who can. To help facilitate this important \ngoal, our legislation takes several steps.\n  First, the bill authorizes creates federally-funded and complementary \nadvanced manufacturing programs at the Departments of Commerce and \nDefense. The development and implementation of state-of-the-art \nadvanced manufacturing systems does not happen overnight, nor can it be \ndone alone. The goal of this new program is to, again, establish a \npublic-private R partnership which enables risk taking and creativity \nto generate new processes and technologies. These new processes and \ntechnologies will give us the productivity breakthroughs we need to \nmaintain our manufacturing competitiveness. I continue to believe in \nthe spirit of American ingenuity--if given the chance and the tools to \nsucceed, we will. This legislation also creates the Test Beds of \nExcellence program, which is designed test and refine these new \nprocesses and technologies in a real manufacturing setting once they \nhave been developed. Then, we ask the Manufacturing Extension Program \nto help disseminate this new innovative knowledge throughout to \nmanufacturing base, including to the many small and mid-sized companies \nthat will be key to our growth. The Test Beds program is a competitive \none and, as in the case of the Innovation Acceleration Grants program \nand other important features of this legislation, it\n\n[[Page S13673]]\n\nis designed to self-scrutinize and adapt to the constantly changing \nneeds of our manufacturing sector.\n  In addition to the effort at the Department of Commerce, our bill \nasks the Department of Defense to work with the private sector to \nidentify and accelerate the transition of advanced manufacturing \ntechnologies and processes that will enable us to maintain our \ntechnological edge on the battlefield. The Department of Defense relies \non innovation, and the bill seeks to expand the Department's \ntraditional manufacturing sector work in this area. An additional \nmotivating factor within the Department of Defense is the inherent \nsecurity risk associated with using certain overseas suppliers. \nAmerican manufacturing must remain competitive in order to meet the \nneeds of our military in a timely fashion.\n\n  These steps will go a long way toward revitalizing our manufacturing \nsystem into a system that is seamlessly integrated with our other \nefforts to boost American innovation through education and research.\n  Our bill goes further, recognizing that innovation fundamentally \noccurs not at the national level, but at the local and regional levels. \nCertainly there are many lessons to be learned from the rise of Silicon \nValley and other similar regions that have sprung up all over this \ncountry as centers for high-tech growth. Our competitors, China, India, \nIsrael and many others, have already begun to emulate the success we \nhave achieved in this way. These clusters have developed in areas of \nthe country where educational and research institutions, together with \ncreative elements of the private sector, have partnered to create an \nenvironment conducive to innovation. Our bill encourages the \ndevelopment of more regional clusters (``hot spots'') of technology \ninnovation throughout the United States. These hot spots spur growth in \nlocal economies and also contribute to progress on a national scale. We \ndon't try to impose these from above, from the national level. These \nmust start at the local level to work. But, the federal government can \nhelp local communities identify successful models and the right \nmetrics. The Secretary of Commerce will publish a ``Guide to Developing \nSuccessful Regional Innovation Hot Spots'' in order to share successful \nstrategies in the formation and development of regional clusters.\n  Finally, it is imperative that the executive branch take a strong \nrole in leading and coordinating the broad initiative outlined in this \nlegislation. To help guide progress in all three of the important areas \nI have outlined, this bill creates a President's Council on Innovation. \nThe goal of the President's Council is to develop a comprehensive \nnational innovation agenda and coordinate all federal efforts related \nto this agenda. In consultation with the Office of Management and \nBudget, this Council would develop and use metrics to assess the impact \nof existing and proposed laws that affect innovation in the United \nStates. In addition, the Council would help to coordinate the various \nfederal efforts that must be spread among many agencies that support \ninnovation, and it would submit an annual report to the President and \nto the Congress on how the Federal Government can best support \ninnovation. This effort cries out for much better coordination and \ncollaboration than exist now. Why the White House? These issues must be \naddressed at the highest levels and in a decisive and organized way to \nachieve success.\n  The National Innovation Act is organized into five titles, \nintentionally reflecting the Senate committees of jurisdiction in the \nsubject areas of each title. Title I, ``Innovation Promotion'' falls \nwithin the purview of the Commerce Committee. Title II, dealing with \nscience, education and healthcare programs, covers subjects within the \njurisdiction of the Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee. \nTitle III, providing tax incentives to promote innovation, comes within \nthe Finance Committee jurisdiction. Title IV covers Department of \nDefense programs and would fall within the Armed Services Committee \njurisdiction. Title V, which touches on immigration, patent reform, and \npossible barriers to innovation, would be within the Judiciary \nCommittee purview. The issues of immigration, health care information \ntechnology, and patent reform are reflected in this bill as Sense of \nCongress provisions, because we recognize that the committees of \njurisdiction are already working on and moving in these areas and we \ndon't want to get in their way. However, the bill cites these moving \nissues to mark the importance of considering how legislation on these \nissues may affect our economy's ability to remain competitive. The \nprovision for an objective National Academy study on barriers to \ninnovation would allow Congress to understand how legal and numerous \nother structural aspects of the U.S. economy may affect our ability to \nbe innovative.\n  From the 18th century Franklin stove to the 20th century personal \ncomputer, the United States has long been the leader in the technology \nand innovation that created jobs, wealth, and an ever-increasing \nstandard of living for our people. We call it American ingenuity. It's \ntime to take that native ingenuity and build a new century of progress \nfor America.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section analysis of the \nNational Innovation Act, a short summary of the legislation, and \nstatements of support for this legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      National Innovation Act of 2005 Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n                     TITLE I--INNOVATION PROMOTION\n\n     Sec. 101. President's Council on Innovation\n       The President shall create a Council on Innovation \n     comprised of heads of various executive agencies including \n     Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy, and others. The \n     Council, which will be chaired by the Secretary of Commerce, \n     will have oversight over legislative proposals and executive \n     branch initiatives for promoting innovation. Specifically, \n     the Council will develop a process for using metrics to \n     evaluate existing and proposed innovation policies and make \n     recommendations to heads of executive agencies on \n     improvements to innovation policies. In addition, the Council \n     shall develop a comprehensive agenda for strengthening \n     innovation among the Federal Government, states, academia, \n     and the private sector. The Council will submit an annual \n     report to the President and the Congress on its activities.\n     Sec. 102. Innovation Acceleration Grants\n       The President will establish the ``Innovation Acceleration \n     Grants Program'' to promote and accelerate innovation in the \n     United States. Each executive agency that currently funds \n     research and development (R) in science, mathematics, \n     engineering, and technology shall have a goal to commit at \n     least 3% of its existing annual R budget to this program. \n     Each such executive agency will also submit detailed plans \n     for the implementation and evaluation of the program within \n     the agency. The plans shall include metrics upon which grant \n     funding decisions will be made and upon which the success of \n     the grants awarded will be assessed. Grants shall be issued \n     for a maximum period of three years (with possibility of \n     renewal for another three years) and shall be awarded to \n     projects that propose a novel approach to address fundamental \n     technological challenges. The agency head may grant further \n     renewals to programs requiring an extended timeframe to \n     complete critical research to the extent they satisfy metrics \n     developed to ensure their ongoing usefulness. Granting \n     agencies are responsible for evaluation of all projects \n     sponsored and for publishing such reviews.\n     Sec. 103. A national commitment to basic research\n       Authorizations are provided to nearly double NSF research \n     funding from Fiscal Year 2007 through Fiscal Year 2011. \n     Within 180 days of enactment, the Director of the National \n     Science Foundation shall submit to Congress a detailed plan \n     for the use of these funds. The plan shall focus on means by \n     which basic research in science and engineering will optimize \n     the United States economy for global competition and \n     leadership in productive innovation.

In responding to the report, this \n     legislation focuses on three primary areas of importance to \n     maintaining and improving United States' innovation in the \n     21st Century: (1) research investment, (2) increasing science \n     and technology talent, and (3) developing an innovation \n     infrastructure. This bill: Establishes the President's \n     Council on Innovation to develop a comprehensive agenda to \n     promote innovation in the public and private sectors. In \n     consultation with the Office of Management and Budget, this \n     Council would develop and use metrics to assess the impact of \n     existing and proposed laws that affect innovation in the \n     United States. In addition, the Council would help to \n     coordinate the various federal efforts that support \n     innovation, and use metrics to assess the performance of the \n     federal innovation programs located in different \n     administrative agencies, and submit an annual report to the \n     President and to the Congress on how the Federal Government \n     can best support innovation.\n\n\n                          Research Investment\n\n       Establishes the Innovation Acceleration Grants Program \n     which encourages federal agencies funding research in science \n     and technology to allocate 3% of their Research and \n     Development (R) budgets to grants directed toward high-risk \n     frontier research. Although this provision sets 3% of R \n     budgets as a strategic goal for allocation to high-risk \n     frontier research projects, it does not mandate that the \n     agencies spend at least 3% of their budgets in this manner. \n     All grants provided to this program will be assessed with \n     metrics and no grants will be renewed unless the agency \n     distributing the\n\n[[Page S13676]]\n\n     grant determines that all metrics have been satisfied.\n       Increases the national commitment to basic research by \n     nearly doubling research funding for the National Science \n     Foundation (NSF) by FY 2011.\n       Makes permanent the Research and Experimentation (R) tax \n     credit with modifications expanding eligibility for \n     incentives to a greater number of firms.\n\n\n                     Science and Technology Talent\n\n       Expands existing educational programs in the physical \n     sciences and engineering by increasing funding for NSF \n     graduate research fellowship programs as well as Department \n     of Defense science and engineering scholarship programs. \n     These fellowships provide an incentive for more American \n     students to pursue post-graduate degrees in the sciences, \n     technology, engineering, or mathematics.\n       Authorizes the Department of Defense to create a \n     competitive traineeship program for undergraduate and \n     graduate students in defense science and engineering that \n     focuses on multidisciplinary learning and innovation-oriented \n     studies.\n       Authorizes funding for new and existing Professional \n     Science Master's Degree Programs to increase the number of \n     qualified scientists and engineers entering the workforce.\n\n\n                       Innovation Infrastructure\n\n       Authorizes the Department of Commerce to promote the \n     development and implementation of state-of-the-art advanced \n     manufacturing systems and to support up to three Pilot Test \n     Beds of Excellence for such systems. The Secretary of \n     Commerce will conduct a competition to select the Pilot Test \n     Beds based on objective criteria and metrics.\n       Encourages the development of regional clusters (``hot \n     spots'') of technology innovation throughout the United \n     States.\n       Empowers the Department of Defense to identify and \n     accelerate the transition of advanced manufacturing \n     technologies and processes that will improve productivity of \n     the defense manufacturing base.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  Major Organizations Support the NIA\n\n       ``U.S. leadership in technology has been the cornerstone of \n     America's strategies for driving economic growth and ensuring \n     national security. U.S. leadership is being challenged as \n     never before. The National Innovation Act of 2005 addresses a \n     number of the most critical issues involving technology \n     leadership, especially those related to federal support for \n     basic research. . . . We are especially pleased to support a \n     bipartisan approach to ensuring U.S. technology leadership. \n     The issues at stake--national security and our standard of \n     living in the 21st century--are far too important to become \n     entangled in partisan politics.''--George Scalise, President, \n     Semiconductor Industry Association.\n       ``Nothing can do more for the U.S. economy and to help \n     ensure America's global competitiveness than an enhanced \n     focus on innovation and research by the public and private \n     sectors.

We commend your \n     leadership in developing the NIA and look forward to working \n     with you to support enactment of this important legislation.\n       Our Nation has reached a critical juncture unprecedented in \n     our history. While our Nation continues to be the world's \n     leader in many technological and scientific discoveries and \n     breakthroughs, other nations are\n\n[[Page S13677]]\n\n     working to create their own innovation infrastructure. These \n     efforts range from tax incentives to attract new research and \n     development to increased investments in math and science \n     education. In short, with so many countries recognizing R's \n     economic development potential, the U.S. can no longer take \n     its current leading position for granted, nor accept the \n     status quo as sufficient to stay competitive.\n       Not surprisingly, these were the same observations and \n     conclusions reached by those leaders in business and academia \n     who came together to produce Innovate America, the National \n     Innovation Initiative Report, which was released this year by \n     the Council on Competitiveness. This report produced a series \n     of recommendations that collectively represent landmarks on a \n     roadmap leading toward a nation better equipped and educated \n     to both innovate and compete in a global economy.\n       We are pleased to see a substantial number of these \n     recommendations embodied in the NIA. Your legislation clearly \n     recognizes that changes are needed in a wide range of areas: \n     reforms in tax policy; federal investments in elementary and \n     secondary education; scholarship and grant availability for \n     university graduate and undergraduate students; federal \n     research priorities; intellectual property protection; and \n     critical areas in our innovation infrastructure, including \n     health care and our armed forces.\n       The depth and diversity of the issues covered in the NIA \n     demonstrate the complexity and the enormity of the \n     fundamental challenge that confronts us: the economic \n     security and competitiveness of our Nation.\n       We stand ready to work with you to move this important \n     legislation forward and thank you for your shared commitment \n     to the Nation's future innovative capacity and capability.\n           Sincerely,\n         Jim Barksdale, Partner, Barksdale Management Corporation, \n           Co-Founder, TechNet; John Chambers, President & CEO, \n           Cisco Systems, Inc., Co-Founder, TechNet; John Doerr, \n           Partner, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Co-Founder, \n           TechNet; James Breyer, Managing Partner, Accel \n           Partners; Ronald Conway, Founder & General Partner, \n           Angel Investors, LP; Carol Bartz, Chairman, President & \n           CEO, Autodesk, Inc.; Jesse Devitte, Managing Director, \n           Borealis Ventures; Henry Samueli, Chairman & CTO, \n           Broadcom Corporation; Gary Lauer, Chairman & CEO, \n           eHealthInsurance; Craig R.

This legislation responds directly to \n     the outstanding set of recommendations made by the Council on \n     Competitiveness for much needed improvements in our Nation's \n     ability to innovate and compete globally.\n       The Council's report, like subsequent reports by the \n     National Academies and a host of business and academic \n     organizations, makes a powerful case that the Nation's \n     ability to compete effectively in the 21st century is under \n     serious threat. That threat is posed largely by continuing \n     underinvestment in fundamental research and our growing \n     weakness in producing scientists, engineers, and others with \n     the technological skills needed for the workforce of the \n     future.\n       The proposals contained in the National Innovation Act \n     represent a critical step toward strengthening the Nation's \n     innovation infrastructure for the 21st century. Among other \n     things, the measure would create a Presidential Council on \n     Innovation, authorize doubling research funding at the \n     National Science Foundation by FY 2011, expand graduate \n     fellowships and traineeships, and encourage federal research \n     agencies to devote three percent of their research and \n     development budgets to ``high-risk frontier research.''\n       The legislation not only addresses the Council's \n     recommendations but also reflects what has become a consensus \n     among the nation's business and academic communities \n     concerning actions we must take to ensure our future global \n     competitiveness and our national security. It is the hope of \n     AAU and the 60 leading U.S. research universities that \n     comprise its membership that Congress will begin acting on \n     these proposals at the earliest possible date.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  Council of Graduate Schools,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 14, 2005.\n     Hon.

The Council of Graduate Schools (CGS) and its \n     450 plus member institutions are very grateful for your \n     leadership in addressing the important issue of strengthening \n     American competitiveness and for your recognition of the role \n     of graduate education in this process.\n       We are especially supportive of the National Innovation \n     Act's provisions related to science and technology talent and \n     the strong emphasis on graduate education contained in \n     Sections 201, 202, 203 and 402 of the bill. We are \n     specifically supportive of the following provisions:\n       Increased funding for the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship \n     and Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship \n     program;\n       Authorization of funds for new and existing Professional \n     Science Master's Degree programs to increase the number of \n     qualified scientists and engineers entering the workforce \n     and;\n       Authorization of a competitive traineeship program for \n     undergraduate and graduate students in defense science and \n     engineering focusing on multidisciplinary learning and \n     innovation-oriented studies, and extension of the SMART \n     program supporting additional participants pursuing doctoral \n     and master's degrees in key fields.\n       Supporting graduate education is critical to achieving the \n     highly skilled workforce needed for the U.S. to compete \n     effectively in the 21st century global economy. Thank you for \n     your leadership in this important policy matter. The Council \n     of Graduate Schools looks forward to working with you to \n     implement this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Debra W.

A bill to amend the Endangered Species Act of 1973 to \nenhance the role of States in the recovery of endangered species and \nthreatened species, to implement a species conservation recovery \nsystem, to establish certain recovery programs, to provide Federal \nfinancial assistance and a system of incentives to promote the recovery \nof species, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Collaboration \nfor the Recovery of the Endangered Species Act, or CRESA. Over the \nyears, this body and the Nation as a whole have fiercely debated the \nmerits of the Endangered Species Act. But there is one fundamental \nconcept on which we all agree--saving endangered species is essential.\n  We have 30 years of experience with the laws that govern species \nmanagement. We know the original intent. We have witnessed the \nstrengths of the Act and its capability and commitment to save species \nfrom extinction. We know about the endless litigation. We have seen \ndisappointingly few species recover. We have lost farms and valuable \nranch land, putting families out of business. Ironically, the biggest \nlosers are the very species we are attempting to recover.\n  However, we have also seen amazing things happen in Idaho, in \nArkansas, Wyoming and in California to name just a few. We have seen \nlandowners, conservationists, local, state and Federal agencies come \ntogether, figure out a workable plan and set about to do the business \nof recovering species. These plans are tried and true--they work, and \nthey need to have the strength of the law behind them.\n  Some ask why the Endangered Species Act needs to be improved. The \nanswer is short--we must apply lessons learned, the most important one \nbeing that collaboration works. Collabortion allows the process to move \nforward. By its very nature, litigation sets one group against \nanother--making them rivals, not partners. Too often we work against \neach other, rather than with and for each other. We need to encourage \nwhat works in order to create the results we all want.\n  The next logical step and what is needed now is a way to facilitate \nthe\n\n[[Page S13678]]\n\nESA in its methods of promoting ongoing species recovery--something \nthat requires collaboration by all--from the marble halls of Federal \nagencies here in Washington to rangeland in rural Idaho and forests of \nArkansas. So, too, in every other state. This is not just a Western \nproblem; the. entire country is searching for effective ways to \naccomplish the goals of the ESA. The good news is that many of these \nvaluable partnerships are in place, functioning very effectively all \nacross our country.\n  Take one example from my home State of Idaho, that of sage grouse \nrecovery. Landowners and conservation groups came together to establish \nstrong conservation programs that respected landowners' rights and \nsatisfied environmental concerns. This collaborative, cooperative \neffort, utilizing the wisdom of those who live and work on the land, \nthe expertise of specialists and those with knowledge of government \nrules and regulations, has been a magnificently successful alternative \nto the perils and dead end road of litigation.\n  Collaboration means more voices. More voices mean more solutions. \nMore solutions mean more options. More options create the best \nsolutions and also bring ownership by all members of the group. \nApplying this method to species recovery and the ESA means that more \npeople will become involved and concerned about recovering species, \nespecially those who bear the direct burden of compliance with the law. \nMore voices bleans greater innovation in the field of species recovery. \nCollaboration decreases conflict, and conflict, as we in this body know \nall too well, usually puts us nowhere.\n  Collaboration works. Our bill codifies these proven solutions to \nprotect them from the dead-end often found in litigation.\n  Why do we need to make a change? It is time to build on lessons \nlearned with regard to species recovery, and our bill will put these \nlessons into concrete, effective action.\n  CRESA accomplishes the goal of species recovery by building on the \nsuccesses of the ESA and by applying valuable lessons learned over the \npast 3 decades.\n  It promotes species restoration and recovery by rewarding landowners \nfor their recovery efforts. Private property rights are guaranteed to \nus by our laws. Cost burdens can be onerous, and landowners should be \nrewarded for recovery efforts under the Endangered Species Act.\n  Laws must first positively reinforce public values and penalize only \nas a last resort. We have had it backward for many years and littered \nin the wake of this travesty are lost family farms and ranches. The old \nadage about the danger of burning bridges is relevant here: much of the \naction driven by existing ESA rules and regulations burns bridges--\nbridges that left intact could bring species across the chasm of \nextinction to recovery.\n  CRESA also promotes flexibility. One lesson learned in the course of \ncreating and implementing the successful species management \npartnerships that I have mentioned today is that it is vital to work at \nthe point of recovery--on the ground, as we tend to say. Working at the \npoint of recovery realizes the benefits of fine-tuning individual \nsolutions to meet specific challenges, but with the greater and broader \ngoal of species recovery. This is flexibility and it cannot be achieved \n2,500 miles from where a species needs restoration. It is on the ground \nthat our resources should be applied.\n  CRESA promotes a freedom of process which encourages flexibility. I \ncannot emphasize how many times I have spoken with Idaho farmers and \nranchers who tell me that, ``that solution might work in the halls of \nCongress--it doesn't work here on my land.'' It is ludicrous to believe \nthat one-size-fits-all in the arena of species recovery. No two \nspecies, topography, environment or human natural resource use are the \nsame, not even in the same county. There are multiple considerations \nthat must be addressed in a cooperative, collaborative manner in order \nto achieve any kind of effectiveness.\n  Private property rights are not the enemy of conservation. Rather, \nthe law can encourage landowners to involve themselves in the process. \nLandowners have a great deal of respect for species. Many of them are \nthe first ones to tell you about the bear they caught sight of in the \ndim light of evening or the early morning grazing of deer in their \nfields. If landowners, especially ranchers and farmers, didn't like \nanimals, they likely wouldn't do what they do. It doesn't make sense.\n  In the same way, environmentalists don't hate people. They, too, live \non land somewhere, and many use the products that large landowners \nproduce for our country: meat, wood, leather, and mining products, to \nname a few. Put in that perspective, it is obvious that working against \none another is futile and counterproductive for people and species. We \nhave innovative solutions that work for both species and people, and we \nneed laws that facilitate this critical flexibility.\n  It is time to come together, sit down at the table and get down to \nthe real matter at hand. We have to, in the words of a good friend who \nknows this issue well, ``concentrate on problem-solving rather than \nideologies.'' While there are great ideological divides on this issue, \nthe ideas for how to solve conservation challenges are not polarized. \nThere is a consensus that there are conservation solutions that can \nbenefit people and species.\n  We have a tremendous responsibility with regard to our valuable \nnatural resources. Growing up and living in Idaho, I cannot fully \nconvey to those who have never seen it the absolute wonder of my \nState's wildlife and land. It is farfetched to imagine that I or anyone \nelse who lives and works this breathtaking setting would want to \ndestroy it. Clearly, this is not just an Idaho issue. There are \nendangered species and wonderful lands in all 50 States and landowners \nnationwide are instrumental to solving the challenge of species \nrecovery and restoration.\n  The Collaboration for the Recovery of Endangered Species Act \nfacilitates this tried and true method of species recovery--species \nrecovery not just for today or next week or next year, but for our \nchildren and grandchildren. I look forward to this bipartisan, \nprogressive approach to species recovery and encourage all of my \ncolleagues to give very careful consideration to this important \nlegislation that we are introducing today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I join with my friend from Idaho as a \ncosponsor to this bill on endangered species. He and I and others have \nworked on this for a good long time. Both of us have been on the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works. We are no longer there, but \nwe started working there. We certainly are excited about the \nopportunity to bring to the floor some ideas that would deal with this \nwhole notion of endangered species.\n  As the Senator has mentioned, all of us support the idea of \ncontinuing to have a program to protect endangered species. That \nconcept is a good one. All of us support that. What we are talking \nabout is a program that would be modernized and reorganized to be able \nto do that in a more efficient way.\n  We have good evidence that the program as it is, is not working. In a \nvery simple way, what we have had is nearly 1,500 species listed. We \nhave had less than a dozen delisted or put back where we want them. The \nemphasis has been on the listing, the emphasis has been on lawsuits, \nand the emphasis has been on disagreements. We should do what we can do \nto bring together the people who are interested. Whether they are \nenvironmentalists, whether they are landowners, whether they are \nnaturalists, whatever, we all have the notion that we want to continue \nto make this program work, and we believe we have some ways to make it \nwork better.\n  As was mentioned, the law is about 30 years old, so it is time to be \nupdated. I agree with the Senator from Oklahoma, we need to review \nprograms as time goes by. What we have learned as they have been in \noperation is we can make them much more effective.\n  There are two things that concern me. One is that there needs to be a \nsubstantial amount and a necessary amount of scientific data and \nscience required for the listing. We have had some experience in \nWyoming with having species listed, and it turns out they were not \nendangered at all. They were not identified properly and, therefore, we \nwent through all of this debate and all of this discussion only to \ndiscover that they were not, in fact, endangered species. So we need to \nhave more\n\n[[Page S13679]]\n\nscience and get into what is necessary to identify an animal or a plant \nas an endangered species.\n  Second, the other challenge is to have a plan for recovery, to have a \nplan for getting cooperation between the landowners and the users and \nall the people who are interested in a way to lead us to recovery.\n  One of our latest experiences in Wyoming and in the western part of \nthe country where we are has been with grizzly bears. Grizzly bears \nwere listed, nearly 20 years ago, as endangered species. The numbers \nthat were set forth in the plan for recovery were reached 15 years ago, \nand we are just now in the process of actually having the recovery and \nthe delisting take place. So we have really lost sight of the goals of \nrecovering species.\n  This is bipartisan language. We will have supporters from both sides \nof the aisle, and there is also an Endangered Species Revision Act that \npassed in the House. So we will have an opportunity when this is passed \nto come together with the House program to put together something that \nwill be amenable and acceptable to both the House and Senate. It is \nbipartisan legislation, as indeed it should be.\n  I am sure we will have hearings, as we should, because there is a lot \nof interest in this issue. As the Senator pointed out, you have them on \nthe east coast and you have them on the west coast and the situations \nare different. This bipartisan language would require recovery goals to \nbe published at the time the species is listed. So there is a plan, and \nwe do not go through this endless proposition. It would make it easier \nto delist them as soon as recovery goals are met, and that should be \nthe purpose of the program.\n  It increases the State's role. This is very important. Many on the \nside of animals as opposed to plants, you have Fish and Wildlife \nService, you have Park Service, you have Forest Service, you have State \ngame and fish, you have State land agencies, so there needs to be a \ngood deal of cooperation.\n  There also, of course, needs to be involvement with landowners who \nare impacted and affected by the plan for listing and the existence of \nthose critters. So that needs to be there.\n  We need to provide incentives for working together. Much of this can \nbe done without a lot of rules and regulations. The sage grouse was \nmentioned. There is a good deal of progress being made there in the \nprivate sector with groups coming together. We can do that.\n  I will not take any more time. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues. It is going to be in the Finance Committee. We hope we can \nhave hearings soon and get this bill on the floor, work with the House, \nand be able to have a successful program put into place so we can \ncontinue to protect endangered species.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAYH:\n  S. 2111. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na credit for small business employee training expenses, to increase the \nexclusion of capital gains from small business stocks, to extend \nexpensing for small businesses, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Small Business \nGrowth Initiative of 2005, which is critical to expanding opportunities \nfor our small businesses to excel in the U.S economy and compete with \nlarger businesses at home and abroad. Our Nation's competitiveness \nhinges on our ability to cultivate the entrepreneurial spirit and \nprovide a policy environment that helps our Nation's job creators start \nor expand small businesses. Since I joined the Small Business Committee \nin 2003, I have redoubled my efforts to help small businesses, and this \nbill represents my latest ideas and work to provide additional \nassistance to the small business community.\n  In my home State of Indiana, small businesses employ nearly 1.3 \nmillion Hoosiers and make up 97.5 percent of all Indiana companies. \nNationwide, small businesses have created between 60 and 80 percent of \nnet new jobs over the last decade. Despite this success, small \nbusinesses are confronted with unique challenges. To understand what \nsmall business owners must overcome to build a successful enterprise, \none need only know that one-third of small businesses fail in the first \n2 years, and about half fail in the first 4 years. To help more small \nbusinesses succeed, my bill is designed to help small businesses train \ntheir employees, increase access to capital, encourage long-term \ninvestments in new technologies and equipment, expand opportunities to \nconduct research and development for the Federal Government, and \nfinally, offer employee retirement plans.\n  The global economy requires that successful small businesses \ncontinually update workers' skills to remain competitive. To meet this \nrequirement, the first section of the bill provides a $1,000 tax credit \nfor training costs per employee for up to five employees. This tax \ncredit can be used for employees to, among other activities, obtain a \nnew job certification, attend a community college course, or attend a \n1-day seminar. Statistics indicate that the U.S. faces a growing skills \ngap in its workforce. With technology playing a critical role in the \neconomy, it is vital that we continually educate workers so that they \nare able to meet the challenges of new and innovative tasks. Companies \nare often reluctant to invest in worker training due to the fear that \nworkers will take their new training to new jobs. This tax credit \nreduces the cost to the employer and provides much-needed support for \nemployers to develop a skilled workforce.\n  Access to capital is critical for emerging small businesses as they \nseek to innovate, create jobs, and create wealth. The second provision \nin this bill provides a significant incentive to individuals and \ncompanies to invest in emerging small businesses, thereby increasing \nthe amount of capital available to small businesses. Specifically, this \nbill provides a zero capital gains rate for long-term individual and \ncorporate investments in small business stock. A 2004 report by the \nCouncil on Competitiveness highlighted small businesses' difficulty in \ntrying to access venture capital. The study found: ``Recently, (the \nfunding gap) has been widening as Venture Capital firms are shifting \ninvestments to focus on more mature firms with larger capital needs. \nEntrepreneurs report difficulty in raising money between $2 million and \n$5 million.''\n  The third section of my bill extends a critical incentive that small \nbusinesses have used to invest in new technologies, expand their \noperations, and most important, create jobs. Under current law, small \nbusinesses can expense--rather than depreciate--up to $100,000 in new \nqualifying machinery or equipment in each year through 2007. My bill \nextends this tax provision through the end of 2010. This will allow \nsmall businesses to enjoy a 5-year planning horizon for new investment. \nIt is difficult for small businesses to make significant investments \nwhen the tax code is riddled with ``here today, gone tomorrow'' \nprovisions. This provision will provide tax savings to small businesses \nand reduce the amount of time that small businesses would otherwise be \nforced to spend complying with complex depreciation rules.\n\n  The fourth section of my bill would expand research and development \nopportunities for small businesses by increasing the amount of federal \nR opportunities available through the Small Business Innovation \nResearch Program, SBIR, and the Small Business Technology Transfer \nProgram, STTR. Small businesses produce 13 to 14 times more patents per \nemployee than large firms. Small business patents are twice as likely \nas large firm patents to be among the 1 percent most cited patents. \nThese programs are critical to expand opportunities for small \nbusinesses to enter the Federal marketplace and in so doing, develop \nnew products that can be commercialized and create new jobs. They play \na major role in helping the government advance cutting-edge research. \nAccording to the Small Business Administration, approximately 1 in 4 \nSBIR projects will result in the sale of new commercial products or \nprocesses.\n  The fifth and final section of my bill is designed to help small \nbusinesses offer employee retirement plans. Too many workers at small \ncompanies do not have the opportunity to contribute to their retirement \nsecurity. Only 31 percent of small businesses with 10 to 24 employees \nprovide retirement plans to their employees. By comparison, 72 percent \nof large firms with 1,000 or more employees provide retirement plan \noptions to their employees. As we\n\n[[Page S13680]]\n\nconsider ways to help small businesses grow and be competitive, it is \nimportant to provide incentives that allow them to recruit and retain \nqualified employees and better compete with larger businesses at home \nand abroad that provide retirement plans for their employees.\n  The problem for small businesses stems, in part, from the \nadministrative costs of starting a retirement plan. To address this \nproblem, my bill doubles the existing tax credit to offset start-up \ncosts associated with setting up new retirement plans. Under this bill, \nsmall companies would be eligible to take a 50 percent credit on the \nfirst $2,000 in approved costs incurred in each of the first 3 years of \na qualified pension plan's existence.\n  In conclusion, small businesses are the engine of our economy and we \nneed to focus attention on advancing policies that help small \nbusinesses grow and prosper. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues on these and other proposals to help our Nation's \nentrepreneurs continue to lead the world in innovation and compete \neffectively with large companies both here and abroad in the global \neconomy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. STABENOW (for herself, Mr. Smith, Mr. Lautenberg, Mrs. \n        Murray, Mr. McCain, Mr. Coleman, and Mr. Dayton):\n  S. 2115. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to improve \nprovisions relating to Parkinson's disease research; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Morris K. \nUdall Parkinson's Disease Research Act Amendments of 2005. I am pleased \nto be joined in this endeavor by my colleague, Senator Smith, who co-\nchairs the Senate Parkinson's Caucus with me, as well as Senators \nMurray, Lautenberg, McCain, and Coleman as co-sponsors.\n  Monday, December 12, marked the anniversary of the death of Mo Udall \nof Arizona, an amazing congressman and champion of the environment who \npassed away from Parkinson's in 1998. In recognition of Congressman \nUdall, Senators Wellstone and McCain introduced the Morris K. Udall \nParkinson's Research Act of 1997, which expanded basic and clinical \nresearch by establishing Udall Centers of Excellence around the nation \nto further scientific advances against Parkinson's.\n  In the United States, an estimated 60,000 new cases are diagnosed \neach year, joining the 1.5 million Americans who currently have \nParkinson's disease. I know first-hand the anguish that a family goes \nthrough when a loved one is struck with this horrible disease as my \ngrandmother had Parkinson's.\n  Top scientists say that Parkinson's is one of the first neurological \ndiseases that could be cured but only if the resources are there. The \nlegislation I am introducing today will help give scientists the tools \nthey need by building on the original Parkinson's Research Act. The \nUdall Act Amendments Act does not call for additional spending. Rather, \nmy bill makes targeted, process-oriented changes to maximize the \nfederal dollars already spent on Parkinson's research.\n  I am also pleased to have the support of the entire Parkinson's \npatient community, including the Parkinson's Action Network, Michael J. \nFox Foundation for Parkinson's Research, Parkinson's Disease \nFoundation, National Parkinson Foundation, Parkinson Alliance, and \nAmerican Parkinson Disease Association.\n  Additionally, I am pleased to have the support of Henry Ford Health \nSystem. Michigan universities and research institutions are leading the \nNation in cutting-edge research into health care, and Henry Ford is \ndoing amazing work in Parkinson's research and epidemiology. The \nWilliam T. Gossett Parkinson's Disease Center at Henry Ford provides \ncomprehensive, experienced, and individualized diagnostic and \ntherapeutic services to patients with Parkinson's disease and other \nmovement disorders. State-of-the-art clinical programs are provided at \nHenry Ford Hospital, the Henry Ford Medical Center in West Bloomfield, \nand the Allen Park Neurology Center.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text the bill and the support \nletters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2115\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Morris K. Udall Parkinson's \n     Disease Research Act Amendments of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. MORRIS K.

Udall Parkinson's Disease Research Act \n         Amendments of 2005.\n\n     Hon. Debbie Stabenow,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stabenow: The Henry Ford Health System \n     strongly supports your legislation which would reauthorize \n     the Morris K. Udall Parkinson's Disease Research Centers and \n     allow an expansion of this important research to other \n     states, including Michigan.\n       The Henry Ford Health System has been engaged in \n     significant Parkinson's Disease research for many years, with \n     published research on linkages between Parkinson's Disease \n     and occupational exposure to lead, copper and agricultural \n     pesticides, as well as life-style going back to 1993. The \n     etiology of Parkinson's Disease is considered to have a \n     strong environmental component, but relatively few studies \n     have investigated the potential association between \n     occupation and the disease. The HFHS research is enriched by \n     our strong clinical and research programs in Neurology, \n     Biostatistics, and Research Epidemiology at the HFHS Health \n     Sciences Center, as well as our formal affiliation with Wayne \n     State University and the National Institute of Environmental \n     Health Sciences Center in Molecular and Cellular Toxicology \n     with Human Applications at WSU.\n       Henry Ford Health System provides healthcare to more than 1 \n     million patients, including approximately 25% of residents in \n     the greater Southeast Michigan region, as well as many \n     patients from virtually every state in the nation. Patients \n     are drawn to Henry Ford Health System because of important \n     advancements in diagnostics and treatment that may not be \n     readily available elsewhere. Because of our ability to \n     combine research with our strong clinical programs, HFHS \n     offers an ideal setting for the kinds of changes called for \n     in this legislation. We believe the intent to focus more of \n     the National Institutes of Health Parkinson's dollars on \n     translational research and therapies will bring a strong \n     return on investment and lead to better treatments for more \n     than one million Americans fighting Parkinson's disease.\n       Thank you for your leadership on this important health care \n     issue. We appreciate your dedication and support for funding \n     the research that can eventually lead to a cure for \n     Parkinson's Disease. We look forward to working with you on \n     this legislation and offer our assistance in achieving the \n     positive changes called for in the Udall Act Amendments.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Nancy M. Schlichting,\n\n     President & CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Parkinson's Action Network,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 1, 2005.\n     Hon. Debbie Stabenow,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Gordon Smith,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stabenow and Senator Smith: The Parkinson's \n     community strongly supports your legislation, the Morris K. \n     Udall Parkinson's Disease Research Act Amendments of 2005.\n       Recognizing the need to accelerate the pace of Parkinson's \n     disease research, Congress passed the Morris K. Udall \n     Parkinson's Research Act of 1997 (Udall Act) and it was \n     signed into law. The Udall Act Amendments builds on the \n     historic 1997 Udall Act to strengthen and focus critical \n     Parkinson's disease research.\n       Your legislation will ensure that NIH-funded research will \n     hasten discovery of better treatments and a cure for \n     Parkinson's disease. We believe the positive changes called \n     for in the Udall Act Amendments will require the NIH to focus \n     more of its Parkinson's dollars on translational research and \n     therapies, recognize the unique aspects of the Udall Centers, \n     and give us a stronger understanding of who is impacted by \n     this devastating disease and why. We are confident that the \n     Udall Act Amendments will ensure that federally-funded \n     Parkinson's disease research brings the strongest return on \n     investment possible and will ultimately lead to better \n     treatments and a cure for the more than one million Americans \n     fighting Parkinson's disease.\n       The Parkinson's community applauds your legislation and \n     looks forward to working with you to ease the burden and find \n     a cure for Parkinson's disease.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 334, submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 334) relative to the death of William \n     Proxmire, former United States Senator from the State of \n     Wisconsin.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. FRIST. It is with deep sadness that I note the passing of the \ndistinguished public servant, Wisconsin's own William Proxmire.\n  William Proxmire was a man of fierce iconoclasm, robust physical \nenergy, and strong moral fiber. During his 32 years of service in the \nSenate, he proved himself a friend to consumers everywhere and a \nsteadfast enemy of Government wastefulness.\n  Born in Lake Forest, IL, as Edward William Proxmire, Senator Proxmire \ndropped his given first name as a youth to emulate his childhood hero, \nthe cowboy William Hart.\n  Following an education at Yale and Harvard Universities, he returned \nto the Midwest where he worked as a newspaper reporter, a farm \nimplement dealer, a printer, and a radio announcer. He won a seat in \nthe Wisconsin State Assembly in 1950, followed by three unsuccessful \nattempts to become Governor. Finally, in a special election, he won a \nseat in the U.S. Senate.\n  Senator Proxmire was an arch opponent of profligate spending. Every \nmonth, he would name his Golden Fleece Award to the latest boondoggle \non the Government books. He uncovered Government efforts to subsidize \nsurfing, study the body shapes of female airline flight attendants, and \ninvestigate the mechanics of why people fall in love.\n  In 22 years, he never missed a single vote, setting the record which \nstands to this day for having cast the most consecutive rollcall votes \nin the Senate.\n  Between 1967 and 1986, the Senator came to the floor each day to call \nupon his colleagues to ratify the Convention for the Prevention and \nPunishment of the Crime of Genocide. Finally, in 1986, after years of \ntenacious advocacy, the Senate acted and approved the convention.\n  Senator Proxmire became so popular with the people of Wisconsin that \nthe last two times he stood for elections, he refused to accept any \ncampaign contributions. Aside from filing fees, his main campaign \nexpenses, the Washington Post reported, ended up being envelopes--for \nreturning contributions that citizens sent in anyway.\n  Even as he aged, he stood by a sturdy regime of clean living: 100 \npushups after waking up, long daily runs, a healthy diet, and early \nbedtimes.\n  Senator Proxmire was proud of the liberal, progressive politics he \nlearned growing up in Wisconsin.
