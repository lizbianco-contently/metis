The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this morning we will immediately resume \nconsideration of the budget resolution. We have an order in place from \nlast night which sets aside specific debate times in relation to \nseveral amendments this morning. There is no debate time remaining on \nthe resolution beyond this time agreement. Senators, therefore, can \nexpect a lengthy series of votes to begin sometime around 1:30 today. \nThis vote-arama will necessitate continued cooperation from all \nMembers. I cannot stress enough the importance of every Senator staying \non the floor or very close by throughout the afternoon and into the \nevening. This is always a trying and challenging period because of the \nunusual nature of what happens over the course of the day. But \nbeginning around 1:30, we will start a series of votes that will go on \nfor a while.\n  I encourage my colleagues to work with the managers to use restraint \nin not offering amendments if they are purely message amendments and \nare not substantive. It is going to be a\n\n[[Page S2876]]\n\nchallenge to bring everything to closure over the course of today and \nearly into this evening already, so please use restraint in terms of \nwhether to offer amendments.\n\n\n                             Terri Schiavo\n\n  I know we want to get started, but I did want to bring to the \nattention of my colleagues an issue that we do have to act on before we \nleave. I do so on behalf of a number of my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle who have come up and said: There is an important issue facing \nthe country that we have not addressed in the past and that other \nsystems of government and other branches of government have \ninadequately addressed, and, therefore, it is time for the U.S. Senate \nto speak.\n  It centers on the fact that if we don't act or if somebody does not \nact, a living person who has a level of consciousness, who is self-\nbreathing, will be starved to death in the next 2 weeks--thus the \naction that is required to be done either later tonight or tomorrow in \norder to prevent that starvation to death by Terri Schiavo.\n  I first heard about the situation facing Terri Schiavo actually \nseveral years ago, but the immediacy of it has played out in the last \nseveral days because of this decision that has been made, not by her \nparents who want to keep her alive, not by her family who wants to keep \nher alive, but by her husband.\n  From a medical standpoint, I wanted to know a little bit more about \nthe case itself, so I had the opportunity to review the initial tapes \nthat were made, the physical examination on which the case was \nultimately based, the fact that she was in a persistent vegetative \nstate, and scores of neurologists had come forward and said that it \ndoesn't look like she is in a persistent vegetative state. It is a \nstrange word, ``vegetative state,'' that connotes all sorts of things \nto lay people. It is a medical term that means that she is not in a \ncoma. Persistent vegetative state is a specific diagnosis that \ntypically has to be made over a period of multiple examinations, \nusually multiple days, and some neurologists say should be made over \nseveral weeks. The facts of this case are that it was made by a single, \nor maybe two, but a single examination over a very short period of \ntime. The professionals themselves who have viewed those tapes question \nthat initial diagnosis.\n  The other questions arise: Does she have any hope of being \nrehabilitated? I talked personally to one of the neurologists who \nexamined her, and he said, absolutely, she can greatly improve, \nsubstantially improve if she is given the appropriate rehabilitation. I \nasked myself, had she expressed her wishes about the end of her life? \nShe had no written directive in terms of what would happen if such an \nevent struck her. Did she have an advanced medical directive? The \nanswer is no.\n  So we have come to the point where on this floor we are going to have \nto face the question of whether we believe that a conscious woman who \nis breathing on her own--and yes, she has a severe disability, similar \nto what cerebral palsy might be. She can't physically feed herself. She \ncan't verbally express her desires at this juncture, but she has no \nlegal direction.\n  The question is, Should we allow her to be starved to death? I \nmention that because it is an important case. It has to do with the \nculture of life. I believe this body is going to have to speak on this \nparticular matter before we leave for recess.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 204\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there will be 60 \nminutes of debate equally divided in the usual form in relation to the \nMedicaid amendment No. 204 offered by the Senator from Oregon, Mr. \nSmith. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, on the Bingaman amendment, I would like to \nyield 4 minutes to Senator Baucus, 4 minutes to Senator Corzine. I \nbelieve after that Senator Stabenow will take 4 minutes and Senator \nClinton for 4 minutes as well, and perhaps Senator Rockefeller \nfollowing if time remains.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I strongly support the Smith-Bingaman-\nColeman amendment to strike the reconciliation instruction to the \nFinance Committee to cut Medicaid by $15 billion. Some say this \namendment is not important because the budget is just a blueprint and \nthe Finance Committee would never make these cuts. That is just not \ntrue. A vote for this budget is a vote for cuts, plain and simple. If \nthe reconciliation instruction is to cut, the Finance Committee is \nunder instruction to cut.\n  Once we pass this budget, the reconciliation instructions are \nbinding. The Finance Committee would be bound to find the $15 billion \nin savings. Although it would be difficult for the committee to reach \nagreement on these cuts, the committee would make the cuts. The Finance \nCommittee has never failed to comply with reconciliation instructions. \nI do not believe that it would start this year. Those who say it is \njust a blueprint, that is a smokescreen. It is not accurate.\n  The administration says we need to address waste and abuse in \nMedicaid. They say these cuts will end the abuse of intergovernmental \ntransfers. I urge my colleagues to not be swayed by these allegations. \nThe administration has been negotiating reform of intergovernmental \ntransfers on a State-by-State basis for the past 2 years. They have \nalready squeezed significant savings through this new policy, and there \nwill not be much further savings if Congress goes down this road. How \ndo I know this? Because Montana is one of the States that was required \nto revise its intergovernmental program to comply with new State rules \nlast year.\n  Keep in mind that the change in policy has never been published. \nThere has been no notice, no invited comments, no rulemaking--never; no \nState Medicaid director's letter, none.\n  So how much in savings remains in reform of intergovernmental \ntransfers? The Congressional Budget Office says zero, no savings. So \nlet's not fool ourselves into thinking we are really cutting fraud and \nabuse in Medicaid with these cuts. Rather, these cuts will hurt people. \nIn fact, in Montana, the proposed cuts would mean a loss of health \ncoverage for 2,800 seniors or more than 12,000 children.\n  These cuts are definitely shortsighted. If Congress simply starts \ncutting Medicaid without considering the overall effects, it would \nforce people to seek care in emergency rooms, and even higher spending \nwould result, or even more people could lose coverage altogether.\n  Some say these are small and represent only a 1-percent cut in the \nprogram's growth over 5 years. But the President's $45 billion net \nMedicaid cut over 10 years is more than the $39 billion Congress has \nallocated to CHIP coverage for millions of uninsured children during \nthe 10-year lifetime of that program.\n  I applaud the leadership of Senators Bingaman, Smith, and Coleman. I \nurge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important amendment.\n  This is important. I strongly urge our colleagues to do what is \nright, to not make these cuts. It is going to directly affect people. \nSupport the Smith amendment.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized \nfor 4 minutes.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I, too, rise to speak strongly and \nforcefully in support of the bipartisan amendment Senators Smith and \nBingaman have offered. The idea of cutting $15 billion in the Medicaid \nProgram mandated under this resolution is a bad fundamental choice for \nour Nation. It is also a bad policy-setting device because it lets the \nbudget process drive Medicaid reform. This amendment directs the \ncreation of a Medicaid commission to investigate and consider possible \nimprovements.\n  A thoughtful, reasoned approach to limiting the growth in the cost of \nthe Medicaid Program, which is driven by enrollments and the high cost \nof health care. And while there may be fraud and abuse, the big issue \nis that we have a health care problem and how do we finance it. It is \nbeing ignored by using what I think is a shotgun approach as opposed to \nthe thoughtful, reasoned approach of how Medicaid reform should be \ndone. That is what this amendment does.\n  Last week, Senators Wyden, Murray, Johnson, and I offered a \nsuccessful amendment during the markup of the budget resolution. The \nsense of the\n\n[[Page S2877]]\n\nSenate was agreed to unanimously by the Budget Committee. As a part of \nthis resolution, it states that the Finance Committee shall not achieve \nany savings under reconciliation that would cap Federal Medicaid \nspending, shift Medicaid costs to the States or providers, or undermine \nthe Federal guarantee of Medicaid health insurance.\n  If this amendment is not accepted--and it is not possible, in my \nview, to cut $15 billion from Medicaid without violating that \nagreement--what we are going to be doing is shifting $15 billion to the \nStates; if not to the States, to the local governments; if not to the \nlocal governments, to the health care providers. It is going to be \ncharity care. It is going to be paid for. We are making a clear choice \nof transferring the responsibility for all of this care to someone \nelse, moving it off the Federal books on to State and local or even \nprivate providers. Maybe we are shifting it on to the streets of our \ncities and the homeless.\n  We are making another choice, too, which is unacceptable. The fact \nis, we are trying to force others to make a choice of whether we say \nhospice care is more important than mental illness treatment or more \nimportant than people having the ability to have hearing and other \nkinds of specialty treatments. We are taking away the options of how we \ntreat health care and, by the way, preventative care. We are also \nmaking a choice which I find completely hard to understand. Why have we \ndecided that this $15 billion we have mandated the Finance Committee to \nfind, why are we saying this $15 billion is so much more important than \nthe cumulative $204 billion or the tax cuts for those making over $1 \nmillion? Isn't this a society that believes in sharing the \nresponsibility for all of us to have access to a better life? We live \nin a society which provides enormous opportunity for so many, and many \nof us have benefitted from it, and we are making a clear choice that it \nis more important that this $15 billion be cut than $204 billion that \nis accumulating for tax cuts to the very wealthy. I do not think these \nare the choices the American people would make if they had those \nchoices laid before them.\n\n  I don't understand. We are saying the most vulnerable should be dealt \nwith without rational and reasoned expectations of where those cuts are \ngoing to come, and we are making all kinds of choices that are embedded \nin these kinds of issues. I believe the idea of a commission to stand \nback and find that reasoned and informed judgment is important.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a question, and I will give him \na minute to answer it?\n  Mr. CORZINE. Certainly.\n  Mr. GREGG. Does this amendment raise taxes to pay for the $15 billion \nthat would be called for to put in this budget, or does it increase the \ndeficit with more spending?\n  Mr. CORZINE. The Senator from New Hampshire knows very well that what \nwe are discussing is whether you extend tax cuts for those who earn \nover a million dollars. It is a debate we can have about language, \nabout extension or raising, but at least this Senator would argue that \nit is more important to make sure that we have a health insurance \nprogram for everyone in this society rather than tax cuts for \nmillionaires. These cuts will force states to raise taxes in order to \nraise the funds that will be necessary to maintain health care under \nMedicaid.\n  Mr. GREGG. To reclaim the time, the Senator did not answer the \nquestion. Maybe he is not familiar with the answer, but the answer is \nthat this amendment increases the deficit by $15 billion.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Four minutes is yielded to Senator Stabenow.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank the Chair.\n  First I say to our esteemed colleague who chairs the Budget \nCommittee, I think, as I have said before, he has done an excellent job \non the committee and the floor in allowing important discussions and \ninput. We all know this is about choices and priorities. We last year \npassed the tax loophole closings, as they have been called, some $23 \nbillion in a business tax bill, a tax bill that I supported that did \nnot end up becoming law. We have already joined saying there are \ndollars we believe would better be spent in other ways, in fairness \nfrom a tax standpoint that tax loopholes should be closed, and those \nequal more than what we are talking about here in terms of health care \nfor our most vulnerable citizens.\n  We also, as my colleague from New Jersey has said, have choices in \nthis country about where everyone will contribute to the quality of \nlife, what it means to be an American, to the strength of America, to \nwhat we are proud of and our best values, or whether only some people \nwill do that. This is a debate about values and choices. That is what a \nbudget resolution is. It is a picture of who we are. It is a picture of \nour values. I can't think of anything that is worse in this budget \nresolution than the picture that says for the most vulnerable children, \nthe poorest children, or poorest seniors in the country, we are going \nto take away health care for them. That doesn't fit with what I know \nabout my faith and beliefs about helping the least of these. It does \nnot reflect what the people of Michigan believe about what is important \nin supporting each other in community and caring about each other.\n\n  In a way it balances priorities. Obviously, we want dollars that are \nspent efficiently and effectively, and we want to give the States \nflexibility. In my home State, I am very proud of what they have been \nable to do in bulk purchasing for prescription drugs under Medicaid and \nworking with other States and saving dollars, and we certainly know we \nwant flexibility for them under Medicaid. But we also know that \nMedicaid is the single greatest provider of health insurance, covering \nover 21 million children, our future; 800,000 children in Michigan, our \nfuture. How many times do we say children are our future?\n  Well, this budget does not reflect that. It does not reflect that as \nit relates to funding their future skills and technology and education, \nand it certainly doesn't reflect their future if you are a poor child \nwhose parents do not have health care.\n  Let me speak about a couple of people in Michigan. Betty Counts, who \nlives in Detroit with her daughter Yvette, who has mental and physical \nhandicaps, is quoted in the Detroit News as saying, ``It's getting more \nfrustrating trying to get the services I need and the help my daughter \nneeds.'' And the budget cuts will certainly make things worse for her.\n  Ask Jimia Williams how much Medicaid means to her. She lives in Flint \nand has a 19-month-old son who has seizures and asthma. She works 35 to \n40 hours a week--and most of the people we are talking about are people \nwho are working; 80 percent of the uninsured are working 1 job, 2 jobs, \n3 jobs that do not provide health insurance--but her only source of \nhealth insurance right now is Medicaid. Medicaid pays for her young son \nto see a neurologist and get treatments for his seizures and his \nasthma, and it also pays for his medication, inhalers for both of them. \nShe said, ``Without Medicaid I would not be able to pay for my son's \nmedical needs.''\n  I could go on to so many different situations, but the bottom line of \nthis vote is about our values and our choices.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. STABENOW. This amendment reflects what is best about America. I \nurge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New York is recognized for 4 minutes.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I, too, come to the floor in support of \nthe Smith-Bingaman amendment, and I thank our colleagues for bringing \nthis amendment forward. What it does is very simply and very profoundly \nsay, wait a minute, let's not cut Medicaid right now. Let's take the \n$15 billion in cuts that are in this budget resolution and restore \nthem. But that is not the end of it. Let's also put together a \nbipartisan commission so that we can take a hard look at Medicaid and \ntry to figure out how to improve service delivery and quality and do \nmore to make it cost effective.\n\n  I am very proud to cosponsor this amendment because I believe this is \nthe right way to go. I believe wholeheartedly that we should be on a \nmuch\n\n[[Page S2878]]\n\nfaster track to return to fiscal discipline and to reduce the \nunprecedented deficits we are running. But I do not believe slashing \nMedicaid funding is the answer to getting our fiscal house in order, \nand it is regrettable that we would have in this same budget room for \nmillions and millions of dollars more in tax cuts while we attempt to \nbalance our budget on the backs of our most vulnerable citizens.\n  I can look at the growth in Medicaid and certainly see the same \nstrategy that everyone else has. In part it is part of the sluggish \neconomy, the loss of health insurance benefits for so many people who \ndo still have jobs. I know in my own State the Medicaid Program grew \nbetween 2000 and 2004. In fact, in the last 4 years in America, we have \nseen 35 million more Americans receive their health insurance through \nMedicaid. We now have 45 million uninsured Americans. I think that \nnumber would be above 50 million if we did not have Medicaid as a \nhealth care safety net.\n  This budget resolution hits New York especially hard, cutting our \nMedicaid funding by almost $2 billion. Let me just tell you what that \nmeans. We provide insurance to 4.1 million New Yorkers through \nMedicaid. That includes 1.7 million children, 1.4 million adults, and 1 \nmillion elderly and disabled beneficiaries. These are people who are \nthe frail elderly in nursing homes. These are the children of those who \nare working but do not have health insurance. These are people living \nwith chronic diseases. For these people, Medicaid truly is their last \nresort. They have nowhere else to turn.\n  As some of you know, I just spent 5 days in the hospital in New York \nCity with my husband, and we are very fortunate we can go to one of the \nfinest hospitals in the world to get the care that is necessary, but I \nknow very well that that hospital has two-thirds of its income coming \nin Medicare and Medicaid. It is in an area in New York City where there \nare a lot of poor people, people who get up every day and go to work. \nThey get on the subways, the trains, they get to work, they work hard, \nbut they do not have health insurance. Medicaid enables them to go to \nthat hospital just like my husband can go to that hospital.\n  We need Medicaid reform. That is what Senators Smith and Bingaman are \nproposing. Let us do the right diagnosis about what is wrong with \nMedicaid. Let us do what we need to do to get it on a better footing, \nbut let me add that the costs in Medicaid have gone up more than the \ncost of private insurance. This is not just a problem in Medicaid, this \nis a problem in the health care system, and we are going to make our \nproblem worse if we do this cutting of Medicaid without this type of \nbipartisan amendment.\n  If we tried to cut in New York, for example, we would have to make \nsome horrible choices. Should we cut out children? Should we eliminate \n100,000 beneficiaries, most of whom are in nursing homes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I urge adoption of this very important and necessary \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield myself 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me once again do what I did last \nevening, and that is commend Senator Smith for his leadership on this \nimportant issue. This is a very important test of what our priorities \nare and also whether we are essentially going to try to take advantage \nof those we think are less organized to resist.\n  There are a lot of ways we can save money in health care costs that \nthe Federal Government underwrites. In fact, I have an amendment I am \ngoing to be offering later on today where I will propose some \nsignificant cuts, substantially more than we are talking about here, \nthat can be saved in Medicare because I believe we should look at \nhealth care as an area where we need to constrain the growth in costs. \nBut the problem is this budget does not do anything about Medicare. \nThis budget particularly does not do anything about the enormous growth \nin the cost of Medicare as a result of last year's prescription drug \nbill. There are a lot of provisions in that bill which clearly overfund \nhealth maintenance organizations, HMOs, provide a slush fund to be used \nby the Secretary of Health and Human Resources. There is an enormous \namount of money sloshing around in that legislation, but there is no \neffort in the budget to get at any of that. Instead, we have said, \nlet's go after $15 billion of cuts in the areas that affect these less \norganized lobbies, these less organized groups, these groups that are \nnot going to speak up so strongly and resist the cuts.\n  That is why Senator Smith's initiative is so important. That is why \nit is so important that we have a national commission to give us \nrecommendations as to how we can intelligently save money in health \ncare costs in future years.\n  There are ways that we can better coordinate health care delivery \nunder Medicare and health care delivery under Medicaid. Forty-two \npercent of the cost of Medicaid is spent on people who are covered by \nMedicare. Now, we need to do a better job of coordinating those \nprograms, and there are opportunities for saving money. Of course, none \nof that has been studied, and none of that has been given to us in the \nway of recommendations. All we are presented with in this budget is a \nrecommendation that we cut $15 billion and somehow or another \nessentially shift that cost to the States.\n\n  I know there is some discussion up and down the halls that maybe \nSecretary Leavitt has made some arrangement with the Governors and they \nare agreeable to this $15 billion cut. I have spoken with our Governor, \nGovernor Richardson of New Mexico, who is head of the western \nDemocratic Governors--maybe all the Governors; I am not exactly sure of \nthe title he holds these days. He is a leader on this issue, and he has \nassured me there is no deal and that these cuts that are proposed in \nthis budget will adversely affect us in New Mexico.\n  We are struggling to continue the services we have traditionally \nprovided under Medicaid. We are struggling to deal with the fact that \nmore and more people are insisting on services in Medicaid because they \nare losing their private health insurance. That is why the cost of \nMedicaid overall has been going up, because more and more people are \ndependent on Medicaid.\n  This is an important amendment. Senator Smith deserves the support of \nall of our colleagues on this amendment. I urge all our colleagues to \nsupport it. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon has 8 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, a vote for this amendment to defer these \ncuts to this commission and a reform effort that is bipartisan is not \nabout being against reducing the deficit. It is, in fact, a way to \nachieve reductions, if that is what it comes to, in a way that takes \ncare of the most vulnerable people in our society.\n  We are talking about 52 million Americans. Of these, we are talking \nabout the elderly who are in nursing homes. Of these, we are talking \nabout the chronically ill people without income who suffer from cancer \nor HIV. We are talking about the children of the working uninsured. We \nare talking about people who have no other recourse except, if they \nlose their health care, to go to the emergency rooms of our community \nhospitals. When they go there without the ability to pay, they are \nserved, but we are all then later served the passing on of these costs \nin the form of higher prices to private plans and businesses--small \nbusinesses especially--that struggle mightily to continue providing \nhealth care.\n  Right now every year 3 percent--and it grows by that number--lose \ntheir insurance from their businesses because of the escalating costs \nlargely driven by the inefficient distribution of health care.\n  It is very important for my colleagues to understand that this is not \na vote against a budget of fiscal responsibility. This is a way to \nproceed toward fiscal responsibility in a way that is thoughtful. It is \nreally important,\n\n[[Page S2879]]\n\nwhen we talk about a population that is vulnerable--those covered by \nMedicaid--that we do this carefully, that we do it thoughtfully, that \nwe do it right instead of just doing it fast.\n\n  The truth is, when you put this kind of cut, $15 billion, under \nreconciliation, that means it will be cut. Reconciliation is a Damocles \nsword that hangs over this place and has the ability to disrupt the \nregular process, taking it from a committee and right to the floor \nwithout the participation that, frankly, we have the privilege to \nprovide but the duty not to shirk.\n  It is my belief that this proposal of a commission, made up of 23 \nmembers--Governors, Senators, Congressmen, providers, advocates, local \nofficials--a bipartisan commission that can deal with the necessary \nreforms that must come to Medicaid can do them in a way that works for \nthe population that has to be served and to disqualify those who game \nthe system or abuse the system.\n  I readily acknowledge there is much in Medicaid that is broken. The \ntruth is, we have not had a Medicaid commission since Medicaid's \ncreation in 1965, and now we propose to let the budget drive the policy \nwhen we ought to be letting the policy drive the budget.\n  Given that we are going to do this and need to do it to modernize \nMedicaid, given the vulnerability of the population served, given the \nchance to do this right instead of just doing it fast, to let the \npolicy drive the budget instead of the budget driving the policy with \nthis vulnerable population, I plead with my colleagues to stand up to \ntheir duty and make sure that Congress is not circumvented, to defend \nthe 52 million people in America who are counting on us to do it right, \nand not just to do it fast.\n  If we pass this, the reductions will come, but the reforms and the \nflexibility necessary at the State level to accommodate that will not \nbe done in a more thoughtful and bipartisan way.\n  I see no others of my colleagues seeking recognition, so I simply \nclose by asking Republicans and Democrats to be careful with this \nissue. Of all the choices we make around here on issues affecting the \nAmerican people, this one calls for the most care, the most caution, \nthe most thought, and the greatest degree of sensitivity because it \ninvolves the blind, the lame, the poor, the needy, those who have no \nrecourse if we pull away this central strand in the safety net of \nAmerica's social promise.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, will my friend from Oregon yield for a \nmoment?\n  Mr. SMITH. I will be happy to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to thank the Senator from Oregon \nfor his leadership. He and the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman, \nhave led an effort I am proud to cosponsor. His eloquence is \nmeaningful. This is an opportunity for us to work in a bipartisan way, \nto lay out a process to achieve what we all want in terms of \nefficiencies, but to do it in a way that is thoughtful, caring, and \nappropriate, and to allow us to make the best decisions without hurting \nthe most vulnerable people in this country.\n  I thank the Senator for his leadership.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Michigan for her \nkind words. I also say to my friend, the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, Senator Gregg is a terrific fellow, one of the best people I \nknow in this place. He has a tough job. I know I have made it more \ndifficult. I, at a personal level, apologize to him for that, but I \nwant him to know--I want all my colleagues to know--how personally and \npassionately I feel about this as someone who helped to create the \nOregon health plan, to find ways to serve more with preventive \nmedicine, in ways that stretch the dollar and serve more people who \nhave no other recourse. I take that responsibility very seriously.\n  I am trying to reflect that with the best of motives, with an equal \ncommitment to finding a budget that will represent our values and our \nviews that includes all the Members; that does, perhaps for a few days, \ndelay some of the cuts that would fall, but if these cuts fall badly, \nwe will hurt the most vulnerable people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SMITH. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I had the great good fortune when I went to \ncollege to be taught by one of the historically strongest history \nprofessors in our Nation, a man named David Truman. He went on to be \npresident of Mount Holyoke. He wrote probably the definitive treatise \non American Government. One chapter in that treatise was dedicated to \ncommittees and commissions. He said that the commission is the place \nwhere you send issues when you do not want to have to deal with them, \nwhen you want to ignore them, when you want to obfuscate the issue, and \nwhen you want to basically kick the can down the road.\n  He was a brilliant professor and usually right, and in this case \nobviously totally correct.\n  This amendment, if it is adopted, will guarantee that the issue of \nMedicaid is not addressed. That is a guarantee in this decade. It does \nnot kick the can down the road, it kicks the can down the road a decade \nbecause we will not do reconciliation again for a long time, I suspect. \nNext year is an election year, and Congresses are not inclined to make \ntough choices in election years. It has been 10 years since we did the \nlast reconciliation bill, so it is unlikely reconciliation will occur \nagain. And we are not going to pass in this Congress a bill which \nreforms a significant program on the entitlement side without using \nreconciliation because the courage simply is not here.\n  So let's talk about why it is absolutely critical that this year we \naddress the Medicaid issue and why it is not going to impact any \nchildren and why all this ``wearing your heart on the sleeve'' language \nwe heard around here is a large amount of puffery.\n  We had some very disturbing testimony--and I believe that is the term \nused by the Senator from North Dakota, and it is accurate--from the \nComptroller of the Currency as we talked about the liabilities already \non the books that our children are going to have to pay because our \ngeneration put them on the books. They add up now to $44 trillion. That \nis ``trillion'' dollars. Mr. President, $44 trillion of liabilities is \nalready on the books.\n  This chart shows that, $44 trillion. To try to put that in \nperspective because a trillion dollars is something nobody can \nunderstand. If you take all the taxes paid in America since the \nRevolution, it adds up to $38 trillion. So we have on the books more \nliabilities today than taxes paid in this country in the history of \nthis country.\n  In fact, if you take the entire net worth of the United States today, \nand every American adds up all their net worth--all their houses, all \ntheir cars, all their jewelry, whatever they have, stocks, bonds, \nassets, real estate, it comes to $47 trillion. So we have on the books \nalmost as much obligation as we have net worth.\n  The practical effect of that is that we are overwhelming the next \ngeneration with obligations which they will have to pay. Our children \nand our grandchildren are going to have to pay the taxes to support \nthat $44 trillion worth of obligations we put on the books. So it is \nimportant that we look at from where those obligations come.\n  They come primarily from what is known as entitlement accounts, \nspecifically three major accounts: Social Security, Medicare, and \nMedicaid. In fact, the vast majority of them do not come from Social \nSecurity, they come from Medicare and Medicaid. Health care represents \n$27 trillion of that $44 trillion of costs that are on the books that \nour children are going to have to pay because we have already committed \nthem to do that to support the baby boom generation when it retires.\n  It is entitlements that are the issue. My colleagues have come \nforward and said: But we do not have to deal with Social Security, even \nthough the President has been willing to discuss it. We do not have to \ndeal with it, no; stiff arm Social Security. OK, that is off the table.\n  The President says he just amended the Medicare law, so he does not \nwant to move on Medicare this year. OK, that is off the table.\n\n[[Page S2880]]\n\n  That leaves one issue, one major program that should be looked at \nthis year at least, and that, of course, is Medicaid.\n  The other side of the aisle and three speakers this morning have \nalready said you can just address this problem by raising taxes. I \nnote--it does not appear to be anybody has focused on this at all--but \nthe amendment before us does not raise taxes, it raises the deficit. We \nheard all of yesterday, the day before, and the day before that how the \nother side of the aisle did not want to raise the deficit; they wanted \nto be the party that was opposed to deficit spending. Today they come \nforward and the vast majority of the people sponsoring and supporting \nthe program, the bill before us, which dramatically raises the deficit \nby $14 billion in the 5-year period, something like $60 billion in the \n10-year period.\n\n  But even if you accept the fact that they want to raise taxes to pay \nfor it, the issue is, Could you solve this problem, this outyear \nliability that is caused by all these entitlement accounts, Medicare, \nMedicaid, and Social Security, by raising taxes?\n  You cannot do it. This chart shows it so clearly. The cost of \nMedicare, Medicaid, and Social Security is the red line here. The blue \nline is the historical amount that the Federal Government spends, 20 \npercent of GDP. That is what we have historically spent, since World \nWar II, essentially. You can see that the red line crosses the blue \nline in about the year 2029, 2028, in that period. These three \nprograms--Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid--will actually cost \nthe Federal Government more than 20 percent of the gross national \nproduct.\n  What does that mean in practical terms? It means you wouldn't be able \nto spend any money on education, any money on roads, any money on \nnational defense, because the entire Federal Government would be \nabsorbed by paying for these three programs. Or, alternatively, you \ncould take the approach the other side wants to take, which is raise \ntaxes.\n  If you did that, you would have to double the tax rate on Americans \nin order to pay for this program. Working Americans, young Americans, \nthese pages who are here today and are going to get a job, would find \ntheir ability to have a decent lifestyle would be dramatically reduced \nbecause they would have to pay twice as much in taxes as our generation \nhas paid in order to support these Federal programs which are already \non the books.\n  You cannot tax your way out of this. I don't care if you confiscate \nall the income of the two top brackets, you cannot get this system \nunder control through taxes. You have to address the other side of the \nledger, which is spending responsibly on these programs. That is what \nthis bill tries to do. That is what the budget tries to do.\n  In a most minor way, a minuscule way, almost, we suggest in this \nbudget we want to save $15 billion in the rate of growth--not cuts--in \nthe rate of growth of Medicaid over the next 5 years; $15 billion. You \nsay $15 billion is a lot of money. It is a lot of money, but you have \nto put it in context. Over the next 5 years, the Medicaid system is \ngoing to spend $1.12 trillion--that is trillion with a ``t''--and $15 \nbillion on that amount is 1 percent, essentially. What we are actually \ntrying to save in this bill is $14 billion.\n  This chart shows it. Medicaid spending will go up dramatically. It \nwill go up by 39 percent. It will not go up by 41 percent. That is what \nit would do. It would go up by 41 percent if this bill doesn't go into \nplace, but if this bill goes into place, it will go up by 39 percent. A \n39-percent rate of growth in this program is what we are planning.\n  We have heard people come down here, especially the Senator from \nOregon, and say if this language passes, lives will be lost. I think he \nsaid that. Children will be lost. That is absurd, misleading, \ninaccurate, and a total gross exaggeration. I wish the Senator had been \na Governor because he would know that the Medicaid system today does \nnot benefit children as much as he thinks it does. There is a large \nchunk of the Medicaid system today which is being gamed out of the \nsystem by States and being used in the general operations by the States \nto build roads, to put police officers on the road--a large chunk of \nit. That could be saved.\n\n  There is a large chunk of the Medicaid system today which is going to \npharmaceuticals to pay dramatically more than what we pay under any \nother program for pharmaceutical products. That could be saved.\n  There is a large chunk of the Medicaid system today which is going to \npeople who are gaming the system by what is known as spending down. \nThat is when you, in a rather fraudulent way, get rid of your assets--\ngive them to your kids or give them to somebody else in your family so \nthat you can then come to the Government and say, Support me in a \nnursing home. So all the other Americans in this country who are \nplaying by the rules end up supporting people who are breaking the \nrules and who are gaming the system through spending down. Huge amounts \nof dollars are pouring out of the system under those accounts.\n  A lot of money is being lost in this system simply because it is \ninefficiently run, because the Governors do not have the flexibility \nthey need in order to get more service because they know how to deliver \nit, but instead they are hamstrung by all sorts of rules and \nregulations which make no sense to them and which undermine their \ncapacity to deliver the service efficiently.\n  The President and innumerable Governors, responsible Governors in \nthis country, have come forward and said you give more flexibility to \nthe Governors and they can take a little less rate of increase in \nspending and deliver much more service to many more kids. So this \nconcept that you cannot get to this 1-percent savings, that you cannot \nlive on a 39-percent rate of growth in Medicaid without having children \nlose their lives and be not able to go to the emergency room for care, \nis scare tactics. Not only that, it is not right. Because if you cannot \nstep up--especially as a Republican who supposedly is committed to \nfiscal responsibility, because that is what our party is supposed to be \ncommitted to--and say that you can deliver better service with more \nflexibility, then you are probably not a very good Governor. I doubt \nthere are any Republican Governors, at least, and I suspect there are \nnot a lot of Democratic Governors who don't believe they can do more \nwith a lot more flexibility.\n  The President has listed seven or eight--actually, Governor Leavitt \nhas--seven or eight different proposals, none of which impact services \none iota and, in fact, some of which would significantly expand \nservices to children, which could be accomplished if we reform the \nprogram and would slow the rate of growth in this program along the \nlines projected here.\n  So it is unconscionable that people would claim a $14 billion \nreduction in the rate of growth when you are having a $1.1 trillion \nexpenditure, a reduction which represents 1 percent over 5 years, could \nnot be accomplished in the context of a program where there are \nobviously so many problems which need to be addressed and which could \ndeliver more efficient and more effective service.\n  It gets back to this point, of course. If we do not do this now, we \nare not going to do it. This is not an amendment to set up a \ncommission, the purpose of which is to resolve the problem. This is an \namendment to set up a commission to make sure the problem is never \nresolved. It is irresponsible because of that.\n\n  I do think it is important to note how this budget has been \nstructured. A lot of people say this Federal budget is pretty \nmeaningless and it is sort of a process we go through here. Of course, \n2 out of the last 4 years we didn't even have one. To some degree they \nare correct, I regret to say.\n  We have in this budget three basic elements: discretionary spending, \nentitlement spending, and the other is taxes. On the discretionary side \nwe set a discretionary cap. We have already seen 24 amendments or so \noffered on the floor that will affect that cap--in other words, Members \nnot willing to accept the spending levels of this budget. They have to \nput money into this program or that program. We have another hundred or \nso amendments also pending which do exactly the same. So the \nwillingness to discipline the discretionary side of the ledger is, to \nsay the least, tepid. One would suspect there are going to be a lot of \ngames played with that cap even if it gets into place before we get to \nthe appropriations\n\n[[Page S2881]]\n\nprocess. But it does, hopefully, limit the rate of growth and it does \nhave some impact. But regrettably I have to admit it is at the margin.\n  Then there is a tax side. Most of the taxes, in this budget at least, \nare taxes which most people are going to vote for. That point was made \nyesterday--whether there are reconciliation instructions, most of these \ntax cuts are going to be extended. They are very popular: R, spousal \nstuff, tuition tax stuff.\n  No, the essence of this budget is whether we are going to address the \nfastest growing function of the Federal Government, the function of the \nFederal Government which is going to bankrupt our children and give \nthem much less of a quality of life than we have had; whether our \ngeneration, the baby boom generation, which is now the generation that \ngoverns, is going to be willing to stand up and admit that we put too \nmuch on the books for our children to bear. That is the essence of this \namendment. This amendment knocks out the only significant effort--well, \nthere is one other dealing with the PBGC--the only significant effort \nto bring under control the rate of growth in the Federal Government in \nthe outyears; the major piece of fiscal discipline.\n  In the short term you can argue the discretionary caps may help. But \nin the long term, which is where our big problem is and where we all \nacknowledge it to be, the only thing that is going to address that is \nif we reconcile the Medicaid number. If we do not do it this year, it \nis not going to be done. That is why I find this amendment to be so \npernicious, because it is put forward as if the people who support it \nare for fiscal discipline when in fact its practical implication is to \ngut the only thing in this budget which actually will generate fiscal \ndiscipline. And it is being done by Republicans. You have to ask \nyourself how they get up in the morning and look in the mirror.\n  In any event, that is where we stand. I am not going to deny that \nthis isn't a crucial vote. This is a crucial vote. If the Medicaid \nlanguage is passed, if it is knocked out of the bill, I think I put in \ncontext the effect it has on this budget. More important, I hope I have \nput in context the effect it is going to have on our kids and our \ngrandkids, because we will have said that in none of the three areas \nwhere the explosive growth is occurring--in none of these three areas \nwhere we are headed to this disaster, where our children are not going \nto be able to afford the costs that we have stuck them with--that in \nnone of these three areas is this Congress willing to act. That would \nbe more than an unfortunate event.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Do I have any time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 10 minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I reserve that time and yield the floor. I \nyield the remainder of the time on my side to the Senator from \nMississippi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank Senator Gregg for the leadership he \nprovided at the Budget Committee. This is never an easy job. I worked \nwith Senator Pete Domenici when he was chairman, and we had this vote-\narama and critical votes year after year. We got it done every year \nexcept for 2 out of the last 3 years. We need this blueprint in place \nso we can go forward, so we can have some modicum of controlling \nourselves, controlling spending.\n  I don't like everything in this resolution, particularly. I think \nright now the aggregate of money for a State is too much; the aggregate \namount of money for Treasury and IRS is too much. I would like to have \nmore in agriculture, education, transportation. But if each one of us \npicks our issue where, ``Oh, no, we can't have any restraint here,'' we \nwill never have any.\n  I enjoy listening to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle get up \nand give these great speeches about how we have a problem with the \ndeficit, we have to have restraint, and then when it comes time to have \nrestraint, to do things to help the economy grow, or control spending \nin any area, we all say: No, not my area.\n  We have to do it across the board. We know that the problem in the \nFederal Government is not on the discretionary side. It is not how much \nwe are going to be spending on highways or education. The growth there \nhas been relatively restrained. That is true in most of these \ncategories. The problem is in the mandatory area. Frankly, I have never \nliked mandatory areas. What does mandatory mean, you get it no matter \nwhat? Then a Governor or legislature can keep adding people, keep \nadding people, perhaps for good reason, perhaps political reasons.\n  All of a sudden, you have a program that grows like topsy-turvy, \ntotally out of control. It is going to bust State budgets. It already \nhas. It will have a huge impact on the Federal budget.\n  These mandatory programs are going to cause situations where we \ncannot continue to afford to spend what we are spending in the future, \nwhat we committed to on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.\n  Do I think this is a great program? Yes. I personally know what they \nmean. I have benefited from them. I have seen what they don't do. When \nmy father was killed in an automobile accident after 30 years of paying \ninto Social Security, because of the marital situation and my age, our \nfamily got nothing out of it.\n  I would like to have some sort of system where people pay and they \nhave an opportunity for their families to benefit, if they so choose.\n  Medicare--I know what it means to people who are aged and have health \nproblems. I think what we did on the prescription drug issue was a huge \nmistake. We didn't have real reforms. In fact, we put more burdens on \nMedicare, and we are not going to be able to afford what we have gotten \ninto on Medicare. But Medicaid is the subject for discussion. My State \nhas wrestled with this. Over the past few years, we kept adding people \nand programs to it until it was not a problem for a while, but for the \nlast 2 years it is absolutely totally out of control, and my poor State \nof Mississippi, there is a $270 million hole. The Governor and \nlegislature fought about it, cussed about it, struggled with it. \nFinally, last Sunday night at midnight they came up with an agreement.\n  What was the agreement? They couldn't figure out any way to pay for \nit or to cut it, and they borrowed the money from the tobacco trust \nfund, and said: Don't worry, we will pay it back later. Excuse me? I \ndon't think that is a very good or permanent solution. The States need \nhelp. We need to be thoughtful in how we reform Medicaid to make sure \nthose we are committed to giving help really do get it, and that it is \ndone in a controllable, reasonable way.\n  The Federal Government is part of the problem. We have to match the \nfunds.\n  The President made a very small recommendation of some savings in the \nMedicaid area. Then the Senator from New Hampshire took that, and \nactually he took some of the savings and added some of it back in areas \nwhere it was badly needed, for a net savings of only $14 billion in \nthis resolution over 5 years. If we cannot support that, we might as \nwell fold our tent.\n  Let me say to my colleagues here, too, that we are going to have to \ndo this. We are going to have to do it now and later.\n  When we come back out of conference, we are going to have serious \nreforms, or a way to get to reforms and some savings in the Medicaid \narea because we cannot continue down this road.\n  I am sorry. I am embarrassed to say that Democrats seem to not want \nto have any kind of restraint, and, unfortunately, some of my \nRepublicans colleagues, too.\n  This is an important vote. It is not the only important vote. It is \nnot one that will destroy the whole process, but it is going to tell a \nwhole lot about who we are.\n  I don't see how anybody who votes for this amendment to knock out \nthis little, tiny savings can ever raise their voice again and say they \nare worried about deficits and Federal Government spending to go on too \nlong. I realize I am talking in very broad terms and not going into any \nspecificity.\n  This is an important vote. I plead with my colleagues, show some \nrestraint. We have shown so little restraint for several years. We have \nall been a part of that. But now we are paying the price. We have these \ndeficits which we have to cut. It is estimated this resolution would \ncut the\n\n[[Page S2882]]\n\ndeficit about half over the next 5 years. I believe that is right. It \nis probably not enough. We probably should do more.\n  The red line and the red ink on the chart in these entitlement \nprograms is going to swamp us. Some people say we can do that later. \nCan we do it better later? No. Every year we wait, it gets worse. It \nmakes the reforms and the necessary savings more difficult and larger.\n  I just wanted to urge my colleagues to support the Budget Committee's \naction and support this resolution. Don't vote to take out the tiny \nsavings in Medicaid that is included here. The States have to be doing \nsome of that. They show a lot more restraint and leadership than we do \non them. They have one thing that is different: they have to have \nbalanced their budgets every year. It is in their constitutions. My \npoor State does. Maybe someday we will still have to come back to that \nat the Federal level.\n  I thank Senator Gregg for his leadership, and I thank him for \nyielding.\n  Mr. GREGG. I appreciate the appropriate comments of the Senator from \nMississippi.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss devastating cuts \nto Medicaid included the fiscal year 2006 budget we are now debating. \nMedicaid has been the most successful health care safety net program \nour nation has ever established, protecting low-income children, the \nelderly and the disabled from being uninsured. Fifty-two million people \ncount on this program and without it, these individuals would be forced \nto seek out care in our emergency rooms, and would likely mean that \nmany low-income seniors in nursing homes would not have appropriate \ncare in older age.\n  As you know, the budget before us includes $14 billion in cuts to the \nMedicaid program over the next 5 years. This is a startling number and \nrepresents the single largest cut to any program in this budget. \nFourteen billion in cuts is almost as large as the entire State Health \nInsurance Program or SCHIP budget for the next 3 years, and equal to \nFederal Medicaid spending in six mid-sized States or 18 small States. \nIf we allow this reconciliation instruction to move forward, it will \nhave very harmful effects for those most in need all across America. \nThese reductions will force states to cut services as well as cut \naccess entirely for certain populations.\n  In my home State of South Dakota, it is estimated that these Medicaid \ncuts could cause a loss of coverage for 800 elderly people. These are \nlargely individuals with severe chronic illnesses that require nursing \nhome care. It will also cut coverage for 4,000 children in South Dakota \nby the end of 2010; children who would have otherwise been covered \nunder the program if the Federal dollars would continue. These are the \nmost vulnerable citizens in my State whose families have likely sold \nthe farm and exhausted all of their resources just to pay for health \ncare. They are the sickest and the poorest, and this budget tells them \nthat we do not care.\n  Beyond the devastating effect on those most in need, the budget cuts \nwill inappropriately shift the entire burden of care to cash-strapped \nStates that are already struggling with growing health care costs and \nwill not be able to afford these additional burdens. More than half of \nall States will see their Federal matching rates decline in 2006 and \nthey will also be required to start making payments back to the Federal \nGovernment to finance the new Medicare drug coverage for dual eligibles \nor those people eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid. Additional \nMedicaid burdens are of great concern to me and the majority of \nGovernors have also expressed their opposition to the current Medicaid \nbudget.\n  These budget cuts not only mean that many South Dakotans will lose \nState coverage, but it also means that the State will have to cut \nservices for those who are lucky enough not to be dropped from the \nMedicaid program. Cuts in services may mean that people on Medicaid \nwill no longer be able to obtain health services such as breast cancer \ntreatment, rehabilitative care or prescription drugs. The impact of \nthese cuts in care will not just go away because Medicaid stops paying \nfor treatment. Hospitals, health centers and other providers will wind \nup treating those patients in our emergency rooms and as charity care \npatients, absorbing those costs. Also, individuals who lose coverage \nwill not have access to preventive care and will likely delay treatment \nuntil hospital care is needed. This increases the costs to the system, \nsince a trip to the hospital is going to be much more expensive than if \nthey would have had coverage to go to the doctor or get a prescription \ndrug before getting sick.\n\n  Costs within the program are rising, but this is not because the \nMedicaid program is inefficient. The driving force behind rising costs \nis the result of many things. The surge in costs are due in part to \nCongress having failed to deal with the millions of low-income workers \nwho are uninsured, and that Medicare does not pay for long-term nursing \nhome care. Census data has revealed that there were 5.1 million more \npeople uninsured in 2003 than in 2000. An unstable economy has left \nworkers with lower incomes and employers dropping health coverage. \nStatistics show that two-thirds of those losing coverage are in low-\nincome jobs. Because of these access to coverage problems, Medicaid is \nfilling a critical gap that most in our nation support--ensuring kids \nhave basic medical care, providing low-income working families with \nhealth coverage that keeps them healthy and productive, and making sure \nthat seniors have the care they need in old age. These factors do not \nmake the case for cuts to Medicaid, but rather indicate that we should \nbe doing more to expand the program for those who lack coverage. The \nSCHIP program was a great example of that, and we should be doing more \nto pull those that are low-income and uninsured under this umbrella.\n  The overall rise in health care costs are also contributing to the \nincreased expenses in Medicaid. New technologies and the skyrocketing \ncosts of prescription drugs are sending all health care costs through \nthe roof. Under these circumstances, Medicaid's spending per enrollee \nhas actually been more efficient than other health care payors. The \nprogram spending has increased more slowly than private insurance \nspending and Medicare.\n  More and more poor people will need programs like Medicaid if the \ntrends continue as they have in recent years. We should be working on \nsolutions to reduce the costs of health care in the United States, but \ncutting Medicaid is not the answer. We need to closely examine our care \nsystem broadly and reduce costs by promoting the use of information \ntechnology in health, emphasizing prevention techniques that keep \npeople healthy, and reducing the costs of prescription drugs. It will \nalso be crucial that we closely examine our long-term care system, \nwhich accounts for almost one-third of Medicaid spending and will \nlikely increase as our senior population increases in numbers. This is \nwhere the discussion must turn to, rather than placing the blame on the \nMedicaid program which has been a cost efficient, successful program \nensuring coverage for millions of Americans most in need.\n  We will be voting soon on an important amendment offered by Senators \nSmith and Bingaman, as well as many others, that will strike the \nreconciliation instructions to the Finance Committee for Medicaid, and \nstrike the function that directs that committee to cut the $14 billion \nfor that program. In its place, the amendment will create a $1.5 \nmillion reserve fund to create a Medicaid Commission. I am pleased to \nbe a cosponsor of this amendment. We do have a need to address the \nskyrocketing costs of our Federal health care programs and health care \nin general, and I think the establishment of a commission on Medicaid \nis a smart way to begin to find solutions. I will support this \namendment and I urge all of my colleagues to do the same. We need to \nget our priorities straight with this budget. A budget that proposes to \ncut billions in health care coverage for our most vulnerable citizens \nwhile at the same time including $23 billion in tax cuts for capital \ngains and dividends is not a budget that represents my values or the \nvalues of the American people.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 204\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, our Nation is facing very difficult fiscal \nrealities which are only going to become more difficult and expensive \nthe longer we wait to take action. The Federal\n\n[[Page S2883]]\n\nGovernment can no longer afford ``business as usual.'' According to the \nGAO, the unfunded Federal financial burden for public debt, including \nfuture Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid payments, totals more \nthan $40 trillion or $140,000 per man, woman and child. At what point \ndo we listen to the wake up call?\n  The Federal Reserve Chairman, Alan Greenspan, has recently warned \nCongress and the Nation that, ``In the end, the consequences for the \nU.S. economy of doing nothing could be severe. But the benefits of \ntaking sound, timely action could extend many decades into the \nfuture.'' We must all work together to reduce the crippling $412 \nbillion budget deficit and the mounting unfunded Federal financial \nburden.\n  I commend the administration for submitting a budget request that \nproposes reduced funding for a number of programs. I clearly understand \nthat every program is important to certain constituencies, and Medicaid \nis at the top of the list for many. The Medicaid program provides \ncritical services to some of the most vulnerable people in our nation. \nIn my home State of Arizona, we have an outstanding Medicaid program, \nthe Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System, that represents a \nmodel for other States.\n  Unfortunately, not every state Administers its program as efficiently \nas Arizona. The reality is, Medicaid costs are skyrocketing out of \ncontrol. It is time we took a long hard look at this program--as every \nother program for that matter and develop proposals to ensure that \nMedicaid will continue to serve the neediest Americans over the long \nterm.\n  Let me be clear. I do not support across the board cuts to the \nMedicaid program. In fact, I believe such an action could have a \ndisastrous effect on many important efforts that ensure access to care \nfor many Americans who have nowhere else to turn. Additionally, I \nrecognize that cuts to Medicaid that result in reduction of covered \nindividuals would flood hospital emergency rooms with additional \nuninsured patients, forcing hospitals to absorb additional cost for \nuncompensated care. Arizona has one of the highest uninsured \npopulations in the country and a large number of undocumented \nimmigrants, our hospitals are already struggling to absorb the cost of \nproviding uncompensated care, dramatically reducing medicare eligible \npopulations could severely impact the hospital system in my State and \nin many others.\n  In debating potential cuts to the Medicaid program, we must work to \nensure that the federal government does not further exacerbate these \nexisting problems. Any effort to reform Medicaid must be made in a \ncautious and deliberative manner.\n  We simply must start to control spending and make some very difficult \ndecisions among competing priorities. I was pleased to have joined with \nSenators Smith and Bingaman in cosponsoring S. 338, the bipartisan \ncommission on Medicaid Act of 2005, which was introduced on February 9, \n2005. I cannot vote for the pending amendment because I believe \nstrongly that the fiscal reality of Medicaid must be addressed sooner \nrather than later. And I have been around here long enough to know that \ntoo often we need to have our feet held to the fire to really make \nmeaningful progress on difficult issues. So I hope that we can agree to \ncut waste in the Medicaid program and also create a bipartisan task \nforce to provide recommendations for how best to reform the program for \nthe long run. In my judgment, only through comprehensive reforms can we \nprevent across the board cuts in Medicaid in the long term. We should \nbegin our reform efforts today.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the Smith-\nBingaman amendment. I am proud to cosponsor this amendment to strike \nthe proposed $15 billion in cuts to Medicaid and instead create a \nMedicaid Commission.\n  In an effort to climb our way out of record Federal budget deficits, \nthe Budget resolution we are considering this week will cut Medicaid by \n$15 billion over the next 5 years. This cut would be devastating to \nmillions of low-income families, children, disabled and senior citizens \nwho are served by Medicaid.\n  I recognize that Medicaid--like all health care programs continues to \nface higher health care costs. But it is unconscionable to arbitrarily \nslash billions of dollars from a safety net program like Medicaid, and \nat the same time, give away billions of dollars worth of tax cuts in \nthe same budget.\n  The main problem causing Medicaid spending growth is not that it is \nbloated or inefficient. New studies by the Urban Institute and the \nKaiser Family Foundation show that Medicaid spends less, per patient, \nthan private health insurance plans and that its costs have grown more \nslowly in the last four years than private-sector insurance premiums.\n  The real cost driver in Medicaid is the economy, which continues to \ncause a strain on the ability of businesses to offer health insurance \ncoverage to their employees. More and more employers are dropping \nhealth insurance coverage, pushing low-wage working families onto \npublic programs, while the overall cost of health care continues to \nskyrocket. Cutting $15 billion from Federal Medicaid spending is only \ngoing to make matters worse by forcing the problem down to States, \nwhich already face severe budget crises.\n  A $15 billion cut in Medicaid could translate to a loss of $300 \nmillion for Wisconsin. It would be extremely difficult for Wisconsin \nand other States to absorb a cut of this magnitude while continuing to \nprovide the level of services on which families depend. A cut of this \nsize has the potential to deprive thousands of poor families needed \nmedical care and greatly increase the already record number of \nuninsured Americans.\n  I do not object to having a thorough discussion about how we can make \nMedicaid work better to serve low-income Americans. But it is \nunacceptable to force arbitrary cuts in Medicaid without first taking \nthe time to consider the future efficiency and operation of the \nMedicaid program. Medicaid is an essential source of health care for 53 \nmillion of our nation's most vulnerable citizens, and any changes to \nthe program should be driven by informed, reasoned policy and not by \narbitrary budget targets.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject these harmful cuts.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about Medicaid, \na program that is very important to my home State of West Virginia. \nOver the past few days I have listened to my colleagues characterize \nthe $15 billion in Medicaid cuts contained in this budget as marginal, \nminor, and not a big deal. I want to remind my colleagues that this \nbudget isn't simply about numbers. It is about the policies behind the \nnumbers that have an impact on real people who would not have access to \nhealth care in the absence of Medicaid.\n  Medicaid is the absolute bedrock of our nation's health care system. \nIt is the fulfillment of the promise the Federal Government has made to \nour Nation's most vulnerable citizens that they will have access to \naffordable health care when times get tough.\n  It finances nearly 40 percent of all births in the United States. \nWithout it, many pregnant women would forego the prenatal visits and \npregnancy-related care that are vital for a child's healthy start. \nMedicaid provides coverage for one in five of our Nation's children, \nmany of whom would otherwise be uninsured. It pays for half of all \nnursing home care and is the largest single purchaser of long-term care \nservices in the country.\n  In every State throughout our Nation, Medicaid keeps hospitals, \ndoctors, nursing homes, and clinics operating in our communities. And, \nmore importantly, it provides our most vulnerable citizens--pregnant \nwomen, children, the elderly, and the disabled--with access to \nmeaningful and affordable health care.\n  The $15 billion in Medicaid cuts being proposed by this \nadministration matter to the more than 50 million children, pregnant \nwomen, seniors, and disabled individuals who rely on Medicaid to meet \ntheir health care needs. Some of my colleagues would have you believe \nthat these cuts will have no impact at all on the number of kids \ncovered by Medicaid or the number of people who can access care in \nnursing homes. They even argue that these cuts will lead to Medicaid \nexpansions because Governors will have greater flexibility over the use \nof their dollars.\n  Well, these statements simply are not true. Fewer dollars do not \nequal\n\n[[Page S2884]]\n\ngreater flexibility. Fewer dollars mean that States, medical providers, \nand individual beneficiaries are going to have to shoulder more of the \nburden of rapidly rising health care costs. Cost-shifts of this \nmagnitude will undoubtedly lead to eligibility restrictions, benefit \nreductions, increased beneficiary cost-sharing, and provider payment \ncuts or freezes.\n  States are already struggling with the numerous unfunded mandates \nthat the Federal Government has passed down in recent years. Twenty-\nnine states, including my home state of West Virginia, are facing a \ndrop in their Federal medical assistance percentage, FMAP, next year \nbecause of a change in the statutory formula used to compute FMAP.\n  When the Medicare drug benefit starts on January 1, 2006, states will \nbe required to finance a significant portion of the cost. This will be \nthe first time since the enactment of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965 \nthat a specific Medicare benefit will be financed in significant part \nby state payments. The Congressional Budget Office, CBO estimates that, \nat a minimum, states will pay $48 billion toward the Medicare \nprescription drug benefit in the first 5 years. These costs could be \nmuch greater if more dual eligibles sign up for prescription drug \ncoverage or if States have to cover the costs of drugs for dual \neligibles that private drug plans do not cover.\n  West Virginia is scheduled to lose $36 million in Federal Medicaid \nmatching funds in 2006. And, it is still unclear how much \nimplementation of the Medicare prescription drug law will cost. The \nadditional cuts proposed by the President could result in West Virginia \nlosing as much as $100 million in Federal Medicaid matching funds next \nyear alone. The hospitals, doctors, nursing homes and clinics in my \nState cannot afford to absorb cuts of this magnitude.\n  This budget isn't about reducing the Federal deficit. Otherwise, we \nwould have eliminated the $70 billion in tax cuts that are contained \nthis budget. We would have taken an objective look at entitlement \nspending, and not just focused on the program that provides health \nbenefits to the working poor. We would have reined in excessive \noverpayments to private plans under Medicare and found ways to lower \nMedicare prescription drug costs.\n  This budget isn't about reforming the Medicaid program for the \nbetter. Otherwise, it would have addressed the real reasons Medicaid \ncost are going up: significant decreases in employer-sponsored health \ncoverage and Medicare's gaps in long-term care coverage. Otherwise, the \nadministration would have provided specific policy proposals for \nstrengthening Medicaid for the future, instead of vague ideas that even \nthe Congressional Budget Office could not score. If this budget were \ntruly about improving Medicaid, then the administration would not be \nattempting to shoehorn sweeping changes to the program into an \narbitrary budget number. Instead, Medicaid policy would determine the \nbudget number.\n  I would like to say to my colleagues that Democrats are happy to \ndiscuss strengthening the Medicaid program for the future. We are happy \nto work toward reforming the program for the better. However, the \nprescription for Medicaid must adequately address the larger problems \nwith our health care system that have an impact on the program. This is \nclearly not the case with this budget.\n  The bottom line is that this budget is about choices, and this \nadministration has chosen to unfairly target low-income working \nfamilies. This budget robs the most vulnerable in our society, while \nsimultaneously giving greater tax breaks to the rich. This is \nunacceptable. The Federal Government has a responsibility to maintain \nits commitment to Medicaid in order to protect access to health care \nfor working Americans.\n  That is why I oppose the $15 billion in Medicaid cuts included in the \nbudget and will vote for the Smith-Bingaman amendment to strike these \ncuts from the budget resolution.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I support the floor amendment offered by my \ncolleagues Senators Bingaman and Smith to strike the cuts from Medicaid \nand the State Children's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP, in the budget \nresolution.\n  The budget resolution includes $15.2 billion in reductions in \nmandatory programs that are part of Function 550, which is limited to \nhealth programs. Medicaid and SCHIP are the only mandatory programs in \nthis category that are under the jurisdiction of the Senate Finance \nCommittee.\n  The reductions in Medicaid included in the budget resolution will \nlead to further cuts in coverage and benefits for people in need. They \nwill prevent individuals from being able to access health care, which \nwill increase the burden on our public health system. In Hawaii, \nMedicaid and QUEST, Hawaii's program that provides health coverage \nthrough managed care plans for eligible lower income residents, \nprovided essential health services to nearly 190,000 people in 2002. \nFor those in rural Hawaii, particularly the elderly, Medicaid provides \naccess to health care that they might otherwise have to go without. The \nMedicaid cuts will further erode the ability of hospitals, clinics, \nphysicians, and other medical providers to meet the health care needs \nof our communities. These very same health care providers already are \nconfronted with inadequate reimbursements, rising costs, and an \nincreasing demand to provide care for the uninsured.\n  Without doubt, the Medicaid reductions in the Senate budget plan \nwould adversely affect health care coverage for low-income, uninsured \nAmericans. Medicaid programs are demanding a larger share of state \nspending than they have in recent years. Reducing the Federal \ncommitment to Medicaid will push additional costs to the States and \nincrease the number of people who are uninsured or under-insured.\n  Contributing to the obstacles in delivering quality health care to \nthose who need it the most are the critical losses that a majority of \nstates will see in their Federal Medical Assistance Percentage, FMAP. \nThe FMAP formula is designed to pay a higher FMAP to states with lower \nper capita income relative to the national average. According to the \nFederal Funds Information for States in its report, Fiscal year 2006 \nFMAP projections, 30 States are projected to experience cuts in their \nFMAP. This aggregate FMAP cut translates into an $850 million reduction \nin FY 2006 Medicaid grants to the impacted states. The five states \nfacing the largest FMAP decreases include Alaska, Wyoming, New Mexico, \nNorth Dakota, and South Dakota.\n  Hawaii faces a projected FMAP decline of 0.7 percent for FY 2006, \nwhich translates to a loss of $655,000 that could be used to provide \nhealth care to the citizens of my state. While it may seem like a small \ndecline compared to larger, more prosperous states, let me assure you \nthat the loss will be felt. In a June 2004 report by the Families USA \norganization, nearly one out of three people under the age of 65 went \nwithout health insurance for all or part of the 2-year period from \n2002-2003 in Hawaii. More alarming is the statistic that nearly 82 \npercent of uninsured people in Hawaii are members of working families. \nThe report went on to make the distinction that 61 percent of families \nin Hawaii, at or below 200 percent of the Federal poverty level, were \nuninsured.\n  In 2005, it is estimated that the Hawaii Medicaid program will spend \njust over $929 million. Of this, the Federal Government will contribute \nnearly $544 million. A substantial portion of Hawaii's health care \nindustry relies on Medicaid spending. In 2002, Medicaid payments \ninfused Hawaii's hospital system with more than $106 million. In \naddition, Medicaid is the primary payer for 70 percent of Hawaii's \ncertified nursing facility residents. Any cut in Medicaid funding will \nhave a profound effect on the economic viability of Hawaii's health \ncare system and its ability to care for people in need.\n  Medicaid costs for States have soared in recent years, driven by \nrising health-care costs, an aging population that relies largely on \nMedicaid to pay for nursing homes, and a recession that sent more \npeople to state-supported health care. Medicaid reform needs to have a \nreform discussion that is not driven by an arbitrary budget number.\n  While I support improving the health care delivery system for all \ncitizens of our country, the need for unique legislation to satisfy an \nessential, fundamental need is indicative of the flaws\n\n[[Page S2885]]\n\nin the current Medicaid system and an issue that the commission \nproposed by this amendment can address. Medicaid needs more funding, \nnot less. Escalating costs, the increase in the number of uninsured, \nFMAP cuts, and the clawback provision in the 2003 Medicare drug benefit \nlegislation only serve to put more pressure on state budgets. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment to restore dollars available to \nprovide essential Medicaid coverage to our country's most vulnerable \ncitizens.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Medicaid provides a critical safety net \nfor 53 million Americans--low-income children, parents, disabled and \nelderly citizens who have nowhere else to turn for health care. \nMedicaid now provides health care for 1 in every 5 children. It pays \nfor one-third of all births in this country, almost 40 percent of all \nlong-term care expenses, a sixth of all drug costs, and half of the \nStates' mental health services. It also is the largest payer of \nservices for AIDS patients.\n  What does it say about the leadership of this Senate that it proposes \nto cut $15 billion from Medicaid? That program provides health care for \n25 million children, 13 million low-income adults, and 15 million \ndisabled and elderly Americans. These cuts are proposed at the very \nsame time the budget once again proposes large new tax cuts tilted \ntoward higher income households. Our colleagues say they have no choice \nbut to make these cuts to Medicaid because of the large deficit. But \nthe large deficit was created by the large tax breaks for the rich, not \nby Medicaid.\n  The budget is a blueprint of Congress' priorities for the Nation. \nThis Congress once again shows that it cares more about those who have \nthe most than it does about those who have the least. How can we \npossibly continue to give tax breaks each year to the wealthy, and \nreduce health benefits for the poor to pay for them. Those are not the \nvalues we stand for.\n  In fact, the budget cuts in the Senate resolution are even deeper \nthan the cuts proposed in the administration budget. Even if the \nFinance Committee adopts every cut the President proposed to Medicaid, \nthey will still need to come up with an additional $7 billion in cuts \nto meet the target in this bill.\n  We need to maintain the Federal commitment to medical care for the \npoorest of the poor. If we weaken the Federal commitment, these men, \nwomen, and children will go without care, or show up at the emergency \nroom door. We know that lack of access to care causes harmful \nconsequences. We cannot abandon our responsibility to provide for those \namong us who are less fortunate.\n  This budget will force the States to pick up costs that the Federal \nGovernment should be covering. It will result in a massive shift of \nresponsibility from the Federal Government to the States. We already \nhave shifted much of the cost of the elderly to the States, costs that \nshould be covered by Medicare. More than 40 percent of all Medicaid \nexpenditures are used to fill the gaps in Medicare. Medicaid pays for \ntheir long-term care, their prescription drugs, and their cost-sharing.\n  Medicaid is the largest source of long-term care today. The more than \n7 million persons who are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid are \namong the most vulnerable. Seventy percent of them have incomes below \n$10,000. Nearly one in four live in long-term care facilities. They are \ntwice as likely to have Alzheimer's disease, and more likely to have \ndiabetes and stroke than others on Medicare beneficiaries. They are a \nsmall proportion of the Medicaid population, but their costs are among \nthe highest. Medicare will start paying for prescription drugs for the \ndually eligible next January, but the states will see little or no \nrelief. In fact, because of the so-called ``clawback'' formula in the \nprescription drug law, many states will end up sending the federal \ngovernment more money for picking up these drug costs than they would \nhave spent without the drug bill. What kind of relief is that?\n  We can all agree that we need to improve Medicaid. We have an \nopportunity to improve the program, but that is not what this budget \ndoes. This budget is not driven by policy--it is driven by an arbitrary \nnumber that was picked by the leadership as their deficit reduction \ntarget. The Federal Government needs to maintain its commitment to \nhealth care, not try to weaken it and dump the costs on the states. We \nneed to help the states provide health care, not cut federal funding \nand put a bigger burden on them. But that is exactly what this budget \ndoes.\n  Some on the other side describe these cuts as minor, or as reductions \nin growth, or as necessary Medicaid reforms. Don't believe a word of \nthat. Nothing is further from the truth. There are no policy reasons \nfor these cuts. They are large, harmful cuts that are being made so \nthat they can say they are reducing the deficit. But if you look at the \nnumbers, this budget doesn't reduce the deficit--it increases it over \nthe next 5 years. Despite these harmful cuts in Medicaid, they add yet \nanother round of tax breaks. Where is the fairness in that? It is Robin \nHood in reverse steal from the poor to give to wealthy.\n  Our colleagues say we need to cut Medicaid because it is growing too \nfast. The reason is obvious. It is growing because over the past 4 \nyears, more people are losing their jobs and their health care, falling \ninto poverty, and finding themselves with no option but Medicaid. That \nis what is responsible for Medicaid's growth.\n  Over the past 4 years, the number of uninsured has climbed from 40 \nmillion to 45 million, and it is expected to continue growing for the \nforeseeable future. The number of uninsured would have been much \ngreater without Medicaid. During the same time period that the number \nof uninsured increased by 5 million, the number of Americans on \nMedicaid grew by 9 million. If Medicaid had not been available to them, \nwe would be facing 54 million uninsured. Is that the kind of policy the \nNation wants to promote?\n  Medicaid enrollment grew 40 percent over the past 5 years, and it is \nprojected to grow another 5 percent this year. Enrollment growth is \ncausing Medicaid's rising cost, not inefficiencies, or fraud, or abuse. \nIn fact, the cost of private employer-sponsored health insurance has \ngrown at twice the rate of Medicaid. The percentage of Americans with \nemployer-sponsored health insurance fell, but the number of Americans \non Medicaid grew, and that growth was largely caused by the bad \neconomy, the continuing decline of employer health insurance, and the \nsoaring cost of prescription drugs.\n  Cutting costs is the wrong prescription for Medicaid. This amendment \nwill give us time to assess Medicaid fairly, and base any changes on \nsound policy, not arbitrary budget cuts. These cuts will have a real \nimpact on real people. Millions may lose their only hope for health \ncare if we allow these cuts to stand. Emergency rooms will have more \nand more patients with nowhere else to turn, and the Nation's health \ncare safety net will continue to fray. That is not the kind of budget \nwe ought to be approving.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for the Smith-Bingaman amendment. Our \ngoal on Medicaid is to improve it, not dismantle it.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, over the last century, the Nation has \nwitnessed tremendous advances in medical science and technology. We now \nhave treatments and cures for diseases and conditions that were at one \ntime surely fatal. Thirty years ago, if children developed cancer, \ndoctors couldn't save their lives. Today, more than three-quarters of \nchildren with cancer survive. Heart disease is no longer the leading \ncause of death because of significant improvements in medical treatment \nand surgical procedures. Americans with AIDS are living many years \nlonger and spending more time at home and not in hospitals because of \nnew drug cocktails that prevent infections and other deadly \ncomplications.\n  The unfortunate and bitter irony is that while the number of medical \nbreakthroughs continues to increase, so does the number of Americans \nwho will never benefit from them. Right now, 45 million Americans have \nno health care coverage, and this number continues to rise. Over a 2-\nyear period, over 85 million Americans have not had continuous \ninsurance coverage. In this land of plenty and opportunity, 350,000 \nuninsured children with earaches and sore throats will never see a \ndoctor. Sixteen million uninsured Americans\n\n[[Page S2886]]\n\ncannot afford to fill prescriptions. Uninsured women who develop breast \ncancer are 40 percent more likely to die, as are 50 percent of \nuninsured men with prostate cancer. The Institute of Medicine has \nreported that 18,000 adults die every year because they are uninsured.\n  For many Americans, Medicaid represents their only real hope of \nobtaining health care. Nationally, 53 million people rely on Medicaid \ncoverage, including 25 million children, 13 million low-income adults, \nand 15 million disabled and elderly Americans. Nearly 16 percent of \npeople who live in rural areas have Medicaid coverage, including more \nthan 1 in 4 children in these areas. One quarter of African Americans \nand 20 percent of Hispanics rely on Medicaid, as do 9 percent of women.\n  In my home State of Illinois, Medicaid provides health coverage for 2 \nmillion residents. Over 30 percent of children in Illinois receive \nhealth care through KidCare. Nearly 65 percent of nursing home \nresidents rely on Medicaid coverage.\n  Despite Medicaid's critical role in providing access to care, the \nRepublican budget proposes to cut Medicaid by $15 billion. This cut \ntranslates into an estimated $287 million loss for Illinois. Experts \nreport this funding could provide health care coverage for 200,000 \nchildren or 135,000 working parents in my State.\n  Some of my colleagues argue that we have no choice but to make large \ncuts to Medicaid because of the deficit. But these deficits were \ncreated by huge tax breaks for the rich, not by Medicaid, and we should \nnot balance the budget at the expense of health care for low-income \nchildren, their parents, pregnant women and seniors. We cannot keep tax \ncuts for the rich and cut basic health care for the poor. We cannot \nretreat from our Federal commitment to Medicaid and leave the States \nholding the bag.\n  I agree the Medicaid Program is not perfect. The Smith-Bingaman \namendment to create a commission to study the program and make \nrecommendations for improvement is a reasonable approach. Sound policy, \nnot politics or deficit concerns, should guide any changes to the \nMedicaid Program, and I am not convinced that we have examined or \ndiscussed the full range of Medicaid-related issues and options before \nus.\n  We cannot and should not deny millions of Americans access to basic \nhealth care. Medicaid is the Nation's safety net, and we should \nstrengthen it, not destroy it. I am going to vote yes for the Smith-\nBingaman amendment to strike proposed cuts in funding for Medicaid, and \nI urge my colleagues to join me.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 229\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). Without objection, the pending \namendment will be set aside, and the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg], for Mr. Frist, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 229.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding medicaid \n  reconciliation legislation consistent with recommendations from the \n                secretary of health and human services)\n\n       Beginning on page 58, strike line 11 and all that follows \n     through page 61, line 24, and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 504. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING MEDICAID \n                   RECONCILIATION LEGISLATION CONSISTENT WITH \n                   RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH \n                   AND HUMAN SERVICES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Medicaid program provides essential health care and \n     long-term care services to more than 50,000,000 low-income \n     children, pregnant women, parents, individuals with \n     disabilities, and senior citizens. It is a Federal guarantee \n     that ensures the most vulnerable will have access to needed \n     medical services.\n       (2) The Medicaid program will spend $189,000,000,000 in \n     fiscal year 2006.\n       (3) During the period from fiscal year 2006 through fiscal \n     year 2010, the Medicaid program will spend \n     $1,100,000,000,000.\n       (4) Over the same period, spending for the Medicaid program \n     will increase by 40 percent.\n       (5) Medicaid provides critical access to long-term care and \n     other services for the elderly and individuals living with \n     disabilities, and is the single largest provider of long-term \n     care services. Medicaid also pays for personal care and other \n     supportive services that are typically not provided by \n     private health insurance or Medicare, but are necessary to \n     enable individuals with spinal cord injuries, developmental \n     disabilities, neurological degenerative diseases, serious and \n     persistent mental illnesses, HIV/AIDS, and other chronic \n     conditions to remain in the community, to work, and to \n     maintain independence.\n       (6) Medicaid supplements the Medicare program for more than \n     6,000,000 low-income elderly or disabled Medicare \n     beneficiaries, assisting them with their Medicare premiums \n     and co-insurance, wrap-around benefits, and the costs of \n     nursing home care that Medicare does not cover. The Medicaid \n     program spent nearly $40,000,000,000 on uncovered Medicare \n     services in 2002.\n       (7) This resolution assumes $163,000,000 in spending to \n     extend Medicare cost-sharing under the Medicaid program for \n     the Medicare part B premium for qualifying individuals \n     through 2006.\n       (8) Medicaid provides health insurance for more than 1/4 of \n     America's children and is the largest purchaser of maternity \n     care, paying for more than 1/3 of all the births in the \n     United States each year. Medicaid also provides critical \n     access to care for children with disabilities, covering more \n     than 70 percent of poor children with disabilities.\n       (9) More than 16,000,000 women depend on Medicaid for their \n     health care. Women comprise the majority of seniors (71 \n     percent) on Medicaid. Half of nonelderly women with permanent \n     mental or physical disabilities have health coverage through \n     Medicaid. Medicaid provides treatment for low-income women \n     diagnosed with breast or cervical cancer in every State.\n       (10) Medicaid is the Nation's largest source of payment for \n     mental health services, HIV/AIDS care, and care for children \n     with special needs. Much of this care is either not covered \n     by private insurance or limited in scope or duration. \n     Medicaid is also a critical source of funding for health care \n     for children in foster care and for health services in \n     schools.\n       (11) Medicaid funds help ensure access to care for all \n     Americans. Medicaid is the single largest source of revenue \n     for the Nation's safety net hospitals, health centers, and \n     nursing homes, and is critical to the ability of these \n     providers to adequately serve all Americans.\n       (12) Medicaid serves a major role in ensuring that the \n     number of Americans without health insurance, approximately \n     45,000,000 in 2003, is not substantially higher. The system \n     of Federal matching for State Medicaid expenditures ensures \n     that Federal funds will grow as State spending increases in \n     response to unmet needs, enabling Medicaid to help buffer the \n     drop in private coverage during recessions. More than \n     4,800,000 Americans lost employer-sponsored coverage between \n     2000 and 2003, during which time Medicaid enrolled an \n     additional 8,400,000 Americans.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Committee on Finance shall not report a \n     reconciliation bill that achieves spending reductions that \n     would--\n       (A) undermine the role the Medicaid program plays as a \n     critical component of the health care system of the United \n     States;\n       (B) cap Federal Medicaid spending, or otherwise shift \n     Medicaid cost burdens to State or local governments and their \n     taxpayers and health providers, forcing a reduction in access \n     to essential health services for low-income elderly \n     individuals, individuals with disabilities, and children and \n     families; or\n       (C) undermine the Federal guarantee of health insurance \n     coverage Medicaid provides, which would threaten not only the \n     health care safety net of the United States, but the entire \n     health care system;\n       (2) the Secretary of Health and Human Services, working \n     with bipartisan, geographically diverse members of the \n     National Governors Association and in consultation with key \n     stakeholders, shall make recommendations for changes to the \n     Medicaid program that reflect the principles specified in \n     paragraph (3); and\n       (3) the Committee on Finance, consistent with such \n     recommendations, shall report a reconciliation bill that--\n       (A) allows any Medicaid savings to be shared by the Federal \n     and State governments;\n       (B) would emphasize State flexibility through voluntary \n     options for States; and\n       (C) would not cause Medicaid recipients to lose coverage.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield back such time as I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMaryland is recognized.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I ask what the time situation is and \nthe parliamentary situation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will have 15 minutes equally \ndivided on the amendment.\n  Mr. SARBANES.

Madam President, first, let me say at the outset, \nbecause I neglected to do so the other day in the general debate, that \nI commend both the chairman of the Budget Committee and the ranking \nminority member of the Budget Committee for the fair and expeditious \nway in which consideration of this resolution was conducted in the \ncommittee. We have a new chairman. It is always a challenge, and I want \nto express to him my recognition of the fair process conducted in the \ncommittee, which is, of course, essential to the Senate working through \ncontroversial issues and trying to reach a solution.\n  This amendment would restore approximately $1.89 billion in cuts that \nare in the administration's proposed budget to the Community \nDevelopment Block Grant Program and a number of other development \nprograms that have been proposed for elimination. It would bring all of \nthose programs back to the 2005 level. It is my view, and the view of a \nmajority of the Members of the Senate expressed in a letter sent to \nChairman Gregg and Senator Conrad, that the administration of these 18 \nprograms should remain as they are currently constituted.\n  In other words, the community development block grant should continue \nto be housed at HUD, the rural programs at USDA, and this effort to \nshift all of them over to the Department of Commerce, an idea which has \nnot been considered, not examined, not brought to the floor of the \nCongress, ought not to be carried through.\n  I am going to focus on the CDBG Program primarily because very \nsubstantial cuts have been proposed in the budget.\n  Roy Bernardi, the Deputy Secretary of HUD, a former mayor of \nSyracuse, has said that the foundation of virtually all community and \neconomic development occurring across the Nation is CDBG. This is the \nDeputy Secretary of HUD, formerly mayor of Syracuse. He said:\n\n       We must continue to support and build upon programs that \n     work, those that have a proven record of flexibility and the \n     ability to fit in with locally determined needs. CDBG is such \n     a program and ranks among our Nation's oldest and most \n     successful programs.\n\n  I have two letters strongly supporting full funding for the CDBG \nProgram at HUD, signed by a host of State, city, and county \norganizations, such as the National League of Cities, the U.S. \nConference of Mayors, National Association of Counties, and the \nNational Governors Association.\n  I ask unanimous consent those two letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                    March 4, 2005.\n     Hon. Judd Gregg,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Budget, U.S. Senate, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. Kent Conrad,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Budget, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Gregg and Ranking Member Conrad: As you \n     prepare to consider the FY 2006 Budget Resolution, we the \n     undersigned organizations want to convey our opposition to \n     proposed cuts in the FY 2006 Department of Housing and Urban \n     Development (HUD) budget. We respectfully request that you \n     craft a Budget Resolution that will provide adequate budget \n     authority for all HUD programs and maintain important \n     community and economic development functions and funding at \n     HUD.\n       Of particular concern to us is the proposed elimination of \n     the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program along \n     with 17 other federal community and economic development \n     grant programs. We oppose in the strongest terms the \n     elimination of CDBG, and we urge you to reject the proposed \n     ``Strengthening America's Communities'' (SAC) Initiative and \n     support full funding for the CDBG program at HUD.\n       As you know, the FY 2006 Budget would effectively eliminate \n     18 community and economic development programs, including \n     CDBG, and create an entirely new initiative to be operated by \n     the Department of Commerce. Proposed funding for this \n     ``consolidated'' program would be $3.7 billion, a 35% \n     reduction in funding when compared to total FY 2005 \n     appropriations for the 18 programs targeted for elimination \n     under the initiative. Consider that Congress funded the CDBG \n     program alone at $4.7 billion in FY 2005, $1 billion more \n     than the entire proposed budget for the SAC initiative.\n       Eliminating these 18 programs and substantially reducing \n     the federal investment in community and economic development \n     would have a devastating impact on state and local \n     governments. Each of these existing programs is an important \n     and necessary component of urban, suburban, and rural \n     communities' efforts to revitalize neighborhoods, expand \n     affordable housing opportunities and create economic growth. \n     We believe that CDBG is the glue that holds these efforts \n     together.\n       For 30 years, the CDBG program has served as the \n     cornerstone of the federal government's commitment to \n     partnering with state and local governments to strengthen our \n     nation's communities and improve the quality of life for low- \n     and moderate-income Americans. Since its inception, CDBG has \n     made a real and positive difference in communities across \n     America, and there is no shortage of CDBG success stories. \n     Many of the groups that signed this letter have been working \n     in partnership with HUD and the Office of Management and \n     Budget (OMB) in a good faith effort to improve the CDBG \n     program's ability to measure performance. As a result of this \n     effort, HUD plans to unveil a new outcome-based measurement \n     system in early 2005. As recently as November 2004, OMB \n     endorsed this undertaking. We believe this new system will \n     verify what is already obvious: CDBG works.\n       CDBG's emphasis on flexibility and local determination of \n     priority needs through citizen participation is allowing \n     state and local governments to achieve real results. \n     According to HUD's ``Highlights of FY 2004 CDBG \n     Accomplishments,'' CDBG funding led to the creation or \n     retention of more than 90,000 jobs in the last year alone. \n     Thanks to CDBG, in 2004 over 130,000 rental units and \n     single-family homes were rehabbed, 85,000 individuals \n     received employment training, 1.5 million youth were \n     served by after-school enrich-\n\n[[Page S2888]]\n\n     ment programs and other activities, and child care \n     services were provided to 100,065 children in 205 \n     communities across the country. CDBG also funded nearly \n     700 crime prevention and awareness programs. Additionally, \n     more than 11,000 Americans became homeowners last year \n     thanks to CDBG funding. CDBG remains a smart, efficient \n     form of investment, as it continues to leverage around \n     three dollars for every dollar of federal investment. It \n     certainly did not come as a surprise to us when HUD \n     Secretary Alphonso Jackson, in a March 2nd appearance \n     before the House Financial Services Committee, stated, \n     ``The program works.''\n       The CDBG program's design is especially successful at \n     targeting resources to those who need them most. In 2004, 95 \n     percent of funds expended by entitlement grantees and 96 \n     percent of state CDBG funds expended were for activities that \n     principally benefited low- and moderate-income persons. A \n     full half of persons directly benefiting from CDBG-assisted \n     activities were minorities, including African Americans, \n     Hispanics, Asians, and American Indians. Despite the fact \n     that economic challenges and pockets of poverty exist in \n     almost all American communities, adoption of the SAC \n     initiative would almost certainly result in a complete loss \n     of funding for a significant number of communities.\n       For all of the reasons detailed above, we believe that CDBG \n     should remain at HUD and receive full funding of at least \n     $4.7 billion in FY 2006. We also believe it is premature for \n     the Budget Resolution to even address such a far-reaching \n     change to the program before the numerous committees of \n     jurisdiction have had sufficient opportunity to hold \n     appropriate hearings on the topic. We urge you to craft a \n     Budget Resolution reflecting those sentiments. More \n     specifically, we strongly encourage you to include hnguage in \n     your Resolution clearly stating that the Resolution ``does \n     not assume enactment of the proposed `Strengthening America's \n     Communities' Initiative nor the proposed reduction in funding \n     for the CDBG program included in the Administration's FY 2006 \n     budget.''\n       We thank you for your favorable consideration of this \n     request.\n           Sincerely,\n       Council of State Community Development Agencies.\n       The Enterprise Foundation.\n       Habitat for Humanity International.\n       Housing Assistance Council.\n       Local Initiatives Support Corporation.\n       National Association for County Community and Economic \n     Development.\n       National Association of Counties.\n       National Association of Housing and Redevelopment \n     Officials.\n       National Association of Local Housing Finance Agencies.\n       National Community Development Association.\n       National Conference of Black Mayors.\n       National League of Cities.\n       National Low Income Housing Coalition.\n       United States Conference of Mayors.\n\n                                                   March 15, 2005.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     Majority Leader, Office of the Senate Majority Leader, \n         Capitol Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Minority Leader, Office of the Senate Minority Leader, \n         Capitol Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Frist and Minority Leader Reid: As a \n     diverse coalition of organizations representing the nation's \n     community and economic development practitioners, elected \n     officials and constituency groups, we are writing to express \n     our overwhelming opposition to the Administration's proposal \n     to eliminate 18 federal community and economic development \n     programs and reduce federal grant assistance for distressed \n     and underserved local communities by $2 billion each year. We \n     strongly urge you to restore these vital resources as part of \n     the FY2006 congressional budget resolution.\n       At a time when nearly every American business and community \n     is confronting intense competition from emerging and \n     developing nations, the federal government should be \n     expanding its resources and assistance for local community \n     and economic development. Instead, the Administration is \n     recommending a 34 percent funding cut and more unfunded \n     mandates for our nation's state and local governments. The \n     President's plan would also significantly diminish and \n     eviscerate the federal role in community development projects \n     such as providing first-time access to clean and drinkable \n     water, affordable housing and community facilities for our \n     nation's poorer areas and citizens.\n       From our perspective as the constituencies at the \n     frontlines of community and economic development, we feel \n     strongly that the current federal investment of $5.7 billion \n     each year is a solid, wise and effective investment in our \n     nation's local communities. While we understand and recognize \n     the current federal budget climate, we must point out that \n     the proposed funding cut represents less than one-half of a \n     percent of last year's federal deficit. More importantly, the \n     $2 billion reduction in federal investments will result in \n     the loss of at least $18 billion in matching and leveraging \n     investments by the private sector and other governmental and \n     nonprofit programs at the state and local level.\n       Our nation's distressed regions, communities and \n     neighborhoods need national leadership, models of innovation \n     and matching funds for locally-led projects and initiatives. \n     Instead, we fear the Administration's proposal will result in \n     more communities marking time in the land of lost \n     opportunity.\n           Sincerely,\n       American Planning Association.\n       American Public Works Association.\n       Association for Enterprise Opportunity.\n       Center for Rural Affairs.\n       Coalition of Community Development Financial Institutions.\n       US Conference of Mayors.\n       Council of State Community Development Agencies.\n       Local Initiatives Support Corporation.\n       National Association of Counties.\n       National Association of Development Organizations.\n       National Association of Regional Councils.\n       National Association of RC Councils.\n       National Association of Local Housing Finance Agencies.\n       National Community Capital Association.\n       National Community Development Association.\n       National Farmers Union.\n       National Low Income Housing Coalition.\n       National Rural Funders Collaborative.\n       National Rural Housing Coalition.\n       Northeast-Midwest Institute.\n       Rural Community Advancement Program.\n       The Enterprise Foundation.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, the private sector strongly supports \nCDBG.\n  Doug Woodruff, Senior Vice President of the Bank of America, said at \na recent Hill briefing:\n\n       From the perspective of the private sector, the CDBG \n     program provides a valuable and irreplaceable function in the \n     continuum of efforts that surround many revitalization \n     projects.\n\n       The success of CDBG is unquestionable. It has produced over \n     2 million jobs in its 30-year history, and generated more \n     than $50 billion in personal earnings.\n\n  I want to address one other point; that is, how do we restore the \nfunding? That is always a question. It is a matter of priorities.\n  This amendment proposes to restore the funding by eliminating tax \nloopholes that were closed by this body in the last Congress. Ninety-\ntwo Members voted to do this. A lot of those provisions were dropped in \nconference.\n  Just 2 weeks ago, colleagues supported closing these loopholes in the \ncontext of the minimum wage debate. Obviously, these loopholes should \nbe closed. The headlines are screaming ``abusive tax shelter schemes.'' \nThe GAO recently reported that 60 of the Nation's largest corporations \nused and abused tax shelter services in recent years.\n  Some want to cut other programs but this would mean taking from Peter \nto pay Paul. We have a perfect opportunity here to recoup valuable \nrevenues that are now being lost through these tax shelter schemes. \nThat is the tradeoff in this amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes forty seconds.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield half of that time to the Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I appreciate very much having an \nopportunity to support this amendment and to be a cosponsor. I thank my \ncolleague from Maryland for his leadership.\n  This is a small way in which we support local communities to create \njobs, revitalize neighborhoods, support infrastructure, water, sewer, \nroads--those things that help create jobs.\n  From the highlights of the 2004 CDBG accomplishments, they show very \nspecifically that they created or had the retention of more than 90,000 \njobs last year. In a State like Michigan, this is incredibly important. \nOver 130,000 rental units and single-family homes were rehabbed, 85,000 \nindividuals received employment training, 1.5 million children were \nserved with afterschool enrichment programs, childcare services were \nprovided to over 100,000 children and their families, 700 crime \nprevention and awareness programs, and 11,000 Americans became \nhomeowners.\n  What is more important to each of us as parents than to be able to \nmake sure we have shelter and a home for our children?\n  These are partnerships with local communities, small amounts of \nrevenue that we bring together with our communities to make major \nimpacts on the quality of life. That is what we are about--to partner \nwith our local communities.\n  I urge the support of the amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support the Sarbanes \namendment, which will prevent one the greatest failings of this \nPresident's Budget--its elimination of more than $2 billion\n\n[[Page S2889]]\n\nfrom critically needed economic development and social service programs \nand the proposed consolidation of 18 valuable Federal programs into a \nsingle block grant under the so-called ``Strengthening America's \nCommunities Initiative.''\n  I am heartened that so many of my colleagues have come together in \nopposition to these cuts--55 Senators wrote to the Budget Committee in \nan important show of bipartisanship 2 weeks ago.\n  Under the President's plan most American cities can expect at least a \n35 percent cut in assistance from the Federal Government to help secure \ninvestment, house the poor, provide health care to the uninsured, and \ncounsel the abused.\n  If the administration dislikes helping cities, they should have the \ndecency to say so, instead of this charade where they try to hide \nmassive cuts under the cloak of streamlining.\n  Their proposal insults the intelligence of mayors, community \ndevelopment officials, and social service agencies across the country--\nby cynically suggesting that somehow these cuts are going to make life \nbetter and be helpful to cities across America.\n  What makes these cuts so objectionable is they come at a time of \ngreat stress and difficulty for Americans who live in poverty. 1We are \nthe wealthiest nation on earth. We are blessed with great abundance. \nYet despite our great wealth, too many of our fellow citizens remain in \nthe shadows, the prisoners of persistent and increasing urban and rural \npoverty.\n  The numbers are alarming. Today, nearly 36 million Americans live in \npoverty, and 3 million more working Americans live in hunger or on the \nverge of hunger today than in 2000. One out of five American children \ngoes to bed hungry each night. We have it in our power to eliminate so \nmuch of this poverty.\n  At the very least, we shouldn't do anything to make it worse which is \nexactly what this ``Strengthening America's Communities'' plan from the \nWhite House would do. In the powerful words of the Gospel, ``To whom \nmuch is given, much is required.''\n  We need to pass the Sarbanes amendment, so that the work of tens of \nthousands of public officials, health officials, educators, community \ndevelopment experts toiling to improve living conditions in our cities \nisn't made any more difficult.\n  Mayors across the country on the front lines every day are struggling \nto create new jobs and attract capital investment. They are struggling \nto educate and house the children of the poor, and they are not fooled \nby this administration's misleading slogan ``Strengthening America's \nCommunities,'' because they know it is the exact opposite.\n  My friend, Mayor Clare Higgins of Northampton isn't fooled. She \nrecently wrote me urging Congress to save Community Development Block \nGrants, one of the very few tools she has to meet Northampton's needs \nand one of the biggest programs on the President's chopping block.\n  Most recently, Northampton invested $300,000 of these Federal funds \nto acquire the Interfaith Cold Weather Emergency Homeless shelter--the \nonly cold weather shelter serving Hampshire County. It is a \ncollaborative effort between area church groups and ServiceNet Inc., a \nlocal human service provider. Without these funds, there would be no \ncold weather shelter in Hampshire County.\n  Mayor Higgins wrote:\n\n       Without CDBG funds, the City will be unable to develop a \n     planned senior center, public services that provide emergency \n     food, homeless services, child care and after school \n     programming, literacy skills and health care would not be \n     funded; the City's ability to promote and develop affordable \n     housing will be severely limited, parks and playgrounds will \n     not be improved, and the City's ability to provide funding \n     for the redevelopment of the former Northampton State \n     Hospital will cease.\n\n  Mayor Tom Menino of Boston--the former head of the U.S. Conference of \nMayors--isn't fooled. He knows what's at stake and recently conducted \nan analysis of the budget cuts on his city.\n\n       Since 1998 alone--\n\n  Mayor Menino stated at a recent press conference--\n\n     the City of Boston has permitted almost 5,000 new units of \n     affordable housing and permitted more than 12,000 other \n     units. We have invested a total of $7.8 million in CDBG funds \n     in 19 large developments that have created a total of 1,175 \n     apartments including 517 units for the formerly homeless.\n\n  He went on to say that this budget for housing, community \ndevelopment, and social services threatens to ``throw the nation into \nthe dark ages.''\n  That doesn't sound like he believes his community will be \n``strengthened'' by the Bush administration's cuts.\n  Mayor Menino believes the President's budget will mean the loss of $8 \nmillion in Community Development Block Grant funding for Boston and the \nloss of $5.5 million in Community Services Block Grant funding.\n  On any given night in the City of Boston, there are nearly 6,000 \nhomeless men, women, and children in the city. Shelters in \nMassachusetts have been overflowing for 6 straight years, with 4 beds \navailable for every 5 adults.\n  Yet the very support he has relied on to help build 133 units of \naffordable housing for homeless people, to help 500 low-income \nhomeowners rehabilitate their properties, and to provide 130 first-time \nhomebuyers with their down payments is now in grave danger.\n  How exactly is the mayor supposed to strengthen Boston when the \nsupport he needs to do it is getting the axe under this budget?\n  Other local officials tell the same story.\n  A letter I recently received from Elizabeth Cohen, Executive Director \nof Rape Crises Services of Greater Lowell, says:\n\n       Dear Senator Kennedy:\n       We need your help . . . We use CDBG Funds to support \n     multilingual sexual assault support services. We are the only \n     program in the Greater Lowell area and the only agency to \n     have certified rape crisis counselors who speak Spanish and \n     Khmer. With the elimination of this funding, we will have to \n     cut back on these services, which will result in 100 Khmer-\n     speaking clients being unable to have a counselor in their \n     language . . .\n       As you know, immigrants and refugees already have many \n     struggles when they move to a new city or new country. Having \n     to deal with the trauma of sexual violence on top of the \n     difficulties in housing, education, food and school can \n     paralyze a family . . . Please don't let the President take \n     away this funding for Lowell.\n\n  I ask the Senate, does this sound like we are strengthening \ncommunities with this budget?\n  In Lawrence--one of Massachusetts' and the Nation's poorest cities--\nCDBG funds have been used to amazing effect to leverage nearly $110 \nmillion of investment in the remedation and redevelopment of an \nabandoned industrial brownfield site known as the Lawrence Gateway \nProject.\n  The city has invested nearly $6 million of its CDBG funds in the \nproject and formed a model partnership with GenCorp, a private company \nthat has invested $75 million so far in the redevelopment.\n  Today, Lawrence is continuing to use its CDBG funds to meet debt \nservice payments on loans made to clean the properties.\n  Without these Federal funds, the partnership with GenCorp could not \nexist, and the City would not be able to do anything about this 15-\nacre, fenced-in, desolate property, which would stand as a stark \nreminder of the city's industrial past rather than as a symbol of the \nkind of innovative development needed to build a stronger future for \nthe city.\n  How will we be strengthening Lawrence by eliminating one of the best \nways they have to create investment partnerships with private \nbusinesses?\n  In addition to the community development block grant, the Sarbanes \namendment will also preserve the community services block grant. These \nfunds strengthen communities by funding local agencies, which provide \nservices such as literacy, child health care, after school activities, \nlow-income housing, food stamps, emergency shelter, and other support.\n  In Worcester, Patsy Lewis of the Worcester Community Action Council \nsent me a letter on just how devastating the President's plans to \neliminate this program are.\n  Simply put, Patsy wrote, they would have to reduce or close their GED \nclasses and partnerships for at-risk students in the public schools. \nThe agency may even be forced to close.\n  Perhaps the President can explain how a community can be \n``strengthened'' by eliminating GED programs.\n  Another person who isn't fooled about the effect of the President's \ndevastating ``Strengthening America's\n\n[[Page S2890]]\n\nCommunities,'' budget cuts is Steve Teasdale, executive director of the \nMain South Community Development Corporation in Worcester, which is \ndoing incredible work attacking poverty in one of Massachusetts most \neconomically distressed neighborhoods.\n  The Main South Community Development Corporation was formed in 1986, \nwhen concerned citizens came together to revitalize the neighborhood \nsurrounding Clark University, which was reeling from the economic and \nsocial devastation wrought by the loss of Worcester's industrial base.\n  The obstacles in Main South's path are considerable:\n  Between 1960 and 2000, the population of the neighborhood fell 35 \npercent from 5,600 to 3,700. The housing stock fell by 29 percent.\n  Over 40 percent of the population lives below the poverty line--and \n17 percent have incomes lower than 50 percent of the poverty level.\n  At 11.4 percent, unemployment is double the city's rate of 6.3 \npercent. Over half of neighborhood households are headed by single \nparents.\n  The challenges confronting the community are great, and Federal funds \nmade available through the community services block grant, the \ncommunity development block grant, and HUD's section 108 loan program \nhave been absolutely essential to the extraordinary successes of Main \nSouth in recent years.\n  CDBG funds were used at the outset to match a challenge grant from \nthe Ford Foundation that provided for the creation of the entity, and \nenabled Main South to attract outside investment. The result is \nnumerous accomplishments for the neighborhood.\n  Since 1988, Main South has acquired and rehabilitated 246 units of \nlow and moderate income housing--137 of which had been abandoned, and \n78 of which were fire-damaged, many from arson. The new homes added \n$500,000 annually to Worcester's tax rolls.\n  In addition, as a direct result of Main South's housing \nrehabilitation, over $20 million of investment has flowed back into the \ncommunity. Three ongoing private developments represent another $40 \nmillion of capital brought into the area.\n  Because of this Federal support, Main South has been able to be a \ntrue partner to Clark University, providing greater educational \nopportunity to neighborhood families--through a homework center, \ncomputer training classes, and career placement services.\n  In fact, because of the success of the partnership, Clark University \nlets neighborhood high school students take college classes and \nprovides full tuition to neighborhood students who make the grade \nacademically. This is extraordinary.\n  All of this has been made possible by the commitment and dedication \nof concerned community leaders--and the relatively modest sums of \nFederal support that are in danger with this budget before us.\n  Now Main South is taking on its greatest project, the Kilby-Gardner-\nHammond Neighborhood Project.\n  This partnership between the Boys and Girls Club, the City, Clark \nUniversity, and Main South will revitalize 30 acres of distressed \nindustrial property consisting of over 40 vacant, trash-strewn lots.\n  It aims to transform the neighborhood through the construction of a \n$7 million new Boys and Girls Club, between 70 to 80 affordable housing \nunits, and a new outdoor track and field complex for Clark University \nstudents and neighborhood children alike.\n  It is a transformative project, with a total investment impact of $30 \nmillion, much of that made possible by Section 108 loan guarantees that \nthis budget would eliminate.\n  Without Section 108, Teasdale and Main South would never have been \nable to acquire the properties to put this project together. This fact \nalone should cause us to reject the administration's ``strengthening \ncommunities'' proposal--because it will do nothing of the sort.\n\n       The question has to be asked, [Teasdale recently wrote] is \n     what would happen in these neighborhoods if such funding was \n     severely restricted or cut back. The answer can only be \n     assumed to be that the current problems in these areas would \n     get worse as capital investment once again withdraws to safer \n     havens and the social service needs of the resident \n     populations are stripped away. Crime, substance abuse, lack \n     of recreational and educational opportunities for the youth \n     of these areas and the incidence of poverty can all be \n     expected to increase if CDBG funding is no longer available.\n       The long-term social and financial costs associated with \n     such cut backs would be deeply damaging and although the \n     immediate impact would be most severely felt in our poorer \n     urban communities the resulting social distress would \n     eventually affect everyone.\n\n  Steve Teasdale and the leadership of the Main South Community \nDevelopment Corporation know more about the day-to-day challenges \naffecting our poorer urban communities and the difficulties associated \nwith urban economic revitalization than any of us, because they live it \nevery day.\n  I ask my colleagues to consider his words and vote for the Sarbanes \namendment, so we can save these critically important poverty prevention \nand economic development programs.\n  The Senate has a moral obligation not to make it harder for \ncommunities to solve the complicated issues of poverty and community \ndevelopment they face. Without the Sarbanes amendment, that is exactly \nwhat the Senate will allow to happen.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I rise today in support of Senator Sarbanes' \namendment to the Budget resolution that would restore funding to the \nCommunity Development Block Grant, CDBG, program and 17 other community \nand economic development programs proposed to be eliminated.\n  These programs are vital to our Nation's low and moderate income \nneighborhoods, as these are the communities who need these programs the \nmost.\n  Despite the proven results of the CDBG program and the other 17 \ncommunity and economic development programs, the fiscal year 2006 \nbudget proposes to consolidate these programs into a single Commerce \nDepartment program, resulting in a $1.89 billion cut.\n  In fiscal year 2005, the total budget for all 18 community and \neconomic development programs proposed to be consolidated, including \nCDBG, was $5.6 billion.\n  The administration's proposal only provides $3.7 billion for all 18 \nprograms, leading to a $1.89 billion cut in community development \nfunds.\n  This major reduction would have a devastating impact on our Nation's \nneediest communities and families who rely on these programs.\n  The loss of funds would also impact our Nation's economy, affecting \nsmall businesses who receive loans to finance projects that lead to the \ncreation and retention of jobs.\n  The Sarbanes' amendment would restore the proposed $1.89 billion cuts \nto the CDBG program and 17 other community and economic development \nprograms, such as the Community Development Loan Guarantees Program and \nCommunity Development Financial Institutions Fund; retain the \nadministration of these important programs at their current agencies. \nFor example, the CDBG program would remain at HUD and not be \ntransferred to the Department of Commerce; accomplish this by closing \ntax loopholes that an overwhelming majority of Senators voted to close \nin the last Congress.\n  While the vote to close tax loopholes was not enacted, it offers us a \nbipartisan way to save community and economic development programs.\n  The Community Development Block Grant Program is one of the most \neffective Federal domestic programs to revitalize urban and rural \ncommunities.\n  Over the past 30 years, cities, counties, and States have used more \nthan $105 billion in CDBG funds.\n  Over 95 percent of CDBG funds have gone to projects and activities \nprincipally benefiting low- and moderate-income individuals and \nfamilies such as housing development, recreation centers, clinics, day-\ncare facilities, and job creation and training.\n  According to HUD's ``Highlights of Fiscal Year 2004 CDBG \nAccomplishments,'' CDBG funding led to the creation and retention of \nmore than 90,000 jobs and 85,000 individuals received employment \ntraining nationwide in the last year alone.\n  In 2004, CDBG funds also helped with the rehabilitation of over \n130,000 rental units and single family homes, and allowed more than \n11,000 Americans to achieve the American Dream and become homeowners.\n  Additionally, nearly 700 crime prevention and awareness programs were\n\n[[Page S2891]]\n\nfunded and child care services were provided to 100,065 children in 205 \ncommunities across the country.\n  In my State of California, CDBG grants are critical to both urban and \nrural cities who rely on these funds to serve many low-income \nneighborhoods.\n  In fiscal year 2005, California received over $526 million in CDBG \nfunds, accounting for 12.8 percent of the total $4.1 billion grant \nprogram.\n  Of these funds, for example, California cities and counties received \n$82.8 million to the city of Los Angeles and $34.6 million to Los \nAngeles County; $24.6 million to the city of San Francisco; $11.5 \nmillion to Riverside County; $8.4 million to San Bernardino County; and \n$5.5 million to Fresno County.\n  Over the past 5 years, the diverse use of CDBG funds have allowed Los \nAngeles County to develop almost 9,000 affordable housing units, to \ncreate and preserve over 2,000 jobs, to remove over 32 million square \nfeet of graffiti, and to provide loans and technical assistance to over \n5,000 businesses among other programs.\n  Cuts to the CDBG program would greatly hurt Los Angeles County's low \nincome residents, the primary beneficiaries of CDBG-funded services.\n  According to 2000 Census data, 17.9 percent of Los Angeles County \nresidents had incomes below the poverty level, a far higher poverty \nrate than the 12.4 percent national average.\n  CDBG funds have not only benefited large urban counties like Los \nAngeles, but rural counties and cities in California as well. Here are \na few examples:\n  The city of Porterville in the Central Valley, which has a population \nof over 39,000 and an unemployment rate of 12.3 percent, has utilized \nCDBG funds to rehabilitate over 50 homes and assist more than 200 first \ntime homebuyers purchase their first home. Many of these first time \nhomebuyers are farm worker families.\n  The city of Victorville, located in San Bernardino County, served \nover 2,900 senior citizens, youth, homeless, disabled, victims of \ndomestic violence, and low-income families in 2004 with CDGB funds. \nOver $551,550 in CDBG grants were provided to low-income senior and \ndisabled homeowners to rehabilitate their homes, ensuring that \nVictorville citizens have a safe place to live.\n  As you can see, CDBG funds are crucial to closing the disparity \nbetween rich and poor in so many communities in California and \nthroughout the country.\n  As a former mayor, I know that CDBG resources are the most flexible \ndollars within city government, making them extremely valuable to the \neconomic vitality of local communities.\n  We cannot allow these funds to be cut.\n  To do so would send the wrong message to our country's neediest \ncommunities and families who rely on these funds the most.\n  Although CDBG is one of the main community development programs \nslated for consolidation and cuts in the fiscal year 2006 budget, there \nare 17 other important programs that would be impacted as well.\n  Specifically, I would like to touch on a few of the following \nprograms that have had a substantial benefit to counties and cities:\n  Community Development Loan Guarantees, section 108 loan program, \nfunded at $7 million in fiscal year 2005, is used often with CDBG funds \nto finance the construction of new facilities and economic development \nactivities such as business loans.\n  Through the section 108 Loan Program, the city of San Francisco has \nbeen able to construct 13 new childcare facilities which created 599 \nnew slots for children of low-income families, and created 200 new jobs \nthrough 8 business start ups and expansions.\n  Brownfields Economic Development Initiative, which received $24 \nmillion in fiscal year 2005, used with the section 108 loan program, \nhelps finance the redevelopment of seriously contaminated sites.\n  Cities throughout California and the Nation have received assistance \nthrough these funds to conduct environmental engineering assessments \nfor site cleanup activities.\n  This amendment would also restore funding for the Community \nDevelopment Financial Institutions, CDFI, which provides private sector \ninvestors with tax credits to raise money for hard to finance \ndevelopment projects in low-income areas, as well as other economic \ndevelopment programs. CDFI received $55 million in funding this year.\n  These community and economic development programs proposed to be cut \nin the fiscal year 2006 budget put Federal dollars where they are \nneeded most by funding projects that are unique to the problems they \naddress.\n  The proposed cuts to the CDBG program and 17 other programs would \nresult in higher unemployment, diminish business creation and \nretention, increase the number of blighted buildings, and the number of \nhomeless people who cannot find affordable housing.\n  The loss of these dedicated funds would profoundly affect our \ncountry's low and moderate income communities and residents.\n  We must not allow this to happen.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for the Sarbanes amendment to restore \nfunding for CDBG and the 17 other community and economic development \nprograms proposed to be eliminated.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to address shortfalls in the \nbudget resolution for key community and economic development programs. \nThe budget before us includes a reduction of roughly $2 billion in \nFederal assistance to distressed and underserved communities. These \ncuts are shortsighted, ill-advised and represent a significant retreat \nfrom our long-standing commitment to invest in our Nation's \ncommunities. I join Senator Sarbanes in offering an amendment to \nrestore funding for these programs to their fiscal year 2005 levels.\n  Last year the Federal Government invested $5.7 billion in communities \nacross the country through a network of community and economic \ndevelopment programs. These programs were used to enhance social \nservices, invest in infrastructure, promote affordable housing, provide \npublic services and revitalize our downtowns. These investments changed \nthe face of our cities and helped improve the standards of living \nacross the Nation.\n  Unfortunately, the President has proposed to eliminate this network \nof programs and replace them with a single block grant at the \nDepartment of Commerce. Eighteen programs are on the chopping block, \nincluding the Community Development Block Grant, CDBG, the Community \nDevelopment Financial Institutions Fund, CDFI, the Community Services \nBlock Grant, CSBG, Brownfields Economic Development Initiatives and the \nEconomic Development Agency, EDA. I find this proposal underwhelming \nand unacceptable. To add insult to injury the President has proposed, \nand this budget includes, only $3.7 billion for community and economic \ndevelopment activities covered under this initiative--a 34-percent \nreduction in all programs combined. This is simply not adequate.\n  Each of the programs slated for elimination was created for a \nspecific purpose, each serves targeted constituencies and addresses \ndistinct needs. Consolidating and under funding these programs would \nleave critical gaps in the web of support for our Nation's cities and \ntowns. I question the President's assertion that these programs are \nineffective or inefficient and I question the wisdom of starting a new \nprogram at a new agency when the old system is not broken.\n  I am particularly concerned with the elimination of the Community \nDevelopment Block Grant program. CDBG is the centerpiece of the Federal \ngovernment's efforts to help States and localities meet the needs of \nlow-income communities. CDBG funds vital housing rehabilitation, \nsupportive services, public improvements and economic development \nprojects in communities across the Nation. It serves more than 1,100 \nentitlement communities, urban counties and States, and more than 3,000 \nrural communities.\n  Last year over 95 percent of CDBG funds went to activities benefiting \nlow and moderate income persons. CDBG housing projects assisted over \n160,000 households, public service projects benefited over 13 million \nindividuals, and economic development projects helped create or retain \nover 90,000 jobs. Vermont used CDBG grants to rehabilitate over 270 \nunits of affordable housing and help create or preserve over 150 jobs.\n\n[[Page S2892]]\n\n  I recently led a bipartisan letter with Senator Coleman to the Budget \nCommittee attesting to the effectiveness of CDBG and urged that it be \nfully funded and retained at the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment. Fifty-seven members of the Senate joined me in this \nletter.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print this letter in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 2, 2005.\n     Hon. Judd Gregg,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Budget,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington. DC.\n     Hon. Kent Conrad,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Budget, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Gregg and Ranking Member Conrad: The \n     Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program funds \n     housing rehabilitation, supportive services, public \n     improvements and economic development projects in communities \n     across the nation. CDBG serves more than 1,100 entitlement \n     communities, urban counties and states, and more than 3,000 \n     rural communities. We urge the Budget Committee to maintain \n     the Federal government's current commitment to community \n     development programs at the Department of Housing and Urban \n     Development and support a budget allocation of $4,732 billion \n     in Function 450 for CDBG, Section 108 economic development \n     loan guarantees, and the Brownfields Economic Development \n     Initiative.\n       HUD is the Federal Department principally responsible for \n     community economic development. CDBG is the center piece of \n     the Federal government's efforts to help states and \n     localities meet the needs of low-income communities. Section \n     101 of the Housing and Community Development Act created the \n     CDBG program to consolidate a number of complex and \n     overlapping programs of financial assistance in order to \n     encourage community development activities which are \n     consistent with comprehensive local and areawide development \n     planning; to further the national housing goal of a decent \n     home and a suitable living environment for every American \n     family; and to foster the undertaking of housing and \n     community development activities in a coordinated and \n     mutually supportive manner by Federal agencies and programs, \n     as well as by communities. HUD's community development \n     programs coupled with HUD's housing and homeless programs and \n     supportive services, provide communities with a comprehensive \n     approach to serving the needs of residents. CDBG is the glue \n     that holds other Federal programs serving low-income \n     communities together.\n       The Strengthening America's Community proposal aims to \n     create strong accountability standards, offer flexibility to \n     communities and create a more unified federal approach. These \n     goals are already hallmarks; of the CDBG program. On the 30th \n     Anniversary of CDBG in 2004, HUD Deputy Secretary Roy \n     Bernardi said the following about the program: ``HUD has a \n     long history of `being there' and providing help for people, \n     particularly those with the greatest needs--our lower income \n     constituents. CDBG has certainly been there, during boom \n     years and most importantly in times of tightening budgets, \n     which place greater demands on existing services. We must \n     continue to support and build upon programs that work, those \n     that have a proven record of flexibility and the ability to \n     fit in with locally determined needs. CDBG is such a program \n     and ranks among our nation's oldest and most successful \n     programs. It continues to set the standard for all other \n     block grant programs.''\n       The Strengthening America's Communities proposal would \n     recreate a block grant program similar to CDBG within the \n     Deparment of Commerce. The Department of Commerce, however, \n     does not have the vital infrastructure or institutional \n     capacity to provide a comprehensive approach to neighborhood \n     development. Replicating HUD's CDBG program within the \n     Department of Commerce would require rebuilding HUD's \n     ``infrastructure'' and would result in inefficiencies, \n     greater complexity and less aid to fewer cities, an approach \n     which does not serve America's communities or taxpayers. \n     CDBG's success depends on a locally driven, citizen \n     participation process that provides flexibility and does not \n     take a ``one-size-fits-all'' approach. The needs of Nashua, \n     New Hampshire; Bismarck, North Dakota; Cincinnati, Ohio and \n     Kansas City, Missouri are very different from the needs of \n     Miami, Florida; El Paso, Texas; Pueblo, Colorado; or San \n     Diego, California. CDBG is capable of addressing the diverse \n     needs of these communities whether it is housing \n     rehabilitation, homeownership, supported services for the \n     elderly or children, business development or infrastructure \n     improvements.\n       CDBG is one of the most effective Federal domestic programs \n     to revitalize neighborhoods with proven results. Over 95 \n     percent of CDBG funds went to activities principally \n     benefiting low- and moderate-income persons. Twenty-eight \n     percent of CDBG funds supported housing activities in \n     distressed communities, 24 percent supported public \n     improvements, 15 percent went to the provision of public \n     services, and 7 percent supported economic deve1opment \n     activities. In FY2004, CDBG housing projects assisted 168,938 \n     households. Public service projects funded with CDBG served \n     13,312,631 individuals. Economic development programs funded \n     by CDBG in fiscal 2004 created or retained 90,637 jobs for \n     Americans and public improvement projects benefited 9,453,993 \n     persons. CDBG also has a strong record in business retention: \n     CDBG ensured that over 80 percent of the businesses assisted \n     through the program were still in operation after three \n     years.\n       Thank you for your consideration. We look forward to \n     working with you to ensure that communities across the \n     country can provide good jobs, affordable housing, and public \n     services to meet the needs of all Americans.\n           Sincerely,\n         Norm Coleman, Patrick Leahy, Jack Reed, Kit Bond, Mike \n           DeWine, Paul Sarbanes, Evan Bayh, Barbara Mikulski, Ted \n           Kennedy, George Voinovich, Jeff Bingaman.\n         Debbie Stabenow, Rick Santorum, Frank R.

Mr. President, I believe you will find similar support for \neach of the other programs under this umbrella.\n  I challenge each Member to go back to their State and find one \ncommunity that has not reaped the benefits of a CDBG investment. I \nchallenge each member to visit with their local community action groups \nand hear how they use the Community Services Block Grant to support the \nneediest in their communities. These programs fill a real need and have \nproven results. A cut of $2 billion in Federal funds will result in the \nloss of at least $18 billion in matching funds from local and State \ngovernments and nonprofit and private sector investments. I fail to see \nthe wisdom in dismantling programs that are so vital to our \ncommunities.\n  Our amendment would restore nearly $2 billion for community and \neconomic development programs and urges the Senate to retain the \nadministration of these programs at their current agencies. We fully \npay for the increase in funds by closing egregious tax loop holes that \nover 90 Members of this Chamber has already gone on record in support \nof closing.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me in support of this amendment and \nexpress their support for these important programs.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \namendment of my friend and to express my support of the Community \nDevelopment Block Grant Program, the Economic Development \nAdministration, and the 16 other economic and community development \nprograms that are dramatically underfunded in this budget. It is no \nsurprise to see this amendment coming from my distinguished colleague \nfrom Maryland. I thank him for his work on this issue, both now and in \nthe past. Throughout his career in the Senate he has been a powerful \nadvocate for CDBG and similar community development programs.\n  The CDBG Program has for 31 years provided vital funding to \ncommunities all over the United States and throughout my home State of \nMontana. CDBG is especially valuable to economically distressed \ncommunities that often lack basic public infrastructure. It funds a \ndiverse range of projects. Just last year, CDBG dollars helped fund \nhead start facilities in Havre and Kalispell, and money to help Dodson \nmodernize their wastewater system.\n  A CDBG grant helped Big Horn County renovate Memorial Hospital. In \nAnaconda, where we have a Jack Nicklaus-designed golf-course, a CDBG \nloan helped renovate the Old Works Hotel, dramatically improving the \nregion's tourism industry.\n  These CDBG investments leveraged millions of State and local dollars. \nIn Montana, CDBG dollars are primarily administered at the State level, \nso local officials can direct the funding to the areas of greatest \nneed. CDBG is a program that works. It is a good investment of taxpayer \nmoney that communities leverage to fund vital\n\n[[Page S2893]]\n\nprojects they could not complete on their own.\n  And the CDBG Program has been supporting community development for \nthe past 30 years with great success. Providing small infusions of \nFederal funding to jumpstart projects, CDBG has touched hundreds of \nMontana communities, and thousands of lives.\n  Unfortunately, CDBG isn't the only program on the chopping block. The \nEconomic Development Administration is a small but crucial program that \ninvests to help communities--particularly economically distressed \ncommunities--get ready for new businesses. EDA has a documented record \nof success. Since its inception in 1964, the EDA has created more than \n4 million jobs and leveraged more than $18 billion in private sector \ninvestment in thousands of communities all across the country.\n  EDA investments in Montana have helped Montana farmers, suffering \nfrom years of draught. The Bear Paw economic development district in \nnorthern Montana used an EDA planning grant to help farmers study the \nfeasibility of growing carrots and other vegetables in a region \ndominated by wheat growth for more than a century. The study \ndemonstrated the viability of these crops, and farmers are excited to \nhave a variety of crops to choose amongst.\n  Why, then, does this budget propose to eliminate it? At a time when \nit is critical for our country to maintain competitiveness in the \nglobal economy a proposal to eliminate a successful catalyst for \neconomic growth is a mistake.\n  The growing budget deficit is a concern. But continued economic \ngrowth is central to everyone's plan to reduce the deficit. Why then \nare we cutting programs that spur economic growth? EDA creates jobs, \nmore than 4 million in its history. It is essential that we preserve \nthis job creating agency.\n  Our economy is in recovery, and as this recovery continues, EDA is \nworking to make sure that all of America recovers. EDA targets its \nfunding at economically disadvantaged communities. Areas that have \nrecently experienced a factory closure, or a military base closure. The \npeople who benefit the most from EDA are those who have been hurt the \nmost by outsourcing.\n  States, counties, and cities are experiencing ever greater demands on \ntheir budgets. The choices they make, just like the choices we make \nhere in the Senate, are tough, and getting tougher. The rising costs of \nhealth care, education, and other investments programs are straining \nlocal budgets to the breaking point. In some communities they have been \nforced to raise local taxes so high the benefits from recent tax cuts \nare all but gone.\n  We are robbing Peter to pay Paul. And it doesn't make sense to do it \nwith agencies that have the ability to leverage their funds and ripple \nthrough their communities. For us here in Washington to eliminate \nFederal programs like the CDBG and EDA would devastate communities.\n  Cities will be forced to choose between school for our children or \nhousing for our seniors, between improving decaying infrastructure \nneeded to create new jobs and providing health coverage for our \nchildren. This amendment doesn't solve all of these problems, but it is \na giant step to improving our communities.\n  Once again, I thank my colleague from Maryland, as well as all of our \nother cosponsors. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. These \nprograms create jobs and improve lives and communities all over our \ncountry. Let's not shortchange our communities that need this help the \nmost.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today many Americans in communities across \nthe Nation are being left behind in our economy. Federal community and \neconomic development programs, such as Community Development Block \nGrants, Community Development Financial Institutions, and Economic \nDevelopment Administration grants, have a history of ``being there'' \nfor communities--providing funding for housing rehabilitation, job \ncreation, and infrastructure. I thank Senator Sarbanes for offering his \namendment to save these important programs from elimination, and I am \nglad to be a cosponsor. Senator Sarbanes' amendment will restore \nfunding to these vital programs by closing tax loopholes that the \nmajority of the Senate supported closing in the FSC/ETI bill.\n  The President's Strengthening America's Communities Initiatives, \nSACI, would fundamentally change Federal economic and community \ndevelopment programs serving our communities. The President's fiscal \nyear 2006 budget eliminates 18 successful programs serving low-income \nurban, rural, and Native American communities. It reduces the Federal \ncommitment to funding community development by 33 percent, cutting \nfunding from $5.6 billion to $3.71 billion. And the President's \nproposal will also reduce the number of communities served. A program \nthat serves fewer Americans with less resource can only place more \nfamilies and low-income neighborhoods at risk, rather than create \nvibrant and strong economies as CDBG, CDFI, EDA, the Brownfields \nEconomic Development Initiative and Section 108 loan guarantees are \ndoing.\n  The real issue with federal community development assistance is the \nlack of financial resources for the thousands of communities struggling \nto remain economically competitive, not the current structure of the \nexisting programs. While the budget resolution includes funding for tax \nloopholes that the Senate voted to close last year, it fails to \nadequately fund programs that provide affordable housing to American \nworkers, programs that create or retain jobs in the economy, and \nprograms that provide vital public services to our senior citizens.\n  In fiscal year 2003, the economy lost 486,000 jobs. CDBG projects \ncreated or retained 108,700 jobs for Americans. CDBG also has a strong \nrecord in business retention. While businesses have left American \nshores for other countries, CDBG ensured that over 80 percent of the \nbusinesses assisted through this program were still in operation after \n3 years.\n  There is overwhelming opposition to the Strengthening America's \nCommunity Initiative. Mayors, local and State community development \nagencies, housing assistance agencies, and others from Rhode Island to \nUtah, and from Michigan to Texas, have written letters to Congress and \nto the administration opposing these devastating cuts and changes to \nFederal economic and community development assistance. They know that \nCDBG, CDFI, and EDA programs are the foundation of strong communities--\nthese programs are literally the building blocks of community \ndevelopment. A unified grant program, as proposed by the \nadministration, will leave gaping holes in community and economic \ndevelopment assistance.\n  CDBG is the glue that holds other Federal programs serving low-income \ncommunities together. On the 30th Anniversary of CDBG in 2004, HUD \nDeputy Secretary Roy Bernardi said the following about the program:\n\n       HUD has a long history of 'being there' and providing help \n     for people, particularly those with the greatest needs--our \n     lower income constituents. CDBG has certainly been there, \n     during boom years and most importantly in times of tightening \n     budgets, which place greater demands on existing services. We \n     must continue to support and build upon programs that work, \n     those that have a proven record of flexibility and the \n     ability to fit in with locally determined needs. CDBG is such \n     a program and ranks among our nation's oldest and most \n     successful programs. It continues to set the standard for all \n     other block grant programs.\n\n  I want to tell my colleagues about CDBG's history of ``being there.'' \nIn Rhode Island, CDBG was there when the West Elmwood Housing \nDevelopment Corporation, a not-for-profit community based organization, \nneeded to build and renovate affordable homes. CDBG gave Rhode Island \nfamilies, who would otherwise be unable to achieve the American dream \nof homeownership, the chance to own their own home. In Florida, \nCongress turned to CDBG to provide relief after last year's devastating \nhurricane season, and in New York City, CDBG helped the city rebuild \nafter the September 11 tragedy. In New Hampshire, CDBG is there for the \nConcord Area Trust for Community Housing to layer with Low-Income \nHousing Tax Credits to build affordable housing. In Ohio, Community \nDevelopment Financial Institutions are there for communities across the \nState helping to finance businesses and microenterprises that support \nnew jobs in the economy. And EDA was there to provide planning and \ntechnical assistance to help save 466 existing jobs and\n\n[[Page S2894]]\n\ncreate 78 new jobs near Billings, MT. There are no other Federal \nprograms or tax loophole that have the history of ``being there'' like \nCDBG, CDFI, and EDA.\n  Senator Sarbanes' amendment to restore funding to these programs \ndeserves the full support of my Senate colleagues, whether Republican \nor Democratic, representing an urban state such as Rhode Island or a \nrural state such as Montana. I hope my colleagues will join me in \nvoting for Senator Sarbanes' amendment so that all workers, families, \nneighborhoods, and communities can participate in our Nation's economic \ngrowth.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, what is the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 7 minutes \n25 seconds.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, this amendment increases spending by $2.5 \nbillion, exceeding the cap, and it increases taxes by the same amount \nof money. It is a tax-and-spend amendment. Therefore, I would oppose \nit. There are a lot of other reasons I would oppose it, but I wanted to \ngive the Senator from Missouri an opportunity to say a couple of words \non something else.\n  I yield to the Senator from Missouri, and I yield the remainder of my \ntime on this amendment.\n  Mr. TALENT. Madam President, I thank my friend, the chairman. I would \nlike to speak briefly on a separate amendment that I am going to offer \nand ask for a vote on it during the vote-arama today.\n  I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Senators Thune, Stabenow, \nand Wyden.\n  This amendment is endorsed by all the major transportation groups--\nincluding ASSHTO, Associated General Contractors, the Road Builders, \nthe American Public Transportation Association, the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, and the Heavy Highway Alliance, representing major trade \nunions. These groups understand the importance of this amendment and \nmany will be scoring it as one of their key transportation votes of \nthis session.\n  As has been the case in past resolutions, the current budget \nresolution in the Reserve Fund section allows the budget chairman to \nmake adjustments to the allocation for surface transportation.\n  However, the Senate language as written significantly restricts the \ntransportation reauthorization funding options available to the Finance \nCommittee.\n  In the fiscal year 2004 budget resolution, last year's resolution, we \nagreed to reserve fund language that allowed new transportation funding \nso long as it was offset by an increase in receipts of any kind to the \nhighway trust fund. That is as it should be. We ought to allow the \nFinance Committee to have the full range of funding options.\n  As written in this year's resolution, the resolution takes away the \nflexibility of the Finance Committee, the EPW Committee, the Banking \nand Commerce Committees, to consider all available funding mechanisms \nfor the reauthorization bill. It precludes the use of resolutions used \nin past authorization bills, some of which the administration has \nagreed to and which passed last year by 74 bipartisan votes. Among the \nfunding options that would be blocked are interest on the highway trust \nfund's unexpended balances; the motor fuels refund reform for over-the-\nroad and lend-lease vehicles; and drawdown of the highway trust fund \nbalance.\n  My amendment simply changes the language to be consistent with the \nlanguage in the House budget resolution and the fiscal year 2005 \nconference report. The amendment is narrowly targeted and does not \naffect the budget neutrality of the final transportation bill. The \namendment simply ensures we have that debate at the right time on the \nhighway bill with all the funding options on the table. I urge my \ncolleagues who support transportation funding to vote for this \namendment. It restores the flexibility to use revenue sources approved \nin the past and gets us out of the box that the current language traps \nus in and makes it easier to adequately fund our transportation needs \nwithin the limits of a revenue-neutral bill.\n  I will be asking for a vote at the appropriate time on the amendment. \nI thank my cosponsors, including the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. What is the time situation on Senator Sarbanes' amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire controls 4 \nminutes and the Senator from Maryland controls 1 minute 19 seconds.\n  Ms. STABENOW. As the cosponsor with my colleague from Missouri, I \nwould appreciate a couple of minutes to speak on the Talent-Stabenow \namendment before proceeding with the other amendments.\n  Mr. GREGG. We do not have any time on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I ask for 2 minutes off the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time remaining.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The balance of the time is 1 minute 19 \nseconds.\n  Ms. STABENOW. To my colleagues, I rise to speak in support of the \nTalent-Stabenow amendment. It is very simple, as my colleague \nindicated. It is extremely important as the Senate begins the work of \nSAFETEA transportation legislation.\n  As in past resolutions, the current budget resolution in the reserve \nfund section allows the budget chairman to make adjustments to the \nsurface transportation allocation. However, this budget resolution as \nwritten ties the hands of the Finance Committee and restricts the \ntransportation funding options available to them such as using interest \nfrom the highway trust fund and drawing down the trust fund balance.\n  All the Talent-Stabenow amendment would do is modify the language to \nput all the funding options on the table. This change would be \nidentical to the provision in the current House budget resolution and \nwhat has been included in past House and Senate budget resolutions.\n  We all know how critical SAFETEA is. Transportation issues in each of \nour States are absolutely critical. The transportation bill creates \njobs. It supports communities. It uplifts all of our roads and highways \nand bridges in a critically important way. I am hopeful this amendment \nwill receive strong bipartisan support so we can pass a strong safety \nbill with all the options on the table and make sure we have the \noptions available to make it the very best bill we possibly can, given \nall of the concerns regarding funding.\n  Mr. GREGG. We yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is expired.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 230\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMinnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Madam President, I have an amendment I send to the desk \nfor immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Coleman] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 230.\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n  Mr. COLEMAN (for himself) proposes an amendment to the concurrent \nresolution S. Con. Res. 18 setting forth the congressional budget for \nthe United States Government for fiscal year 2006 and including the \nappropriate budgetary levels for fiscal years 2006 through 2010; as \nfollows:\n  (Purpose: To fully fund the Community Development Block Grant Program \nand related pograms, including Community Services Block Grant Program, \nBrownfield Redevelopment, Empowerment Zones, Rural Community \nAdvancement Program, EDA, Native American CDBG, Native Hawaiian CDBG, \nand Rural Housing and Economic Development)\n\n       On page 16, line 15, increase the amount by $1,454,000,000.\n       On page 16, line 16, increase the amount by $29,080,000.\n       On page 16, line 20, increase the amount by $465,280,000.\n       On page 16, line 24, increase the amount by $610,680,000.\n\n[[Page S2895]]\n\n       On page 17, line 3, increase the amount by $203,560,000.\n       On page 17, line 7, increase the amount by $72,700,000\n       On page 17, line 16, increase the amount by $619,000,000.\n       On page 17, line 17, increase the amount by $359,020,000.\n       On page 17, line 21, increase the amount by $241,410,000.\n       On page 17, line 25, increase the amount by $12,380,000.\n       On page 18, line 4, increase the amount by $6,190,000.\n       On page 26, line 14, decrease the amount by $2,073,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 15, decrease the amount by $388,100,000.\n       On page 26, line 18, decrease the amount by $706,690,000.\n       On page 26, line 21, decrease the amount by $623,060,000.\n       On page 26, line 24, decrease the amount by $209,750,000.\n       On page 27, line 2, decrease the amount by $72,700,000.\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Madam President, let me express my thanks to my \ncolleague from Maryland, Senator Sarbanes, for his work on this issue \nand for his leadership in the Senate. We serve together on the Foreign \nRelations Committee. It is a great honor. He brings great compassion, \ngreat respect, great dignity to the committee, to the institution, and \nhis service is greatly appreciated. It is my honor as a relatively new \nSenator to be working on an issue that is so important to him as it is \nto me and to the folks I represent, both as a Senator from Minnesota, \nbut as I represented as mayor in the city of St. Paul.\n  My amendment is simple. It says no cuts to the Community Development \nBlock Grant Program. It says no moving CDBG, no to program changes that \nlimit CDBG's effectiveness.\n  I share the President's goal of reducing the deficit and bringing \nfiscal accountability to Washington. But like so many things in \nWashington, the devil is in the details. In the case of CDBG, the \ndetails in the budget need to be reworked quite a bit.\n  I have a simple philosophy: Don't kill those things that build the \neconomy and help cut deficits. I strongly supported tax cuts that \ncreate investment and grow jobs. CDBG grows jobs. Community development \nblock grants grow communities.\n  When I talk to the folks back in Minnesota, whether they are city \nadministrators or mayors or county commissioners, they all say the same \nthing: The Community Development Block Grant Program is the lifeblood \nof community development. That is why I am offering this amendment to \nfully fund CDBG along with the Community Service Block Grant Program, \nthe Brownfield Redevelopment Program, and the Rural Housing and \nEconomic Development Program, to name a few. These are things that \nwork. Let's change and reshape things that do not work. But when you go \nhome and folks say across the board--big town, small town, urban, \nrural--that it works, work with it.\n  CDBG was enacted in 1974 and has been assisting America's communities \nfor 30 years. It is a program that helps State and local government tap \ntheir most serious community development challenges, including \ninfrastructure, housing, and economic development. Over the first 25 \nyears, it has created 2 million jobs and contributed in excess of $129 \nbillion to the Nation's gross domestic product.\n  CDBG and public-private partnerships are the cornerstone of the \neconomic revitalization across the country and in many of our cities in \nrecent years. They have provided the tools to provide economic \nopportunity and hold jobs.\n  When you deal with the budget, there is a question of fiscal \nresponsibility. Does the program work? Fair question. Is it cost \neffective? Fair question. What does it achieve?\n  I know CDBG works because when I was mayor, before coming to \nWashington, I worked with it. In coming here, my hope was to be \nMinnesota's mayor in Washington. I always take pride in the fact that a \nmayor's focus is on getting things done. They are at the bottom of the \npolitical food chain but really responsive. That was the bottom line. \nIt was getting things done. If streets were unplowed in the city of St. \nPaul, I heard about it. So as a former mayor I know something about \nfiscal responsibility, about having to reduce needless bureaucracy, \nabout turning deficits into surpluses, and setting money aside for a \nrainy day, all while submitting budgets that contained no tax increases \nin 8 years. Part of my ability to do that was the growth I saw in my \ncommunities and the public-private partnerships that CDBG created and \nshaped and was a part of. Community centers and crime prevention, \naffordable housing, and business and economic development--the heart \nand soul of Federal help to our cities.\n  The Presiding Officer serves the great State of Alaska, which has \nchallenges. They are not awash in a surplus of cash. The Presiding \nOfficer understands, as I understand, we have to support those things \nthat grow our communities.\n\n  The fact is, jobs in St. Paul's economy have not grown without CDBG. \nWe used CDBG to revitalize neighborhoods, and it is through this effort \nwe were successful.\n  I can personally testify that dollar for dollar there is no better \ninitiative to help States and localities renew and rebuild our cities \nand create economic growth and jobs than the Community Development \nBlock Grant Program.\n  As Minnesota's mayor in Washington, I still believe that Government \nis beholden to the people; that individuals, with the help of their \nlocal representatives, can plan their lives better than bureaucrats in \nsome distant capital.\n  That is what I like, and the idea behind CDBG, a very conservative \nidea that we should not have 1,500 command and control programs rush \nout of Washington trying to micromanage the needs of communities. \nInstead, we should help communities meet those needs and priorities \nthrough one block grant. With all the unfunded mandates coming from \nWashington, CDBG is a way we help communities across the country meet \nsome very critical priorities. CDBG is a fiscally responsible program \nthat exponentially produces more than it costs and is a truly \nconservative initiative enabling local leaders to meet local needs.\n  CDBG works. Last year, the Office of Management and Budget celebrated \nCDBG under the theme ``performance counts.'' Since then, the Office of \nManagement and Budget may have changed its mind, but America hasn't.\n  Let me state what CDBG means to my home State in Minnesota. When I \nbecame mayor of St. Paul, we got businesses and jobs growing. But not \nall St. Paul was benefiting from the turnaround. An area around Ames \nLake on the east side of St. Paul, one of my toughest neighborhoods, \nneeded help, needed growth. They could not take part in the surrounding \neconomic boom because the buildings were in total disrepair and \nbusinesses were looking to move out, not move in. It would have been an \nimpossible situation if not for CDBG. But thanks to CDBG, we were able \nto leverage Federal funds to attract millions of private dollars to \nimprove infrastructure and replace the blight of city sprawl with green \nspace, and build a community center to keep kids off the street.\n  I was at the League of City meetings the other day and talking to the \nmember who represents the east side of St. Paul. In that community, \nthey had a shopping center that was blighted, with nothing there. Reeds \ngrew up through the concrete. We figured out the Good Lord was saying \nthere was a wetland in the heart of the city. We got rid of the \nshopping center, got rid of the concrete, and created wetlands. Now he \nis telling me we have housing in the worst areas of St. Paul; the most \nblighted areas are growing and prospering. Again, CDBG was an important \npart of it.\n  In other words, thanks to CDBG, Ames Lake is now moving in the right \ndirection. St. Paul is located within Ramsey County. And like all \ncounties with a big city, Ramsey County struggles with sort of a split \nidentity. On one hand, it has suburbs that are doing well compared to \nparts of the big city. Within the city is land intense with industrial \nprojects such as car parks and truck sites that big cities need. Now \nthese projects are great to have when they are up and running, but when \nthey shut down, they are so large they take whole communities with them \nthat is happened with the Glendenning Truck site.\n  It was in bad condition, and local officials knew something had to be \ndone about it. Using CDBG, they were able to replace a dilapidated \ntruck site with thriving businesses and jobs.\n\n[[Page S2896]]\n\n  Ramsey County also used CDBG to transform the Vadnais Highlands \napartment complex into safe, attractive and affordable housing.\n  I give another example of how community development becomes economic \ndevelopment. There is a town of 502 people in Minnesota called \nBrewster. In 1997, Brewster was awarded a one time community \ndevelopment block grant. This grant allowed Brewster to renew and \nrejuvenate its infrastructure by tearing down its dilapidated \nstructures and replacing them with 40 homes. As a result of this \ninvestment, when Minnesota Soybean Processors was looking for a new \nhome, there was no better place than Brewster.\n  The relocation of Minnesota Soybean Processors immediately created 40 \njobs. In fact, that CDBG grant is still creating jobs as Minnesota \nSoybean Processors are now opening a biodiesel division which will \nemploy 10 more people.\n  In another example, the city of Rochester, MN, used CDBG to fund the \nAldrich Memorial Nursery School, providing pre-school kids with a safe \nplace to be while mom and dad are working.\n  The city of Minneapolis uses CDBG to improve housing, stimulate job \ngrowth, improve public infrastructure, provide public health services, \nand school readiness programs.\n  A reduction in CDBG could hinder the city's current efforts to help \n200 moms and dads to find jobs; efforts to develop 150 multifamily \nhomes; efforts to acquire and demolish 110 vacant and boarded up \nhouses; efforts to provide capital improvements to child care \nfacilities, and efforts to reduce lead hazards in 70 homes and provide \nyouth employment training to 300 kids. That is a lot of bang for the \nbuck.\n  Minneapolis is a big city, but community development block grants are \njust as important to our rural communities. As you may know, America's \nrural communities often lack the resources to improve their \ninfrastructure and housing.\n  The town of Detroit Lakes is located in Becker County, MN, and has \nabout 7,500 residents. It is the heart of Lake Country in the land of \n10,000 lakes. If you have not visited there, you should. Spend some \nmoney there while enjoying the lakes. The beach is right in town. At \n119 Pioneer Street is the Graystone Hotel.\n  Built in 1916 to accommodate the region's growing tourism industry, \nthe Graystone Hotel had since fallen on hard times. Its once grand \nexterior had degenerated into an unsightly mess, and its rooms all but \nabandoned. In short, what was once one of Detroit Lakes' flagship \nbuildings, was now its biggest detraction.\n  Using CDBG along with private funding, the Graystone Hotel now \nincludes 41 residential units and a variety of businesses and nonprofit \nenterprises ranging from Lakeland Medical Health Center to Godfather's \nPizza.\n  St. Louis County, which is located in northern Minnesota and is one \nof the more rural areas in Minnesota, has also used CDBG. Since 1993, \nCDBG has helped create 560 jobs in St. Louis County; it has provided \n2,900 residents of St. Louis County with business training resulting in \n159 new start-up businesses; 450 homes were improved through local \nhousing rehabilitation programs in the county.\n  Hundreds of first-time home buyers participated in a first-time home \nbuyer program, resulting in the purchase of 600 single family homes.\n  In St. Louis County, CDBG also helps fund community soup kitchens, \nemergency shelters, child daycare projects, programs combating domestic \nviolence, and a number of infrastructure improvements such as the water \ntreatment facility in Aurora. St. Louis County has been able to \nleverage $5 in private dollars for every dollar they received through \nthe CDBG program.\n  CDBG works, but don't take my word for it, just 1 ask the folks in \nDetroit Lakes, St. Paul, or St. Louis County.\n  I was pleased to work with Senator Patrick Leahy in leading a \nbipartisan coalition of 57 Senators in sending a message to the Senate \nBudget Committee signifying our strong commitment to CDBG and reminding \nfolks that cities from Montpelier to Minneapolis need CDBG to create \neconomic opportunity and to grow jobs.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 2, 2005.\n     Hon. Judd Gregg,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Budget,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Kent Conrad,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Budget,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Gregg and Ranking Member Conrad: The \n     Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program funds \n     housing rehabilitation, supportive services, public \n     improvements and economic development projects in communities \n     across the nation. CDBG serves more than 1,100 entitlement \n     communities, urban counties and states, and more than 3,000 \n     rural communities. We urge the Budget Committee to maintain \n     the Federal government's current commitment to community \n     development programs at the Department of Housing and Urban \n     Development and support a budget allocation of $4.732 billion \n     in Function 450 for CDBG, Section 108 economic development \n     loan guarantees, and the Brownfields Economic Development \n     Initiative.\n       HUD is the Federal Department principally responsible for \n     community economic development. CDBG is the centerpiece of \n     the Federal government's efforts to help states and \n     localities meet the needs of low-income communities. Section \n     101 of the Housing and Community Development Act created the \n     CDBG program to consolidate a number of complex and \n     overlapping programs of financial assistance in order to \n     encourage community development activities which are \n     consistent with comprehensive local and areawide development \n     planning; to further the national housing goal of a decent \n     home and a suitable living environment for every American \n     family; and to foster the undertaking of housing and \n     community development activities in a coordinated and \n     mutually supportive manner by Federal agencies and programs, \n     as well as by communities. HUD's community development \n     programs coupled with HUD's housing and homeless programs and \n     supportive services, provide communities with a comprehensive \n     approach to serving the needs of residents. CDBG is the glue \n     that holds other Federal programs serving low-income \n     communities together.\n       The Strengthening America's Community proposal aims to \n     create strong accountability standards, offer flexibility to \n     communities and create a more unified federal approach. These \n     goals are already hallmarks of the CDBG program. On the 30th \n     Anniversary of CDBG in 2004, HUD Deputy Secretary Roy \n     Bernardi said the following about the program:\n       ``HUD has a long history of `being there' and providing \n     help for people, particularly those with the greatest needs--\n     our lower income constituents. CDBG has certainly been there, \n     during boom years and most importantly in times of tightening \n     budgets, which place greater demands on existing services. We \n     must continue to support and build upon programs that work, \n     those that have a proven record of flexibility and the \n     ability to fit in with locally determined needs. CDBG is such \n     a program and ranks among our nation's oldest and most \n     successful programs. It continues to set the standard for all \n     other block grant programs.''\n       The Strengthening America's Communities proposal would \n     recreate a block grant program similar to CDBG within the \n     Department of Commerce. The Department of Commerce, however, \n     does not have the vital infrastructure or institutional \n     capacity to provide a comprehensive approach to neighborhood \n     development. Replicating HUD's CDBG program within the \n     Department of Commerce would require rebuilding HUD's \n     ``infrastructure'' and would result in inefficiencies, \n     greater complexity and less aid to fewer cities, an approach \n     which does not serve America's communities or taxpayers. \n     CDBG's success depends on a locally driven, citizen \n     participation process that provides flexibility and does not \n     take a ``one-size-fits-all'' approach. The needs of Nashua, \n     New Hampshire; Bismarck, North Dakota; Cincinnati, Ohio; and \n     Kansas City, Missouri are very different from the needs of \n     Miami, Florida; El Paso, Texas; Pueblo, Colorado; or San \n     Diego, California. CDBG is capable of addressing the diverse \n     needs of these communities whether it is housing \n     rehabilitation, homeownership, supported services for the \n     elderly or children, business development or infrastructure \n     improvements.\n       CDBG is one of the most effective Federal domestic programs \n     to revitalize neighborhoods with proven results. Over 95 \n     percent of CDBG funds went to activities principally \n     benefiting low- and moderate-income persons. Twenty-eight \n     percent of CDBG funds supported housing activities in \n     distressed communities, 24 percent supported public \n     improvements, 15 percent went to the provision of public \n     services, and 7 percent supported economic development \n     activities. In FY2004, CDBG housing projects assisted 168,938 \n     households. Public service projects funded with CDBG served \n     13,312,631 individuals. Economic development programs funded \n     by CDBG in fiscal 2004 created or retained 90,637 jobs for \n     Americans and public improvement projects benefited 9,453,993 \n     persons. CDBG also has a strong record in business retention: \n     CDBG ensured that over 80 percent of the businesses assisted \n     through the program were still in operation after three \n     years.\n       Thank you for your consideration. We look forward to \n     working with you to ensure that\n\n[[Page S2897]]\n\n     communities across the country can provide good jobs, \n     affordable housing, and public services to meet the needs of \n     all Americans.\n           Sincerely,\n         Norm Coleman, Patrick J.

Judd Gregg,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Budget, U.S. Senate, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. Kent Conrad,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Budget, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Gregg and Ranking Member Conrad: As you \n     prepare to consider the FY 2006 Budget Resolution, we the \n     undersigned organizations want to convey our opposition to \n     proposed cuts in the FY 2006 Department of Housing and Urban \n     Development (HUD) budget. We respectfully request that you \n     craft a Budget Resolution that will provide adequate budget \n     authority for all HUD programs and maintain important \n     community and economic development functions and funding at \n     HUD.\n       Of particular concern to us is the proposed elimination of \n     the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program along \n     with 17 other Federal community and economic development \n     grant programs. We oppose in the strongest terms the \n     elimination of CDBG, and we urge you to reject the proposed \n     ``Strengthening America's Communities'' (SAC) Initiative and \n     support full funding for the CDBG program at HUD.\n       As you know, the FY 2006 Budget would effectively eliminate \n     18 community and economic development programs, including \n     CDBG, and create an entirely new initiative to be operated by \n     the Department of Commerce. Proposed funding for this \n     ``consolidated'' program would be $3.7 billion, and 35 \n     percent reduction in funding when compared to total FY 2005 \n     appropriations for the 18 programs targeted for elimination \n     under the initiative. Consider that Congress funded the CDBG \n     program alone at $4.7 billion in FY 2005, $1 billion more \n     than the entire proposed budget for the SAC initiative.\n       Eliminating these 18 programs and substantially reducing \n     the Federal investment in community and economic development \n     would have a devastating impact on State and local \n     governments. Each of these existing programs is an important \n     and necessary component of urban, suburban, and rural \n     communities' efforts to revitalize neighborhoods, expand \n     affordable housing opportunities and create economic growth. \n     We believe that CDBG is the glue that holds these efforts \n     together.\n       For 30 years, the CDBG program has served as the \n     cornerstone of the Federal government's commitment to \n     partnering with state and local governments to strengthen our \n     Nation's communities and improve the quality of life for low- \n     and moderate-income Americans. Since its inception, CDBG has \n     made a real and positive difference in communities across \n     America, and there is no shortage of CDBG success stories. \n     Many of the groups that signed this letter have been working \n     in partnership with HUD and the Office of Management and \n     Budget (OMB) in a good faith effort to improve the CDBG \n     program's ability to measure performance. As a result of this \n     effort, HUD plans to unveil a new outcome-based measurement \n     system in early 2005. As recently as November 2004, OMB \n     endorsed this undertaking. We believe this new system will \n     verify what is already obvious: CDBG works.\n       CDBG's emphasis on flexibility and local determination of \n     priority needs through citizen participation is allowing \n     state and local governments to achieve real results. \n     According to HUD's ``Highlights of FY 2004 CDBG \n     Accomplishments,'' CDBG funding led to the creation or \n     retention of more than 90,000 jobs in the last year alone. \n     Thanks to CDBG, in 2004 over 130,000 rental units and \n     single-family homes were rehabbed, 85,000 individuals \n     received employment training, 1.5 million youth were \n     served by after-school enrichment programs and other \n     activities, and child care services were provided to \n     100,065 children in 205 communities across the country. \n     CDBG also funded nearly 700 crime prevention and awareness \n     programs. Additionally, more than 11,000 Americans became \n     homeowners last year thanks to CDBG funding. CDBG remains \n     a smart, efficient form of investment, as it continues to \n     leverage around three dollars for every dollar of Federal \n     investment. It certainly did not come as a surprise to us \n     when HUD Secretary Alphonso Jackson, in a March 2nd \n     appearance before the House Financial Services Committee, \n     stated, ``The program works.''\n       The CDBG program's design is especially successful at \n     targeting resources to those who need them most. In 2004, 95 \n     percent of funds expended by entitlement grantees and 96 \n     percent of State CDBG funds expended were for activities that \n     principally benefited low- and moderate-income persons. A \n     full half of persons directly benefiting from CDBG-assisted \n     activities were minorities, including African Americans, \n     Hispanics, Asians, and American Indians. Despite the fact \n     that economic challenges and pockets of poverty exist in \n     almost all American communities, adoption of the SAC \n     initiative would almost certainly result in a complete loss \n     of funding for a significant number of communities.\n       For all of the reasons detailed above, we believe that CDBG \n     should remain at HUD and receive full funding of at least \n     $4.7 billion in FY 2006. We also believe it is premature for \n     the Budget Resolution to even address such a far-reaching \n     change to the program before the numerous committees of \n     jurisdiction have had sufficient opportunity to hold \n     appropriate hearings on the topic. We urge you to craft a \n     Budget Resolution reflecting those sentiments. More \n     specifically, we strongly encourage you to include language \n     in your Resolution clearly stating that the Resolution ``does \n     not assume enactment of the proposed `Strengthening America's \n     Communities' Initiative nor the proposed reduction in funding \n     for the CDBG program included in the Administration's FY 2006 \n     budget.''\n       We thank you for your favorable consideration of this \n     request.\n           Sincerely,\n       Council of State Community Development Agencies.\n       The Enterprise Foundation.\n       Habitat for Humanity International.\n       Housing Assistance Council.\n       Local Initiatives Support Corporation.\n       National Association for County Community and Economic \n     Development.\n       National Association of Counties.\n       National Association of Housing and Redevelopment \n     Officials.\n       National Association of Local Housing Finance Agencies.\n       National Community Development Association.\n       National Conference of Black Mayors.\n       National League of Cities.\n       National Low Income Housing Coalition.\n       United States Conference of Mayors.\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. I urge my colleagues to adopt my amendment and show \ntheir support for these community leaders by fully funding the \ncommunity development block grant program, keeping it at HUD, and \nrejecting any harmful changes.\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/17/senate-section/article/S2899-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2899-S2910]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n[[Page S2899]]\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                                 Senate\n\n CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET FOR THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT FOR THE FISCAL \n                          YEAR 2006--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. GREGG. There is 7\\1/2\\ minutes remaining in opposition?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. There is story after story for everything in this country. \nThe problem is, if we start funding all the stories, we will run out of \nmoney and tax our kids so they cannot afford it and tax ourselves so we \ncannot afford it.\n  The issue is setting priorities. The President has suggested a \npriority in the area of CDBGs. I suspect this Congress is not going to \naccept that priority, but it should function within the caps that have \nbeen set in order to decide whether it chooses that priority.\n  This is a reasonable approach, to set a cap and then say to the \nAppropriations Committee, you decide whether CDBGs make more sense than \nsome other program that would compete for the same amount of money.\n  I will not vote for either of these amendments, but if I had to vote \nfor one or the other, I would be more inclined to vote for the one from \nthe Senator from Minnesota because he does not impact caps and takes it \nout of something called 800 which is the general operation of the \nGovernment which means basically a cut to IRS and other operating \naccounts within the Government.\n  I don't think that should be the way we should approach this. We \nshould, rather, allow the Appropriations Committee to make decisions on \nthis and we should not be arbitrarily in the Senate reallocating money \nfrom IRS over to the CDBG Program on the basis of anything, including \nstories.\n  I understood the Senator from Maryland wanted a couple of minutes.\n  I yield the Senator 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I commend the Senator from Minnesota \nfor a very eloquent statement about the effectiveness of the CDBG \nprogram. Of course, he has absolutely firsthand experience with it \nhaving been a mayor of one of our great cities. I appreciate his \nanalysis of the worth of the CDBG program.\n  I simply make this point, and this is a broader priorities question: \nThe amendment I have offered derives the funding, in order to restore \nthe money, by closing tax loopholes--the very provisions that passed \nthe Senate overwhelmingly last year 92 to 4 on the FSC/ETI bill. A lot \nof these provisions were dropped in conference. The ones dropped would \nproduce $27 billion over a 5-year period. So there is not much argument \nabout the necessity of closing these loopholes. The overwhelming \njudgment here was that ought to be done. That would then avoid cutting \nother programs.\n  There is a dilemma here. I understand that. If we are trying to keep \nthings neutral as far as contributing to the deficit is concerned, then \nthe question becomes, do you cut other programs in what is, I think, an \nalready extremely tight budget. So you fund CDBG, but you would \ndiminish the funding for housing, education, and other programs--across \nthe board. The alternative is to find a revenue source in which there \nis general agreement in terms of an abuse of the Tax Code.\n  Now, the chairman refers to that as taxing and spending. I do not \nknow how you spend if you do not tax unless you are going to run up a \ndeficit. I regard that as responsible budget making.\n  You always have to use reasoned judgement and analysis in terms of \nwhat is fair and right. The proposal here is to close some of those tax \nloopholes. There has been an overwhelming judgment that those loopholes \nshould be closed. The amount of revenue produced by closing the \nloopholes dropped in conference is three times what it would cost to \nrestore the CDBG Program. Thus closing only some of them would produce \nsufficient revenue to restore these programs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 2 minutes\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Maryland.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 208\n\n       (Purpose: to modify the designation authority for an \n     emergency requirement)\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 208, which is \nat the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 208.\n       On page 42, line 14, strike ``that'' and all that follows \n     through ``designates'' on line 15 and insert: ``that the \n     Congress designates as an emergency requirement''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 10 minutes evenly divided on this \namendment.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, section 402 of the pending budget \nresolution establishes a procedure for designating emergency \nappropriations that I believe creates a new and unnecessary hurdle for \nCongress in responding to emergency situations. It distorts the balance \nof power between Congress and the President.\n  Section 402 permits an emergency designation of an appropriation to \nbe challenged on a point of order and provides that the point of order \ncan be waived only by a vote of three-fifths of\n\n[[Page S2900]]\n\nthe Senate. That point of order has been incorporated in budget \nresolutions for several years now. It was put in place to curb what was \nseen as an overuse of the emergency designation to escape the \nlimitations of the caps on discretionary spending. It has served \nsuccessfully to impose restraint on emergency designations.\n  But now, in this resolution, the distinguished chairman of the Budget \nCommittee has included, in addition to that requirement, the further \nrequirement that the President must also designate the appropriation as \nan emergency in order for it to escape being counted against the budget \nresolution caps for discretionary spending.\n  While it is true the Presidential designation was part of the process \nin the original Budget Enforcement Act of 1990, that legislation was a \ncomprehensive measure with a number of budget enforcement provisions, \nand was before the three-fifths or 60-vote requirement had been imposed \non the process. It seems to me we do not need both the 60-vote \nrequirement and the new Presidential designation requirement.\n  Let me suggest a hypothetical situation. Let us say this provision \nwere in place when this body takes up the President's emergency \nsupplemental request, which has been passed by the other body. Let us \nsay that an amendment is offered on the floor to address an emergency \nsituation not included in the President's budget request, and its \nemergency designation is challenged by a point of order here in the \nSenate, and, further, that an overwhelming majority of the Senate votes \nto approve the emergency designation. Despite the size of the vote in \nthe Senate, so long as it is over 60, and even if the President signs \nthe bill into law, if the President declines to specifically and \nexpressly concur with the congressional emergency designation, the \nappropriation will be counted against the discretionary cap by the \nBudget Committee scorekeepers. This is even though the President \napproves the appropriation.\n  My suggestion is by signing the bill the President approves the \ndecision of the Congress that the funds are needed, and that they \nshould be spent, and that they are needed to address an emergency.\n  So despite a substantial majority vote here in the Senate on a \nparticular appropriation provision, despite congressional approval of \nan appropriations bill, including its emergency designation, and \ndespite the President signing the bill, approving the bill with this \nprovision in it, the President can effectively nullify the action of \nthe Congress relative to the caps on spending set by Congress in its \nown budget resolution.\n  I believe the inclusion of this additional Presidential power should \nbe stricken from this resolution and we should enforce our budget \nprovisions with the 60-vote point of order as provided by our rules and \nunder the law. Congressionally imposed caps on spending should be set \nand enforced by Congress, not by the President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I rise in opposition.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GREGG. How much time would the Senator need?\n  Mr. BYRD. Two minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I yield the Senator 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator, the \nchairman of the committee, for his characteristic courtesy.\n  I rise, Madam President, to express my admiration for Senator Cochran \nas he assumes the duties of chairman of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee. Today, I stand with Chairman Cochran in support of his \namendment concerning the authority of Congress to designate funding as \nan emergency.\n  In the Constitution, there is no ambiguity about which branch of \nGovernment has the power of the purse. It is the congressional power of \nthe purse which is the central pillar of the system of checks and \nbalances under our Constitution. The budget resolution that is before \nthe Senate includes a provision which makes the ability of the Congress \nto designate funding as an emergency subject to the approval of the \nPresident.\n  The measure that is before the Senate is a budget resolution. It is \nnot a law. It will not be sent to the President for his approval. The \nCongress should not use a budget resolution to tie its own hands on \nspending decisions. The Congress should not tie its own hands in \ndetermining whether an expenditure for war, or an expenditure for \nvictims of a flood, hurricane, or earthquake is an emergency. The \nSenate should not have to get on its knees and plead with any President \nfor his permission to designate a provision as an emergency. The \nCongress is a coequal branch of Government under our Constitution, and \nit should jealously guard the prerogatives associated with the power of \nthe purse, so wisely preserved for the legislative branch by our \nFounding Fathers.\n  If the Senate wants to provide emergency funding for agriculture \ndisaster relief, or for responding to a recent flood or hurricane, or \nto provide additional funding to the Department of Defense for body \narmor, it must have that authority. The Cochran amendment makes clear \nCongress retains that authority.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  Again, I thank the chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, a lot of folks around here talk about \nbudget reform, and this is budget reform in that it returns us to the \ndays when the President was treated essentially this way, back under \nPresident Clinton, under President Bush the first. I think it is \nimportant to know what the issue is.\n  The issue is not defense spending, because the proposed budget point \nof order and the Presidential involvement does not apply to defense \nspending. So with regard to the supplemental that is coming at us, the \nmajority of which is defense spending, it does not affect that. It is \nnondefense areas where basically emergency designations are used to \navoid the cap.\n  The cap is the enforcement mechanism on the discretionary side. There \nare going to be instances where we are going to have to go through the \ncap because there are legitimate emergencies--hurricanes, the tsunami. \nBut the simple fact is, there are also instances where we have used the \nemergency designation, such as for oyster farming, where maybe they \nwere not quite emergencies, and yet they allowed the cap to be avoided \nfor that spending item.\n  This tries to put some balance back into the process of when we are \ngoing to have domestic emergencies and when we are not, and making sure \nthe President is part of that process, which has traditionally been the \nway we did it around here. So I think it is reasonable change.\n  I understand the chairman and the ranking member of the \nAppropriations Committee are concerned because it may well impact them, \nalthough I suspect with this President they will be able to work out an \nunderstanding that they will agree on. But I do think it is an \nenforcement mechanism that is appropriate at this time.\n  Madam President, do I have any time left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute 20 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield that back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time is yielded back.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nthis debate which has just been completed, the following times be \nallocated specifically for Members to offer their amendments; provided \nfurther, that if the Senator is not here during the allocated time, the \nclock run against the time reserved for the amendment.\n  I send a list of those allocations to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 177\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I inquire, I believe in the order of \nmatters it is appropriate now to consider amendment No. 177, and there \nis a 15-minute time limit on it. Am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a 15-minute time limit on the \neducation amendment. Does the Senator call up the amendment?\n\n[[Page S2901]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes, I call up the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, during the last few days, we have voted \non various education amendments. I want to direct the attention of our \nMembers to some of the facts as we are coming to the final \nconsideration of this amendment.\n  Fact No. 1: The chairman's mark in the 2006 budget, if you look on \npage 5, you will see education, training programs, and you see that \nthere will be cut $2.5 billion now, $4 billion in the second year. \nAccording to the best estimate we have, from the Center on Budget and \nPolicy Priorities, cumulatively over 5 years this will be $40 billion. \nThose who are opposed to our amendment will say, you have a $5 billion \nhigher education trust fund. But as the chairman of our committee \npointed out, that basically is a phony mark.\n  The chairman of our committee, Mr. Enzi, says that chairman's mark \ncontains a $5 billion reserve for new initiatives coupled with \napproximately $5 billion in spending cuts. In order to get the $5 \nbillion in reserve funds, you have to effectively have these cuts plus \nthe reconciliation cuts. What we are talking about basically are very \ndramatic and significant cuts in education.\n  This amendment does two basic things. First, it will ensure that we \nwill reach $4,500 in Pell grants. Second, it will fund the cuts that \nare proposed by the President in terms of TRIO and GEAR UP so that we \nwill help the needy children in that area. Third, it will ensure that \nwe are going to provide funding for vocational education, special \nskills, the adult education program, so we are going to have a \ncontinuing upgrade of American skills. That is one important part of \nthis amendment.\n  The second important part is the part of the amendment that gives \nattention to where the United States is in terms of a global challenge. \nI personally believe that the greatest challenge we are facing today is \nglobalization, and the challenge we ought to respond to is to make sure \nthat our people will be able to deal with the global challenge. And \nthat means investing in math and science.\n  This amendment will fund education for math and science teachers in a \nsimilar way that we did at the time we were threatened with sputnik in \n1957. With this amendment we will effectively get 50,000 to 60,000 more \nmath and science teachers every year.\n  We have seen what has happened to the United States in the area of \nmath and science. In 1975, we were third in the world in terms of math \nand science and engineering degrees. By the year 2000, we were 15th in \nthe world, and we are going down. This budget resolution will drive us \ndown further. This amendment provides a stopgap to that and the \nopportunity to make significant gains. That is what this is about.\n  We know that the Chinese are graduating three times as many engineers \nas the United States will this year. India is graduating three times as \nmany computer scientists as we are. If we just think that we can go \nalong with business as usual, we are missing an enormously important \nopportunity and responsibility. We need this kind of investment. We \nneed it so that we will be able to compete globally in terms of the \neconomy. We need this investment so that we will be able to compete \nfrom a national security point of view. Investing in our young people \nis an essential part of our national security. We cannot tolerate the \nkinds of cuts that are included in this legislation. This \namendment addresses that.\n\n  Those on the other side will say we have increased education funding \nby all these percentages in recent years. We have increased funding in \neducation, but it is still totally inadequate. The fact is, most of the \nincrease has been the result of action on this side. I wish we had been \nable to meet our responsibilities.\n  If you look at what is happening currently in terms of high school \ndropouts, these are three of the large high schools in Los Angeles--it \nis difficult to see, but you should be able to see the trend lines--\nRoosevelt High School, Garfield High School, and Huntington Park High \nSchool. You see the dramatic dropout that is taking place across the \ncountry. That is happening in our high schools.\n  Talk to any principal, talk to any school board, talk to any of those \ninvolved in education--they know what is not happening; that is, \ngetting a good education.\n\n[[Page S2902]]\n\n  Finally, for every 100 ninth graders, 68 of those graduate from high \nschool out of every 100; 40, when they graduate, will enroll in \ncollege. Only 27 will stay enrolled as sophomores, and only 18 graduate \nfrom college on time out of the 100.\n  Money is not the only answer. Money in a number of instances isn't \nthe answer. But investing in resources is an indication of our national \npriority. It does seem to me that we can afford the $5.4 billion which \nis offset and paid for with the close of tax loopholes in a proposal \nthat also includes $71 billion in tax reductions for individuals. That \nis what this whole proposal is about. That is what this budget is \nabout: the question of priorities. This is a $5.5 billion investment in \nour children, offset--not increasing the deficit--with the closing of \ntax loopholes which has been accepted by the Senate in a proposal that \nis already providing $71 billion in tax reductions. It does seem to me \nthat this is more of an expression of the values of the American \npeople. Five billion is a lot, but we know that investing in our young \npeople, investing in math and science, is key to our future. It seems \nto me to be something that the American people should and will support. \nI hope this amendment will be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, the Senator from Massachusetts is \ncorrect. Money does not solve the problem of education. If it did, the \ncity of Washington would have the finest schools and the best academic \nexperience in the country instead of the worst. The students \nregrettably score at the bottom of the Nation year in and year out. Yet \non a per capita basis, more money is spent per child here in Washington \nthan any place else in America: $12,000 a year per child. I \ncongratulate the present Mayor for trying to address the issue through \ncreating choice within the school system. But that is a fact. Money \ndoes not necessarily solve education problems.\n  However, in the area of money, this Presidency has done a \ndramatically better job than the prior President in his commitment to \nincreasing education dollars. Since coming into office, President \nBush's increase in education exceeds that of President Clinton by 33 \npercent. His increase in funding for title I exceeds that of President \nClinton by 52 percent. His increase in IDEA funding exceeds that of \nPresident Clinton by 75 percent. His increase in funding of No Child \nLeft Behind exceeds President Clinton's areas in approximately the same \nprograms by 46 percent. In this budget proposal, the President has \nproposed adding another $500 million in IDEA, $600 million in title I, \n$1 billion in No Child Left Behind, and half a billion dollars into \nPell grants.\n  In addition, this budget itself sets up the process for significant \nincreases in funding in the Pell grant area so that we can get to a \n$4,150 grant next year. And if we follow the proposal of this budget, \nwe will get to a $5,100 grant for people who use Pell grants and go to \ncollege for 4 years and complete their schooling.\n  In addition, we put in $5.5 billion, approximately, in order to \nreauthorize the Higher Education Act. And yes, it is paid for in large \npart, but it is paid for by basically ratcheting down on lenders. I \nsuspect the Senator from Massachusetts will be comfortable with many of \nthe pay-fors which Senator Enzi comes up with in committee. So the \neducation commitment of this administration has been extraordinarily \nstrong, and this budget puts forth some very creative and unique ideas \nfor going forward on that aggressive approach.\n  This amendment is not the way to proceed. The Senator from \nMassachusetts has never been a wilting violet on the concept of \nincreasing taxes. This amendment reinforces that fine track record as \nit increases taxes by $10.9 billion. In fact, the entire other side of \nthe aisle has not been much in the way of wilting violets on the issue \nof increasing taxes.\n  So far we have had approximately seven amendments that we have \naccounted for. I think there are a lot more floating around here that \nwe have not yet accounted for that had they been passed or if they are \npassed--four of them were, fortunately, defeated--would have added $47 \nbillion. That doesn't count this $10 billion. So we are up to almost \n$60 billion of new taxes that has been proposed so far. I suspect that \nnumber is understated because I think we are missing five or six \namendments that had been suggested in the last few hours late last \nevening.\n  So there is no question but there is a philosophy on the other side \nwhich this side is trying not to subscribe to, which is that you just \nraise taxes and you spend more money and that solves the problem. That \ndoesn't solve the problem. The problem is that we have to set \npriorities, and within those priorities, some programs of the Federal \nGovernment should be funded more aggressively than others.\n  What the President has suggested specifically is that the core \neducational initiatives of the Federal Government--No Child Left \nBehind, title I, special education, Pell grant, higher education--will \nbe funded extremely aggressively. The Congress may not decide to choose \nto follow that course of action, but at least we should go forward with \nthe concept that we are going to set the priorities within a budget \nthat we can afford and not break that budget and raise taxes on the \nAmerican people.\n  Therefore, I oppose this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise in support of \nSenator Kennedy's amendment to increase education funding in the budget \nby $5.4 billion. This amendment will provide additional budget \nauthority for the purpose of addressing many important education needs, \nincluding ensuring continued funding for TRIO, GEAR UP, and Perkins \nvocational education. In addition, this amendment will include funding \nto raise the maximum Pell grant award to $4,500 this year, which is one \nof my top legislative priorities for this year.\n  Our system of higher education is in many ways the envy of the world, \nbut its benefits have not been equally available. Unfortunately, it is \nstill the case that one of the most determinative factors of whether \nstudents will pursue higher education is their family income. Students \nfrom families with incomes above $75,000 are more than twice as likely \nto attend college as students from families with incomes of less that \n$25,000.\n  To help remedy these inequities, the Federal Government has wisely \ninvested in a need-based system of student financial aid designed to \nremove these economic barriers. Central to this effort for the past 30 \nyears has been the Pell grant program.\n  The Pell grant program is the single largest source of grant aid for \npostsecondary education funded by the Federal Government. It provides \ngrants to students based on their level of financial need to support \ntheir studies at the institutions they have chosen to attend.\n  I have long supported efforts to raise the Pell grant maximum award. \nI am pleased by the efforts of the Budget Committee to provide a $100 \nincrease in the Pell grant maximum award for this year. But I believe \nit is imperative that we succeed in providing a more substantial \nincrease in the maximum grant this year.\n  That is why, as my first legislation of this year, I introduced \nSenate Resolution 8, calling on the Senate to increase the Pell grant \nto $4,500 this year. I am very pleased to have Senators Feingold, \nColeman, Kennedy, and Durbin joining me as cosponsors of this \nresolution. They are all leaders in the effort to expand access to \nhigher education.\n  The amendment before us builds on the efforts of my resolution, by \nfollowing up to ensure sufficient budget authority to meet this goal.\n  While I understand that we face many difficult decisions on the \nbudget resolution before us, I believe that a $450 increase is an \nimminently reasonable and achievable goal for this year--especially in \nlight of the fact that the Pell maximum grant has gone essentially \nunchanged for 4 years. After receiving a modest increase of $50 in \n2002, the maximum award has been stuck at the $4,050 level for 2003, \n2004, and 2005.\n  In the meantime, the cost of attending college has continued to rise. \nThe combination of these factors over the past 4 years has led to a \nsignificant erosion in the purchasing power of the Pell grant, and has \nforced students to rely increasingly on loans to finance their higher \neducation.\n\n[[Page S2903]]\n\n  In 1975, the maximum Pell grant covered approximately 80 percent of \nthe costs of attending a public, 4-year institution. Today, it covers \nless than 40 percent of these costs, forcing students to make up the \ndifference by taking on larger and larger amounts of debt.\n  The decline in the value of grant aid and the growing reliance on \nloans have serious consequences for access to higher education for low-\nincome students. The staggering amount of loans causes some students to \nabandon their plans to attend college altogether. According to the \nCollege Board, low-income families are significantly less willing, by \nalmost 50 percent, to finance a college education through borrowed \nmoney than their wealthier counterparts.\n  That does not surprise me. Many working families in Maine are \ncommitted to living within their means. Understandably, they are \nextremely wary of the staggering amount of debt that is now required to \nfinance a college education.\n  I also know this to be true from my experiences as a college \nadministrator at Husson College in Maine. At Husson, 85-90 percent of \nstudents currently receive some sort of Federal financial aid, and--\napproximately 60 percent of students receive Pell grants.\n  As Linda Conant, the financial aid director at Husson told me:\n\n       You cannot imagine how difficult it is to sit with a family \n     and to explain to them the amount of loans that are needed to \n     finance a post-secondary degree. It scares them. That is why \n     Pell grant aid is so important for low-income families. For \n     these families, loans don't always work, but Pell does.\n\n  We also know that having a well-educated workforce is crucial to our \neconomic future and competitiveness in the global economy. The Bureau \nof Labor Statistics has projected that over the next 10 years, there \nwill be significant growth in jobs requiring at least some post-\nsecondary education. So increasingly, higher education is going to be \nnecessary to ensure employability and to prepare Americans to \nparticipate in tomorrow's economy.\n  That is why Pell grants are so important. Pell grants make the \ndifference in whether students have access to higher education, and a \nchance to participate fully in the American dream.\n  Mr. President, Pell grants are targeted to the neediest of students--\nrecipients have a median family income of only $15,200. An additional \n$450 in Pell grant aid may very well be the deciding factor on whether \nthese students can pursue their college dreams.\n  The Pell grant program is the foundation of making good on the \nAmerican promise of access to higher education. Now is the time for us \nto make a commitment to raising the Pell maximum award to $4,500 for \nthe upcoming award year. I hope that my colleagues will join me in \nsupporting this amendment.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor Senator Kennedy's \namendment to the, fiscal year 2006 budget resolution. This amendment \nwould ensure the necessary investment in education to secure our \nNation's continued prosperity.\n  This amendment would focus on three areas critical to boosting \neducational opportunity and our economy. First, it would make college \nmore affordable and accessible. The amendment would raise the maximum \nPell grant by $450, to $4,500, a long overdue and necessary increase \nfor millions of students who struggle to keep up with ever-rising \ncollege tuition. It also would restore a host of programs that give \nlow-income Americans a lifeline to college. The President seeks to \neliminate programs like TRIO, GEAR UP, and LEAP, which have opened \ndoors for students who otherwise might never consider a college \neducation, let alone be able to afford it.\n  Second, this amendment would make a crucial difference for high-need \nschools. We cannot remain global leaders in technology if we do not \nmaintain a world-class standard of education in math and the sciences \nfor all students. Yet we have a shortage of highly qualified teachers \nin these very areas. This amendment would use loan forgiveness as an \nincentive to attract and retain 57,000 teachers in math, science, and \nanother woefully understaffed arena, special education.\n  Finally, this amendment would ensure the future competitiveness of \nthe workforce by preserving investments in workforce development, adult \nliteracy, and vocational education. In voting to reauthorize and \nimprove the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act, 99 \nSenators just last week recognized the indispensable nature of the act, \ndespite the President's efforts to eliminate it. With this amendment we \ncan restore funding for Perkins programs as well as for job training \nand literacy programs that give adults the tools they need to be \neconomically productive.\n  The investment in these commonsense measures is one we cannot afford \nto forego. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for this \namendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 234\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). There will now be 30 minutes of \ndebate equally divided on the Baucus-Conrad amendment on agriculture.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Baucus] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 234.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To ensure that legislation to make cuts in agriculture \n  programs receives full consideration and debate in the Senate under \n  regular order, rather than being fast-tracked under reconciliation \n                              procedures)\n\n       On page 28, strike lines 14 through 20.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this amendment is critical to my home \nState of Montana and to most States in the Nation. It is agriculture. \nAgriculture is the financial engine that drives, certainly, my State's \neconomy. It brings in $2 billion of annual revenue plus benefits to \nrural communities and to our State generally. One in five Montana \nworkers is employed in agriculture or a related field.\n  But this amendment is important not just to Montana; it is important \nto the Nation. America's agricultural producers provide us with the \nsafest and highest quality food supply in the world. We all know that. \nIt is worth repeating. It is worth remembering. Sometimes we take \nthings for granted. Our agricultural producers in America provide us \nwith the safest, highest quality food supply in the world. Americans \nare extremely fortunate to enjoy those benefits.\n  Agriculture is a small part of the Federal budget, but it is expected \nto shoulder huge cuts, very disproportionate cuts in this budget \nresolution.\n  The Senate budget resolution calls for a reduction in mandatory \nagricultural programs of $5.4 billion over 5 years. The budget \nresolution puts $2.8 billion of those savings on fast track through \nreconciliation.\n  I was one of the farm bill negotiators and supporters of that \nlegislation, but I disagree with some of the provisions within the law. \nThe 2002 farm bill represented a delicate balance between diverse \ninterests. It was very tough to put that together. The 2002 farm bill \nwas a 6-year bill, not an on-and-off bill but a 6-year bill, and people \nhad reason to expect it settled farm policy for 6 years. People have to \nplan, to have a sense of what is going on. It is not just farmers, but \nbankers, equipment suppliers, and farm implement dealers. Producers and \nbankers who made financial decisions to enter into contracts with the \nunderstanding that the farm bill would not be renegotiated until 2007, \nthat was their understanding.\n  If Congress proceeds with the agriculture cuts in this budget \nresolution, we will be cutting nutrition, not just the six basic crops \nin the farm bill, but cutting nutrition, conservation, and forestry \nprograms. These cuts are not directed solely at the commodity programs. \nIn fact, they are directed at many other segments of the whole \nagriculture bill.\n  The Senate should put off the policy discussions that are behind \nthese cuts until we begin debate on the new farm legislation. That is \nthe appropriate time to debate these policy discussions, not in the \nbudget resolution to cut for the sake of cutting. The commitment\n\n[[Page S2904]]\n\nthat Congress and the President made to farmers, to conservatives, and \nthe neediest in our society should be maintained until a new farm bill \nis developed.\n  Proposed mandatory spending cuts will also unilaterally disarm our \ntrade negotiators, especially our agricultural trade negotiators. The \nUnited States recently lost its appeal of the World Trade Organization \ndispute panel decision concerning domestic cotton. It is not widely \nknown, but it should be well understood, the implications of that \ndecision.\n  At the same time, we are negotiating a new global trade agreement \nwith the WTO, of which agriculture is a critical part. That decision is \ngoing to put our agricultural producers and our agriculture program in \njeopardy. We should, therefore, not commit to the substantial \nagriculture policy changes that this resolution would require while we \nare engaged in those trade talks. We should not unilaterally disarm. It \nmakes no sense, and I cannot understand for the life of me why this \nbudget resolution unilaterally disarms our farmers before we go into \nnegotiations. Some argue the proposed cuts are good for our negotiators \nbecause they demonstrate to other countries that the United States is \nserious about agriculture reform.\n  I have learned through very hard, bitter experience that no country \naltruistically, out of the goodness of its heart, if it has any sense, \nis going to lower a trade barrier. They do not unless they have to. You \nhave to provide leverage. There are many examples where the United \nStates had to exercise leverage to get other countries to lower a trade \nbarrier. It takes leverage. They just do not do it out of the goodness \nof their heart.\n\n  If we do that, think what the Europeans are going to do. They are \ngoing to say: Oh, those Americans, they have already eliminated their \nagriculture program, they have cut their supports, so we Europeans do \nnot have to go quite so far. I tell you, it makes no sense, no sense \nwhatsoever for this Congress to pass a budget resolution which cuts \nagriculture by such a dramatic amount.\n  In 2002, total EU domestic supports plus export subsidies totaled $37 \nbillion. What was ours? What was the U.S. comparable figure? It is \nabout $17 billion, and that is just actual spending.\n  Look at that: Europeans have twice the amount of agricultural support \npayments that we have, twice as much as the United States has--more \nthan twice as much as the United States has. Yet we are coming before \nthis body and saying we are going to cut agriculture even more, while \nthe Europeans have close to three times the amount of subsidies we \nhave. I do not think that makes much sense.\n  The total amount agreed to in the WTO Uruguay Round is $81 billion \nfor the EU and $19 billion for the United States. Just think of that. \nThat was the Uruguay Round. That was a mistake. Mr. President, 81 for \nthem, 19 for us. These cuts contained in the budget resolution, to \nwhich I am opposed, are, therefore, clearly ill timed. This is the \nwrong time to do this. Developing countries, in particular, have \noffered very little in agricultural talks. If we pass this resolution, \nthey are going to ask themselves: Why should they? They can keep their \nsky-high tariffs on agricultural products and still get the United \nStates to cut its support of U.S. agricultural programs.\n  We also lose bargaining power to push for changes to the European's \nagricultural policy. That policy transformed postwar Europe from the \nworld's largest food importer to one of the world's largest net \nexporter of agricultural products.\n  Let me state what happened. This pretty much demonstrates what \nhappened in this country, why agricultural producers in the United \nStates are in tough shape. In the 1970s, the European Union was the \nworld's largest net importer of agricultural products. They decided \nthat is wrong; we have to do something about it. So they did. What did \nthey do? They implemented massive agricultural support payments for \ntheir farmers so that in a 10-year time in the mid-1980s, Europe became \nthe largest net exporter of agricultural products. It was a big shift \nfrom the world's largest importer to the world's largest exporter in 10 \nyears, and that is where they stayed. That is what we face. That is why \nit is wrong right now in this budget resolution to further cut \nagricultural payments which are disproportionate right now.\n  Our farmers and our ranchers can compete with anybody in the world \njust as long as the playing field is level, but we should not put \nAmerican farmers and ranchers at a disadvantage by cutting U.S. \nprograms just as we are seeking changes in other countries' programs. \nWe should not unilaterally disarm. We should not unilaterally disarm \nagriculture just as the trade talks reach a critical point. They are \nupcoming. To do so would not just be unwise, it would be reckless.\n  Agriculture is being asked to make a substantial and disproportionate \ncontribution to spending reductions. This is unjustified. There are \nother cuts in this budget not nearly as great as the ones agriculture \nwill face. I just think it is sensible to support this amendment so we \ndo not cut agriculture the way proposed in this resolution. It makes no \nsense.\n  I see some of my colleagues on the floor who wish to speak on this \namendment. I see Senator Conrad. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. President, the amendment before the Senate strikes the budget \nreconciliation instructions to the Senate Committee on Agriculture. The \namendment deletes the requirement that the Senate Agriculture Committee \nreport legislation that reduces outlays by $2.8 billion. It does not \nchange the other budgetary assumptions for agriculture contained in the \nresolution.\n  The fact is, agriculture has already contributed substantially to \ndeficit reduction. We are far below in funding what the farm bill \ncalled for. We are $16 billion below what the farm bill anticipated. If \nthe national media ever reported something incorrectly, they reported \nincorrectly the effect of the last farm bill on agriculture spending. \nYou would have thought, reading the national press, that agriculture \ngot an enormous increase, a 60-percent increase. Wrong. Agriculture did \nnot get an increase, agriculture got less money. What they left out \nwere the disaster bills we had been reporting and passing year after \nyear. Here is the pattern of farm program spending, and this shows the \nspending went down. It did not go up. The national media just got it \nwrong.\n  This is in the midst of a circumstance in which our major competitors \nare providing far more funding to their producers than we are providing \nto ours. Our major competitors are the Europeans. Here is what they are \ndoing. They are providing $277 an acre of support each and every year \nfor their producers. The comparable amount in the United States is $48. \nSo they are outgunning us over 5 to 1.\n  It is not just in domestic support. It is also in international \nsubsidies, subsidies for export. Here is the European Union's part of \nworld agricultural subsidies. They account for 87 percent of world \nagricultural export subsidies. This is the U.S. share--1 percent. They \nare outgunning us 87 to 1.\n  Right now we are entering negotiations with the WTO to try to level \nthe playing field. Let me remind my colleagues, this is what Europe is \ndoing for their farmers. These are not Kent Conrad's numbers, these are \nthe international scorekeepers' numbers, OECD: Europe, $277 an acre per \nyear per producer; the United States, $48. On export subsidy, Europe \naccounts for 87 percent of all the world's agricultural export subsidy; \nthe United States is 1 percent. They are outgunning us 87 to 1.\n  We are just entering negotiations to try to level the playing field. \nWhy would we ever unilaterally disarm in the midst of a trade dispute? \nWe would never do that in a military confrontation. Why would we do it \nin a trade confrontation?\n  Unilaterally cutting in the midst of the farm bill, in the midst of \ninternational negotiations, is a profound mistake. If anybody doubts \nwhat is happening, Europe has gone from being the biggest importing \nregion in the world to the biggest exporting region, and they are now \nequivalent to us in world market share. Keep up with this strategy and \nAmerica is going to become a second-class agricultural power.\n  This year, USDA forecasts we are going to import more agricultural \nproduction than we will export. That is a\n\n[[Page S2905]]\n\nstunning turnaround for the United States. We should not continue down \nthat path.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague and yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 40 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished Senator from North \nDakota if he might have time he can allocate to other Senators, \ninsomuch as the time remaining on this amendment has virtually expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The short answer is I do not. Under the agreement that \nhas been reached, all time has been allocated among these various \namendments, so there is no time remaining to allocate.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I wonder if I can impose upon the very gracious \ngenerosity of the Senator from New Hampshire and ask if perhaps he \ncould give a little time on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I do have 5 minutes, I have been informed, \nthat I can allocate. Let me give that 5 minutes that I have available.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Senator. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator \nfrom North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is a critically important issue. I \nappreciate the work of my colleague from Montana and my colleague from \nNorth Dakota. This is about family farmers. The reconciliation \ninstruction to take money from an account that is critically important \nfor the survival of family farmers is just a bad instruction. My \ncolleague from Montana wants to abolish that instruction.\n  Look, family farmers, in my judgment, have a lot of fights. They \nfight every year. They fight against bad weather, crop disease and \ninsects, and they have to fight grain markets trying to make a living \nout under the yard light on the family farm. They should not have to \nfight the U.S. Congress and the administration.\n  We made a deal on the farm program. We made commitments on food \nprograms. The family farmers should not have to face jeopardy from this \nCongress.\n  The fact is, this Congress has decided for family farmers that we \nwant to provide a bridge across price valleys, so that when prices \nprecipitously drop, we don't wash away all of the family farmers of \nthis country. So we put together a farm program, an account in the \nbudget that deals with ag. It all works together. I believe the \nrecommendation to cut these funds is a recommendation that pulls the \nrug out from under America's family farmers.\n  Bad trade deals have undermined our farmers. Weather and insects and \ngrain markets have undermined our family farmers. The last thing that \nshould happen is for us to pull the rug out from under our family \nfarmers.\n  I rise in strong support of the amendment offered by my colleague, \nSenator Baucus, from Montana. I hope the Senate will adopt this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Arkansas, Mr. Pryor.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, in 2002, this Congress entered into a \ncontract with our farmers, and today what we are discussing is--believe \nit or not--actually breaking that contract with America's farmers. \nLet's not just focus on the farmers, because the agriculture bill is \nmuch broader than that, including children and nutrition programs, poor \npeople on food stamps, and every consumer who buys food in this \ncountry. As it now stands, America spends less on food than any other \nnation in the world. If this passes, that might change.\n  I support deficit reduction. We know that. The farmers have already \ncontributed over $16 billion to deficit reduction. That is according to \nCBO. When you look at the numbers, they are very clear. Farm spending \nonly amounts to less than one-half of 1 percent of Federal spending, \nbut accounts for 17 percent of the Nation's GDP and 25 million jobs.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the senior Senator \nfrom Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, there is not enough time in the day for \nme to talk about agriculture because it is in my veins. I do come to \nthe floor to support my colleague from Montana. A few weeks ago, I came \nto the floor to note my extreme disappointment in President Bush's ag \nbudget proposal, and really his entire budget proposal as it relates to \nrural America. I reiterate my support for our farmers and our rural \ncommunities by speaking in strong support of this amendment.\n  Our agricultural producers and the folks who live in rural America \nare every bit a part of the fabric of this American family. There is no \nreason why they should be asked to carry a disproportionate share of \nthe sacrifice in dealing with this historic debt. I join President Bush \nin wanting to deal with this historic debt. But there is no reason in \nthis world why rural communities and agricultural producers----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, is there any of my time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 45 seconds.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield that to the Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Thank you. I do want people in this country to know \nthat the people in rural America, whether it is ag producers, who have \nabsolutely no certainty about the things that contribute to what they \nhave to do; they have no control over the weather, no substantial \ncontrol over trade. Yet, they did have a role to play, as everybody in \nthis body did, in the contract that came about in the farm bill.\n\n  This is not the appropriate place to breach that contract. It is not \nthe appropriate place to turn on the people of rural America that \nsupport this great Nation in the safest, most abundant and affordable \nfood supply in the world. We have an opportunity to look at what we can \ndo for rural America.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support the Senator from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \nSenators be added as cosponsors to my amendment: Harkin, Stabenow, \nDayton, Pryor, Lincoln, Salazar, and Conrad.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Montana for the \npurpose of a colloquy.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank my chairman, who has almost an \nimpossible job on this budget.\n  I rise to discuss this resolution and its impact on agriculture. I \nask the Senator, is my understanding correct that this budget \nresolution directs the Senate Agriculture Committee to contribute \ntoward deficit reduction by reducing mandatory program spending by $2.8 \nbillion over the next 5 years? Is my understanding correct?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I appreciate the question of the Senator \nfrom Montana. Yes, the Senator's understanding is correct. We took \ngreat care to assure that this budget resolution was constructed to \nprovide the Agriculture Committee with the flexibility needed to \nachieve a reduction in the deficit while ensuring continued support for \nprograms that provide a critical safety net for farmers and ranchers, \npromote conservation, and reduce hunger.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank the chairman. I understand the challenges of \nattempting to reduce the budget deficit by reducing spending. I believe \nwe have to get a budget resolution passed, and I know that the Senator \nhas to make some difficult choices. I also note that $2.8 billion is a \nlot of money in Montana, especially given skyrocketing energy prices \nand the likelihood that this will be another drought year in Montana.\n  I ask the Senator, is it true that the House has asked their \nAgriculture Committee to reduce mandatory spending at a higher level \nthan has been proposed by this budget resolution?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes, the Senator is correct. I believe the House budget \nresolution proposes reducing mandatory spending for agriculture by $5.3 \nbillion over the next 5 years. I add that the President's budget \nproposed to reduce mandatory program spending for agriculture by nearly \n$9 billion.\n\n[[Page S2906]]\n\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank the Senator. In a perfect world, I would prefer no \nreduction in spending for agriculture at all. As you know, the 2002 \nfarm bill has already contributed significantly to deficit reduction. \nOver the past 3 years, farm programs spending has been about \n$17 billion less than projected. So a lot of my farmers in Montana feel \nlike they already ``gave at the office.''\n\n  However, we must face up to the reality of our budget situation and \naddress this deficit. In doing so, however, reductions in spending must \nbe proportionate. I urge the chairman, in the strongest manner \npossible, to keep the final budget resolution from asking for a higher \nlevel of mandatory program savings from agriculture than the $2.8 \nbillion that we have included in this budget resolution.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I will state that the Senator from Montana \nhas been extremely persuasive. We started out with a budget number in \nthis budget that essentially tracked the President's number in \nagriculture. But as a result of listening to the Senator from Montana \nand the Senator from Georgia, chairman of the Agriculture Committee, we \nhave backed that number down rather dramatically from the original \nrequest of $9 billion by the President's $2.8 billion. And we have, as \nthe Senator from Montana noted, at the request of the Senator from \nGeorgia, given maximum flexibility to the Agriculture Committee so that \nthey can reach that number. Remember, that is a 5-year number, not a 1-\nyear number; the $2.8 billion is spent over 5 years. They can reach \nthat number however it is deemed best in looking at it through the lens \nof the Agriculture Committee, where the real expertise resides.\n  I thank the Senator from Montana for his very constructive effort in \nthis area. I assure the people of Montana he has certainly held their \ninterests and put their interests first and aggressively pursued it.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield the balance of our time to the Senator from \nGeorgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I want to start out today by \nacknowledging the cooperation and thanking the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee for working together with those of us who have real concerns \nabout agriculture and, particularly, relative to, obviously, the \nnumbers that are contained in the President's budget and the final \nnumber agreed upon between the Budget Committee, as well as the \nAgriculture Committee. I thank my friend, Senator Burns from Montana, \nfor his outstanding input into this and his persuasive arguments. It is \nbecause of things like that that we have been able to negotiate this \nnumber down to something that we think is now fair and reasonable.\n  Let me, first of all, say that I, too--like my Democratic colleagues \non the other side alluded to earlier--came to the floor immediately \nafter the President's budget was sent to the Hill. He was extremely \ncritical of that budget relative to the requested deficit savings in \nagriculture.\n  I, too, was at the table when we negotiated the 2002 farm bill. On \nthe House side, we felt like we had a good farm bill, and we got \ntogether with folks on the Senate side and crafted a bill that provides \na real safety net for our farmers across America.\n  The fact is that that farm bill has worked exactly like those of us \nwho crafted the farm bill wanted it to work--that is, philosophically. \nWhen times and yields are good and prices are up, there are very few \nGovernment payments going to our farmers. In tough times, when prices \nare low and yields are low, whether it be from drought or other \ncircumstances, in agriculture country the Federal Government does \nextend a helping hand not to guarantee any farmer a profit, but it \nallows them to get through to the next year when times might get \nbetter.\n  That having been said, I discussed not just on the floor of the \nSenate my displeasure with the administration relative to their budget \nproposals, but I went directly to the President. I told the President \nface to face that I was very disappointed in the numbers that had been \nsent down here and that, at the end of the day, I really did feel like \nAmerica's farmers and ranchers would be willing to pay their fair share \nfor deficit reduction, but we were simply not going to pay a \ndisproportionate amount when times are difficult in agriculture \ncountry, and when we have farmers who have depended on that 6-year farm \nbill and have made financial plans, whether it is the purchase or lease \nof land, purchase of farm equipment, or planning for the growing and \nharvesting of crops, as they have done, depending on that 6-year farm \nbill being in place.\n\n  Therefore, as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, I made a \ncommitment to our farmers and ranchers that we are going to do \neverything possible to make sure that the policy of that farm bill is \nnot changed. We can do that.\n\n  The folks on the other side, frankly, have made my argument for me. \nThat is this: They have said, correctly, that in 2002 when the farm \nbill was passed and signed into law, fiscal conservatives all across \nthe country and the media really chastised those of us that crafted \nthat farm bill for spending way too much of the American taxpayers' \nmoney on agriculture programs. We knew that if the farm bill worked \nright, we would never spend what was projected. In actuality, it was \nprojected that we would spend $52 billion on commodity programs in \n2002, 2003, and 2004, and because we have had good yields and good \nprices in those years, we have spent only $37 billion. That is just in \none title of the farm bill. So we have achieved savings of $15 billion \nin 3 years.\n  We also have the food stamp title, where no projected savings have \nbeen talked about at this point. Maybe some can be achieved. When I \ncame to Congress in 1995, USDA reported that the Food Stamp Program \nerror rate was 10 percent.\n  Last week, USDA testified before the House Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Agriculture and said that the error rate has now been \nreduced to 6 percent. That is because of the hard work of everybody in \nthis body on both sides of the aisle and everybody in the House on both \nsides of the aisle. We have squeezed that program down to where the \nerror rate is still at 6 percent. That is too much. But still it is \ncoming way down.\n  We can probably achieve some additional savings there. Also, we have \nthe conservation title, which has not been discussed. We are going to \nspend about $33 billion this year on the Food Stamp Program, about 2.5 \non conservation, and projected about 18 on commodities.\n  Now, if we have saved $15 billion on the commodity title alone in 3 \nyears, am I hearing this right, that folks on the other side are saying \nwe cannot achieve $2.8 billion over the next 5 years, not just from \ncommodities but from all three titles in the farm bill? I think that is \nkind of a ludicrous argument for us to say that when we are in tough \ntimes--times have changed since we passed this farm bill in 2002, where \nwe were in surplus times. Times have changed because we are now in a \ndeficit situation and we must be fiscally responsible in this body, \njust as our colleagues on the House side must be fiscally responsible.\n  I cannot imagine anybody saying that we cannot be treated fairly when \nwe are going to be cutting and asked to be finding savings in Medicaid, \nin transportation, in education, and in other mandatory programs, that \nfarmers and ranchers and their respective States are not going to be \nwilling to participate when we have already saved an average of $5 \nbillion per year, that we are now being asked to save $2.8 billion over \n5 years, that our farmers and ranchers would not be willing to \nparticipate in their fair share, so long as, and I emphasize this, we \ndo not change the policy in the farm bill.\n  We have entered into a colloquy with the distinguished chairman of \nthe Budget Committee that as he goes into conference he is going to do \neverything within his power to make sure we hold this $2.8 billion \nfigure because we already know the House has come in with a number in \nexcess of that. I would again say if the requested deficit savings on \nagriculture are disproportionate in any way, we need to look at it and \nwe need to rethink where we are today. But when we look at the $2.8 \nbillion and the fact that we have saved an average of $5 billion a \nyear, I know and understand we have not been asked to share in an \namount that requires that the deficit reduction requested by the \nPresident be taken out on the backs of\n\n[[Page S2907]]\n\nfarmers and ranchers. I would rather not have any, but being fiscally \nresponsible is as important as writing a good farm bill.\n  I close by saying that as I have gone around the country--and I have \nover the last 2 weeks. I have been in the far West, I have been in the \nMidwest, and I have been in the Southeast, talking to farmers and \nranchers, and I am very pleased with the reaction that farmers and \nranchers have given to me personally when we have explained to them how \nwe are going to approach these deficit savings. What I have told them \nis we are going to be fair and equitable in each and every title, and \nthat we are going to ask all of agriculture to share somewhat in the \npain, but it is not going to be disproportionate, and we are going to \nkeep the policy of the farm bill in place and we are going to find \nreductions in savings that will allow the greatest patriots in \nAmerica--and that is farmers--to participate once again in deficit \nreduction, and when we do this we want to assure, in all probability, \nthat farmers and ranchers will have this $2.8 billion returned to them \nin interest savings alone, because we all know if we continue down this \ntrail of deficit spending, interest rates are going to rise. If we act \nresponsibly in this body and also on the House side relative to this \nissue of deficit spending, we can either hold interest rates in line or \nmaybe see them reduced again, which will be of tremendous benefit to \nour farmers and ranchers.\n  I am proud to represent agriculture country. I come from the heart \nand soul of agriculture country in my State, and farmers and ranchers \nall across America are the salt-of-the-Earth people who make this \ncountry the great country it is. They have always been willing to do \ntheir fair share, and that is simply what we are asking for, nothing \nmore.\n  I yield back.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I support this amendment because it would \nprevent the damage this budget resolution seeks to inflict on Americans \nthroughout our country in all walks of life who benefit from the whole \nrange of programs within the jurisdiction of the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, where I am proud to serve as \nranking Democratic member.\n  It is said that the cuts to these programs required by this \nresolution are no cause for worry, no sweat. With respect, I must say \nthe facts are otherwise. The 2002 farm bill has already suffered \nserious cuts in three annual appropriations cycles. This budget \nresolution contains further and even deeper cuts--both in \nappropriations and through budget reconciliation instructions to our \ncommittee and the House Agriculture Committee. To be sure, the $2.8 \nbillion reconciliation instruction in this resolution is less than in \nthe President's budget, and it is less than the $5.3 billion \nreconciliation instruction in the House's version of the budget \nresolution. However, I would note that the Senate resolution does \nassume additional budget reductions of $2.7 billion, so the total \nassumed budget savings from the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and \nForestry is $5.5 billion in this resolution.\n  The budget reconciliation figures in these resolutions are a direct \nassault on the progress we made in writing a balanced farm bill in 2002 \nthat covered a whole range of needs from helping protect farm income, \nto providing food to poor families and children, to improving \nconservation and environmental practices, to promoting farm-based \nrenewable energy, to increasing food and agriculture research, to \nassisting rural economic development and others. We need to protect \nthat balance.\n  Where is the budgetary justification for making these cuts and \nupsetting the balance we struck and the progress we made in the farm \nbill? There is no justification. We have been fiscally responsible in \nthe programs falling in our committee's jurisdiction. We were provided \na budget allocation to write the 2002 farm bill and we stayed within \nit. We repaired Freedom to Farm and reinstated a countercyclical \ncommodity program. Thanks to that countercyclical feature, the \ncommodity programs have cost some $15 billion less than they were \nexpected to cost over the first three years of the 2002 farm bill. We \nalso carefully and responsibly invested some of our farm bill budget \nallocation to strengthen programs and adopt innovative new initiatives \nin conservation, agricultural trade, rural development, nutrition, \nagricultural research and renewable energy.\n  The direct harm from these budget cuts would be serious enough, but \nin addition they can only upset carefully struck balances in the 2002 \nfarm bill and reopen old arguments and old fault lines. We had broadly \nbased bipartisan support for the 2002 farm bill, but this budget \nresolution threatens to tear that all apart. This resolution would pit \none group and its interests against others--one title of the farm bill \nagainst others. As a result, we would be looking to the next farm bill \nwith a reduced budget baseline and a fractured farm bill coalition, \nwhich would surely make it all the harder and more contentious to write \nthe next farm bill.\n\n  Less than 3 years ago we passed a farm bill to repair our Nation's \nfarm income protection system. It would be irresponsible to weaken that \nsystem now and create new uncertainty--especially when we need \nbargaining leverage in the midst of global agricultural trade \nnegotiations in the WTO. Farm commodity programs are less than a half \nof a percent of the Federal budget. It is terribly misguided to propose \nthat cutting farm income protection can significantly help solve \nFederal budget deficits.\n  Nor is there money to be spared in the farm bill's conservation, \nrural economic development, research or renewable energy initiatives--\nsome of the most innovative and forward-looking parts of the 2002 farm \nbill which have already suffered the most and seem to be at the \ngreatest risk of further cuts. These initiatives constitute investments \nin the future of our Nation's food and agriculture system, our rural \ncommunities and our environment and natural resources. Believe me, we \nare not investing too much in these initiatives. We are investing far \ntoo little.\n  This resolution is especially threatening to Federal food assistance \nand nutrition programs if history is our guide. The last time there was \nbudget reconciliation, recipients of Federal food assistance took the \nheaviest hit of anyone. Think about the fairness of that. Those cuts \ndid not come from waste, fraud, and abuse, but instead were taken from \nacross-the-board benefit reductions that affected nearly all recipient \nhouseholds, including families with children, the working poor, the \nelderly, and people with disabilities.\n  This year we are hearing the same claims about waste, fraud, and \nabuse in Federal nutrition programs. In reality, we have worked hard to \nimprove the program integrity of nutrition programs, and we have done \nit on a bipartisan basis. The error rate in the Food Stamp Program is \nnow at an all-time low. There is not a realistic way to wring \nsignificant budget savings out of waste, fraud and abuse in nutrition \nprograms. It is not there. Instead, this resolution would take away \nfood from American families, most of them with children and most of \nthem working or trying to find work. We should not add new hardship to \nthe lives of working American families by cutting food assistance \nprograms.\n  For all of these reasons, I support and am proud to cosponsor the \namendment of Senator Baucus and urge my colleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Could I take a minute off of managers' time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let us be very clear what this amendment \nis about. Agriculture represents less than 1 percent of Federal \nspending. It is being asked to take 9 percent of the mandatory cuts. If \nthe Medicaid amendment is adopted, agriculture will be asked to take \n16.5 percent of the cuts, and we are less than 1 percent of the budget. \nThat is not fair. That sets a precedent.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will not yield.\n  That sets a precedent that is a profound mistake for agriculture and \nwe will rue the day when we are in the midst of negotiations that we \ncut the heart out of our negotiators' ability to level the playing \nfield for our producers. That is a mistake.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n\n[[Page S2908]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 239\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I only have a few minutes. I consider this, \nas my colleagues might guess--in all my years working on this, I sound \na little like a broken record, but this amendment restores money for \nlocal law enforcement.\n  I want to make a stark point. In the past, we had an opportunity to \ndeal with actually affecting violent crime. The way we did that was we \npassed a COPS bill that did a simple thing. It put more cops on the \nstreet in the Nation's cities and rural communities. It had a funny \neffect, a profound effect. Violent crime dropped on average 8 percent \nper year since the bill passed in 1994.\n  We began to struggle with this concept and this notion even after the \nformer Attorney General said the crime bill has worked miraculously, \nand then announced the administration was eliminating the funding for \nthe COPS Program.\n  In that process, we went from spending over $400 million on hiring \nadditional cops at the local level--not we, but local law enforcement, \nlocal mayors, local town councils, local State police hired more cops, \nand in the year 2001 we spent over $400 million on hiring new cops. \nThat number is now down to zero in this budget.\n  All of my colleagues know, notwithstanding the fact they may \nsubscribe to this notion of devolution of Government, meaning the \nFederal Government should not do anything the States can do, they have \nnot only decimated the program that allows for hiring of law \nenforcement agencies locally but they have eliminated the big three, \nthe COPS Program, the local law enforcement block grants, and the Byrne \ngrants.\n  Total support for local law enforcement from the Federal Government \nhas\n\n[[Page S2909]]\n\ngone down from $2.2 billion we were sending to local law enforcement in \nthe year 2002 to $118 million this year. Will someone on this floor \ntell me how that possibly makes sense?\n  Local law enforcement is facing what I would call the perfect storm. \nFirst, the FBI has been taken out of local law enforcement. The FBI \naccounted for somewhere between 2 and 10 percent of all the enforcement \ndone at the local level, depending on the jurisdiction, for bank \nrobberies, interstate auto theft, and a whole range of other issues. \nBut necessarily, the FBI has been taken out of that and put in \ncounterterrorism. Violent crime task forces are gone. The Federal arm \nhas been withdrawn.\n  Secondly, of the 46 or so major police agencies in the United States \nof America, 27 of them have had to cut the number of cops they have. In \nNew York, it is 3,400 cops down; Cleveland, 250; Minneapolis, 140; New \nOrleans, 100. There are some 3,373 pending applications for additional \ncops from 3,373 jurisdictions in America, totaling well over a request \nfor more than 10,000 additional law enforcement officers.\n  What is the last part of this perfect storm? The last part in the \nperfect storm is that State and local budgets are crunched. Now, I \nrealize I only have 7 minutes so I will conclude with this simple \npoint: I hear my friends say that Homeland Security is going to fill in \nthe blanks. There is not one penny in Homeland Security allowing for \nthe hiring of an additional local law enforcement officer, No. 1. No. \n2, if anybody is going to find a terrorist about to put sarin gas into \nthe heating system or cooling system of the largest mall in Little \nRock, AR, or in Savannah, GA, it is not going to be some guy wearing \nfatigues and night-vision goggles who is a special forces officer in \nthe U.S. military. It is going to be a local cop on his way from a \nDunkin' Donut shop on his rounds behind that shopping center.\n\n  So we are making a tragic mistake. I do not understand the \nPresident's rationale. My legislation calls for funding the COPS \nProgram at over $1 billion to eliminate the current backlog in \napplications and to meet State and local needs. We do it by cutting \ncorporate loopholes and we provide an additional $1 billion in deficit \nreduction as well.\n  The COPS office has met its goal of funding over 100,000 cops, but it \nis like cutting grass. Everybody says what a great job it did. Well, \nwhen one cuts their grass this summer, the first week it looks great. \nTwo weeks later, when one does not cut it, it looks a little ragged. \nSix weeks later, it is a wheatfield. That is how crime is.\n  The idea with an expanding population that we can use fewer resources \nto fight crime is absolutely mindless, and that is exactly what we \ncontinue to do.\n  These law enforcement officers taking this money over the years are a \nvictim of their own success. They made it work.\n  I will close with a quote from the president of the International \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police, IACP:\n\n       But when I first read President Bush's budget for 2006, I \n     felt as if someone had punched me in the stomach.\n\n  I ask any one of my colleagues to go home and ask any one of their \nlaw enforcement agencies, State, municipal, town, county, whether they \nneed this help. I will be dumbfounded if they find anybody who says \nthey do not. The idea that this is not a Federal responsibility is \nbeyond me.\n  Where do my colleagues think the dope is coming from that is coming \ninto their cities and towns? It is because of a failed Federal policy \non interdiction at our borders. It is because of a failed Federal \npolicy relating to all the poppy being grown in Afghanistan, a failed \nFederal policy of all the cocaine coming out of the Andes.\n  This is a Federal responsibility. To quote President Reagan--I do not \nknow who he was quoting, but he is most associated with the comment--if \nit ain't broke, do not fix it.\n  This ain't broke. It is working. Do not try to fix it by eliminating \nfunding for local law enforcement from in 2002 over $2 billion to in \nthis budget less than $118 million.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. To quote President Reagan: The only thing in this city \nthat has eternal life is a Federal program.\n  COPS is the No. 1 poster child for that statement. Why is the COPS \nProgram being wound down? Because when it was started, it was supposed \nto end after 3 years.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Not true.\n  Mr. GREGG. That was the agreement. When President Clinton offered \nthis proposal, which I supported, which I funded--I happened to chair \nthe subcommittee that funded this proposal--the understanding was it \nwould be a 3-year program. The cities and towns would come in, they \nwould get their police officers approved, and then after 3 years those \npolice officers would be off the Federal payroll, on the local payroll, \nand when we got to 100,000 police officers, the program would end. In \nthe year 2000, we got to 100,000 police officers; in the year 2001, we \ngot to 110,000 police officers--and the program goes on and on.\n  There was an agreement 2 years ago that we would only fund those \nofficers who were sort of the end of the line--in rural communities, \nessentially--and then we would terminate the program the way it was \nsupposed to be originally terminated. That has not happened, either.\n  Finally, the President, living up to the commitment of President \nClinton, has said: Enough is enough. The program did what it was \nsupposed to do, it put over 100,000 police officers on the street. As a \nresult of doing that, it has succeeded. Let's declare victory relative \nto this program because it accomplished what it was supposed to \naccomplish--it added 110,000 or 120,000 officers, I guess, in the end--\nand let's take these funds which were being used here and move them to \nanother account, specifically accounts which are going to be more \nfocused on a targeted response--primarily to the threat of terrorism--\nversus a general response.\n  The police officers, obviously, have a terrorism role, but they have \na lot broader portfolio when they walk on that street, from moving-\nvehicle crimes to, obviously, violent crimes to drug crimes. But the \ndollars that were being spent on the COPS Program have been moved over, \nessentially to homeland defense and other accounts, the purpose of \nwhich is to get the Federal role together in an area where we have a \npriority, which is fighting terrorism.\n  The officers who were put on the street by this program are \ntheoretically still on the street because the communities that use this \nprogram to basically gear these officers up--I think we paid 75 percent \nthe first year, 55 percent the second year, 25 percent the third year, \nand then it goes on the community's payroll, that officer's salary--\nthose officers are still out there, one presumes.\n  It is just extremely ironic that there would be such an outcry to \nkeep a program that the prior administration fully expected and put \nforward as a program that was going to be focused on getting 100,000 \npolice officers on the street, and when it accomplished that it would \nterminate. It accomplished that and more, and it should be terminated.\n  So I hope maybe we could prove President Reagan wrong once. He has \nbeen right on just about everything he ever did as a President, but \nmaybe we could just prove him wrong once--I'm sure it would make the \nother side happy--by showing all programs are not eternal in this city \nand we can terminate one--the COPS Program.\n  I yield the remainder of my time on this amendment, then, and we will \nmove on to the next amendment, which I guess is Senator Feinstein's.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 188\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 15 minutes of debate equally \ndivided on the Feinstein amendment on SCAAP.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 188 and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein], for herself, \n     Mr. Kyl, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Cornyn, \n     Mr. Schumer, Mr. Feingold, and Mrs. Clinton, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 188.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n\n[[Page S2910]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that Congress should enact \n  a long term reauthorization of the State Criminal Alien Assistance \n  Program and appropriate $750,000,000 for the program in fiscal year \n                                 2006)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE STATE CRIMINAL \n                   ALIEN ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) Control of illegal immigration is a Federal \n     responsibility.\n       (2) The State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (referred \n     to in this section as ``SCAAP'') provides critical funding to \n     States and localities for reimbursement of costs incurred as \n     a result of housing undocumented criminal aliens.\n       (3) Congress appropriated $250,000,000 for SCAAP to \n     reimburse State and local governments for these costs in \n     fiscal year 2003.\n       (4) Congress appropriated $300,000,000 for SCAAP to \n     reimburse State and local governments for these costs in \n     fiscal year 2004.\n       (5) Congress appropriated $305,000,000 for SCAAP to \n     reimburse State and local governments for these costs in \n     fiscal year 2005.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this concurrent resolution assume that--\n       (1) Congress will appropriate $750,000,000 for SCAAP for \n     fiscal year 2006; and\n       (2) Congress will enact long-term reauthorization of SCAAP \n     to reimburse State and local governments for the financial \n     burdens undocumented criminal aliens place on their local \n     criminal justice systems.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this is a sense-of-the-Senate \namendment sent to the floor by Senator Kyl, Senator Hutchison, Senator \nBingaman, Senator Akaka, Senator Cornyn, Senator Schumer, Senator \nFeingold, and Senator Clinton. It is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment to \nurge this Congress to reauthorize the SCAAP Program, the State Criminal \nAlien Assistance Program.\n  On every desk there is a chart that shows how much each State \nreceived for this program. What does this program do? What this program \ndoes is reimburse the State for the cost of the incarceration of an \nillegal alien. In other words, when someone comes to our country, \ncommits a crime, is convicted of that crime, is in jail or is in State \nprison, the Federal Government--it is their responsibility for all \nmatters pertaining to immigration--has reimbursed the State. The \nprogram reimburses the State for less than 20 percent of the actual \ncost to the State. The authorization is due to expire. We are asking in \nthe sense of the Senate that it be considered for reauthorization.\n  Before I speak further, my main author, Senator Kyl, wanted to make a \nfew comments and then Senator Cornyn, if I might.\n  I yield briefly to Senator Kyl.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California for \nhelping, again, to lead this effort to get adequate reimbursement to \nthe States for the incarceration of illegal immigrants. In the past, \nthe amount of reimbursement had been roughly one-third of their costs. \nThat is not enough, but at least it helped to defray the expenses of \nthe States in housing these people who were convicted of crimes and who \nwere ultimately the responsibility of the Federal Government.\n  In the last couple of years, the amount of money has gone down to the \npoint that, as the Senator said, last year it was about 17 cents on the \ndollar. That is absolutely unacceptable. If the Federal Government \ncannot do what is necessary to control the border and prevent illegal \nimmigration, at least it can help the States defray some part of their \ncost in incarcerating the people who come here and commit crimes. \nSurely we can authorize a program that could reimburse the States again \nat the level of approximately one-third of their costs. That will be \nour goal.\n  That is why I am very proud to, again, work with Senator Feinstein to \ntry to get adequate reimbursement to the States for this program. I \nfully support her effort. I compliment her for her leadership, and I \nhope my colleagues will join in accepting this sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I yield my portion of the time to the \nSenator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I also want to express my gratitude to the \nSenator from California for taking the leadership on this issue again \nthis year.\n  This is a common theme among those of us who represent border States, \nto ask the Federal Government to live up to its responsibilities. It is \nclear that the cost of housing aliens who are committing crimes in our \ncountry is a Federal responsibility. Yet for year upon year upon year \nthey have thrust that burden on the States, and indeed on the counties \nat the local level.\n  In my State, about 8,700 criminal aliens have been detained at a cost \nof roughly three times what this provision would reimburse my State. \nThis is about one-third of the money that is a Federal responsibility \nthat would go back to my State and the States that bear that Federal \nexpense.\n  I am all for the Federal Government living within its means, and I \nsupport this budget at the top-line number. I think part of budgeting \nis not only living within your means but it is making sure you fund \nyour priorities. It is arguably a Federal priority to deal with the \ndetention of illegal aliens who come into the country and commit \ncrimes. It is a scandal that this sense of the Senate is even necessary \nagain this year.\n  I want to express in closing again my gratitude to Senator Feinstein \nfor taking the leadership on this, and I certainly commend this to our \ncolleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

Res. 84) condemning violence and \n     criminality by the Irish Republican Army in Northern Ireland.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. GREGG.

Res. 84\n\n       Whereas on January 30, 2005, a Catholic citizen of Belfast, \n     Northern Ireland, Robert McCartney, was brutally murdered by \n     members of the Irish Republican Army, who attempted to cover-\n     up the crime and ordered all witnesses to be silent about the \n     involvement of Irish Republican Army members;\n       Whereas the sisters of Robert McCartney, Catherine \n     McCartney, Paula Arnold, Gemma McMacken, Claire McCartney, \n     and Donna Mary McCartney, and his fiancee, Bridgeen Karen \n     Hagans, refused to accept the code of silence and have \n     bravely challenged the Irish Republican Army by demanding \n     justice for the murder of Robert McCartney;\n       Whereas when outcry over the murder increased, the Irish \n     Republican Army expelled 3 members, and 7 members of Sinn \n     Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, were \n     suspended from the party;\n       Whereas the leadership of Sinn Fein has called for justice, \n     but has not called on those responsible for the murder or any \n     of those\n\n[[Page S2911]]\n\n     who witnessed the murder to cooperate directly with the \n     Police Service of Northern Ireland;\n       Whereas on March 8, 2005, the Irish Republican Army issued \n     an outrageous statement in which it said it ``was willing to \n     shoot the killers of Robert McCartney''; and\n       Whereas peace and violence cannot coexist in Northern \n     Ireland: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Senate joins the people of the United States in \n     deploring and condemning violence and criminality by the \n     Irish Republican Army in Northern Ireland; and\n       (2) it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (A) the sisters and fiancee of Robert McCartney deserve the \n     full support of the United States in their pursuit of \n     justice;\n       (B) the leadership of Sinn Fein should insist that those \n     responsible for the murder and witnesses to the murder \n     cooperate directly with the Police Service of Northern \n     Ireland and be protected fully from any retaliation by the \n     Irish Republican Army; and\n       (C) the Government of the United States should offer all \n     appropriate assistance to law enforcement authorities in \n     Northern Ireland to see that the murderers of Robert \n     McCartney are brought to justice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/17/senate-section/article/S2911-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2911-S2926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET FOR THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT FOR THE FISCAL \n                          YEAR 2006--Continued\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 188\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes 13 seconds on the side of \nthe Senator from California, and 7\\1/2\\ minutes on the other side.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this is a bipartisan sense of the \nSenate. President Bush, when he was Governor, used this program. The \nGovernor of my State, Governor Schwarzenegger, supports it. It is a \nhuge item, as has been stated by Senators Kyl and Cornyn, for border \nStates.\n  This is a tremendous responsibility to the Federal Government. It is \nan unfunded mandate. It is a program that should not be allowed to \nlapse.\n  We have come to the floor with this sense of the Senate to ask the \nSenate to pass this resolution so that those of us on the authorizing \ncommittee and on Appropriations can move to get this job done.\n  As I mentioned, this is a 7-year reauthorization. The amounts \nrequested for each year are spelled out in the resolution. This is a \ntotal Federal responsibility, and I am hopeful that the Senate will \naccept their responsibility.\n  I yield the floor at this time and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, what is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 1 minute \nremaining; the Senator from New Hampshire has 7\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. \nTherefore, it has no impact that involves actual events or activity. It \nexpresses the sense of the Senate as to what we think we should do on \nsomething. We have had a few of those.\n  The attempt has been, of course, to reduce the number of sense-of-\nthe-Senate amendments. This would be subject to a 60-vote point of \norder on a sense-of-the-Senate budget resolution. I will not make that \npoint of order.\n  I will say this: We will probably take this sense of the Senate. This \nis about SCAAP. SCAAP has some serious problems. That is why it has \nalways been looked at in a fairly suspect way, not only by the Bush \nadministration but before that the Clinton administration had concerns \nabout it. And the concerns are these: It essentially is a revenue-\nsharing event. Essentially these dollars go back to the States in very \nlarge amounts of money. They go to the border States, primarily \nCalifornia and Texas, New Mexico and Arizona, but primarily California \nand Texas are the two major beneficiaries of this program. But they go \nback without any strings attached.\n  The theory is that they are going to be spent to relieve some of the \nburden that is put on these States relative to incarcerating illegal \naliens who are captured in those States and are detained within those \nStates in State prison facilities. That is a legitimate purpose. We \nshould be assisting those States in that area because we are putting \npressure on those States in a unique way. Other States don't have the \nsame pressure. But there is nothing to say the money has to be spent \nthat way. It is literally a check which the Federal Government writes \nto the States of Texas, California, or Arizona. And if the Governors \nwant to use it to build a road or use it to buy a new school or for \nsome other activity, the Governors can do that.\n  I have always said let us put some language into this which makes it \nclear that this money is going to go to the States for the purpose of \ngiving those States assistance with detaining illegal aliens but isn't \ngoing to end up being used, as I suspect, for primarily a basic State \ncommitment to its own correctional system.\n  I think you can make a pretty good case that there is a history here \nof this money essentially being used to supplement efforts on the part \nof the States in their own correctional systems.\n  I hope when we reauthorize this language, which will come through the \nSenate's Judiciary Committee, that type of language which makes it \nclear this money has to be used for the purpose for which it is \ndesignated will be included. That is a debate between the authorizing \ncommittee and the appropriating committee. The Budget Committee doesn't \nhave any direct impact on that. We don't do programmatic activity at \nthe Budget Committee level.\n  I haven't read the sense of Senate yet, but I suspect we will simply \naccept it. After I read it, I may change my mind. That can be a \nmistake, as we know, around here. That is my concern and reservation \nabout the program.\n\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I respond to the distinguished Senator \nthat essentially what he said is correct. I have no objection to an \namendment in the program. My State is a big user of this program at \n$111 million last year. He is right, Texas, California, and the big \nimmigrant States are the States that are most affected by this program.\n  Moneys go to every single State. I have no objection to mandating the \nmoney must go directly into the State prison system or the county jail \nsystem, whatever that might be.\n  I point out also to the Senator when I was mayor, we had a revenue-\nsharing program. We had a community block grant program, all of which \nlooked as though they were going to go by the boards, certainly CDBG \nwith this budget. This is a total Federal responsibility. For our \nGovernment not to take that responsibility and recompense those States \nthat provide the incarceration--these people are not in Federal prison, \nthey are in State prisons--is a huge mistake.\n  I have objection, certainly, to mandating where the funds would go. \nIf the managing Senator wishes to move this by unanimous consent, I \ncertainly have no objections to that, either.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 240\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are now 15 minutes of debate equally \ndivided on the Byrd amendment on highways.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Senator from West Virginia is not here \nat this moment, so I yield myself a couple of minutes for the \nproponents of the amendment.\n  I strongly support this amendment. There are many Senators who are \nvery distressed with the very low level in the amount of transportation \nobligation funds passed out of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee the other day. There are donor States that are very upset \nwith the donor levels not being high enough, and the so-called donee \nStates are concerned that they are not properly taken care of. There \nare States that believe the minimum obligation should be higher.\n  In my experience, I have never experienced such consternation among \nso many Senators so concerned we are not paying enough for our \ninfrastructure and our highways as is the case now, compared with the \nprevious highway bill we passed a few years ago; that is, with TEA-21, \nwhich was passed about 6 years ago.\n  In the meantime, the Finance Committee is working on a provision to \nadminister money to the highway bill. Chairman Grassley and I are \nworking diligently to find a way to administer money to the highway \nbill. We hope to bring that amendment to the floor. We will not raise \ngasoline prices. We will not raise gasoline prices. There will be\n\n[[Page S2912]]\n\noffsets, so it will be budget neutral. The offsets will be in the \nnature of fuel fraud, to prevent fuel fraud, and close corporate or tax \nloopholes which we all agree should be closed.\n  I strongly urge Members to recognize we do need more money. We all \nknow that. We are finding ways in the Finance Committee to find more \nmoney. I do not know the exact amount, but it will not be a significant \namount. It will help solve the problems that Senators have in meeting \ntheir legitimate concerns as we try to meet the formula and have enough \nmoney in the highway program to build our roads and streets. This \namendment will not be a huge amount, but it will be helpful.\n  I urge Members to support the amendment that is offered by the senior \nSenator from West Virginia. Senator Byrd is in the Senate, and I highly \ncompliment the Senator for his work. He has been a champion over the \nyears. I am so impressed with the efforts he undertook about 6 years \nago when they got TEA-21 up and passed. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMontana for his overly charitable and very gracious comments concerning \nmy efforts. I thank him for his work, likewise.\n  Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to allow the Senate to \nonce again pass a $318 billion highway bill. That is precisely the bill \nthat the Senate approved last year by a vote of 76 to 21.\n  Now, my good friend, the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator \nGregg, was among the 21 Senators who voted against last year's highway \nbill. I don't have any expectations he will support the amendment. My \nplea is to the 73 Senators still serving in the Senate who voted for \nthat highway bill last year, Republicans and Democrats alike. We must \nreverse the continuing deterioration of the highways and transit \nsystems in our State. We know the right vote was cast in February of \nlast year when we approved a $318 billion highway bill despite the veto \nthreats of the President.\n  We know that the highway and transit needs in the States have not \ndiminished one thin dime since that vote last year. Today I am asking \nmy colleagues to vote again for a budget that will allow for a $318 \nbillion highway bill.\n  Just yesterday, the Environment and Public Works Committee marked up \na new highway will. The bill marked up yesterday in committee provides \nfar less funding than the bill passed last year, so that the bill's \ntotal would stay within the level of funding that President Bush has \nsaid he would accept, namely, $284 billion. That lower level of \nfunding, $284 billion, is the level incorporated in the budget \nresolution before the Senate. The product of yesterday's committee \nmarkup is harsh medicine--harsh medicine, indeed--to all 50 States in \nour Nation. The bill approved in committee yesterday distributes almost \n$25 billion less to our States in formula funds than the bill approved \nby more than three-quarters of the Senate last year.\n  We now see precisely the amount of money that States will lose as a \nresult of this retreat because it represents the elimination of almost \n1.2 million jobs that would have been created without that lost \nfunding. A major benefit of the committee having marked up its bill \nyesterday is that every Senator can see what their State will lose as a \nresult of this retreat.\n  Currently sitting on every Senator's desk is a table comparing the \namount of funding that was distributed by a formula to every State \nbetween 2005 and 2009 under the bill approved by the Senate last year \nand the smaller bill approved by the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee yesterday. I have taken the liberty of including in this \ntable the size of the job loss that results from these funding \nreductions. I ask unanimous consent this table be printed in the Record \nat this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          BYRD-BAUCUS HIGHWAY AMENDMENT\n [Allows for $318 billion highway bill as passed by the Senate in 2004 (S. 1072) instead of $284 billion bill as\n          reported by the EPW Committee yesterday.

I ask every Senator to take a close look at this table \nbefore voting on this amendment. Senators should be aware of precisely \nthe amount of investment and the number of jobs their State will be \nlosing if they vote against this amendment. In my state of West \nVirginia, failure to adopt this amendment will mean a loss of almost \n$275 million and this amendment will mean a loss of almost $275 million \nand more than 13,000 desperately needed jobs.\n  For several larger States--such as Florida, Georgia, and Ohio--the \nloss over a 5-year-period to each State is more than $1 billion and \nmore than 50,000 jobs.\n  Mr. President, before any Senator argues that my amendment just \nincreases spending without ensuring it will be spent on highways and \nmass transit, let me point out that my amendment restores the special \nhighway and transit budget categories. Every additional penny provided \nby this amendment will be required to be spent on our highways or mass \ntransit programs.\n  The offset for my amendment is the very same type of financing \nmechanism that served to enhance the receipts to the highway trust fund \nand were included in last year's highway bill with the bipartisan \nsupport of the Senate Finance Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, may I ask for 1 additional minute?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I know that some Members are saying that it \nis foolhardy to try to pass a highway bill at $318 billion because the \nPresident has already vowed to veto a measure of that size. But I wish \nto remind my colleagues that our job--our job here--is to legislate \nbased on our recognition of what is needed by our States and by the \nNation. It is the President's job to either sign that bill or veto it.\n  So I ask my colleagues, why do our constituents send us here if we do \nnot look out for their needs? We have been sent here to vote our \nconscience and to stand for the needs of our constituents. So in \noffering this amendment today, I am saying to my colleagues, let's do \nour job. Let's adopt a budget that will enable us to pass a highway \nbill that we believe addresses the transportation and commerce needs of \nthe Nation. The President will review that piece of legislation, and he \nwill either sign or veto it. That is his job. That is his prerogative. \nBut now is not the time to back away from the country's transportation \nneeds.\n  When the roll is called on this amendment, Senators will be faced \nwith a stark choice. They can either vote for the level of highway \nspending that they received in last year's highway bill or they can \nresign their constituents to ever worsening congestion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair and implore my colleagues to vote for the \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd], for himself and \n     Mr. Baucus, proposes an amendment numbered 240.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 3, line 10 increase the amount by $1,458,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 11 increase the amount by $3,536,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 12 increase the amount by $3,605,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 13 increase the amount by $2,922,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 14 increase the amount by $2,316,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 7 increase the amount by $8,920,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 8 increase the amount by $8,332,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 9 increase the amount by $8,332,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 10 increase the amount by $9,568,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 16 increase the amount by $1,458,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 17 increase the amount by $3,536,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 18 increase the amount by $3,605,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 19 increase the amount by $2,922,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 20 increase the amount by $2,316,000,000.\n       On page 15, line 15 increase the amount by $8,920,000,000.\n       On page 15, line 16 increase the amount by $1,458,000,000.\n       On page 15, line 19 increase the amount by $8,332,000,000.\n       On page 15, line 20 increase the amount by $3,536,000,000.\n       On page 15, line 23 increase the amount by $8,332,000,000.\n       On page 15, line 24 increase the amount by $3,605,000,000.\n       On page 16, line 2 increase the amount by $9,568,000,000.\n       On page 16, line 3 increase the amount by $2,922,000,000.\n       On page 16, line 7 increase the amount by $2,316,000,000.\n       On page 48, line 6 increase the amount by $579,000,000.\n       On page 48, line 7 decrease the amount by $40,372,000,000.\n       On page 48, line 8, after ``outlays for the discretionary \n     category'' add the following ``and $34,740,000,000 for the \n     highway category and $7,099,000,000 for the transit \n     category''.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I urge all our colleagues to support \nSenator Byrd's amendment, because our Nation's interstates, roads, and \nsubways are at the breaking point, and our future economic health is at \nstake.\n  This shouldn't be a hard vote, because we did it before. Just last \nyear, the Senate voted 76-21 to support the funding levels called for \nby the Byrd amendment.\n  Senators Bond, Baucus, Inhofe, Jeffords, Shelby, and Sarbanes have \nworked hard to construct a transportation bill under the constraints \nthey have been placed, but the fact is they don't have enough money.\n  The White House has issued an edict: $284 billion or nothing. Let's \ndo what we know is right for our States, for our economy, for our \nNation's future.\n  The U.S. DOT says that each $1 billion of transportation investment \nsupports and sustains 47,000 jobs.\n  Let's pass the Byrd amendment, and reaffirm our commitment to a \nstrong U.S. economy and good-paying American jobs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Can I ask the Chair what the status of the time is, Mr. \nPresident?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes 30 seconds at his \ndisposal.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this proposal increases spending over the \nbill by approximately $30 billion. That is a fairly significant amount \nof money. It also raises taxes by $14 billion, which is also a \nsignificant amount of money. We are now at a point where amendments \noffered from the other side of the aisle increase spending by \napproximately $100 billion and increase taxes by approximately $60 \nbillion. At some point you must ask the question, What is the purpose \nof a budget if the only purpose is to simply increase taxes and \nincrease spending?\n  From my viewpoint, the purpose of the budget is to actually try to \nput in fiscal discipline and have some controls over spending and, as a \nresult, have some controls over the amount of money we are taking out \nof people's pockets. Remember, it is their money, not our money, and \nspending it for them rather than allowing them to spend it themselves.\n  So I obviously oppose this amendment. As the Senator from West \nVirginia noted, I voted against the $318\n\n[[Page S2914]]\n\nbillion when it came through the first time. And I do note that, yes, \nthere were a number of people who voted for that at the time. But I do \nnote the President, working with the Members of the Congress, has \nreached an agreement as to what we can afford in the area of highway \nfunds, and that agreement is $284 billion.\n  Now, we put that in the budget. That is what we put in the budget. \nNow, some might say, well, that is not enough, but actually I think it \nis almost $50 billion more than where we started. I think we started at \n$236 billion for this highway bill, or somewhere in that range.\n  So there has been a fair amount of movement upward toward trying to \naddress the issue of infrastructure in this country and making sure \nthat highway construction is adequately funded. So $284 billion is not \na small amount of change. It is a rather significant amount of money \nand is a very strong commitment to the highways.\n  There is a second amendment floating around here on the issue of \nhighways, which is offered by the Senator from Missouri, and was \ndiscussed earlier today, which would change the way that we might add \nmoney into the highway bill. We put in the budget resolution a reserve \nfund which essentially said that more dollars could go into the highway \nbill, you could get to the number the Senator from West Virginia \nproposed, if you legitimately raised revenues to pay for it. And \nlegitimately raising revenues means having proposals which actually \nwill produce revenues as versus ones that are a lot of smoke and a lot \nof mirrors.\n  So the language is not overly restrictive, it is reasonable. But it \ndoes expect that if we raise this highway fund up, it will be done in a \nway that is paid for appropriately out of highway-related activity, not \nout of the general fund.\n  That is a very important point because when this highway bill was put \ntogether there was some movement of dollars from the general fund into \nthe highway fund through basically moving around the accounting \nmechanism for the ethanol tax. So we put in place this reserve fund \nwhich does allow for the dollars spent on highways to go up.\n\n  I put that in because there were a lot of people here who believed \n$284 billion was not an acceptable number.\n  Now, the President says it is an acceptable number. In fact, he said \nhe will veto anything over that number. But I believed as long as it \nhas hard pay-fors we will consider it. And that is reasonable.\n  Now, the amendment that is floating around here would basically take \nthose hard pay-fors and move them back to what I would call, not \nillusory because they are not that specious, but they really are not \nvery hard pay-fors. There could be a lot of games played with the \nlanguage that is being proposed relative to what the pay-fors would be, \nand you might end up, unfortunately, spending the money but not ever \ngetting the revenues in to cover those costs.\n  So I oppose that language, too, because I do feel very strongly that \nif we are going to go above the $284 billion level, we need to go above \nit with hard pay-fors that come out of highway activity, not out of the \ngeneral fund.\n  So these two amendments are floating around here. I guess they are \ngoing to be voted in sequence probably. I just want to point out that I \nthink both of them do damage to this budget in the area of fiscal \ndiscipline. And the one that is before us right now would raise taxes \nby $14 billion and increase spending by $35 billion, which is just too \nmuch to handle in the context of this budget, where the highway number \nis an agreed-to number between the two bodies and the President.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 241\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to reporting the amendment?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Bunning] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 241.\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today, I rise to offer a very important \namendment dealing with taxes on Social Security benefits. For too many \nyears, senior citizens have carried an unnecessary and unfair tax \nburden on their shoulders. Today we have an opportunity to remove it.\n  Historically, Social Security benefits were not taxed. However, in \n1983, Congress changed the rules of the game. That year, Congress \npassed legislation to begin taxing up to 50 percent of a senior's \nSocial Security benefit if their income was over $25,000 for a single \nindividual or $32,000 for a couple.\n  This move subjected many seniors across the country to an \nunanticipated tax increase and forced them to send a portion of their \nSocial Security benefit back to the IRS.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I oppose the taxation of Social Security \nbenefits. Nevertheless, deficits continue to rise to alarming levels, \nand the tax cuts authorized by this budget resolution will worsen those \ndeficits significantly. I urge the Finance Committee to pay for any tax \ncuts included in the reconciliation bill authorized by this budget \nresolution.\n  In 1993, Congress was at it again, and that year the Clinton tax was \npassed. The Clinton tax allows 85 percent of a senior's Social Security \nBenefit to be taxed if their income is above $34,000 for a single and \n$44,000 for a couple.\n  The additional money this tax raises doesn't even go to help Social \nSecurity's solvency--instead it goes into the Medicare program.\n  I was in Congress in 1993, and I fought with many of my colleagues \nagainst the Clinton tax. Unfortunately, we lost that fight and the tax \nwent into place.\n  Some people may argue that this is a tax only on so-called ``rich'' \nseniors, but that just isn't the case. In fact, the income thresholds \nboth for the 50 percent tax and the 85 percent tax haven't changed \nsince they were first enacted back in 1983 and 1993.\n  A lot has changed in the last two decades, and more and more seniors \nare being affected by these taxes. In fact, it\n\n[[Page S2915]]\n\nis estimated that over 15 million beneficiaries pay taxes on their \nSocial Security benefits.\n  Eleven million of these pay taxes on up to 85 percent of their Social \nSecurity benefit.\n  On one hand, we tell seniors to plan and save for retirement, and on \nthe other we tax them for doing just that. In the past, there have been \nefforts by members of Congress--including myself--to remove the Clinton \ntax.\n  Today, the amendment I am introducing finally takes steps to repeal \nthe Clinton tax. The amendment provides additional money under \nreconciliation so that this tax can be rolled back.\n  This means that the 85 percent tax tier would be eliminated and the \nmaximum amount of Social Security benefits that could be taxed would be \n50 percent.\n  This amendment will allow millions of seniors to keep more of their \nSocial Security benefits in their pocket. Some of us have been trying \nto undo this tax for years, and this amendment finally gives us an \nopportunity to do that.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and to end this unfair \ntax on seniors and their Social Security benefits.\n  Mr. President, I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time off the Republican debate \ntime?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, Senator Gregg and I will work out how the \ntime is used right here. It will either come out of the time in \nopposition or perhaps we could work out how we are using the balance of \nthe time here, the 7\\1/2\\ minutes. Did the Senator want to use the time \nin opposition or should I use this time?\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator may use the time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will use the time and talk about the side by side. So \nwe will be using the 7\\1/2\\ minutes on the other side of this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. It is the best way, I say to my colleagues, to try to \nkeep this all on track. We are trying to get to the 1 o'clock mark and \nbe able to proceed with all of the amendments that are stacked.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 243\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. I send to the desk an amendment and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 243.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that the tax cuts assumed \nin the budget resolution should include the repeal of the 1993 increase \n             in the income tax on Social Security benefits)\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  .SENSE OF THE SENATE ON REDUCING THE TAX ON SOCIAL \n                   SECURITY BENEFITS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the tax cuts assumed in \n     this resolution include repeal of the 1993 law that subjects \n     85% of certain Social Security benefits to the income tax, \n     provided that the revenue loss to the Medicare Hospital \n     Insurance Trust Fund is fully replaced so that the seniors' \n     access to health care is not adversely affected. If the \n     inclusion of these proposals would otherwise cause the cost \n     of the tax cuts to exceed the level authorized in the \n     resolution, any excess should be fully offset by closing \n     corporate tax loopholes.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this amendment is very simple. It says it \nis the sense of the Senate that the tax cuts assumed in this resolution \ninclude repeal of the 1993 law that subject 85 percent of certain \nSocial Security benefits to the income tax, provided that the revenue \nlost to the medical hospital insurance trust fund is fully replaced so \nthat seniors' access to health care is not adversely affected. If the \ninclusion of these proposals would otherwise cause the cost of the tax \ncuts to exceed the level authorized in the resolution, any excess \nshould be fully offset by closing corporate tax loopholes.\n  We are proposing eliminating that tax on Social Security, as Senator \nBunning is proposing. We are proposing doing it in a way that the \nrevenue lost to the Medicare hospital insurance trust fund is fully \nreplaced so that seniors' access to health care is not adversely \naffected. As I have indicated, if the inclusion of these proposals \nwould otherwise cause the cost of the tax cuts to exceed the level \nauthorized in the underlying resolution, any excess should be fully \noffset by closing corporate tax loopholes.\n  This will now be in the queue, along with the Bunning amendment.\n  I retain my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask the Senator from North Dakota, through the Chair, if \nhe would mind yielding a couple of minutes off the 7\\1/2\\ minutes to \nthe Senator from Kentucky to respond to the Senator's point.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield 2 minutes to the Senator.\n  Mr. BUNNING. It won't take long. I am encouraged that the Senator \nfrom North Dakota agrees with me that this is an unfair tax. Everybody \nhere knows what a sense of the Senate is. It does not get into law. It \nis just how we feel and makes ourselves feel good by offering a sense \nof the Senate. The amendment I have offered actually removes the 35 \npercent increase that was put on in 1993. The sense of the Senate \ndoesn't touch it. It just says: We should take a look at it. We feel \ngood about doing it. But we are not going to do it at this time.\n  I urge all of my colleagues who are watching, listening, if they want \nto really reduce the tax on Social Security recipients, they should \nvote for the Bunning amendment. If they want to feel good about what \nthey are doing and not really remove the 35 percent tax, then I would \nencourage them to vote for the amendment of the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Let's be very clear: The legal effect of our two \namendments is precisely the same--precisely the same. Why is that the \ncase? Because a budget resolution cannot compel the Finance Committee \nto do anything in terms of policy. That is just a fact. I know it is \nconfusing to our colleagues, but the chairman has said a dozen times at \nleast on the floor of the Senate that the budget resolution cannot \ncompel the Finance Committee to make any specific policy determination \nwith respect to revenue. All we are doing is telling them how much \nrevenue to raise. That is the same with respect to the appropriations \ncommittees. A budget resolution does not tell the appropriators what \nspecific way they are to reach the numbers. It just gives them a \nnumber.\n  So let us be absolutely clear--the force and effect of our two \namendments is no different. Senator Bunning is attempting to send a \nsignal to the Finance Committee about how they should treat the \nreconciliation process. That is what my amendment does as well. We are \nsending the same signal in the sense that we are both saying, take this \nSocial Security benefits tax as it relates to income tax off the table.\n  The place where I think he has made a very important point is that, \nsince these taxes were put in place back in 1993, there has never been \nany change in the income levels that it relates to.\n  That is something that I think we can absolutely agree on. This just \ndoesn't make any sense. It is indefensible that there has not been any \nadjustment. So we are sending this amendment to our colleagues with the \nhope and the expectation that they will pay the same attention to it \nthat they will pay to the amendment of the Senator from Kentucky. We \nare about to enter the time when we will cast a series of votes. I \ndon't know how many votes we now have in the queue; I think it is \napproaching 30 amendments. It may be useful at this point to send a \nmessage to our colleagues about how we are going to try to conduct \nthese votes.\n  We are going to be asking our colleagues to accept short time limits \non the votes. People will have a chance to make arguments for and \nagainst the amendments to remind people of the subject of their \namendments. It is important for colleagues to structure their schedules \nfor the remainder of the day that will allow them to stay in or close \nto the Chamber. We don't want colleagues to miss votes.\n\n[[Page S2916]]\n\n  At the same time, we want to move these votes as expeditiously as \npossible. Thirty votes is just the beginning. Let us alert our \ncolleagues one more time. In addition to the 30 votes, or thereabouts, \nalready in the queue, we have dozens and dozens of additional \namendments that have been noticed. When the first vote starts, we will \nbe asking the leadership--at least on our side, and the Senator can \nspeak to his side--to go to Members who have noticed amendments and ask \nthem to sharply reduce the number of amendments they intend to offer.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I will yield 1 minute off of my time, if \nthe Senator from Kentucky needs it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 3 minutes left on Senator Bunning's \ntime.\n  Mr. BUNNING. The only thing I want to say is that my amendment gives \nthe Finance Committee the resources to do this. A sense of the Senate \ndoes not give the Finance Committee the resources to make the changes \nin the law that reduces the 35 percent tax on senior citizens.\n  I yield back my time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, what is the next amendment in order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Clinton amendment.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding that on this amendment there are 20 \nminutes equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen minutes equally divided.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 244\n\n  (Purpose: To expand access to preventive health care services that \n  reduce unintended pregnancy (including teen pregnancy), reduce the \n    number of abortions, and improve access to women's health care)\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of \nSenator Clinton and others.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n  The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for himself, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. \nKerry, Mr. Corzine, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Lautenberg, and Mrs. Feinstein, \nproposes an amendment numbered 244.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, whether you are pro-life or pro-choice, \nDemocrat or Republican, this amendment advances goals we should all \nshare: reducing the number of unintended pregnancies, abortions, and \nimproving access to women's health care.\n  This amendment would allow us to increase funding for national family \nplanning, title X, pass the measure Senator Snowe and I have worked on, \nand improve awareness of emerging contraception and improved teen \npregnancy prevention programs.\n  One-half of the unintended pregnancies in this country wind up with \nabortion. Why can't we move forward with this amendment? It should be \nbipartisan. It is an amendment that would really help--$100 million to \nhelp these programs. These moneys come from closing tax loopholes for \ncorporations that go overseas and, I believe, cheat Americans out of \ntheir rightful tax dollars. This money would stay in America.\n  There was a column in the paper yesterday that said this bill--now \nthis amendment--has been greeted with the sound of one party clapping: \nthe Democrats. Why can't we get support from the majority party for \nthis amendment? We continually talk about the issue of abortion. Here \nis a way to cut as many as 3 million abortions over a 2-year period of \ntime. That seems like a worthy goal. That is what this amendment is all \nabout. It is about fairness, about making progress in a problem that is \ncreating problems in this country. We should hold our heads high in \ndoing this.\n  I hope this doesn't become a pro-life, pro-choice issue. This is an \nAmerican issue. It is good for the American people, and it is \nespecially good for young girls, teenagers. We need to stop the scourge \nof teenage pregnancy. There are only a couple of nations in the world \nthat we are behind in teenage pregnancies. I hope that this amendment \nwill be adopted by an overwhelming vote. I have some doubts that it \nwill be, because we seem to be in partisan mode here, and that is too \nbad.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask that the time run equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. How much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 4\\1/2\\ minutes for Senator Clinton \nand 7 minutes for the majority.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am going to use time off Senator \nClinton's time on this amendment.\n  We have before us a budget resolution that purports to be fiscally \nresponsible. This budget resolution before us is anything but that. The \nhard reality is that the budget before us increases the debt every year \nof its terms by over $600 billion.\n  When they say this is going to cut the deficit in half, their own \ndocument shows their projections of debt increase are over $600 billion \na year, each and every year of this budget. That is not fiscally \nresponsible.\n  I see that the Senator from New York has arrived in the Chamber. I \nadvise her that she has about 3 minutes left of her time.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I thank my friend, who knows more about \nthe budget than I think anybody in Washington. He has, once again, done \na tremendous job in trying to help educate all of us about the \nconsequences.\n  I strongly endorse the amendment that Senator Reid and I have \noffered, the Prevention First amendment. This is an area where Senator \nReid and I absolutely agree that we need to do more to cut the rate of \nunintended pregnancies; therefore, the rate of abortions in our \ncountry.\n  The statistics are pretty stark that half of the pregnancies in the \nUnited States are unintended, and nearly half of those are terminated. \nMaking contraception more accessible will help us reduce the number of \nunintended pregnancies and abortions.\n  The Prevention First amendment will ensure there is money in the \nbudget that will provide more family planning services and that will \nchange our health insurance law to give women equal rights of access to \nprescription contraception. It just boggles my mind that insurance \ncompanies pay for Viagra and they will not pay for birth control. I do \nnot understand that at all. That is just backward, in my mind.\n  It increases the title X services that are so important in providing \nthat support, as well as ending insurance discrimination when it comes \nto contraceptive coverage.\n  It provides better public awareness for emergency contraception, \nwhich could prevent many thousands of abortions. It is a prescription \ndrug that, if FDA approves over the counter, does not interrupt or \ndisrupt an established pregnancy. According to the Journal of the \nAmerican Medical Association, there is no risk associated with \nemergency contraception.\n  Finally, this amendment provides funding to programs dedicated to \ndecreasing teen pregnancy. In my husband's 1995 State of the Union \nAddress, he made that a goal of his administration, and we accomplished \na lot. But we still have a long way to go.\n  If you are pro-choice or pro-life, if you believe we should do more \nto find common ground on this often difficult and contentious issue, \nand if you want to spend some money to save money and decrease \nabortions and unintended pregnancies, then please support the Clinton-\nReid amendment to the budget.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I suggest the absence of a quorum, with the time to be \ncharged equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Parliamentary inquiry: In terms of the time, when we\n\n[[Page S2917]]\n\nare charging the time equally at this point, we are charging time \nequally off the amendment; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: What is left in the \nqueue, so colleagues who are watching can be informed where we stand \nwith respect to the schedule?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is the Lautenberg debt limit amendment \nwith 10 minutes equally divided, and Senator Gregg has 5 minutes 40 \nseconds on the Clinton amendment remaining.\n  Mr. CONRAD. To recap, if I can, so colleagues understand about where \nwe are, is this correct, that we would have 10 minutes on the \nLautenberg amendment equally divided which is in relationship to debt \nlimit?\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. And then Senator Gregg has 5 minutes in relationship to \nthe Clinton amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Then the schedule of going to the votes that are in \nsequence would start at 1 o'clock?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. So our colleagues should be advised that the voting will \nbegin at or about 1 o'clock. Can the Chair advise us of how many \namendments are pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 25 amendments pending, with the \nLautenberg amendment. The Senator from North Dakota has 9 minutes of \nmanager time still left which he can use at any time. The Senator from \nNew Hampshire has 15 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CONRAD. So I think it is fair, in terms of advising our \ncolleagues, very shortly we are going to start on a voting sequence \nthat will include--is it 25 amendments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, 25.\n  Mr. CONRAD. So 25 amendments are in queue. We can generally do--\ncorrect me if I am wrong--we can roughly do three votes an hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Maybe four.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I just say, I have never seen us accomplish four. We have \ntried.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is in the \nchair; we will do four, but he is leaving in a few minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. With 25 votes stacked, we are talking about 8 hours of \nvoting; would that not be correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The math seems sound, yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair. We are awaiting Senator Lautenberg to \ntake up the 10 minutes on his amendment, unless Senator Gregg wants the \nremaining time on the Clinton amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, will the Chair advise us when the time on \nthe Clinton amendment has been eliminated and the time on the \nLautenberg amendment commences?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute 37 seconds left on the \nmajority side. All time has expired on the minority side.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair. I again suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nset aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 187\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I call up amendment No. 187 and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Lautenberg], for himself \n     and Mr. Schumer, proposes amendment numbered 187.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To strike the debt ceiling reconciliation instruction)\n\n       On page 30, strike lines 19 through 23.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Schumer be added \nas a cosponsor to amendment No. 187.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this budget resolution includes a \nreconciliation instruction to raise the debt limit by $446 billion. \nThat is a lot of money. That is $1,510 for every man, woman, and child \nin America. I think the Senate ought to have a debate on whether to add \n$1,500 to the indebtedness of each and every American, and that is why \nI am offering this amendment.\n  The amendment is to strike the reconciliation instruction. This \nbudget resolution includes a debt limit increase automatically for one \nreason: that my friends on the other side of the aisle do not want to \nhave a debate about how exploding budget deficits are piling up our \nnational debt. Instead, what we see is an attempt to hide yet another \ndebt limit increase by burying it deep in the budget.\n  We used to have debt limit increase debates on a regular basis, and \nwe made it hard to increase the debt limit because we knew ultimately \nthe deficits would overwhelm us.\n  This record-setting deficit the administration is running will have \nreal consequences for every family. As the Government borrows more \nmoney, much of it from foreign central banks, eventually it is going to \ncause interest rates to go up. It is inevitable. When interest rates go \nup, it hurts each and every American. Houses cost more. Cars cost more. \nCollege certainly costs more. Investment capital for small businesses \ncosts more.\n  We often hear the money our Government spends is the people's money. \nThat is true, but it is also true that the money our Government borrows \nis the people's debt.\n  We passed a bankruptcy bill that I think is punitive to working \nAmericans who lose their jobs, have a catastrophic illness or an \ninjury, or run up their credit card debt to try to pay their bills. \nOver and over again, our friends on the other side say people have to \npay their debts. Well, is this any different?\n  What I have here is the Bush administration's credit card. We like to \nuse this as a reference. It is issued by the Bank of Our Children's \nFuture. That is what it says. It says the President is over the limit. \nThat is because public debt under this administration has been run up \nto $7.7 trillion and each American's share of that debt is over \n$26,000. Hear this: Every American is going to be saddled with a debt \namounting to $26,000 as a result of our increasing indebtedness. But \n$7.7 trillion apparently is not enough, which is where we are. \nPresident Bush wants this credit limit increased.\n  When they make that kind of request, it usually needs some scrutiny. \nThe majority party in the Senate wants to give him that increase, but \nthey want to do it without anybody noticing, without any conversation \nabout it. So they bury it in the budget resolution.\n  We need to discuss whether it is a good idea to increase this credit \nlimit because each and every American gets stuck paying the bill, \nincluding our children and our grandchildren.\n\n[[Page S2918]]\n\n  We should be talking about paying off the debt on this card, as we \ndid in 1997. I was then the ranking member of the Budget Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Let us face up to our responsibility. Let us quit \npiling debt on the backs of our children and grandchildren. I urge my \ncolleagues, support this amendment, let the debate begin, and let us \nexamine it in the light of day.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, what is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 4\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, it is not a unique procedure to use \nreconciliation to address the debt limit. The debt limit is something \nthat as a Government we have to do. If the debt is run up, the debt \nlimit has to be run up or else the bonds cannot be issued in order to \nset up the debt properly.\n  If that is not done, what happens? The Government shuts down. So in a \nnumber of instances, and I believe even in the Democratic Party, in two \ninstances when the Democratic Party controlled the Senate, \nreconciliation included the debt limit. So it is the responsible thing \nto do to have this vehicle available.\n  That does not mean the Finance Committee will use it. It may be that \nwe will not use it. But we need to have this vehicle available in order \nto make sure the Government continues to operate. In fact, one could \nargue that if this amendment were to pass, it would put in jeopardy at \nsome point down the road the operation of the Government because the \ndebt limit might be put in the position where it could not pass. That \nis not hyperbole. That is a distinct possibility and a hypothetical \nthat could actually occur.\n  So the responsible thing to do is to have debt limit reconciliation \ninstructions as one of the elements. That is why the Budget Act allows \nfor it. Interestingly enough, this is not something we created. It was \ncreated by the Budget Act which was, of course, written under a \nDemocratic Congress. As I mentioned, it has been used twice when the \nDemocratic Party was in the majority. So it is a reasonable approach. \nIt is something that needs to be included within the budget, and I \nwould certainly hope this amendment would be rejected.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, is there a response time available on \nthis?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield an additional minute to the Senator from New \nJersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is yielded an additional minute.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I say to the distinguished chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, yes, we have to pay our bills. We cannot ignore our \nobligations. But when one borrows money, there is a contract that is \nsigned and it is done with an open mind. Here we are being asked to \ntake on more debt without having any discussion about what it is that \nwould compel us to increase the national debt.\n  The national debt is going to drown us and we now have a chance to \nexamine it in the light of day, and that is what I would like to see us \ndo. That is why we should take it from this budget resolution and \ndiscuss it in an open debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Having now reached \nthe hour of 1, the order would provide that the votes start at 1; is \nthat correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Votes may begin at this time. Each manager has \nadditional time that does not have to be utilized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The chairman of the committee and I have agreed we will \nput in a quorum call at this moment, and we will remind colleagues that \nwe will begin the voting very shortly.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the time remaining \nwhich I have and the Democratic manager has, Senator Conrad, that we be \nable to reserve that time and use it at a later period in the day, \nduring the voting.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I now move that we go to the first issue, \nwhich is going to be the Medicaid amendment offered by Senator Frist, \nthe majority leader, and I yield myself a minute on that. Each side has \na minute?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I make a point of order a quorum is not \npresent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when we begin \nto vote the order of votes will be as follows, for the initial set of \namendments.\n  We will begin with the majority leader's amendment relative to \nMedicaid, which is No. 229; followed by the Bingaman for Senator Smith \namendment on Medicaid, No. 204; followed by the Carper amendment on \nfull consideration of tax cuts, No. 207; followed by the Snowe-Wyden \ndrug pricing amendment, No. 214; followed by the Harkin vocational \neducation amendment, No. 172; followed by the Hutchison-Ensign Border \nPatrol amendment, No. 218; followed by the Landrieu National Guard \namendment, No. 219; followed by the Salazar-Conrad rural education and \nhealth amendment, No. 215; followed by the Dorgan runaway corporations \namendment, No. 210; followed by the Lieberman-Collins first responder \namendment, No. 220; followed by the Vitter port security, amendment, \nNo. 223; followed by the Vitter Corps of Engineers amendment, No. 224; \nfollowed by the Allen, as modified, NASA amendment, No. 197; followed \nby the Sarbanes CDBG amendment, No. 156, followed by the Coleman CDBG \namendment, No. 230; followed by the Cochran emergency retirement \namendment, No. 208; followed by the Kennedy education amendment, No. \n177; followed by the Baucus-Conrad amendment No. 234, agriculture; \nfollowed by the Biden COPS amendment, No. 239; followed by the \nFeinstein State Criminal Assistance Program, No. 188; followed by the \nByrd highways amendment, No. 240; followed by the Talent highway \namendment, No. 225; followed by the Conrad sense of the Senate \nregarding Social Security tax, No. 243; followed by the Bunning repeal \nof Social Security tax, No. 241; followed by the Clinton-Reid \nprevention first amendment, No. 244; followed by the Lautenberg debt \nlimit amendment, No. 187.\n  That is the first group of amendments which we will be taking up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we are going to move to the Frist amendment \nin a few minutes, and begin to vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, through the Chair to the two managers of the \nbill, it is my personal feeling we shouldn't have the 1 minute on each \nside. It is an inordinate amount of time. It never amounts to 1 minute. \nI think we should just vote. When we take 1 minute when we have 25 or \n30 votes, it will add an inordinate amount of time to these amendments. \nI have not spoken to the majority leader, but it would be my feeling \nthat the Members have had\n\n[[Page S2919]]\n\ntheir say and we should run right through the votes.\n  Mr. GREGG. I think the Democratic leader has made a very constructive \nsuggestion for the process. I would be happy to accept that.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I personally think that would be a \nmistake. My experience here has been when we have so many votes \noccurring that if there is not some explanation, people literally may \nnot know what they are voting on. If we want to reduce it to 30 \nseconds, I think you need at least a moment for people to have it \nbrought to their attention what the vote pertains to.\n  I urge us to have at least a limited amount of time for those who are \nfor and against to have some explanation before the vote.\n  Mr. REID. This can only be done by unanimous consent, obviously. One \nof the managers of the bill doesn't agree. I should tell everyone this \nis going to add at least an hour to the votes--I will bet more than \nthat. We have staff here. We have nice staff. If people do not know \nwhat the votes are, that is unfortunate. But, anyway, it takes \nunanimous consent, and I understand that.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, if I could say this: Yes, people have \nstaff. But the staff who are here are the staff of those of us who are \nmanaging this resolution. Many individuals don't have staff in this \nChamber. I have found that when we start having 25 or 30 votes in a \nrow, Members can get almost disoriented about what they are voting on. \nI think it would be a mistake not to have a chance to say what it is.\n  Mr. REID. Does the Senator think that 30 seconds for each side would \nbe better than the 1 minute? Could we accept that? I am indicating that \nif everything goes well, we will be finished with this stuff at 12 or 1 \no'clock tonight.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I absolutely agree with the Senator on the need to \ncompress the time. As the Senator knows, we have been working \ndiligently to try to organize this in a way that reduces the time. I \nwould accept going to 30 seconds on a side.\n  Mr. GREGG. I am happy to go to 30 seconds for each side.\n  Mr. REID. I have not checked with Senator Frist. I wouldn't want to \ndo anything without checking with him. I don't think it would be \nappropriate. If he doesn't agree to this, I would be happy to rescind \nthe unanimous consent request. In the meantime, I ask unanimous consent \nthe time between votes be 30 seconds per side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, recognizing that the first amendment to be \nconsidered is the Frist amendment, are the yeas and nays ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They are not.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all amendments \nafter this amendment be 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before we start, I know the majority leader \nwould agree. We have to keep a better tab on the time around here. It \nis possible to speed things up. I am sure this vote will take more than \n10 minutes. After that I think we should enforce the 10-minute rule. If \npeople can't get here to vote because they have business to conduct, \nthey may have to miss some votes.\n  I hope the majority would allow the 10-minute vote to be a 10-minute \nvote. I understand that if there is a vote which is close and people \nhave to play around the votes a little bit, that stalls a little bit. \nThe majority has the right to call votes to a close. I hope they would \ndo it, recognizing that every minute they allow these votes to go \nbeyond the 10 minutes is additional time people could be doing other \nthings.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 229\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 30 seconds on each side.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise on behalf the majority leader, who \nis detained at another location. The majority leader's amendment simply \naccomplishes the best of both worlds in the sense that he continues the \nreconciliation instruction so we will move forward with Medicaid \nreform.\n  This year, he also sets up a commission which makes it very clear \nthat Medicaid reform will not impact services to children or people who \nare in need but would, rather, look at how we improve this process of \ndelivering Medicaid services without undermining the process of \nMedicaid services.\n  As I said before, if we do not move forward with reconciliation this \nyear, we are not going to do it at all.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, 200-plus groups who support the Smith-\nBingaman amendment believe this would be a poison pill. I fear the same \nbecause it tries to put the Senate on record as requiring the Senate \nFinance Committee, under the Damocles sword of reconciliation, to \nreport out an agreement that Secretary Leavitt may reach with any group \nof Governors--not even a majority, not even from the National Governors \nAssociation.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 49, nays 51, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 57 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--49\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--51\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n  The amendment (No. 229) was rejected.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 204\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We will let the time run.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, briefly, all the arguments have been made. \nEverybody knows we are dealing with a Damocles sword when you put \nreconciliation on Medicaid that covers the most vulnerable Americans. I \nthink right now is simply the time to say vote your conscience.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, to the extent there is a Damocles sword, it \nis hanging over the generations to come who are going to have to pay \nthe bills for our generation. The failure to address those bills today \nis going to make it virtually impossible for our children and their \nchildren to have the quality of life we have had because of the tax \nburden we are going to pass on. I hope people vote ``no.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. FRIST. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I make another appeal to our colleagues. We \nare going to start strictly cutting off the votes. We are going to ask \npeople to stay in the Chamber or right outside the Chamber. Again, we \nhave a lot of votes. We have to get through them.\n  I also want to take 2 minutes to address an issue that I mentioned \nthis morning in opening, and it has to do with a particular case in \nFlorida, the Terri Schiavo case. Over the course of the day and, \nindeed, yesterday, we have been working together, both sides of the \naisle, to bring resolution to an issue that has fallen to us which we, \nfor the most part in this body, agree we need to address before leaving \ntoday.\n  I am going to propound two unanimous consent requests. We do not want \nto have at this point a large debate or discussion on the issue, but it \nis important that we act now because in working with the House of \nRepresentatives, we do, at the end of the day, want to pass \nlegislation. And because they will be going out shortly over the course \nof the day, we want to make it clear it is an issue we are all working \ntoward and I believe we can solve today and, thus, I will propound will \nhave these two unanimous consent requests. I will explain very briefly \nthe first of the two unanimous consent requests. The House has a bill \nthey have passed. It is a bill that, for the most part, on both sides \nof the aisle there has been some concern that we have not been able \nto get unanimous consent just in our discussions. That will be the \nfirst unanimous consent request.\n\n  The second unanimous consent request will be a private relief bill \nthat is targeted to this particular case. It is a bill that both sides \nare discussing, and it is a bill on which I think over the next several \nhours we can come to some sort of mutual agreement.\n  What is important is that this body act. If we do not act, there is a \npossibility that a woman who is alive today--and everybody agrees she \nis alive today--while we are on recess will have termination of all \nfeeding and water. She will be starved to death. Without going into a \nlot of details--a lot of people are discussing it--that is what we \nwould do from a procedural standpoint.\n  The first unanimous consent request relates to a House bill that many \npeople told me is unacceptable. The second unanimous consent request \nrelates to a bill on which we worked together and is very targeted.\n\n\n                 Unanimous Consent Request--H. R. 1332\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of H.R. 1332, the House-passed legislation \nrelating to Theresa Marie Schiavo, that the bill be read a third time \nand passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that \nany statements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I object, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The majority leader has the floor.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 653\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. 653, a bill introduced by \nSenator Martinez regarding Theresa Marie Schiavo, that the bill be read \na third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, we are working with a number \nof Senators on this side of the aisle to see if we can work out \nsomething on this legislation. So I tell the majority leader that we \nneed more time because there is a number of Senators who have concerns. \nSo I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader has the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will be happy to yield to the floor \nmanager.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise as a strong supporter of the bill \nof the Senator from Florida. I think it is absolutely imperative that \nwe as a body take action to give a Federal court an opportunity to \nreview this determination.\n  A woman's life is at stake, and it is absolutely imperative that we \ntake action today. We are working diligently on both sides--I thank the \nmajority leader and I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. \nSantorum--and we are going to take action today. So we have to try to \nwork through some issues to make certain we get that opportunity. But I \npledge as the manager of this bill that we will interrupt this bill at \nany time when we have a resolution so that we can take action to save \nthis woman's life or to give a court an opportunity to review this \ncase.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, there will be opportunities later when we \naddress the bill for people who feel passionately about it to speak. We \nare on the budget resolution. People know we are working in a \nbipartisan way to resolve this matter to save her life which, at the \nend of the day, is the goal.\n  I request people not say a lot right now so we can proceed with the \nbudget votes unless there is something new to be said; otherwise, we \nwill have an opportunity later tonight.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the regular order.\n  Mr. FRIST. Regular order.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the amendment of the \nSenator from Delaware.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Excuse me?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the amendment of the \nSenator from Delaware.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. May I make a point of parliamentary inquiry?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like to know with whom this \nlegislation has been shared? It certainly has not been shared with me, \nand I do not intend to just sit here while we change the nature of all \nof these things to put this in the political arena without a hearing.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 207\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 30 seconds on each side on the Carper \namendment No. 207. Who yields time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, this is a simple amendment.\n  This is a straightforward amendment. If my colleagues agree with me, \na U.S. Senator who wants to reduce taxes in a way that decreases the \nbudget deficit, it is OK to do that.\n  For this Senator or any Senator who wishes to reduce taxes, we can do \nthat under this amendment, but if those taxes increase the budget \ndeficit and the debt for this country, we need to muster 60 votes. The \nmoneys for the offset can come from other taxes or\n\n[[Page S2921]]\n\nthey can come from reducing spending to provide the offset.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 30 seconds have expired.\n  Mr. CARPER. I urge a ``yes'' vote, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the effect of this amendment is \nobviously to take the reconciliation process out of the budget. The \nreconciliation process is going to guarantee to the Senate the \nopportunities to get things done that need to be done without making \ntax issues a political football. That tax policy was made in 2001 and \n2003 to keep that current law. We have seen too many times that laws \nthat have widespread political support are filibustered and do not get \npassed.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 207.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 49, nays 51, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 59 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--49\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Voinovich\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--51\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Warner\n  The amendment (No. 207) was rejected.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 214\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The next order of business is amendment No. \n214 by Senators Snowe and Wyden. There is 1 minute evenly divided. Who \nyields time?\n  The Senator from Maine\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am going to be speaking for 30 seconds \nfor both myself and Senator Wyden on this amendment.\n  This is the one initiative before the Senate that addresses the \nescalating costs with respect to Medicare Part D that, as we know, has \nbeen reestimated by the administration from $400 billion to $534 \nbillion.\n  The CBO has stated that our amendment would be able to negotiate real \nsavings. They said there is a potential for some savings if the \nSecretary were to have the authority to negotiate prices with the \nmanufacturers of single source drugs. Former Secretary Thompson said he \nwished that he had the opportunity to negotiate. He said that in his \npress conference upon his resignation.\n  Finally, 80 percent of seniors support this authority, and so does \nthe American Medical Association for the first time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition? The Senator \nfrom Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am surprised that there are so many \nwise Members of this Senate who know exactly how the prescription drug \nbill is going to work when it doesn't even start until January 1, 2006. \nWe took language in Democratic proposals on this subject and put them \nin a bipartisan bill so that there was a consensus of what ought to be \ndone. Now they want to strike them out.\n  The chief actuary and OMB says this will not save money. It will not \nincrease competition because we have competition written into this by \nthe plans competing against each other. Don't strike that out.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senator was necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Ohio (Mr. Voinovich).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The next order of business is the amendment \nNo. 172 by Senator Harkin. There is 1 minute equally divided.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this amendment restores the Perkins \nVocational Education Program and pays for it by eliminating two tax \nprovisions that haven't even come into force yet. We are not raising \nanyone's taxes. We are not rolling back anything. There are two items \nin the 2001 tax bill called PEP and Pease. They start next year. They \ndon't have to go into effect.\n  Who gets the benefits? Ninety-seven percent of the benefits go to \npeople making more than $200,000 a year, and 54 percent go to people \nmaking over $1 million a year.\n  I am just saying, don't let that go into effect. That saves $146 \nbillion over 10 years. This amendment would reduce the deficit with the \nmoney, and also put the money into restoring the Perkins Vocational \nEducation Program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, this amendment increases taxes by $24 \nbillion and purports to give $7.5 billion to vocational education. The \nbill only controls the top discretionary number Government-wide. So the \nmotion isn't enforceable and would likely be ignored by the committee \nof jurisdiction. The money could go over into some other account. There \nis no guarantee that the tax-and-spend amendment will result in one \ndollar of education.\n  The subcommittee chairman and the chairman for Education have looked \nat the budget, and there is money available for it.

Mr. President, to begin with, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe Vitter amendment No. 223 on port security, a sense of the Senate, \nbe agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 223) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we are now going to go to the Dorgan \namendment for which we will have the 10-minute vote, but we have \ndecided--Senator Conrad and myself, after consulting with the \nleadership--that for the next 3 amendments there will be 5-minute \nvotes. There will be no statements between the votes. That will be the \nLieberman-Collins amendment on first responders, the Vitter amendment \non the Corps of Engineers, and the Allen amendment, as modified, on \nNASA. I ask unanimous consent that be the order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me very quickly explain why we are \ngoing to try this experiment on three votes. Here is the situation we \nface. In 2 hours we have done six amendments. We have 26 amendments in \nthis queue. We have 40 or 50 amendments after that. You do the math: 20 \nand 40 is 60; three amendments an hour; that is 20 more hours of \nvoting.\n  Now, we can either subject ourselves to that or try to find a way to \nbreak through this morass and make more progress. The leadership has \nagreed to try on three amendments an experiment: 5-minute votes. \nPlease, colleagues, let's see if we can't make this go more \nefficiently.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 210\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is the Dorgan amendment.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, are we doing 1 minute a side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty seconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the purpose of this amendment is to repeal \nthe provision of the Tax Code that actually rewards companies to shut \ndown their American plant and move their jobs overseas. Yes, we \nactually reward companies in the current Tax Code for shutting down \ntheir American plants and moving jobs. It is the most pernicious part \nof the Tax Code. In my judgment, this is only a baby step in the right \ndirection.\n  A vote against this amendment is a vote against fairness and a vote \nagainst American jobs. I hope this Senate will approve this amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  Is all time yielded back?\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk to called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, at the request of a number of Senators who \nare sponsors of amendments, we have decided that we are going to \nrestore the minute that was equally divided so Members can explain \ntheir amendments. But we are staying with the 5-minute vote for the \nnext three amendments. However, we are skipping over Senator Allen's \namendment because we hope to work that out. That would mean that \nSenator Sarbanes' amendment on CDBG would be the third 5-minute vote. \nBut there will be a minute equally divided before the votes.\n  I believe we are now on the Lieberman amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time on the Lieberman amendment?\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the amendment Senator Lieberman and I \nhave offered would restore homeland security grant funding to last \nyear's level for the first responder programs and for port security. It \nis a very modest amendment. Let us remember that when disaster strikes, \nour citizens do not dial the 202 Washington, DC, area code, they dial \n911.

Mr. President, the previous Vitter amendment is vitiated \nbecause this is a replacement--it is modified.\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Modified by 224.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 156\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we are now on the Sarbanes amendment. If \nthis experiment is going to work--and I am not sure it is--I think it \nwould be more likely to succeed if everybody sat at their desks as the \nclerk called the roll. Again, we are on the Sarbanes amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The Senator from Maryland is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, this is a community development block \ngrant amendment. Our mayors, Governors, and county officials are all \ndesperate for this program. This restores the cuts, keeps it in HUD. \nBernardi, the Deputy Secretary, said:\n\n       We must continue to support and build upon programs that \n     work, those that have a proven record of flexibility and the \n     ability to fit in the local determined needs. CDBG is such a \n     program and ranks among our Nation's oldest and most \n     successful programs.\n\n  This amendment would fund it by using the closing of tax loopholes, \nwhich previously passed this body. I urge support for the amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, it has the practical effect of increasing \nspending by $1.9 billion and increasing taxes by $1.9 billion. Of \ncourse, there is no binding language that would have any effect on the \nAppropriations Committee. Jurisdiction as to how this money would be \nspent would be entirely with the Appropriations Committee, and they \ncould spend it any way they want. It breaks the cap and raises taxes. I \nhope we oppose it.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

We are going to try 5 minutes some more. What a democracy. \nIt is very impressive.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 230\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the Coleman amendment No. \n230. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, my amendment is simple. It says no cuts \nin the Community Development Block Grant Program or other programs such \nas the Community Service Block Grant Program, the Brownfield \nRedevelopment Program, and the Rural Housing and Economic Development \nProgram.\n  My amendment is fully offset by function 920.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, having lost the previous amendment, I \nsupport the amendment of the Senator from Minnesota. It is not my \npreference to do an across-the-board cut of other programs, but the \nCDBG Program is so important that we should adopt this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, of course, the committee of jurisdiction \nwill have the decision on how these monies are spent and what decisions \nare made. But the practical effect--I think Members should know this--\nthe practical effect of a 920 cut is an across-the-board cut. So, for \nexample, a $2 billion item such as this means a billion dollars comes \nout of defense and a certain percentage comes out of education, a \ncertain percentage comes out of health care, a certain percentage comes \nout of homeland security. That is the way this would work were the \nAppropriations Committee to follow these instructions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is agreeing to amendment No. 230.\n  Mr. SARBANES.

There is 1-minute debate on Cochran amendment \nNo. 208.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this amendment seeks to ensure that it is \nCongress who sets the discretionary caps and enforces them. It does not \ntransfer to the President a new power of enforcement. If the President \nsubmits an urgent supplemental, as he has done now, and the House \npasses a supplemental bill and it comes to the Senate, if we add an \nemergency designation for an item, you can make a 60-vote point of \norder against that if it exceeds the caps, and we enforce that cap in \nthat fashion.\n  This adds that the President has to enforce it by specifically \nagreeing that it is an emergency. That is not in the law now, and it \nshould not be added on this resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this returns us to a point of order that \nexisted in prior days when the President participated in emergency \ndesignations relative to nondefense activity. It only applies to \nnondefense activity. It avoids issues such as placing in emergency \nbills items which are clearly not emergency issues unless the President \nagrees they are emergency issues also.\n  I think it creates a much more balanced approach to how we address \nspending, and it protects the cap and does not allow the emergency \nbills to basically circumvent the cap.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n208.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 177), as modified, is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To maintain college access and close corporate tax loopholes \n by an amount equal to $5.4 billion, enough to: (1) restore education \nprogram cuts slated for vocational education, adult education, GEAR UP, \n  and TRIO, (2) increase the maximum Pell Grant scholarship to $4,500 \n  immediately, and (3) increase future math and science teacher loan \n         forgiveness to $23,000 without increasing the deficit)\n\n       On page 3, line 10, increase the amount by $723,0000.\n       On page 3, line 11, increase the amount by $3,803,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 12, increase the amount by $666,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 13, increase the amount by $227,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 14, increase the amount by $55,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 19, increase the amount by $723,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 20, increase the amount by $3,803,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 21, increase the amount by $666,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 1, increase the amount by $227,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 2, increase the amount by $55,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 7, increase the amount by $5,389,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 8, increase the amount by $5,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 9, increase the amount by $15,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 10, increase the amount by $25,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 11, increase the amount by $40,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 16, increase the amount by $723,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 17, increase the amount by $3,803,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 18, increase the amount by $666,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 19, increase the amount by $227,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 20, increase the amount by $55,000,000.\n       On page 17, line 16, increase the amount by $5,389,000,000.\n       On page 17, line 17, increase the amount by $723,000,000.\n       On page 17, line 20, increase the amount by $5,000,000.\n       On page 17, line 21, increase the amount by $3,803,000,000.\n       On page 17, line 24, increase the amount by $15,000,000.\n       On page 17, line 25, increase the amount by $666,000,000.\n       On page 18, line 3, increase the amount by $25,000,000.\n       On page 18, line 4, increase the amount by $227,000,000.\n       On page 18, line 7, increase the amount by $40,000,000.\n       On page 18, line 8, increase the amount by $55,000,000.\n       On page 30, line 16, decrease the amount by $723,000,000.\n       On page 30, line 17, decrease the amount by $5,474,000,000.\n       On page 36, line 21, increase the amount by $8,000,000.\n       On page 36, line 22, increase the amount by $8,000,000.\n       On page 36, line 23, increase the amount by $93,000,000.\n       On page 36, line 24, increase the amount by $93,000,000.\n       On page 48, line 6, increase the amount by $5,381,000,000.\n       On page 48, line 7, increase the amount by $715,000,000\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I have cleared that both with the majority leader and \nminority leader.\n  Mr. President, my amendment as modified increases the education \nfunding by $5.4 billion paid for by the corporate tax loophole closure \nand now includes no additional deficit reduction.\n  The amendment does three things. No. 1, it will make immediately \navailable the Pell grant increase to $4,500. No. 2, it provides for the \nprotection of the GEAR UP Program, the TRIO Programs, and vocational \neducation. No. 3, it will ensure 60,000 math and science teachers every \nsingle year. That is effectively what this amendment does.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I would agree that this amendment does \nincrease taxes by $5.4 billion. I could not agree that it will actually \nwind up adding money for education. It gives the nonbinding suggestion \nthat it be directed toward various higher education programs, but it \ndoes not guarantee it. The Budget Resolution controls the top-line \ndiscretionary number government-wide. No such suggestion is \nenforceable. There is no guarantee that this tax-and-spend amendment \nwill result in one new dollar for education, let alone the programs \nsuggested by the amendment. I ask that my colleagues vote no.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senate will be in order. The Senator from \nMontana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this amendment strikes the cuts in the \nbudget resolution with respect to agriculture. Two main points: Today, \nagricultural spending constitutes 1 percent of total Federal spending. \nThese cuts here constitute 16 percent of the cuts in the budget \nresolution. It is just not right to single out agriculture 16 times \nmore than other cuts in this resolution.\n  No. 2, the Europeans today spend $37 billion a year on agricultural \nprice supports. We spend about $17 billion, half of what they spend. We \nshould not unilaterally disarm now, before the Doha WTO talks.\n  Two points why the amendment should be agreed to. We should not make \nthese cuts.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, the Senator from Montana is correct; \nthat the cuts in agricultural spending now constitute 16 percent. That \nis another good reason why we should have supported Medicaid savings. \nWe wouldn't be in this position now.\n  What we committed to do relative to agriculture savings is, first of \nall, not to change the policy in the farm bill. We are not going to do \nthat. We are simply not going to change policy.\n  Lastly, let me just say that over the last 3 years, farmers \nthemselves have saved $5 billion per year from the projected farm bill \nexpenditures in 2002. If we cannot find $2.8 billion over the next 5 \nyears, then something is wrong. We are going to find it. We are going \nto treat every commodity fairly and equitably, and every title of the \nfarm bill fairly and equitably in achieving these savings. I urge a \n``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

If we continue on this \ncourse, we are going to be here until 2 or 2:30 this morning.\n  There are a number of colleagues who have multiple amendments still \nnoticed. I am asking colleagues to please notify leadership, please \nnotify the whip, of what amendments you can wait on until another \nvehicle and another time.\n  At this point, I plead with colleagues. Let us not have a situation \nin which we are here until 3 o'clock this morning. This is our \nopportunity now during these votes for Members to notify which \namendments they are willing to hold off on. Please do that.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the manager of our bill, the Senator from \nNorth Dakota, is very busy, and his person to work with on these \namendments is Senator Durbin. If people would help Senator Durbin and \nSenator Conrad and help us move through amendments on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, my amendment restores $1 billion for local \nlaw enforcement, three big programs that have essentially been zeroed \nout, the COPS Program, the law enforcement block grants. Four years ago \nwe spent $2.3 billion helping local law enforcement. It is down to $118 \nmillion.\n  My friend from New Hampshire said we are going to prove we can end \nthe program. Let us pick one that is not working to end. This one \nworks.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the COPS Program was a program put in place \nby President Clinton. It was supposed to have expired 5 years ago. It \nwas fully funded under President Clinton, and 100,000 police officers \nwere put on the streets; in fact, 110,000. It continues to exist even \nthough it has served its purpose, and there was a consensus that it \nwould not go any longer. It is time to ask the program to be \nterminated.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant journal clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 45, nays 55, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 70 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--45\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--55\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n  The amendment (No. 239) was rejected.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, if we could have regular order, just a very \nbrief explanation and we will proceed. We are going to interrupt the \nbudget for a few minutes to discuss a bill we have been talking about \nover the course of the day. It has to do with a particular case in \nFlorida. We will talk a little bit about the background for a very \nlimited period of time. Then we will resume with the debate on the \nbudget and the amendment process. This should take a total of about 15 \nor 16 minutes. It is important we do it now. The House is preparing to \nleave--if they have not left--and the immediacy of this bill centers on \nthe life of\n\n[[Page S2927]]\n\na particular person. That is why we are interrupting the debate now.\n  With that, I turn to my colleague.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I extend my appreciation to many Members of \nthis caucus for their cooperation. This is a very difficult issue. It \nhas been hard for everyone. I especially applaud my friend from \nMichigan, Senator Levin. I joke with him sometimes, but he is a \nHarvard-educated lawyer, and he really lives every minute of that. He \nunderstands the law, and he has helped the Senate get something that is \nappropriate for what we are trying to do. I appreciate that very much. \nA number of other Senators, including the distinguished Senator from \nOregon, have worked with us, and I will not run through the entire \nlist, but we have had Senator Baucus, Senator Feinstein, Senator \nHarkin, Senator Murray. We have had a lot of cooperation. I apologize \nbecause I have left some names out. It is very difficult.\n  We believe we have an obligation to do something. Something is going \nto happen anyway. I think this will wind up being the best of what we \ncould do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to \nthe immediate consideration of S. 653, which is at the desk, that \nrelates to Terri Marie Schiavo; that there be 15 minutes of debate on \nthe bill equally divided between the two leaders or their designees; \nprovided further no amendments be in order; following that debate the \nbill be read the third time, and the Senate proceed to a vote on \npassage of the bill, with no further intervening action or debate.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, the amendment that has been \nworked on the past few hours, is it at the desk?\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. The language is at the desk.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill is at the desk.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I also ask consent that this be increased to \n16 minutes because the Senator from Florida, Mr. Nelson, wishes to \nspend a couple minutes on it.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I do not \nintend to object, there is going to be 15 minutes on each side?\n  Mr. REID. No. Seven and a half minutes to you, a minute to the \nSenator from Florida, and that is the only request for time I have \nreceived.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Senator and withdraw my reservation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, there has been a little confusion because \nthere has been different versions of this bill circulating. I want \neverybody to know the version of the bill we are working on, which the \nunanimous consent relates to, is a brandnew bill as of a few moments \nago which contains the modifications that we have worked out.\n  Mr. REID. That is true.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Hearing no objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 653) for the relief of the parents of Theresa \n     Marie Schiavo.\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, in 1990, at the age of 27, Theresa Marie \nSchiavo, a Florida resident, suffered a heart attack which resulted in \nbrain damage from a lack of oxygen. As a result, she was taken to the \nhospital and a feeding tube was inserted at that time to provide \nnutrition and hydration to keep her alive.\n  Over the last 15 years, there has been a very difficult and long \nprotracted legal struggle in Florida over whether the parents' wishes \nshould prevail, who wish for her to continue to receive food and \nhydration, or the husband's wishes.\n  A court order has been entered. The effect of that court order is \nthat tomorrow, on March 18 of this year, the food and hydration would \nbe withdrawn from this woman.\n  The effort of our bill is very narrowly tailored to provide relief to \nthis young woman so that a Federal judge in Florida will have the \nopportunity to do a de novo review of all that pertains to this case to \nensure that her constitutional rights have been protected, to ensure \nthat under the 14th amendment due process has been exhausted, and to \nensure, without precluding either outcome in the case, that the Federal \nreview of this case could provide the same type of relief that we would \nprovide to any other person in the State of Florida who might be put to \ndeath as a result of a court order, including those who might be doing \nso because of criminal conduct.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Whoever has time, could they just yield 1 minute to me?\n  Mr. President, first of all, I want to thank people who have worked \nout the changes in this bill, which make it a better bill. From my \nperspective, it is still a mistake, and I intend to vote no if there is \na rollcall vote.\n  A number of people have asked me whether I now favor this bill with \nthe changes. My answer is no. I think it is a better bill with the \nchanges. It is a bill which avoids some damaging precedents.\n  We can explain the changes. The most important one is explicitly this \ndoes not create a precedent. Secondly, it is not a 12-month period the \nparents can proceed in. It is a 30-day period that they have. So we do \nnot have a situation where they wait 12 months prior to initiating the \ncase.\n  The court has discretion to issue a stay. It is not mandatory. It is \nnot a bill for the relief of Theresa Marie Schiavo. It is a bill which \ngives the parents the opportunity, within a short period of time, to go \nto court, so it is technically for their relief, not for her relief.\n  So I wanted to make it clear to the people in the Senate who asked, \n``Does this mean you now favor this?'' If there is a rollcall, I intend \nto vote no. I think it is a mistake. If it is a voice vote, I intend to \nvote no, for whatever relevance that has, except I do not want to \nmislead anybody, by proposing these things, that now suddenly I think \nthis is the right thing to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the Senator from \nFlorida for helping accept these modifications. I thank the leaders on \nboth sides, Senator Frist and Senator Reid, for a determined effort in \nthe last few hours to make certain this bill goes to the House in time.\n  I think all of us have in our mind's eye the face of that lovely \nyoung woman. It is very much in my mind, the smile of that young woman. \nHer parents want to give her a chance. I think of my own daughter. We \nought to give her a chance. And this is our opportunity to do it. I \nhope very much the House will give this a chance.\n  I also thank my colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Santorum, who \nfirst brought this to my attention this afternoon. This is the right \nthing to do, colleagues. Let's pass this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the majority \nleader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the majority leader yield for just a \nbrief statement?\n  Mr. FRIST. I will.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I talked about everybody except one of the \nmost important people, if not the most important person, this \nafternoon, and that is Senator Nelson from Florida. He has been here \nduring the whole day, and I want to extend my appreciation to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will be very brief. This is an \nopportunity to talk to a number of my colleagues.\n  As most people know, this is coming to the floor very quickly. And \nthe real, fundamental reason is, if we do not act, there is a good \nchance that a living human being would be starved to death in a matter \nof days. That is why the action now. That is why we are, not rushing \nthings, but deliberating quickly, so we can get it to the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  She will be starved to death next Friday. I have had the opportunity \nto look at the video footage upon which the initial facts of this case \nwere based. And from my standpoint as a physician, I would be very \ncareful before I would come to the floor and say this,\n\n[[Page S2928]]\n\nthat the facts upon which this case were based are inadequate. To be \nable to make a diagnosis of persistent vegetative state--which is not \nbrain dead; it is not coma; it is a specific diagnosis and typically \ntakes multiple examinations over a period of time because you are \nlooking for responsiveness--I have looked at the video footage. Based \non the footage provided to me, which was part of the facts of the case, \nshe does respond.\n  That being the case, and also recognizing she has not had a complete \nneurological exam by today's standards--allegedly, she has not had a \nPET scan or MRI scan; not that those are definitive, but before you let \nsomebody die, before you starve somebody to death, you want a complete \nexam and a good set of the facts of the case upon which to make that \ndecision.\n  All we are saying today is, do not starve her to death now--forever, \nI would argue--but establish the facts based on medical science today, \nand then make a determination in the future. That is what we will \naccomplish with passage of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the Senate is now addressing probably the \nmost gut-wrenching decision that an American family can ever face. \nWithout even a single hearing, without any debate whatever, the Senate \nis tackling an extraordinarily sensitive concern that involves morals \nand ethics and religious principles, and this troubles me greatly.\n  The practice of medicine and the regulation of it throughout our \nhistory has been properly left by the Constitution to the States. Now, \nregardless of how a Senator might feel about this tragic case in \nFlorida--and feelings certainly run very high--a Senator ought to \nreflect on the implications of Federal intrusion before we cast this \nvote.\n  I am particularly troubled at the prospect of setting a precedent \nthat is going to have the Congress, in effect, playing ``medical czar'' \nin case after case because, colleagues, there will be thousands of \ncases just like this.\n  I would ask the Senators, will the steps of the Capitol be the new \ngathering place for America to wrestle with these situations that all \nconcerned consider tragic? I think that is a mistake. That is why I am \ngoing to vote against this legislation.\n  Now, this legislation has particular repercussions for the people of \nmy State. We have voted twice for assisted suicide. I will tell \ncolleagues, I voted against both of those measures on assisted suicide. \nAnd I joined all of you, I think, here today in opposing Federal \nfunding for assisted suicide. But I think these matters are not ones \nwhere we should trample on the prerogatives of the State quickly. And \nthat is what we are doing today--without a single hearing, without a \nsingle opportunity for us to even hear from those most knowledgeable in \nthe field.\n  I know many colleagues want to speak on this, and I want to respect \nthem. I would note that as a result of the cooperation shown, \nparticularly by colleagues on the other side of the aisle, Senator \nFrist and others, there has been language added to this proposal so as \nto at least attempt to protect any State that has acted in this area. \nMy guess is, when the Supreme Court tackles this, they are going to \ndeclare it unconstitutional.\n  But as we go to the vote on this matter, I would urge colleagues to \nthink about what it is going to mean when people from all over this \ncountry, all of our States, all of our communities, ask the Congress to \nstep in on these kinds of cases. I think that is a very troubling \nprecedent. It is my intention to vote no.\n  I thank my colleagues, and particularly the majority leader for his \ncourtesy. I yield the floor, as many others wish to speak on this \nmatter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to Senator Santorum \nfrom Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I thank all those involved. I thank the \ntwo leaders for their conscientious effort in getting this \naccomplished. I thank Senator Conrad, and Senator Martinez, obviously, \nfor his sponsorship of this legislation, and all the others who worked \nwith us. Even though, as Senator Levin and Senator Wyden said, they \noppose this legislation, they understood the importance of this issue \nto colleagues on both sides of the aisle and were willing to work with \nus to improve the bill and, nevertheless, to allow us its passage. So I \nwant to thank everyone concerned.\n  I want to explain, very briefly, what this bill does. This bill \nsimply gives a Federal court the ability to review the State court's \naction. Just yesterday, in California, a man was sentenced to death for \nkilling two people. He will have ample opportunity to have everything \nthe California courts did reviewed by the Federal court under a habeas \ncorpus appeal. He will have multiple appeals for Federal courts to look \nto see whether the State court in California properly behaved in \nproviding him his due process rights under the 14th amendment--a \nmultiple murder.\n  Terri Schiavo has done one thing wrong: she did not have a living \nwill. But the Florida courts gave her a death sentence. They said that \nher feeding tube and hydration will be removed until she is dead. And \nno one but for this bill and the Federal courts will have any right to \nlook to see if her due process rights were followed by the Florida \ncourts.\n  This does not get us involved in a medical decision. This does not \nget us involved in making decisions of life and death. It simply \nprotects the constitutional rights of someone whose only--only--mistake \nwas not to have a living will. Should we not give someone who is in \nthat situation, who has been sentenced to death by a court on a State \nlevel, the right for Federal court review to determine whether her \nrights were protected by those courts? That is all we ask in this piece \nof legislation. It is narrow. It applies only to her, to no one else. \nIt sets no precedent. We specified, thanks to Senator Wyden's \namendment, that it sets no precedent for any other action.\n  So I would encourage my colleagues, as we just have been through a \nhorrific death penalty case in California, to understand that there is \na proper role for Federal courts to look to make sure that due process \nwas followed. That is all we are asking for here today.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, how much time is left on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 1 minute 41 seconds. The \nmajority has 1 minute 54 seconds.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nFlorida, and 42 seconds to the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, this bill we are considering is \na good-faith, bipartisan effort to allow a Federal court in my State to \nreview this case. One of the improvements of this legislation was that \nit changed the original draft directing a Federal court how it should \nissue injunctive relief because constitutionally we cannot direct a \nFederal court, even in law.\n  I support this bill so that this case can be reviewed and decided in \na timely manner. And, indeed, it underscores the need for us to promote \nliving wills so that a person's wants and desires will be carried out \nwhen they are in an incapacitated condition.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank both Senators from Florida. \nSenator Martinez came to me with this last week. We are doing this \npersonal bill because it is so time sensitive. But let's not forget \nthat there are hundreds and thousands of people with disabilities, both \nphysical and mental, who face similar situations. That is why last week \nwhen this was brought to my attention, I said to my friend from Florida \nthat we ought to do some kind of a habeas type of proceedings for these \npeople that are at the end of the rope and yet there is no one speaking \nfor them. So while we pass this today for a woman in Florida, I hope \nwhen we come back after the recess we can work together in a bipartisan \nfashion to fashion some kind of legislation that will give people with \ndisabilities the ability to take one last look at their case before the \nplug is pulled.\n  I hope we can work on that so we don't have case after case after \ncase coming in here, but we can deal with it in a broad, general \ncontext to protect the rights of people with disabilities.\n\n[[Page S2929]]\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nVirginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Florida for his \noutstanding leadership on this extraordinary remedy for a woman who, \nwhen I observed her on videotapes, clearly is conscious and has the \nability to feel.\n  I believe in the sanctity of human life. I think most of us feel in \ngood conscience we can't just sit by and allow this innocent woman to \nstarve to death. Just because she has lost her ability to verbally \ncommunicate her feelings in no way means that she has lost her desire \nto live or her right to life. When in doubt, I think it is appropriate \nand, indeed, logical to presume that people want to live.\n  I am proud of the Senate and Senator Martinez for his leadership in \nhelping to protect Terri Schiavo's right to life.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. To close, I thank the leadership of the minority and \nmajority. I never anticipated that my first legal measure on the floor \nof the Senate would be something such as this. I am very pleased that \nwe have had the cooperation we have had. I thank Senators Harkin and \nConrad and so many others on our side of the aisle who have worked with \nme tirelessly to get to this point and the encouragement they provided \nme.\n  By voting for this bill, we will simply be allowing the Federal judge \nto give one last review, one last look in a case that has so many \nquestions, that has so many anxieties, and that will provide us the \nkind of assurance before the ultimate fate of this woman is decided to \nknow that we did all we could do and that every last measure of review \nwas given her, just like it would have been given to a death row inmate \nconvicted and sentenced to die.\n  I ask for a vote in support of the measure that we might keep Terry \nSchiavo alive and give her a chance to have a Federal review of her \ncase.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 30 \nseconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want to make it clear that although I \nbelieve it is a mistake for Congress to be moving into this area with \nthis haste and speed, in the most difficult decisionmaking a family \ncould ever face--I intend to vote no--the language in section 1 also \nmakes it clear that a Federal court would have to find a violation of a \nconstitutional right or a right under U.S. law in order to provide an \norder that she be maintained on life support.\n  It is very clear in here that there has to be a violation of the U.S. \nConstitution or Federal law for a Federal court to provide the \ncontinuation of life support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is on the passage of the bill.\n  The bill (S. 653) was passed, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 653\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. RELIEF OF THE PARENTS OF THERESA MARIE SCHIAVO.\n\n       The United States District Court for the Middle District of \n     Florida shall have jurisdiction to hear, determine, and \n     render judgment on a suit or claim by or on behalf of Theresa \n     Marie Schiavo for the alleged violation of any right of \n     Theresa Marie Schiavo under the Constitution or laws of the \n     United States relating to the withholding or withdrawal of \n     food, fluids, or medical treatment necessary to sustain her \n     life.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and to lay \nthat motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/17/senate-section/article/S2929-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2929-S2967]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET FOR THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT FOR THE FISCAL \n                          YEAR 2006--Continued\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 188\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There is now 1 minute for debate on Byrd \namendment No. 240.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this amendment would boost the amount of \nfunding in the budget to allow for a highway bill totaling $318 \nbillion. That is the same size as the highway bill we passed last year. \nEvery Senator should look at the table on their desk and see how much \nmoney and how many jobs he or she is foregoing by voting against this \namendment. The offsets for the amendment are not new taxes. The offsets \nare precisely the same offsets that were used in the finance title of \nlast year's highway bill. I urge the Senate to approve the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, there is an agreement--and it is fairly \nwell agreed to, not only within this body but on the House side and \nwith the President--that the highway bill will be $284 billion. That is \nfunded in this budget resolution. This would increase that funding by \napproximately $30 billion. In addition, it raises taxes by $14 billion. \nIt is a classic tax-and-spend amendment. I hope it will be defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). The question is on agreeing to \namendment No. 240.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING CHILDREN WITH HIV/\n                   AIDS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Approximately 2,200,000 million children under the age \n     of 15 are infected with the HIV virus, and 1,900 children \n     worldwide are infected with HIV each day.\n       (2) In 2004, it was estimated that of the 4,900,000 people \n     newly infected with HIV, 640,000 were children. The vast \n     majority of them were infected through mother-to-child \n     transmission, which includes transmission at any point during \n     pregnancy, labor, delivery, or breastfeeding.\n       (3) Effective implementation of prevention of mother-to-\n     child transmission of HIV and care and treatment services in \n     the United States has resulted in the near elimination (less \n     than 2 percent transmission) of mother-to-child transmission \n     of HIV/AIDS. By contrast, in resource-poor settings less than \n     10 percent of pregnant women living with HIV have access to \n     services to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV.\n       (4) Currently, more than 4,000,000 children worldwide are \n     estimated to have died from AIDS.\n       (5) In 2004, approximately 510,000 children died of AIDS, \n     resulting in almost 1,400 AIDS deaths in children per day.\n       (6) According to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/\n     AIDS, if current trends continue by 2010, 3,500,000 of the \n     45,000,000 people infected worldwide will be children under \n     the age of 15.\n       (7) At least a quarter of newborns infected with HIV die \n     before the age of one, up to 60 percent die before reaching \n     their second birthday, and overall, most die before they are \n     5 years of age.\n       (8) HIV threatens to reverse the child survival and \n     developmental gains of past decades.\n       (9) Research and practice have shown conclusively that \n     timely initiation of antiretroviral therapy to infants or \n     young children with HIV/AIDS can preserve or restore their \n     immune functions, promote normal growth and development, and \n     prolong life.\n       (10) There is clear evidence in resource-rich countries \n     that antiretroviral treatment in children is very effective. \n     For example, many children who were infected through mother-\n     to-child transmission in the United States are living with \n     HIV as young adults.\n       (11) Few programs specifically target the treatment of \n     children with HIV/AIDS in resource-poor countries due to \n     significant challenges in diagnosing and treating infants and \n     young children with HIV. Such challenges include difficulty \n     in diagnosing HIV in infants less than 18 months of age, lack \n     of appropriate and affordable pediatric HIV/AIDS medicines, \n     and lack of trained health care providers.\n       (12) Children are not small adults and treating them as \n     such can seriously jeopardize their health.\n       (13) Children should not be forgotten in the fight against \n     the global HIV/AIDS pandemic.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that this resolution assumes that--\n       (1)(A) assistance should be provided to support the \n     expansion of programs to prevent mother-to-child transmission \n     of HIV as an integral component of a comprehensive approach \n     to fighting HIV/AIDS;\n       (B) to facilitate the expansion described in subparagraph \n     (A)--\n       (i) more resources are needed for infrastructure \n     improvements and education and training of health care \n     workers; and\n       (ii) better linkages between mother-to-child transmission \n     and broader care and treatment programs should be created for \n     women, children, and families who are in need of access to \n     expanded services;\n       (2) assistance should be provided to support the care and \n     treatment of children with HIV/AIDS, including the \n     development and purchase of high-quality, Food and Drug \n     Administration-approved pediatric formulations of \n     antiretroviral drugs and other HIV/AIDS medicines, including \n     fixed-dose combinations, pediatric-specific training to \n     doctors and other health-care personnel, and the purchase of \n     pediatric-appropriate technologies;\n       (3) antiretroviral drugs intended for pediatric use should \n     include age-appropriate dosing information;\n       (4) health care sites in resource-poor countries need \n     better diagnostic capacity and appropriate supplies to \n     provide care and treatment services for children, and \n     additional training is required to ensure that health care \n     providers can administer specialized care services for \n     children; and\n       (5) pediatric care and treatment should be integrated into \n     the existing health care framework so children and families \n     can be treated simultaneously.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 182\n\n(Purpose: Expressing the sense of the Senate on the acquisition of the \n                    next generation destroyer (DDX))\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 510. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE ACQUISITION OF \n                   THE NEXT GENERATION DESTROYER (DDX).\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Quadrennial Defense Review to be conducted in 2005 \n     has not been completed.\n       (2) The national security of the United States is best \n     served by a competitive industrial base consisting of at \n     least two shipyards capable of constructing major surface \n     combatants.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) it is ill-advised for the Department of Defense to \n     pursue a winner-take-all strategy for the acquisition of \n     destroyers under the next generation destroyer (DDX) program; \n     and\n       (2) the amounts identified in this resolution assume that \n     the Department of Defense will not acquire any destroyer \n     under the next generation destroyer program through a winner-\n     take-all strategy.\n       (c) Winner-Take-All Strategy Defined.--In this section, the \n     term ``winner-take-all strategy'', with respect to the \n     acquisition of destroyers under the next generation destroyer \n     program, means the acquisition (including design and \n     construction) of such destroyers through a single shipyard.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 180\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, this amendment would increase the Hope \ncredit to $4,000 and make it available for 4 years of college. The core \nof the American Dream is getting a college education and I want to make \nsure that every student has access to that dream. I want to help \nfamilies who are trying to send their children to college and adults \nwho are going back to school for their first degree or their third.\n  Our middle-class families are stressed and stretched. Families in my \nstate of Maryland are worried--they're worried about their jobs and \nthey're terrified of losing their healthcare when costs keep \nballooning. Many are holding down more than one job to make ends meet. \nThey're racing from carpools to work and back again. But most of all, \nthey don't know how they can afford to send their kids to college. And \nthey want to know what we in the United States Senate are doing to help \nthem.\n  That's why I want to give every family sending a child to college a \n$4,000 tuition tax credit. This amendment would give help to those who \npractice self help--the families who are working and saving to send \ntheir child to college or update their own skills.\n  College tuition is on the rise across America. Tuition at the \nUniversity of Maryland has increased by almost 40 percent since 2002. \nTuition for Baltimore Community College rose by $300 in one year. The \naverage total cost of going to a 4-year public college is $10,635 per \nyear, including tuition, fees, room and board. University of Maryland \nwill cost more than $15,000 for a full time undergraduate student who \nlives on campus.\n  Financial Aid isn't keeping up with these rising costs. Pell Grants \ncover only 40 percent of average costs at 4-year public colleges. \nTwenty years ago, Pell Grants covered 80 percent of average costs. Our \nstudents are graduating with so much debt it's like their first \nmortgage. The average undergraduate student debt from college loans is \nalmost $19,000. College is part of the American Dream; it shouldn't be \npart of the American financial nightmare.\n  Families are looking for help. I'm sad to say, the President doesn't \noffer them much hope. The Republican budget has all the wrong \npriorities. President Bush proposed increasing the maximum Pell Grant \nby just $100 to $4,150. I want to double Pell Grants. Instead of easing \nthe burden on middle class families, the Republican budget helps out \nbig business cronies with lavish tax breaks while eating into Social \nSecurity and creating deficits as far as the eye can see.\n  We need to do more to help middle-class families afford college. We \nneed to immediately increase the maximum Pell Grant to $4,500 and \ndouble it over the next 6 years. We need to make sure student loans are \naffordable. And we need a bigger tuition tax credit for the families \nstuck in the middle who aren't eligible for Pell Grants but still can't \nafford college.\n  A $4,000 tax credit for tuition will go a long way. It will give \nmiddle class families some relief by helping the first-time student at \nour 4-year institutions like University of Maryland and the midcareer \nstudent at our terrific community colleges. A $4,000 tax credit would \nbe 60 percent of the tuition at Maryland and enough to cover the cost \nof tuition at most community colleges. My amendment would help make \ncollege affordable for everyone.\n  College education is more important than ever: 40 percent of new jobs \nin the\n\n[[Page S2932]]\n\nnext 10 years will require post-secondary education. College is \nimportant to families and it's important to our economy. To compete in \nthe global economy, we need to make sure all our children have 21st \ncentury skills for 21st century jobs. And the benefits of education \nhelp not just the individual but society as a whole.\n  To have a safer America and a stronger economy, we need to have a \nsmarter America. We need to invest in our human capital to create a \nworld class workforce. That means making a college education \naffordable.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, there is a genuine effort going forward to \nreduce the number of amendments pending before the body. We still have \nan incredible number of amendments out there--somewhere in the vicinity \nof 30, at the minimum. At the rate we are going, that is about 8 to 9 \nhours of voting. It would be helpful if folks would sit down with the \nleadership on both sides, if they have amendments, and try to determine \nways to deal with those and determine if it is necessary to go forward \nwith them, or maybe we can do them in a more expeditious way than to \nformally vote on them. I hope we can get that sort of assistance.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, just to report to the colleagues, we have \nfive more amendments in this queue. We have five amendments that we are \nworking to try to get approved. We have 23 amendments beyond that.\n  I make an appeal. There are a number of Senators with multiple \namendments. We have 8 Senators that, among them, have 20 amendments. I \nappeal to those Senators, please work with leadership to try to reduce \nthose amendments. We are working diligently to get, as we have just \nseen described by the chairman, a series of amendments approved. Let's \nwork and make modifications where necessary, where we can get others \nhandled in that way. If we don't do this, we are going to be here at \n3:30 tomorrow morning. So please, let's get these amendments worked \nout. These are 5-minute votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 225\n\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 225.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri, [Mr. Talent], for himself, Mr. \n     Thune, Ms. Stabenow, and Mr. Wyden, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 225.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To provide the flexibility to consider all available \n                    transportation funding options)\n\n       On page 39, lines 8 and 9 strike ``net new user-fee \n     receipts related to the purposes of'' and insert ``receipts \n     to''.\n\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I will just take 30 seconds.\n  This amendment is endorsed by all the major transportation groups. \nThe budget resolution restricts the transportation funding available to \nthe Finance Committee. Our amendment changes the language to be \nconsistent with past conference reports and budget resolutions. It \nensures that transportation funding options are on the table when we \nconsider the highway bill. It doesn't affect the budget neutrality.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this takes the fund, the purpose of which \nis to allow the Senate to spend more than the $284 billion but requires \nthat that be genuinely paid for, and turns it into a reserve fund. The \npay-fors will become not necessarily illusory but close to that. I \ndon't think it is good policy to do that. I would rather we had a \nstrong statement that if we are going to go over the $284 billion, it \nis really going to be paid for.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 81, nays 19, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 72 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--81\n\n     Akaka\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Cornyn\n     Corzine\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Grassley\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Isakson\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Martinez\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--19\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Burr\n     Coburn\n     DeMint\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Kyl\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Sessions\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n  The amendment (No. 225) was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID.

The question is on the Conrad amendment No. \n243. There is 1 minute equally divided.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this amendment says simply that we ought \nto repeal the tax that applies to Social Security benefits; that we \nshould do it in a way that does not cut Medicare funding and that does \nnot further increase deficits and debt.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, this is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment. \nIt has no meaning at all, and it is not paid for by any method, so it \nmeans nothing. The senior citizen is still stuck with the additional \n35-percent tax on their benefits on Social Security.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, 30 seconds off my leader time.

The question now is on amendment No. 241.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. For my 94 colleagues who just voted for that sense-of-\nthe-Senate amendment, they now have a chance to vote for the real thing \nthat actually pays for it. We put instructions in our resolution to the \nFinance Committee to actually set aside money to pay for this. The \namendment my colleagues voted for last time made them feel good, but it \ndid not do anything for our senior citizens and reduce the tax of 35 \npercent on the Social Security income they get. This is a chance to do \njust that. I urge a ``yes'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let us be clear, the Bunning amendment \ndoubles the tax cut, undermines funding for Medicare, and provides \nabsolutely no assurance that the additional tax cut will be used to \neliminate the tax on Social Security benefits.\n  So let's be clear. It doubles the tax cut. It undermines funding for \nMedicare. It provides no assurance that the money would be used to \nreduce the tax on Social Security benefits.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

It would be very helpful \nif Members would come forward and agree to either adjust their \namendment so they didn't have to have it heard tonight or reach an \nagreement where we did not have to vote on it. Otherwise, we are \nheading for the wee hours of tomorrow morning. I know Senator Conrad \nhad some thoughts on how we might address this.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, there has been excellent cooperation. I \nthank our colleagues. We have removed at least 80 amendments. But here \nis where we stand at the moment. We still have 24 or 25 amendments. We \nneed to take a break because we need to have the desk crew take a \nbreak. They have worked nonstop. We are going to need to take about a \n30-minute break. But to be able to do that and not wind up right back \nat 3 a.m., because we have made some progress now, we are headed for \nabout 1:45 right now if all the amendments are voted on that are in \nqueue, we have to ask colleagues to please let us know if you can \naccept a vote on your amendment on a later vehicle. That is the only \nway we are going to avoid it.\n  You can do the math yourself: 25 votes, 4 an hour, 6 more hours--that \nis right back at 2 o'clock in the morning.\n  So, please, during these next two votes, those who have amendments \nthat do not have to be on this vehicle, come to us and let's see if we \ncannot work something out.\n  Senator Clinton is next up.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 244, As Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING PREVENTIVE HEALTH \n                   CARE SERVICES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     included family planning in its published list of the Ten \n     Great Public Health Achievements in the 20th Century, the \n     United States still has one of the highest rates of \n     unintended pregnancies among industrialized nations.\n       (2) Increasing access to family planning services will \n     improve women's health and reduce the rates of unintended \n     pregnancy, abortion, and infection with sexually transmitted \n     infections.\n       (3) Contraceptive use saves public health dollars. Every \n     dollar spent on providing family planning services saves an \n     estimated $3 in expenditures for pregnancy-related and \n     newborn care for Medicaid alone.\n       (4) Each year, 3,000,000 pregnancies, nearly half of all \n     pregnancies, in the United States are unintended, and nearly \n     half of unintended pregnancies end in abortion.\n       (5) In 2002, 34,000,000 women--half of all women of \n     reproductive age were in need of contraceptive services and \n     supplies to help prevent unintended pregnancy, and half of \n     those were in need of public support for such care.\n       (6) The United States also has the highest rate of \n     infection with sexually transmitted infections of any \n     industrialized country. In 2003 there were approximately \n     19,000,000 new cases of sexually transmitted infections. \n     According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     (November 2004), these sexually transmitted infections impose \n     a tremendous economic burden with direct medical costs as \n     high as $15,500,000,000 per year.\n       (7) The child born from an unintended pregnancy is at \n     greater risk of low birth weight, dying in the first year of \n     life, being abused, and not receiving sufficient resources \n     for healthy development.\n       (8) Each year, services under title X of the Public Health \n     Service Act enable Americans to prevent approximately \n     1,000,000 unintended pregnancies, and one in three women of \n     reproductive age who obtains testing or treatment for \n     sexually transmitted infections does so at a title X-funded \n     clinic. In 2003, title X-funded clinics provided 2,800,000 \n     Pap tests, 5,100,000 sexually transmitted infection tests, \n     and 526,000 HIV tests.\n       (9) The increasing number of uninsured individuals, \n     stagnant funding, health care inflation, new and expensive \n     contraceptive technologies, and improved but expensive \n     screening and treatment for cervical cancer and sexually \n     transmitted infections, have diminished the ability of \n     clinics funded under title X of the Public Health Service Act \n     to adequately serve all those in need. Taking\n\n[[Page S2934]]\n\n     medical inflation into account, funding for the program under \n     such title X declined by 59 percent between 1980 and 2004.\n       (10) Although employer-sponsored health plans have improved \n     coverage of contraceptive services and supplies, largely in \n     response to State contraceptive coverage laws, there is still \n     significant room for improvement. Half of the 45,000,000 \n     women of reproductive age currently live in the 29 States \n     without contraceptive coverage policies. These women may \n     still find the most effective forms of contraceptives beyond \n     their financial reach due to a lack of coverage.\n       (11) Including contraceptive coverage in private health \n     care plans saves employers money. Not covering contraceptives \n     in employee health plans costs employers 15 to 17 percent \n     more than providing such coverage.\n       (12) Approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration, \n     emergency contraception is a safe and effective way to \n     prevent unintended pregnancy after unprotected sex. It is \n     estimated that the use of emergency contraception could cut \n     the number of unintended pregnancies in half, thereby \n     reducing the need for abortion. New research confirms that \n     easier access to emergency contraceptives does not increase \n     sexual risk-taking or sexually transmitted infections.\n       (13) In 2000, 51,000 abortions were prevented by the use of \n     emergency contraception. Increased use of emergency \n     contraception accounted for up to 43 percent of the total \n     decline in abortions between 1994 and 2000.\n       (14) Thirteen percent of all teens give birth before age \n     20. Eighty-eight percent of births to teens age 17 or younger \n     were unintended. Twenty-four percent of Hispanic females gave \n     birth before the age of 20. (Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, December 2004).\n       (15) Children born to teen moms begin life with the odds \n     against them. They are less likely to be ready for \n     kindergarten, more likely to be of low-birth weight, 50 \n     percent more likely to repeat a grade, more likely to live in \n     poverty, and significantly more likely to be victims of abuse \n     and neglect.\n       (16) Research shows that a range of initiatives, including \n     sex education, youth development and service learning \n     programs, can encourage teens to behave responsibly by \n     delaying sexual activity and pregnancy. Federal tax dollars \n     are best invested in programs with research-based evidence of \n     success.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that this resolution assumes that--\n       (1) $100,000,000 of the amount provided for under function \n     category 550 (health) for fiscal year 2006 may be used for \n     any or all of the following--\n       (A) to fund increases in amounts appropriated to carry out \n     title X of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300 et \n     seq.) above amounts appropriated for fiscal year 2005;\n       (B) to fund legislation that would require equitable \n     coverage of prescription contraceptive drugs and devices, and \n     contraceptive services under health plans;\n       (C) to fund legislation that would create a public \n     education program administered through the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention concerning the use, safety, \n     efficacy, and availability of emergency contraception that \n     is--\n       (i) approved by the Food and Drug administration to prevent \n     pregnancy; and\n       (ii) used post-coitally; or\n       (D) to fund legislation that would permit the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services to award, on a competitive basis, \n     grants to public and private entities to establish or expand \n     teenage pregnancy prevention programs or to disseminate \n     information to educators and parents about the most effective \n     strategies for preventing teen pregnancy (funds made \n     available under the authority of this subparagraph are not \n     intended for use by abstinence-only education programs);\n       (2) the prevention programs described in paragraph (1) are \n     cost effective and will achieve savings by--\n       (A) reducing the number of unintended pregnancies;\n       (B) reducing the rate of sexually transmitted infections;\n       (C) reducing the costs to the medicaid program under title \n     XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.); and\n       (D) providing for the early detection of HIV and early \n     detection of breast and cervical cancer; and\n       (3) the increase in funding described in paragraph (1) is \n     offset by an increase in revenues of not to exceed \n     $200,000,000 to be derived from closing corporate tax \n     loopholes, of which the remaining $100,000,000 (after amounts \n     are expended pursuant to this section) should be used for \n     deficit reduction.\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, this is the Clinton-Reid prevention \nfirst amendment. What it does is try to put us on record and provide \nfunding for the important goal of preventing unintended pregnancies and \nabortions. What this amendment does is to increase public health \nfunding for the National Family Planning Program and enact the EPIC \nbill which says to insurance companies, if you are going to provide \ninsurance coverage for Viagra you should provide insurance coverage for \ncontraception. It increases funding to improve awareness and education \nabout emergency contraception, which is a prevention program, not \ntermination, and finally funds a new teen prevention program.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this amendment increases taxes by $200 \nmillion and raises spending by $200 million and would prevent \nabstinence-only programs from receiving funds under it. It would also \ncreate a mandated insurance coverage which will increase the cost of \ninsurance and create more uninsured individuals today, so I recommend a \nvote against it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The amendment of the Senator from New Jersey \nis at the desk.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, in the last 4 years we have raised the \nNation's debt limit three times, from less than $6 trillion to more \nthan $8 trillion. Now we are being asked to add $446 billion of new \ndebt, $1,500 for every man, woman, and child, without debate. My \namendment says we ought to have a debate and answer the question after \nwe have discussed it. The issue ought to be debated. Nothing poses a \ngreater threat to our future security. The President said he doesn't \nthink it is right to avoid facing up to tough issues that our children \nwill have to deal with in the future. Let us face up to our \nresponsibilities.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, for the edification of our colleagues, \nafter this vote is completed, we will take a half hour recess to give \nthe staff a rest for a little bit. Then we will be back and voting, I \npresume, sometime around quarter of 8.\n  The use of reconciliation on the debt ceiling is a very common \nprocedure. Our colleagues across the aisle, when they were in the \nmajority, used it a number of times. It is an option that should be \nmade available. We have to pay our debt and, therefore, we have to \nraise that debt ceiling. This is a very typical and appropriate way to \nhandle the debt ceiling should the Finance Committee choose to pursue \nit. We are just giving them this tool and this option.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered on this \namendment.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant journal clerk called the roll.\n\n[[Page S2935]]\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

It will be a 10-minute vote and we will hold that 10-\nminute vote. In other words, there will not be any effort to go past 10 \nminutes. We will close it out after 10 minutes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we recess until 7:45 and at 7:45 we \nshall vote on the Boxer amendment which has been submitted to both \nsides.\n  There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:15 p.m., recessed until \n7:45 p.m., and reassembled when called to order by the Presiding \nOfficer (Mr. Burr).\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 257\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Is the amendment at the desk?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes. I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 257.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To establish a point of order in the Senate against any \n appropriations bill if it allows funds to be provided for prepackaged \n   news stories that do not have a disclaimer that continuously runs \n through the presentation which says, ``Paid for by the United States \n                             Government.'')\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. POINT OF ORDER.\n\n       (a) Point of Order in the Senate.--It shall not be in order \n     in the Senate to consider any appropriations bill if it \n     allows funds to be provided for prepackaged news stories that \n     do not have a disclaimer that continuously runs through the \n     presentation which says, ``Paid for by the United States \n     Government.''.\n       (b) Supermajority Waiver and Appeal.--This section may be \n     waived or suspended in the Senate only by an affirmative vote \n     of \\3/5\\ of the Members, duly chosen and sworn. An \n     affirmative vote of \\3/5\\ of the Members of the Senate, duly \n     chosen and sworn, shall be required in the Senate to sustain \n     an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a point of order \n     raised under this section.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the Comptroller General of GAO tells us \nthat prepackaged news that is put together by Federal agencies is \nunacceptable and that--I am quoting them--``Americans deserve to know \nwhen their Government is spending taxpayer money to try to influence \nthem.''\n  My amendment simply encourages agencies to add a disclaimer to those \nprepackaged news stories that says ``Paid for by the United States \nGovernment.''\n  This is very important for the taxpayers to know it is their money \nthat is being spent. I hope and I wish the other side would agree to \nthis amendment. If not, I guess we will have to have a vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this amendment creates a point of order on \nlanguage which probably is not able to be given a conciseness that \nwould make it effective. What does ``prepackaging'' mean? It would be \nvirtually impossible to exercise this point of order, and I think it \nwould set a bad precedent for the Senate to create such a point of \norder.\n  I oppose the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  Mr. GREGG. This will be a 10-minute vote, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We are all working together to make sure that our oceans \ncan finally get the attention they deserve. We have a new commission on \noceans. Admiral Watkins is working hard on that commission. What we are \ndoing, which has been agreed to on all sides, is simply saying we need \nto enact a comprehensive, coordinated, integrated national ocean policy \nthat will ensure the long-term economic and ecological health of the \nU.S. oceans, coasts, and lakes.\n  I think it is wonderful that we can come together on this, and on the \nCommerce Committee we will be working to make sure this happens.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask that this amendment be adopted.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 259) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding the need for a \n   comprehensive, coordinated, and integrated national ocean policy)\n\n       On page 65, after line 25, insert the following:\n\n[[Page S2936]]\n\n     SEC. 510.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GREGG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we just had a good example, one amendment \ncleared and one dropped. We need to do more of that. We have 20 \namendments left here, 7 on the other side; that is 27. We have a lot of \nwork to do. We need Senators to be willing to give up some of these \namendments. They can offer them at a later time.

Mr. President, the next item will be a 5-minute vote, with \n1 minute to speak about it. It is Senator Dorgan's amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is amendment No. 211. This amendment \nadds back $1 billion to the Indian accounts. We all know we have a bona \nfide crisis in health care, housing, and education on Indian \nreservations in this country. Many of those appropriations have been \ncut. This amendment restores some of that cut. It is $1 billion, which \nwould be paid for by closing a tax loophole.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this amendment would raise taxes by $3.25 \nbillion. It is a tax-and-spend amendment.

The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold], for himself and \n     Mr. Bingaman, proposes an amendment numbered 258.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To ensure that savings associated with legislation that \n   reduces overpayments to Medicare Advantage plans is reserved for \n  deficit reduction and to strengthen the Federal Hospital Insurance \n                              Trust Fund)\n\n       On page 40, after line 8, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. RESERVE FUND FOR DEFICIT REDUCTION AND TO STRENGTHEN \n                   THE PART A TRUST FUND.\n\n       The Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Budget may \n     revise the aggregates, allocations, functional totals, and \n     other appropriate levels and limits in this resolution upon \n     enactment of legislation that achieves savings under the \n     medicare program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act \n     by reducing overpayments to Medicare Advantage plans (such as \n     legislation that requires the full amount of savings from the \n     implementation of risk adjusted payments to Medicare \n     Advantage plans to accrue to the medicare program, that \n     eliminates the plan stabilization fund under section 1858(e) \n     of such Act, and that adjusts the MA area-specific non-drug \n     monthly benchmark amount under part C of such title to \n     exclude payments for the indirect costs of medical education \n     under section 1886(d)(5)(B) of such Act), by the amount of \n     savings in that legislation, to ensure that those savings are \n     reserved for deficit reduction and to strengthen the Federal \n     Hospital Insurance Trust Fund.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, in deference to the request of our two \nfloor leaders, I will not ask for a rollcall vote, but I do hope my \ncolleagues will voice their support for this amendment.\n  This is real deficit reduction. The other side keeps asking us to cut \nspending. This amendment does just that. This amendment cuts over $20 \nbillion from the Medicare Program and unnecessary overpayments to \nprivate Medicare plans.\n  We have a simple choice: subsidize private health insurance companies \nor reduce the deficit. The private Medicare plans are successful in \nbringing costs down and if the senior supposedly wants to choose \nprivate plans, then why should American taxpayers pay private companies \nmore money than traditional Medicare?\n  We heard a lot of talk from the other side about the need to cut \nspending. This amendment is a fiscally responsible effort to bring down \nthe deficit. I urge my colleagues' support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, it is amazing to me that this is the \nsecond time tonight that we have had people who are standing around \nwanting to change the Medicare Modernization Act, and it does not even \ngo into effect until the 2006. We do not even know that all this money \nmy colleague wants to save will ever be spent in the first place, and \nif it is spent, it is to bring the plans to rural Wisconsin so that his \nfolks in rural Wisconsin can have the same benefits as people in \nFlorida or Los Angeles. It was a major compromise of this bill. We \nought to preserve that compromise because it is for rural America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GREGG. I suggest a voice vote on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin already suggested a \nvoice vote. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 258.\n  The amendment (No. 258) was rejected.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the next amendment is an amendment from the \nSenator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 203\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am offering a sense-of-the-Senate \namendment intended to head off the administration's plans to raid the \nCrime Victims Fund of more than $1.2 billion. I am joined by Senators \nKennedy, Mikulski, Feingold, Biden, Durbin, Obama, and Dodd on this \namendment.\n  We created this fund under the Victims Crime Act of 1984 to be used \nfor the victims of crime. We made a solemn promise these funds would be \nthere. The budget resolution rescinds all amounts remaining in the \nfund. It is wrong. We should not be saying your suffering--even though \nwe promised with great fanfare, the President and everybody else \npromised that your suffering is going to be our concern. We should not \nsay it is no longer that way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I suspect under the rules adopted earlier \nthis evening, with the way things are going to be accounted for in the \nAppropriations Committee, the point of this amendment will be moot.\n  I suggest a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy], for himself, Mr. \n     Kennedy, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Biden, \n     and Mr. Obama, proposes an amendment numbered 203.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate in support of full funding \n              and availability of the Crime Victims Fund)\n\n       At the end of title V, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE CRIME VICTIMS FUND.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:--\n       (1) The Victims of Crime Act of 1984 (``VOCA'') was enacted \n     to provide Federal financial support for services to victims \n     of all types of crime, primarily through grants to state \n     crime victim compensation and victim assistance programs.\n       (2) VOCA created the Crime Victims Fund (``the Fund'') as a \n     separate account into which are deposited monies collected \n     from persons convicted of Federal criminal offenses, \n     including criminal fines, forfeitures and special \n     assessments. There are no general taxpayer generated revenues \n     deposited into the Fund.\n       (3) Each fiscal year, the Fund is used to support--\n       (A) Children's Justice Act grants to States to improve the \n     investigation and prosecution of child abuse cases;\n       (B) victim witness coordinators in United States Attorney's \n     Offices;\n       (C) victim assistance specialists in Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation field offices;\n       (D) discretionary grants by the Office for Victims of Crime \n     to provide training and technical assistance and services to \n     victims of Federal crimes;\n       (E) formula grants to States to supplement State crime \n     victim compensation programs, which reimburse more than \n     150,000 violent crime victims annually for out-of-pocket \n     expenses, including medical expenses, mental health \n     counseling, lost wages, loss of support and funeral costs;\n       (F) formula grants to States for financial assistance to \n     upwards of 4,400 programs providing direct victim assistance \n     services to nearly 4,000,000 victims of all types of crimes \n     annually, with priority for programs serving victims of \n     domestic violence, sexual assault and child abuse, and \n     previously underserved victims of violent crime; and\n       (G) the Antiterrorism Emergency Reserve, to assist victims \n     of domestic and international terrorism.\n       (4) Just 4 months ago, a strong bipartisan, bicameral \n     majority in Congress affirmed its support for the Crime \n     Victims Fund and increased its commitment to crime victims in \n     the Justice for All Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-405), which \n     establishes Federal crime victims rights and authorized 2 new \n     VOCA-funded victim programs.\n       (5) Before fiscal year 2000, all amounts deposited into the \n     Crime Victims Fund in each fiscal year were made available \n     for authorized programs in the subsequent fiscal year.\n       (6) Beginning in fiscal year 2000, Congress responded to \n     large fluctuations of deposits into the Fund by delaying \n     obligations from the Fund above certain amount, as follows:\n       (A) For fiscal year 2000, $500,000,000.\n       (B) For fiscal year 2001, $537,500,000.\n       (C) For fiscal year 2002, $550,000,000.\n       (D) For fiscal year 2003, $600,000,000.\n       (E) For fiscal year 2004, $625,000,000.\n       (F) For fiscal year 2005, $625,000,000.\n       (7) In the conference report on an omnibus spending bill \n     for fiscal year 2000 (Public Law\n\n[[Page S2938]]\n\n     106-113), Congress explained that the reason for delaying \n     annual Fund obligations was ``to protect against wide \n     fluctuations in receipts into the Fund, and to ensure that a \n     stable level of funding will remain available for these \n     programs in future years''.\n       (8) VOCA mandates that ``. . . all sums deposited in the \n     Fund in any fiscal year that are not made available for \n     obligation by Congress in the subsequent fiscal year shall \n     remain in the Fund for obligation in future fiscal years, \n     without fiscal year limitation''.\n       (9) For fiscal year 2006, the President is recommending \n     ``rescission'' of $1,267,000,000 from amounts in the Fund.\n       (10) The rescission proposed by the President would result \n     in no funds being available to support crime victim services \n     at the start of fiscal year 2007. Further, such rescission \n     would make the Fund vulnerable to fluctuations in receipts \n     into the Fund, and would not ensure that a stable level of \n     funding will remain available for vital programs in future \n     years.\n       (11) Retention of all amounts deposited into the Fund for \n     the immediate and future use of crime victim services as \n     authorized by VOCA is supported by many major national victim \n     service organizations, including--\n       (A) Justice Solutions, NPO;\n       (B) National Organization for Victim Assistance;\n       (C) National Alliance to End Sexual Violence;\n       (D) National Children's Alliance;\n       (E) National Association of VOCA Assistance Administrators;\n       (F) National Association of Crime Victim Compensation \n     Boards;\n       (G) Mothers Against Drunk Driving;\n       (H) National Center for Victims of Crime;\n       (I) National Organization for Parents of Murdered Children;\n       (J) National Coalition Against Domestic Violence;\n       (K) Pennsylvania Coalition Against Rape; and\n       (L) National Network to End Domestic Violence.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the funding levels in this resolution assume that all \n     amounts that have been and will be deposited into the Crime \n     Victims Fund, including amounts deposited in fiscal year 2006 \n     and thereafter, shall remain in the Fund for use as \n     authorized under the Victims of Crime Act of 1984.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n203.\n  The amendment (No. 203) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the next amendment will be offered by the \nSenator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 169\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, this is one of the most important things \nwe can do to meet the pandemic afflicting Africa right now. The \nPresident came up with a great number for bilateral aid. We are still a \nlittle short on the global fund. This is to add half a billion dollars \nto the global fund to make sure we can meet our commitment to provide \ndrugs and services to this pandemic.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am happy to join the Senator from \nPennsylvania in a bipartisan effort to attack the deadliest epidemic in \nmodern times. I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Santorum], for himself, \n     Mr. Durbin, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Corzine, Mr. \n     Dodd, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Kohl, Mr. \n     Leahy, Mr. Levin, Mr. Lieberman, Mrs. Murray, and Ms. \n     Stabenow proposes an amendment numbered 169.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: Reaffirming that the United States maintain a one-to-two \nratio for contributions to the Global Fund, that the United States not \nexceed contributing more than 33 percent of the Global Fund's revenue, \nand that the United States contribute an additional $500,000,000 to the \n    Global Fund for Fiscal Year 2006, for a total of not less than \n   $3,700,000,000 for all international HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and \n                           malaria programs)\n\n       On page 9, line 15, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 9, line 16, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 14, decrease the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 15, decrease the amount by $500,000,000.\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. UNITED STATES RESPONSE TO GLOBAL HIV/AIDS, \n                   TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The HIV/AIDS pandemic has reached staggering \n     proportions. At the end of 2004, an estimated 40,000,000 \n     people were infected with HIV or living with AIDS. HIV/AIDS \n     is estimated to kill 3,000,000 men, women and children each \n     year. Each year, there are estimated to be 5,000,000 new HIV \n     infections.\n       (2) The United States was the first, and remains the \n     largest, contributor to the Global Fund.\n       (3) The Presidential Administration of George W. Bush \n     (referred to in this section as the ``Administration'') has \n     supported language in the Global HIV/AIDS authorization bill \n     that links United States contributions to the Global Fund to \n     the contributions of other donors, permitting the United \n     States to provide 33 percent of all donations, which would \n     match contributions on a one-to-two basis.\n       (4) Congress has provided one-third of all donations to the \n     Global Fund every year of the Fund's existence.\n       (5) For fiscal year 2006, the Global Fund estimates it will \n     renew $2,400,000,000 worth of effective programs that are \n     already operating on the ground, and the Administration and \n     Fund Board have said that renewals of existing grants should \n     receive priority funding.\n       (6) The Global Fund is an important component of United \n     States efforts to combat AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, and \n     supports approximately 300 projects in 130 countries.\n       (7) For fiscal year 2006, the President has requested \n     $300,000,000 for the United States contribution to the Global \n     Fund.\n       (8) Through a mid-year review process, Congress and the \n     Administration will assess contributions to date and \n     anticipated contributions to the Global Fund, and ensure that \n     United States contributions, at year-end, are at the \n     appropriate one-to-two ratio.\n       (9) Congress and the Administration will monitor \n     contributions to the Global Fund to ensure that United States \n     contributions do not exceed one-third of the Global Fund's \n     revenues.\n       (10) In order to cover one-third of renewals during fiscal \n     year 2006, and to maintain the one-to-two funding match, the \n     United States will need to contribute an additional \n     $500,000,000 above the President's request for the Global \n     Fund for fiscal year 2006 to keep good programs funded at a \n     level of $800,000,000.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the assumptions underlying this budget resolution assume \n     that none of the offsets needed to provide $800,000,000 for \n     the Global Fund will come from international humanitarian \n     assistance programs.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n169.\n  The amendment (No. 169) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state his inquiry.\n  Mr. CONRAD. What is the next amendment in the queue?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The only amendment that has been proposed but \nnot disposed of is the Allen amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Is this the Allen amendment relative to NASA?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. That amendment was agreed to by unanimous consent, as \nmodified, in a tranche of amendments we did earlier this evening. We \nwill get this clarified, Mr. President.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask that we recognize Senator Lincoln \nfor the purpose of offering an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 192\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I would imagine that everyone in this \nbody has heard equally as much from their local sheriffs as I have \nabout the problem of methamphetamines across this country, particularly \nin rural America.\n  What this amendment does is it takes and restores the funding from \nthe COPS initiative to methamphetamine enforcement and cleanup. We have \nseen tremendous increases across this great Nation in this destructive \ndrug and what it is doing to rural America.\n  I compliment some of my colleagues on the other side--Senator Coleman \nand Senator Talent--who have done a lot of work on this issue. We have \ngood cosponsors on this side.\n\n[[Page S2939]]\n\n  We pay for this initiative by some of the tax loopholes that did not \nseem to get closed in the FSC/ETI package. We are glad to work with our \ncolleagues in any way possible to get this funding out to our States, \nout to our local law enforcement officers. They are having a \ndevastating time trying to address this issue, and I hope my colleagues \nwill take a look at the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield myself a minute off the managers' time. I was \nunder the impression that the Senator's amendment took the funds from \n920. Are you saying the Senator's amendment pays for this with an \nincrease in taxes?\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. We will be more than willing to work with the other \nside on how we pay for it. It does need to be paid for.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I reserve my time.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. We can modify the amendment if the Senator would like.\n  Mr. GREGG. Why don't we reserve action on the Senator's amendment \nuntil we have a couple seconds to talk about it?\n  Mr. President, I would like to clarify that the Allen amendment has \nbeen adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to modify my \namendment that I have just offered and that the funds necessary to \nimplement this amendment be taken from the 920----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Arkansas call up her \namendment?\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mrs. Lincoln] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 192.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n             (Purpose: To support full funding for HIDTAs)\n\n       On page 65, after line 25, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE SUPPORTING FUNDING FOR HIDTAS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) \n     program encompasses 28 strategic regions, 355 task forces, 53 \n     intelligence centers, 4,428 Federal personnel, and 8,459 \n     State and local personnel.\n       (2) The purposes of the HIDTA program  are to reduce drug \n     trafficking and drug production in designated areas in the \n     United States by--\n       (A) facilitating cooperation among Federal, State, and \n     local law enforcement agencies to share information and \n     implement coordinated enforcement activities;\n       (B) enhancing intelligence sharing among Federal, State, \n     and local law enforcement agencies;\n       (C) providing reliable intelligence to law enforcement \n     agencies needed to design effective enforcement strategies \n     and operations; and\n       (D) supporting coordinated law enforcement strategies which \n     maximize use of available resources to reduce the supply of \n     drugs in HIDTA designated areas.\n       (3) In 2004, HIDTA efforts resulted in disrupting or \n     dismantling over 509 international, 711 multi-State, and \n     1,110 local drug trafficking organizations.\n       (4) In 2004, HIDTA instructors trained 21,893 students in \n     cutting-edge practices to limit drug trafficking and \n     manufacturing within their areas.\n       (5) The HIDTAs are the only drug enforcement coalitions \n     that include equal partnership between Federal, State, and \n     local law enforcement leaders executing a regional approach \n     to achieving regional goals while pursuing a national \n     mission.\n       (6) The proposed budget of $100,000,000 for the HIDTA \n     program is inadequate to effectively maintain all of the \n     operations currently being supported.\n       (7) The proposed budget of $100,000,000 for the HIDTA \n     program would undermine the viability of this program and the \n     efforts of law enforcement around the country to combat \n     illegal drugs, particularly methamphetamine.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the spending level of budget function 750 \n     (Administration of Justice) is assumed to include \n     $227,000,000 for the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas; \n     and\n       (2) unless new legislation is enacted, it is assumed that \n     the HIDTA program will remain with the Office of National \n     Drug Control Policy, where Congress last authorized it to \n     reside.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this is very simple. It is to restore a \ncut in the HIDTA funding. HIDTA is called the High Intensity Drug \nTrafficking Administration. This is the major law enforcement \nmechanism. It covers lots of different law enforcement agencies, in the \nwest, particularly rural areas, to fight methamphetamine. We need the \nresources to fight methamphetamine. Methamphetamine is probably the \nlargest scourge in many rural parts of America. This is designed to \nenable us to have the resources to fight methamphetamine in our \ncountry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I suggest a voice vote on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, on our side, we want to signal strong \nsupport for this amendment, and we can voice vote the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n253.\n  The amendment (No. 253) was agreed to.\n  Mr. TALENT. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 202\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask that we recognize Senator Dayton for \nthe purpose of offering an amendment and that Senator Dayton have 1 \nminute to describe his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized for 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 202 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I recognize that there is a lot going on \nright now and I apologize for a touch of confusion, but if Senator \nDayton has been yielded 1 minute as a result of a unanimous consent, we \nask unanimous consent for 1 minute on our side in opposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Dayton], for himself, Mr. \n     Akaka, Mr. Levin, Mr. Lieberman, and Ms. Mikulski, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 202.\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank my cosponsors, Senators Durbin, \nMikulski, Lieberman, Stabenow, and Akaka. My amendment would increase \nthe Federal share of funding for special education to the level of 40 \npercent of the cost that was promised when IDEA was established almost \n30 years ago. Despite the increases that President Bush has proposed \nand that this Congress has enacted in the last 4 years, that Federal \nshare is still less than half of what was promised back then. My \ncolleagues have before them as a part of the letter that I submitted \nwhat the difference is for their respective States. For Minnesota, it \nis about $250 million. That money would be badly needed and best used \nby our local school districts.\n  As a result of the shortfall in Minnesota, and I suspect other \nStates, funds that are supposed to go to regular education get shifted \nover to cover the shortfall for special education, meaning the quality \nof education for all of our students goes down.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I ask my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this amendment would add $74 billion in \nspending and would increase taxes by $74 billion. It comes in the \ncontext of the fact that it would actually exceed the authorized level \nof IDEA as just reauthorized. In addition, it ignores the fact that \nthis President has made a stronger commitment to IDEA than any \nPresident in history, especially in comparison to the prior President. \nThis President has increased IDEA funding by 74 percent in his first 4 \nyears in office, and he has made a commitment in this budget to add \nanother $500 million in IDEA. It is obviously a classic tax-and-spend \namendment, and I certainly hope my colleagues would defeat it.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I offer an amendment to increase the \nfunding for LIHEAP from $1.8 billion to $3 billion. This amendment is \nfully offset. LIHEAP has received level funding for more than 20 years, \nbut energy prices have not remained level. They have not remained \nstable. In fact, they are at all-time highs. We all have stories such \nas this from our States. Recently, a mother of two from Arkansas turned \non her electric oven in order to heat the house, burned the house down, \nand killed her two daughters. We all have similar stories such as that \nfrom around the Nation.\n  This is an amendment that will help the people who need it most in \nall of our States.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this amendment actually increases spending \non the program by $1.2 billion. It is a bit excessive, and, therefore, \nI will oppose this amendment and ask for a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 213) was rejected.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to say for the information of \nSenators that we are now very close. We have six or seven amendments \nleft to do. We are working hard to try to clear some of them. Some of \nthem no doubt will still require votes. We ask for our colleagues' \npatience. We have, I think, made enormous progress. You will remember \nwhen we started this, we were headed for being here until 3 o'clock in \nthe morning. Very substantial progress has been made because of the \ncooperation of Members on both sides. If we can be patient a few more \nminutes, we can clear additional amendments and then be prepared to \npush to the end.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 254, As Modified\n\n  Mr. GREGG.

Mr. President, I suggest the Senator from Michigan has an \namendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I send modified amendment numbered 288 to \nthe desk for immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin], for himself, Mr. \n     DeWine, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. Bingaman, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 238, as modified.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n[[Page S2944]]\n\n(Purpose: To promote innovation and U.S. competitiveness by expressing \n the sense of the Senate urging the Senate Appropriations Committee to \n make efforts to fund the Advanced Technology Program, which supports \nindustry-led research and development of cutting-edge technologies with \n           broad commercial potential and societal benefits)\n\n       In the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   .

Mr. President, this amendment is on behalf of Senator \nDeWine, myself, Senator Lieberman, and others. We have lost 2.8 million \nmanufacturing jobs in this country in the last 4 years. We have a very \nmodest program called the Advanced Technology Program, which, according \nto the Department of Commerce, in their publication, which I would be \nhappy to share with those who can come to take a look at it, according \nto the Department of Commerce, this program has had a result eight \ntimes more in technologies developed than the amount of money we have \nput into the program. It is an eight-time return--multiple--in advanced \ntechnologies which is achieved when the Department of Commerce partners \nwith industry.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this amendment would suggest we continue a \nprogram which has certainly outlived its day. It is essentially walking \naround money for the technology industries, picking winners and losers \nin the area of commercial products that the Government has no role in \ndoing. It is money that could be better spent on basic research--for \nexample, at the NIH.\n  I strongly oppose this amendment and hope we will defeat it.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n        (Purpose: To increase funding for Boys and Girls Clubs)\n\n       On page 23 line 16, increase the amount by $25,000,000.\n       On page 23 line 17, increase the amount by $6,000,000.\n       On page 23 line 21, increase the amount by $8,000,000.\n       On page 23 line 25, increase the amount by $5,000,000.\n       On page 24 line 4, increase the amount by $4,000,000.\n       On page 24 line 8, increase the amount by $3,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 14, decrease the amount by $25,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 15, decrease the amount by $6,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 18, decrease the amount by $8,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 21, decrease the amount by $5,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 24, decrease the amount by $4,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 2, decrease the amount by $3,000,000.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this is an amendment to restore funding for \nthe Boys & Girls Clubs of America to their current fiscal year level. \nFrom my days as a prosecutor, throughout my career in the Senate, I \nhave seen the great value of Boys and Girls Clubs. This is not a \nDemocratic or Republican issue.\n  We have a responsibility to make sure that our children are safe and \nsecure. I know firsthand how well Boys and Girls Clubs work and what \ntop-notch organizations they are. When I was a prosecutor in Vermont, I \nwas convinced of the great need for Boys and Girls Clubs because we \nrarely encountered children from these kinds of programs. In fact, \nafter I became a U.S. Senator, a police chief was such a big fan of the \nclubs that he asked me to help fund a Boys and Girls Club in his \ndistrict rather than helping him add a couple more police officers.\n  In Vermont, Boys and Girls Clubs have succeeded in preventing crime \nand supporting our children. The first club was established in \nBurlington 63 years ago. Now we have 20 club sites operating throughout \nthe State in Addison, Chittenden, Orange, Rutland, Washington, Windham \nand Windsor Counties. There are also four new Boys and Girls Clubs in \nthe works in Winooski, Brattleboro, Barre and Vergennes. These clubs \nwill serve well over 10,000 kids statewide.\n  As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I have \npushed for more Federal funding for Boys and Girls Clubs. Since 1998, \nCongress has increased Federal support for Boys and Girls Clubs from \n$20 million to $85 million in this fiscal year. Due in large part to \nthis increase in funding, there now exist 3,500 Boys and Girls Clubs in \nall 50 States serving more than 4 million young people.\n  Because of these successes, I was both surprised and disappointed to \nsee that the President requested a reduction of $25 million for fiscal \nyear 2006. That request will leave thousands of children and their \nClubs behind. We cannot allow such a thing to happen.\n  Last year, Senator Hatch and I worked together to shepherd into law a \nreauthorization of Justice Department grants at $80 million for fiscal \nyear 2006, $85 million for fiscal year 2007, $90 million for fiscal \nyear 2008, $95 million for fiscal year 2009 and $100 million for fiscal \nyear 2010 to Boys and Girls Clubs\n\n[[Page S2945]]\n\nto help establish 1,500 additional Boys and Girls Clubs across the \nNation with the goal of having 5,000 Boys and Girls Clubs in operation \nby December 31, 2010.\n  If we had a Boys and Girls Club in every community, prosecutors in \nour country would have a lot less work to do in the courtroom. Each \ntime I visit a club in Vermont, I am approached by parents, educators, \nteachers, grandparents and law enforcement officers who tell me ``Keep \ndoing this! These clubs give our children the chance to grow up free of \ndrugs, gangs and crime.''\n  You cannot argue that these are just Democratic or Republican ideas, \nor conservative or liberal ideas--they are simply good sense ideas. We \nneed safe havens where our youth--the future of our country--can learn \nand grow up free from the influences of drugs, gangs and crime. That is \nwhy Boys and Girls Clubs are so important to our children.\n  Across the Nation, Boys and Girls Clubs are preventing crime and \nsupporting our children. My amendment will restore funding for the Boys \nand Girls Clubs of America to the fiscal year 2005 level of $85 \nmillion. It provides a full offset at $50 million split evenly for the \nBoys and Girls Clubs and for deficit reduction by, for example, closing \ncorporate tax loopholes. It also expresses the sense of the Senate on \nthe value of Boys and Girls Clubs in their mission to inspire and \nenable all young people, especially those from disadvantaged \ncircumstances, to realize their full potential as productive, \nresponsible and caring citizens.\n  Congress has authorized and appropriated increased levels of funding \nfor the Boys and Girls Clubs of America in each of the last 8 years \nbecause of the clubs' proven role in discouraging youth gangs, drug \nabuse and youth violence. The budget resolution, following the \nPresident's lead, reduces funding for Boys and Girls Clubs by $25 \nmillion--from $85 million to $60 million--and completely ignores the 5-\nyear authorization for the Boys and Girls Club grant program enacted by \nCongress and signed by the President in October 2004. A drop to $60 \nmillion in the coming fiscal year will likely result in an across-the-\nboard decrease of 30 percent to club pass-thru grants, as well as a 30 \npercent cut to the overall increase in youth served. In connection with \nmy amendment I have offered to substitute other offsets.\n  Mr. President, I urge the Senate to adopt the Leahy amendment to \nrestore funding by $25 million for the 2006 fiscal year for the Boys \nand Girls Clubs of America. Our country's strength and ultimate success \nlies with our children. Our greatest responsibility is to help them \ninhabit this century the best way possible and we can help do that by \nsupporting the Boys and Girls Clubs of America.\n  Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 237), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to reconsider the vote and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 262\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I send to the desk, on behalf of Senators \nGrassley, Baucus, Enzi, and Kennedy, an amendment and ask for its \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SENSE OF THE SENATE WITH RESPECT TO PENSION REFORM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The rules for calculating the funded status of pension \n     plans and for determining calculations, premiums, and other \n     issues should ensure strong funding of such plans in both \n     good and bad economic times.\n       (2) The expiration of the interest rate provisions of the \n     Pension Funding Equity Act of 2004 at the end of 2005 and the \n     need to address the deficit at the Pension Benefit Guaranty \n     Corporation (referred to in this section as the ``PBGC'') \n     demand enactment of pension legislation this year.\n       (3) Thirty-four million active and retired workers are \n     relying on their defined benefit plans to provide retirement \n     security, and a failure by Congress to reform the defined \n     benefit system will place at risk the pensions of millions of \n     Americans.\n       (4) Stabilization of the defined benefit pension system and \n     the PBGC may require significant and structural changes in \n     the Employee Retirement and Income Security Act of 1974 and \n     the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, which must be undertaken \n     in a single comprehensive set of reforms.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Senate conferees shall insist on the Senate position \n     expressed in this resolution with respect to PBGC premiums.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 262) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 161, As Modified\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, amendment No. 161 is at the desk, with \nmodifications.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. DeWine], for himself and Mr. \n     Leahy, proposes an amendment numbered 161, as modified.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To increase funding for Child Survival and Maternal Health \n                               Programs)\n\n       On page 9, line 15, increase the amount by $76,000,000.\n       On page 9, line 16, increase the amount by $15,000,000.\n       On page 9, line 20, increase the amount by $34,000,000.\n       On page 9, line 24, increase the amount by $14,000,000.\n       On page 10, line 3, increase the amount by $7,000,000.\n       On page 10, line 7, increase the amount by $3,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 14, decrease the amount by $76,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 15, decrease the amount by $15,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 18, decrease the amount by $34,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 21, decrease the amount by $14,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 24, decrease the amount by $7,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 2, decrease the amount by $3,000,000.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I join my friend and colleague, \nSenator Leahy, in offering this amendment that would increase the \nfunding level for the child survival and maternal health program to \n$400 million.\n  Basically, by voting for this amendment we will save many lives. It \nprovides money for vaccinations, immunizations, and vitamins that will \nsave lives around the world.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I join the Senator and urge adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we now have the DeWine amendment before \nus.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 161), as modified, was agreed to.\n\n\n                           parity assumption\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I begin by complimenting my friend from \nNew Hampshire and the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee on a job \nwell done. As the new Chairman, he has skillfully navigated a difficult \ncourse to produce the budget resolution before us today. \nCongratulations.\n  I also want to tell him that even though this is his first year as \nthe Budget Committee chairman, he has handled the job like a seasoned \nveteran.\n  I would like to raise the issue of mental health parity as the Senate \ndebates the FY 2006 Senate Budget Resolution.\n  It is my understanding the resolution before us assumes the revenue \nimpact of enacting a mental health parity law at a cost of $1.5 billion \nover 5 years. However, I want to make sure that this is indeed the case \nbecause the assumption I just mentioned is not specifically referenced \nin S. Con. Res. 18.\n\n[[Page S2946]]\n\nRather, the overall revenue number is such that it assumes Congress \nwill pass mental health parity legislation.\n  Mr. GREGG. I understand the concern of the distinguished senior \nSenator from New Mexico regarding mental health parity legislation and \nI would concur with my colleague's assessment. S. Con. Res. 18 does \nassume the revenue impact of enacting mental health parity legislation.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the distinguished Chairman for his \nconsideration and explanation of this important matter.\n\n\n                  energy savings performance contracts\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I would like to bring to the Budget \nCommittee's attention a great program that saves the Federal Government \nboth money and energy--it is called Energy Savings Performance \nContracting or ESPC. Under this public-private initiative, the private \nsector upgrades our aging federal facilities and military bases with \nnew energy efficient equipment, at no upfront cost to the government. \nThe private sector is then paid back over time with the savings from \nthe government's utility bills. The beauty of this program is that \nunder the law, the energy savings must cover the project costs and also \nguarantee that there will be additional savings to the government, as \ncodified per the Energy Policy Act of 1992:\n\n                                H.R. 776\n\n       Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Enrolled as Agreed to or Passed \n     by Both House and Senate)\n\n     SEC. 155. ENERGY SAVINGS PERFORMANCE CONTRACTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 801 of the National Energy \n     Conservation Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 8287) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``The head'' and inserting the following:\n       ``(a) In General.--(1) The head''; and\n       (2) by inserting at the end the following:\n       ``(2)(A) Contracts under this title shall be energy savings \n     performance contracts and shall require an annual energy \n     audit and specify the terms and conditions of any Government \n     payments and performance guarantees. Any such performance \n     guarantee shall provide that the contractor is responsible \n     for maintenance and repair services for any energy related \n     equipment, including computer software systems.\n       ``(B) Aggregate annual payments by an agency to both \n     utilities and energy savings performance contractors, under \n     an energy savings performance contract, may not exceed the \n     amount that the agency would have paid for utilities without \n     an energy savings performance contract (as estimated through \n     the procedures developed pursuant to this section) during \n     contract years. The contract shall provide for a guarantee of \n     savings to the agency, and shall establish payment schedules \n     reflecting such guarantee, taking into account any capital \n     costs under the contract.\n       ``(C) Federal agencies may incur obligations pursuant to \n     such contracts in finance energy conservation measures \n     provided guaranteed savings exceed the debt service \n     requirements.''\n\n  It's a win-win program for the government and taxpayers.\n  The problem is that under the current CBO budget scoring methodology, \nthe entire contract cost is scored up front and there is no accounting \nfor the guaranteed savings which are required by law. Since these \nguaranteed savings are not recognized, this program is scored as \ncosting the government money when in reality this is not the case. The \nOffice of Management and Budget views the program as budget neutral, \nand the program has strong support from the Administration.\n  This current scoring dilemma for the ESPC program has been \nproblematic in the reauthorization of this valuable program. I \nrespectfully ask that the Budget Committee work with the Congressional \nBudget Office to resolve this scoring problem for the ESPC program.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I want to thank the Senator from Oklahoma for raising \nthis issue, and I will ask the Budget Committee staff to look into the \nscoring of the ESPC program with an eye towards accounting for the \nmandatory savings and thus resolving the matter.\n\n\n                          it/p4p reserve fund\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend the chairman and ranking member \nof the Budget Committee for working with me, and with the chairman of \nthe HELP Committee, as well as with the chairman and ranking member of \nthe Finance Committee to include within the budget resolution a reserve \nfund to provide incentives for adoption of modern information \ntechnology to improve quality in health care and for performance-based \npayments that are based on accepted clinical performance measures that \nimprove the quality of health care.\n  The goal of this fund is to allow for legislation to create a program \nthrough which incentives would be provided in the initial years of the \nprogram to encourage health care providers to enhance their use of \ninformation technology and improve quality. The fund would achieve \ndeficit neutrality through the savings that will accrue to public \nprograms through better use of information technology and higher \nquality care. The reserve fund thus requires deficit neutrality over \nthe 5 years of the budget resolution.\n  It was the intent of all those Members who worked on this proposal to \nrequire the program to achieve deficit neutrality over the 5 years of \nthe budget resolution, but not to require deficit neutrality in the \ninitial year of the program or, on a year-by-year basis, in subsequent \nyears. I ask the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee whether \nwhat I have just described reflects their understanding of the intent \nof the program to be established in accordance with this reserve fund.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the description of the intent of the \nreserve fund that my colleague from Massachusetts just provided also \nreflects my understanding and intent in supporting the inclusion of \nthis fund. I believe the intent of the reserve fund would be satisfied \nby legislation reported by the HELP Committee or the Finance Committee \nthat is not deficit neutral in the initial year or any other single \nyear during fiscal years 2006 to 2010 but that otherwise complies with \nthe conditions of the reserve fund. I do not intend to raise or support \na budget point of order raised against such legislation on the basis \nthat it is not deficit neutral in any particular year during fiscal \nyears 2006-2010.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the description of the intent of the \nreserve fund offered by my colleagues from Massachusetts and from New \nHampshire also reflects my understanding of the intent of including \nthis fund in the budget resolution. I commend the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Budget Committee for their leadership in including this \nreserve fund in the Senate budget resolution. And I commend my \ncolleagues from New Hampshire and Massachusetts and others for their \nwillingness to work toward this signal of our bipartisan commitment to \nimproving the quality and safety of health care in this country, and to \naddressing the problem of health care costs. These are critically \nimportant issues facing our nation today, and I look forward to \ncontinuing our bipartisan dialogue, making the best use of this \nimportant reserve fund, and working together on legislation to \nencourage the adoption of health information technology for quality \nimprovement and to develop performance-based payment systems.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 204\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I voted in support of Senator Smith's \namendment to strike $14 billion in Medicaid cuts from the budget \nresolution and instead create a bipartisan Medicaid commission to study \nhow to best reform the program.\n  Sound policy--not arbitrary budget cuts--should be the driving force \nfor strengthening and improving the Medicaid program. A Medicaid \ncommission could help foster a much-needed dialogue about how to take \nprudent steps to make this critical safety net stronger and sustainable \nin the long term.\n  More than 40 million Americans, including 300,000 West Virginians, \nrely on Medicaid. In West Virginia, the health care safety net--\ncomprised of hospitals, nursing homes, home health agencies, physician \noffices, and community health centers--relies heavily on Federal \nMedicaid funding to care for the poor, disabled, and elderly.\n  If Medicaid funding is capped at an arbitrary funding level, states, \nsuch as West Virginia, will be left to shoulder the burden of \nincreasing health care costs on their own. The health care needs of \nlow-income people do not magically disappear just because there are \nfewer federal funds made available.\n  It is my hope that a bipartisan consensus of policies can be reached \nto best address the challenges confronting the Medicaid program. The \npassage of the Smith Amendment to establish a Medicaid commission is a \nconstructive first step toward that goal.\n\n[[Page S2947]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 216\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, on January 20, 2005, President Bush said in \nhis Inaugural speech, ``We will widen the ownership of homes and \nbusinesses. . . .'' Two weeks later he turned around and submitted a \nbudget that cut funding for the only agency dedicated to cultivating \nsmall business ownership in this country, the Small Business \nAdministration. How much did he cut? 20 percent. This is nothing new. \nThe President's track record is even worse. Since President Bush took \noffice in 2001, he has reduced small business resources available \nthrough the SBA by 36 percent, the most of any government agency. You \nmay not think the SBA is important, but, last year alone, through the \nSBA, more than 88,000 small businesses in this country got loans and \nventure capital, totaling more than $21 billion. A lot more than that, \n1.5 million, turned to the SBA and its partners last year for \nmanagement counseling so that they could start a business, keep their \ndoors open, or expand their business. Think of the SBA next time you \nget ice cream from Ben & Jerry's, see a mother with a ``boppy'' baby \npillow, take a road trip and see a Winnebago, send a package Federal \nExpress, type on an Apple computer, or swing a Callaway golf club. All \nthese companies were helped by the SBA. Where would these companies \nhave been when they were shut out from financing if the SBA had not \nexisted? Imagine the void in our economy without the taxes they \ngenerate and all the people without jobs if those companies didn't \nexist. SBA more than pays for itself.\n  The SBA is a good return on the investment for our country. As my \ncolleague from Maine, Senator Snowe, pointed out at our recent hearing \non the SBA's fiscal year 2006 budget, the SBA's budget represents less \nthan 3/100ths of a percent of all Federal spending. And a lot of that \nfunding for the SBA supports emergency loans that help families and \nbusinesses when disaster strikes. We are all for fiscal responsibility, \nbut cutting this resource that is so important to our economy is not \nresponsible. Instead of weakening this resource, we should be \nmaximizing it to leverage more businesses and creating more jobs.\n  Evidently my colleagues agree because tonight they agreed unanimously \nto adopt a bi-partisan amendment to restore $78 million to the SBA's \nbudget for fiscal year 2006. Senator Snowe and I both had our own \namendments, but in the end we joined together so that we could get a \nwin for small business. I thank the Chair for her cooperation and \nleadership.\n  My amendment would have restored $139 million to the SBA, including \n$42 million in fee relief for borrowers and lenders in the 7(a) Loan \nGuarantee program; $30 million for microloans and $20 million for \nmicroloan technical assistance; $5 million for PRIME; $24 million to \nrestore funding New Markets Venture Capital that was unfairly and \nunwisely rescinded; $3.6 million for 7(j) contracting assistance to \ndisadvantage small businesses; $2 million for Native American Outreach; \n$109 million for Small Business Development Centers; a combined $4 \nmillion for SBIR FAST and Rural Outreach; $7 million for SCORE; $5 \nmillion for the U.S. Export Assistance Centers; $2 million for Veterans \nBusiness Outreach; $16.5 million for Women's Business Centers; and $6.5 \nmillion for 65 procurement center representatives. That would have \nraised SBA's funding to $732 million, still far less than the $900 \nmillion provided to the SBA 5 years ago. It was a responsible and \nreasonable increase.\n  Nevertheless, to get things done, we must reach across the aisle and \nwork together. So, as I said earlier, I joined my colleague of the \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship Committee, Chair Snowe, to pass \nSenate amendment No. 216. It did not go as far as I would have liked, \nbut it is still a big step in the right direction. As part of the \ncompromise, Senator Snowe agreed to include $5 million for the PRIME \nmicro business program. The Snowe-Kerry compromise includes: $15 \nmillion for Microloan Technical Assistance, which the President \nrecommended terminating; $1.91 million to fund $20 million in \nmicroloans, which the President recommended terminating; $5 million for \nthe Program for Investment in Microentrepreneurs, PRIME, which the \nPresident recommended terminating, $3 million for the Small Business \nInnovation Research, SBIR, FAST Program, which the President \nrecommended terminating; $1 million for the SBIR Rural Outreach \nProgram, which the President recommended terminating; $21 million for \nSmall Business Development Centers, increasing funding to $109 million \noverall; $10 million to fund procurement center representatives, PCRs, \nin order to hire 100 new representatives; $7.7 million for the HUBZone \nprogram, increasing funding to $10 million; $4.5 million for the \nWomen's Business Centers Program, increasing funding to $16.5 million; \n$3.5 million for U.S. Export Assistance Centers, increasing funding to \n$5 million; $2 million for the SCORE program, increasing funding to $7 \nmillion; $750,000 for Veterans Outreach, increasing funding to $1.5 \nmillion; and $500,000 for the 7(j) contracting assistance program, \nincreasing funding to $2.5 million.\n  These amounts are important to include in the Record so that the \npublic knows our intentions. I thank my colleagues, Senators Snowe, \nConrad, and Gregg, for their help and also their staffs. In advance, I \nask my colleagues on the appropriations committee to match our \nrequests.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 169\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, the HIV/AIDS pandemic has reached \nstaggering proportions. At the end of 2004, an estimated 40 million \npeople were living with HIV/AIDS. Each year, 5 million more people \nbecome infected.\n  The United States has demonstrated important leadership fighting the \nAIDS epidemic. And this leadership is yielding results. At the end of \n2004, an estimated 700,000 people in the developing world were \nreceiving antiretroviral therapy. Many of these individuals were \nreceiving treatment thanks to U.S.-supported bilateral and multilateral \nprograms.\n  The President's budget request for fiscal year 2006 includes $2.9 \nbillion for bilateral programs for AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. \nThis amendment would maintain full funding for this component of the \nPresident's request.\n  The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria is an \nimportant component of U.S. efforts, and supports approximately 300 \nprojects in 130 countries. The United States was the first and remains \nthe largest contributor to the Global Fund.\n  To balance the U.S. share and encourage contributions from other \ndonors, the administration supported language in the U.S. Leadership \nAgainst HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 that links U.S. \ncontributions to the Fund to the contributions of other donors.\n  Together with Senator Durbin, I believe Congress should fulfill the \ncommitment implied in the act by matching, on a one-to-two basis, the \ncontributions of other donors. Through a mid-year review process, \nCongress and the administration should assess anticipated contributions \nto the Global Fund and ensure that U.S. contributions, at year-end, are \nat the appropriate one-to-two ratio, and that the U.S. does not exceed \n33 percent of total contributions to the fund.\n\n  For fiscal year 2005, the Global Fund estimates it will renew $2.4 \nbillion worth of effective programs that are already operating on the \nground. The administration and the Global Fund Board have said that \nrenewing existing grants should receive funding priority.\n  In order to cover one-third of renewals during fiscal year 2006, and \nto maintain the one-to-two funding match, the U.S. will need to \ncontribute an additional $500 million above the President's request to \nkeep well-functioning programs funded at a level of $800 million.\n  Senator Durbin and I consider this number to be the necessary level \nof funding. Failing to renew grants could cut off life-saving \ntreatments in proven programs.\n  Senator Durbin and I firmly believe that funding the global fight \nagainst AIDS is a top priority. If adopted by the Senate, this \namendment will ensure a level of $3.7 billion for international AIDS, \ntuberculosis, and malaria assistance, including $800 million for the \nGlobal Fund.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 238\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, for the second year in a row, the President \nproposes to completely eliminate the Advanced Technology Program, ATP. \nLast year, Congress wisely chose to\n\n[[Page S2948]]\n\nfund the ATP program at $142.3 million. The bottom line is that the ATP \npromotes the development of new, innovative products that are made and \ndeveloped in the United States, helping American companies compete \nagainst their foreign competitors and contribute to the growth of the \nU.S. economy.\n  I hope Congress will continue to fund this important program in \nfiscal year 2006. Doing so will help strengthen the technological and \neconomic leadership of America's high technology manufacturing \ncompanies that is necessary for them to remain competitive in today's \nglobal marketplace. It will also help ensure that the most cutting-edge \ncompanies can continue to innovate, expand and create jobs.\n  My amendment expresses the sense of the Senate calling on the Senate \nCommittee on Appropriations to make every effort to restore funding for \nthe Advanced Technology Program in fiscal year 2006.\n  Continued ATP funding would encourage public-private cooperation and \ninvestment in economically important technology R Through a cost-\nshared program, the ATP provides grants to support research and \ndevelopment of high-tech, cutting-edge technologies with commercial \npotential and societal benefits. The ATP focuses on improving the \ncompetitiveness of American companies and funds many research and \ndevelopment projects that have the potential to create broad-based U.S. \neconomic benefits and that otherwise may not get developed or that \nwould be developed too slowly to take advantage of market \nopportunities.\n  According to one study, the manufacturing sector, more than any \nother, helps to generate increased economic activity in other \nindustries with every dollar of goods produced generating an additional \n$1.43 in economic activity in other industries or sectors.\n  According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, returns for the \nAmerican people on the ATP, as measured from 41 of the 736 projects--\njust 6 percent of the portfolio--have exceeded $17 billion in economic \nbenefits, more than eight times the amount invested in ATP.\n  Manufacturers' investment in innovation account for almost two-thirds \nof all private-sector research and development. This investment in turn \nleads to advances in other manufacturing sectors and spillover into \nnonmanufacturing activities in the United States.\n  ATP involvement accelerates the development and commercialization of \nnew technologies. Time to market was reduced by 1 year in 10 percent of \nprojects, by 2 years in 22 percent of projects, and by 3 years in 26 \npercent of projects.\n  The ATP program supports small business. Over 65 percent of ATP \nprojects have been led by small businesses. This is exceptional given \nthat small businesses lead in the creation of job growth and new \ntechnology advancement in our country.\n  ATP has received applications from 50 States and made awards to high \ntechnology businesses in 40 States plus the District of Columbia.\n  The Biotechnology Industry Organization, BIO, the Industrial Research \nInstitute, the Alliance for Science and Technology Research in America, \nand the American Chemical Society have expressed support for ATP.\n  Unfortunately, current funding levels do not meet the demand for ATP. \nOver 1,000 proposals submitted in 2002 alone yielded enough high \nquality projects to absorb the total funding available in both fiscal \nyear 2002 and fiscal year 2003. Fiscal year 2004 saw the second highest \nnumber of applications for funding in ATP history, 870, but funding was \navailable for only 59 awards.\n  The ATP is one of the few Federal programs available to help American \nmanufacturers remain competitive in the global economy. This high \noctane economic development engine should be supported by Democrats and \nRepublicans alike. If we want NIST to continue making these important \njob-creating ATP awards, we have to fund it.\n  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, nationally we have lost \nnearly 2.8 million manufacturing jobs since January 2001. In the face \nof these losses and strong global economic competition, we should be \ndoing all we can to promote programs that help create jobs and \nstrengthen the technological innovation of American companies. \nSupporting the ATP program is one way to do this.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 253\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak to an amendment with \nmy good friend and colleague, Senator Grassley, expressing the sense of \nthe Senate on the High Intensity Drug Trafficking area, or HIDTA, \nprogram. My amendment assumes that the HIDTA program will be fully \nfunded at $227 million in fiscal year 2006 and that the HIDTA program \nwill remain with the Office National Drug Control Policy, ONDCP, where \nit was last authorized by Congress to be. Additional cosponsors are \nSenators Leahy, Bingaman, Murray, and Talent. I would also like to add \nSenators Gordon Smith and DeWine as cosponsors to this amendment. I \nthank my colleagues for their strong support.\n  I am proud to offer this much-needed amendment. The proposed budget \nwould cut the HIDTA program by 56 percent, assuming only $100 million \nfor HIDTA. The President's Budget also proposes to shift the program \nfrom ONDCP to the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force program \nwithin the Department of Justice. Both of these proposals could derail \nthe highly successful HIDTA program.\n  As many of my colleagues know, methamphetamine is a powerful and \nhighly addictive central nervous system stimulant that is associated \nwith violence and crime. It can cause paranoia, aggression, and mood \nswings. The byproducts of making meth are highly toxic and flammable \nand require costly clean ups. They also endanger many children who are \nexposed when their parents cook meth within the home. Since its \ninception in 1990, HIDTA has become one of the most effective and \ncomprehensive programs we have to fight meth.\n  Specifically, a HIDTA designation provides states like Montana with \nincreased resources, information and intelligence to fight \nmethamphetamine use and production. The Federal funding and increased \ncooperation among Federal, State and local law enforcement frees up \nstate resources that allow, for example, the Montana Department of \nJustice to better support Montana's rural communities. It provides law \nenforcement officials with new technology to coordinate their efforts \nat the local, State, and Federal level.\n  Montana fought hard and successfully to join the Rocky Mountain HIDTA \nin 2002. Since that time, Montana has successfully cut the number of \nmeth labs it busts in half. I have been told by law enforcement across \nmy State that the proposed cuts to HIDTA, combined with cuts proposed \nby the President to other Justice assistance programs like the Byrne \nand COPS programs, would be a disaster for Montana. It would \neffectively end drug enforcement in rural Montana and would set the \nclock back years in our efforts to fight the rapid spread of meth in \nour state.\n  Yesterday, I was proud to cosponsor and support Senator Stabenow's \namendment to restore funding for our first responder programs, Byrne \nand COPS. Sadly, that amendment failed. I also proudly supported \nSenator Biden's amendment to fully fund the COPS program. That \namendment unfortunately also failed. We must do everything we can to \nmake sure these programs survive and so far Congress is not holding up \ntheir end of the bargain.\n  Although my amendment specifically focuses on the HIDTA program, let \nme list again what the Montana Board of Crime Control has told me would \nhappen to Montana if the President's fiscal year 2006 budget is \nenacted:\n  1. Montana will lose its multi-jurisdiction drug enforcement \ncapacity, including seven multijurisdictional drug task forces. This \nmeans that already stretched local law enforcement agencies will have \nto do what they can to address drug enforcement at the local level, \nwithout broader support from the drug task forces.\n  2. Montana will lose 33 drug enforcement offices throughout the \nState.\n  3. Montana will experience a significant increase in drug \navailability, manufacturing and trafficking and drug-related crime.\n  4. Montana would experience an increase in clandestine labs that \nmanufacture methamphetamine.\n  5. Montana would experience a reduction in the amounts of illegal \ndrugs and guns removed from our communities.\n\n[[Page S2949]]\n\n  6. Montana would experience the elimination of funds for rural law \nenforcement agencies' manpower, equipment and training.\n  Again, the above scenario is only the tip of the iceberg. The \nmanufacturing, trafficking, drug addiction and crime will have a ripple \neffect throughout the State in our public health and correction systems \nand the courts, negatively affecting public safety and the quality of \nlife in Montana and across the United States.\n  As the findings in the Baucus-Grassley amendment explain, the HIDTA \nprogram encompasses 28 strategic regions, 355 task forces, 53 \nintelligence centers, 4,428 Federal personnel, and 8,459 State and \nlocal personnel. In 2004, HIDTA efforts resulted in disrupting or \ndismantling over 509 international, 711 multi-State, and 1,110 local \ndrug trafficking organizations. In 2004, HIDTA instructors trained \n21,893 students in cutting-edge practices to limit drug trafficking and \nmanufacturing within their areas.\n  The HIDTAs are successful drug enforcement coalitions that include \nequal partnership among Federal, State, and local law enforcement \nleaders. This is what Congress created the HIDTA's to do--to provide \ncoordination of drug enforcement efforts in critical regions of the \ncountry. That's why full funding for the HIDTA's is so important, and \nthat's what the first part of the Baucus-Grassley sense of the Senate \naddresses--assuming that Congress will fully fund the HIDTA program at \nfiscal year 2005 levels.\n  The second part of the Baucus-Grassley Sense of the Senate on HIDTA \nwould address the administration's decision to shift the HIDTA program \nfrom ONDCP to the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force, OCDETF, \nprogram within the Department of Justice. Moving the program from ONDCP \nto OCDETF is a mistake. The OCDETF program has a different mission and \npurpose than ONDCP and the HIDTA's. The HIDTA program has worked well \nat ONDCP and is a complement to the OCDETF mission. I do not understand \nwhy the Administration would want to shift it from its Congressionally \nauthorized home within ONDCP.\n  Montana law enforcement tell me that moving the HIDTA program to \nOCDETF will do nothing to improve law enforcement capabilities and will \nundermine the unique partnerships and innovation that the HIDTA program \nhas helped to create nationwide and that have been so successful in \ncurbing the spread of meth in Montana. HIDTA's are about coordination \nand collaboration. OCDETF is more centrally managed, with an assumed \nFederal lead, and with a focus on investigation and prosecution--an \nimportant mission, but not the same as the HIDTA mission. Additionally, \naccording to the National Narcotics Officers Association, the vast \nmajority of OCDETF's cases originate within HIDTA funded operational \ntask forces. The current organization works; why change it?\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment. I also hope \nthat we can adopt one of the many amendments that would actually \nincrease funding for all Justice assistance programs, like Byrne and \nCOPS, but this amendment is an important step in the right direction.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 193\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it had been my intent to offer an amendment \nNo. 193, to S. Con. Res. 18, the FY 06, Congressional Budget \nResolution, to fully fund the Help America Vote Act, HAVA, P.L. 107-\n252, by increasing discretionary spending in FY 06 by $822 million. \nThis issue is too important, however, to be relegated to 30 seconds, or \nless, of debate, and so under the circumstances, I will not offer this \namendment to fully fund HAVA today.\n  However, I want to serve notice to my colleagues, that Congress must \nact soon to provide funds to the States to finance the mandatory \nelection reform requirements we imposed on the States in HAVA. If not, \nwe will have created an unjustified and unfunded mandate on State and \nlocal governments and lost the opportunity to ensure that every \neligible American voter has an equal opportunity to cast a vote and \nhave that vote counted in the 2006 Federal elections.\n  The amendment was supported by a broad coalition of organizations \nrepresenting the civil rights communities, voting rights groups, \ndisabilities groups, and State and local governments, spearheaded by \nthe Leadership Conference on Civil Rights and the National Association \nof Secretaries of State. I am grateful to LCCR and NASS for their \nconsistent leadership in ensuring that Congress, and the President, \nfulfill our commitment to fully fund the HAVA reforms. I applaud the \nnon-partisan work of the LCCR/NASS Coalition and look forward to \ncontinuing to work with them to see this commitment come to fruition.\n  No civil right is more fundamental to the vitality and endurance of a \ndemocracy of the people, by the people, and for the people, than the \npeople's right to vote. In the words of Thomas Paine, ``The right of \nvoting for representatives is the primary right by which other rights \nare protected.'' To ensure this right, Congress passed the bipartisan \nHelp America Vote Act. At a time when we are spending millions of \ndollars to ensure the spread of democracy across the globe, we must \nalso remember that building democracy and freedom for every American \nmust begin at home. Ensuring that primary right to vote for all \neligible American voters was the bipartisan goal of HAVA.\n  Nearly two and one-half years ago, the Senate overwhelmingly passed \nthis bipartisan landmark legislation and on October 29, 2002, President \nBush signed HAVA into law. At the White House signing ceremony, \nsurrounded by a bipartisan group of Members, President Bush said in a \nbrief speech, ``When problems arise in the administration of elections, \nwe have a responsibility to fix them . . . Every registered voter \ndeserves to have confidence that the system is fair and elections are \nhonest, that every vote is recorded and that the rules are consistently \napplied. The legislation I sign today will add to the nation's \nconfidence.''\n  I could not agree more with the President. However, for the second \nyear in a row, while the President's budget assumes millions in funding \nfor democratic elections in foreign countries, the President's budget \nassumes no funding for elections at home. Our shared bipartisan vision \nfor HAVA as the vehicle to restore the nation's confidence in the \nresults of our elections cannot be realized without the promised \nfunding to the States.\n  In the aftermath of historic elections in Iraq, it is critical that \nAmerica take stock of our own decentralized elections systems. There is \nmuch we can learn from the Iraqi experiment in democracy that can \nstrengthen the equal opportunity for participation of all Americans in \nour democracy. In light of the continuing barriers that Americans found \nat polling places across this Nation in November 2004, we cannot fail \nto fully fund HAVA. America's ability to promote free societies abroad \nis inextricably linked to our ability to promote, expand and secure \nFederal elections at home.\n  HAVA has been acknowledged as the ``first civil rights law of the \n21st century.'' For the first time in our Nation's history, Congress \nacknowledged the responsibility of the Federal government to provide \nleadership and funding to States and local governments in the \nadministration of Federal elections. Congress required States to \nconduct Federal elections according to minimum Federal requirements for \nprovisional balloting, voting system standards, and statewide voter \nregistration lists, including new requirements to prevent voter fraud. \nFinally, Congress refused to impose an unfunded mandate on States by \nauthorizing nearly $4 billion in payments to States over three fiscal \nyears to implement the HAVA requirements and disability access \nservices.\n  To date, Congress has appropriated over $3 billion for these purposes \nand States are currently in varying stages of implementing HAVA \nrequirements to meet the pending 2006 effective date. But Congress has \nfailed to fully fund HAVA and as a consequence, there remains a $822 \nmillion shortfall in Federal funds. In addition to the $600 million \nauthorized in FY 05, but not appropriated, Congress has underfunded \nHAVA by an additional $222 million for a total of $822 million.\n  To remedy this, the amendment I intended to offer would have \nincreased function 800 by $727 million in BA in FY 06 for election \nreform requirements\n\n[[Page S2950]]\n\npayments to the States, and increased function 500 by $95 million in BA \nin FY 06 to fund election reform disability access payments to the \nStates. The amendment was fully offset by adjusting the reconciliation \nsavings assigned to the Finance Committee in order to allow for the \nclosing of corporate tax loopholes and provided additional deficit \nreduction in an equivalent amount in the amount of $822 million.\n  The absence of these funds will at best impede, or at worst stop, \nstatewide election reforms for the 2006 Congressional elections, the \n2008 Presidential elections, and beyond. According to a letter issued \nby the LCCR/NASS Coalition in support of my amendment, State and local \ngovernments cannot enact the requirement reforms on time without full \nFederal funding. The coalition letter states, in pertinent part: \n``Without full federal funding, state and local governments will \nencounter serious fiscal shortfalls and will not be able to afford \ncomplete implementation of important HAVA mandates.''\n\n  Similarly, the National Association of Counties, NACO, in a letter \ndated March 17, 2005, noted that a recent NACO report ``demonstrates \nthat the funds counties have received so far for implementation of the \nHelp America Vote Act are clearly insufficient.'' The letter goes on to \nconclude that HAVA has ``clearly become an unfunded mandate on the \nnation's counties.''\n  Some have expressed concerns that States do not need additional \nFederal funding, nor should Congress appropriate additional funding, \nbecause States still have millions in unspent HAVA funding. This \nargument is contrary to both the law and the facts. As a matter of law, \nHAVA does not require States to spend Federal funding by a date-certain \nwithin any fiscal year. To the contrary, HAVA merely requires States to \ncomply with specific Federal requirements by certain effective date \ndeadlines, depending upon the timing of the first Federal election in \nthat State. Since the time, place and manner of Federal elections may \ndiffer from state to state, HAVA accommodates the diversity of state \ncircumstances by ensuring that States could retain Federal funding \nwithout making premature obligations or expenditures and without \nthreats of a Federal recoupment of such funds.\n  Similarly, HAVA did not mandate a ``one-size'' fits all approach to \nhow States will implement the HAVA requirements or other election \nreforms. As a result, HAVA contains a savings clause requiring that \nFederal funds remain available until expended pursuant to 42 USC 15462. \nAs a matter of fact, while some States have unspent HAVA dollars today, \nit is also a fact that all States are in varying degrees of compliance \nwith HAVA, including enacting state implementing legislation, \nestablishing certain processes such as administrative complaints \nprocedures, contacting or obligating funds for new or retro-fitted \nvoting systems, or otherwise enhancing any number of election-related \nprograms and procedures to improve state-based election administration. \nAt this time, there does not appear to be any State that is fully \ncompliant with HAVA and that also has a significant surplus of funds.\n  Moreover, the most important requirements in the Act do not have to \nbe implemented by the States until the first Federal elections on or \nafter January 1, 2006. Also, because of the delay in the issuance of \nthe voluntary voting system standards by the Election Assistance \nCommission, some States have delayed purchases of voting systems and \ntechnology until that guidance is issued. Consequently, such States \nhave unexpended funds.\n  However, that does not lessen the critical need for full funding in \nfiscal year 2006. Although the FY 06 funds will not be available to the \nStates until October 1, 2005, just 3 months before some States must \nhave these requirements in place, States will be able to issue \ncontracts, obligate funds for programs, and otherwise fully implement \nreal election reforms if Congress signals its intent to provide these \nnecessary funds.\n  After the concerns raised by the November 2000 general election, \nCongress made a commitment to the States, and to the voters of this \nNation, that we would be a full partner in the conduct of Federal \nelections. While Congress accomplished much with the passage of HAVA, 4 \nyears later in the November 2004 general election, voters faced many of \nthe same barriers in different forms and new barriers to voting that \nHAVA promised to remove. After the 2000 November elections, Americans \nrecognized that real election reform changes must be made to ensure the \nintegrity and security of our democracy. We can do better and we must \ndo better. Full Federal funding is critical to ensuring that America \nwill do better.\n  HAVA began a new era in election law--one where the Federal \nGovernment is a supporting partner to help State and local governments, \nin conjunction with civil rights, voting rights and disability rights \norganizations, to conduct fair, free and transparent elections in our \nNation. HAVA is our collective promise to the American people to fix \nthe problems in our Federal elections.\n  If we fail to honor our commitment now and provide the States with \nonly partial funding, we may jeopardize the opportunity of the States \nto implement the most historic and comprehensive election reforms in \nAmerican history and may ensure that the public's confidence was \nmisplaced in Congress. Full Federal funding is critical to ensuring the \nintegrity and security of Federal elections and the confidence of the \nAmerican people in the final results of those elections.\n  It is time to fulfill that promise and we must do so yet this year.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter issued by the coalition of \norganizations spearheaded by the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights \nand the National Association of Secretaries of State dated March 8, \n2005 and a letter issued by the National Association of Counties, dated \nMarch 17, 2005, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Make Election Reform a Reality; Fully Fund the ``Help America Vote \n                                 Act''\n\n       Dear Senators: We, the undersigned organizations, urge you \n     to support full funding for the Help America Vote Act of 2002 \n     (HAVA) and include $822 million in the upcoming FY06 Senate \n     Budget Resolution. This figure represents the authorized HAVA \n     funds that remain unappropriated.\n       HAVA, which passed with overwhelming bipartisan support, \n     includes an important list of reforms that states must \n     implement for federal elections. State and local governments \n     have been working on such reforms as improving disability \n     access to polling places, updating voting equipment, \n     implementing new provisional balloting procedures, developing \n     and implementing a new statewide voter registration database \n     system, training poll workers and educating voters on new \n     procedures and new equipment.\n       To help state and local governments pay for these reforms, \n     HAVA authorized $3.9 billion over three fiscal years. To \n     date, Congress has generously appropriated $3 billion between \n     FY03 and FY04. Unfortunately, while HAVA authorized funding \n     for states for FY05, none was appropriated. The states and \n     localities need the remaining authorized funding to implement \n     the requirements of HAVA, and the federal EAC needs to be \n     fully funded to carry out its responsibilities as well.\n       States and localities are laboring to implement the \n     requirements of HAVA based on a federal commitment that HAVA \n     would not be an unfunded mandate. State officials have \n     incorporated the federal amounts Congress promised when \n     developing their HAVA implementation budgets and plans. \n     Without full federal funding, state and local governments \n     will encounter serious fiscal shortfalls and will not be able \n     to afford complete implementation of important HAVA mandates. \n     According to a state survey, lack of federal funding for HAVA \n     implementation will result in many states scaling back on \n     their voter and poll worker education initiatives and on \n     voting equipment purchase plans, both of which are vital \n     components to making every vote count in America.\n       We are thankful that you have seen the importance of \n     funding the work of the Election Assistance Commission in \n     FY06. States, localities and civic organizations look forward \n     to the work products from the EAC that will aid in the \n     implementation of HAVA, e.g., voting system standards, \n     statewide database guidance, and studies on provisional \n     voting, voter education, poll worker training, and voter \n     fraud and voter intimidation.\n       We thank you for your support of funding for the Help \n     America Vote Act, and we look forward to working with you on \n     this critical issue.

Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Bob Ney,\n     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Christopher Dodd,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Steny Hoyer,\n     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators McConnell and Dodd and Representatives Ney \n     and Hoyer: On behalf of county officials across the nation, I \n     would like to reiterate our appreciation for your efforts on \n     behalf of counties in the development of the Help America \n     Vote Act of 2001. As you remember, NACo and other \n     organizations representing state and local government \n     officials supported the Help America Vote Act based on an \n     assumption that the federal government would meet numerous \n     deadlines set forth in the legislation and would provide the \n     full authorized level of funding. Thanks to your leadership, \n     sufficient funding was provided in fiscal years 2003 and \n     2004. However, no funds were provided for FY 2005 and total \n     funding for the Help America Vote Act remains more than $800 \n     million short of the authorized amount.\n       Attached is an excerpt from a recent report of the National \n     Association of Counties that demonstrates that the funds \n     counties have received so far for implementation of the Help \n     America Vote Act are clearly insufficient. This excerpt, from \n     a recent snapshot survey conducted by the National \n     Association of Counties on the costs that counties have \n     identified for compliance with unfunded federal mandates, \n     shows that the Help America Vote Act has clearly become an \n     unfunded mandate on the nation's counties.\n       This funding shortfall is a particular burden for counties \n     because the federal government did not live up to its \n     commitment to issue federal voting systems standards by \n     January 1, 2004. These standards are not expected until later \n     this year; the delay is creating uncertainty surrounding \n     compliance with HAVA and is driving up costs for many \n     counties. We look forward to working with you and your staff \n     to secure additional funding and assist counties in meeting \n     the deadlines in the Help America Vote Act.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Larry Naake,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n           Excerpt From Unfunded Mandates: A Snapshot Survey\n\n       A report issued in March 2005 by the National Association \n     of Counties based on a snapshot survey conducted during a \n     two-week period from January 26 through February 11, 2005. \n     The full report provides a snapshot of the continuing \n     unfunded mandates burden facing counties on the tenth \n     anniversary of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act.\n\n\n                         help america vote act\n\n       The Help America Vote Act requires most counties in the \n     nation to purchase new voting equipment that permits all \n     voters to cast a secret ballot regardless of disability. The \n     accelerated timetable nationwide and lack of federal \n     standards are driving up the cost for counties to purchase \n     equipment. In addition, counties are working in cooperation \n     with the states to merge existing voter registration \n     databases into a statewide list and to implement new voting \n     procedures, such as provisional ballots.\n       Thirty six provided information on their costs related to \n     the Help America Vote Act.

Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today and join \nSenator Baucus and our colleagues in offering this Sense of the Senate \nresolution calling for full funding of the High Intensity Drug \nTrafficking Areas program.\n  In all areas the President proposes and Congress disposes, and the \nbudget is no different. While I support the President's efforts to \ncontrol Federal spending to address the budget deficit, I have concerns \nabout how some of his proposals would affect law enforcement efforts to \nidentify, arrest, and prosecute drug trafficking organizations selling \ntheir poison to our kids and grand kids. I think it is critically \nimportant that we not hinder their ability to protect citizens, \nespecially from the dangers of drugs.\n  In particular, the proposal to transfer to the Department of Justice \nand reduce the funding for the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas \nprogram--also known as the HIDTA program--would have a major impact on \ndrug enforcement efforts. With the continued growth of meth in Iowa and \nthroughout the Midwest, we cannot afford to reduce programs designed to \nincrease cooperation and coordination. Just as modem technology allows \nour businesses and our citizens to freely move around the country, the \ncriminal element within the United States can take advantages of these \nsame opportunities. That's why it is essential that they be able to \nwork together, across jurisdictions, so that our laws against drug \ntrafficking can be effectively enforced.\n  Congress provided the Office of National Drug Control Policy with the \nresponsibility for the management--and effectiveness--of the High \nIntensity Drug Trafficking Areas program. For a relatively modest \ninvestment, Federal, State, and local law enforcement have tremendously \nbenefitted from the increased information sharing and improved \ncoordination that HIDTAs create. The task forces created through the \nHIDTA program can serve as models for initiatives against terrorism, \nmoney laundering, and other modem threats to civil society.\n  This amendment is consistent with the views expressed by the Budget \nCommittee. It is consistent with the views expressed in the legislation \nintroduced last year to reauthorize the Office of National Drug Control \nPolicy.\n  I hope that all of our colleagues will join us in supporting this \namendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 197\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator Allen in \nurging the Senate to adopt budget language reinforcing our Nation's \ncommitment to vital aeronautics research. For decades, the National \nAeronautics and Space Administration has conducted a wide array of \naeronautics research programs that have helped ensure our economic and \nmilitary security and revolutionize the way we travel. NASA's work in \naeronautics has captured the spirit of the Wright Brothers, spawning \ngeneration after generation of progress. The amendment before us, which \nI am cosponsoring, will help make certain that progress continues for \nmany years to come.\n  Members of this body, including me, will fly to their home states \nlater today or tomorrow when we have completed the budget, and when we \ndo, we will benefit from countless innovations first developed in NASA \naeronautics programs over the years--efficient jet engines, safe and \nsecure air traffic control networks, advanced de-icing technologies, \nand so on.\n  The impact of NASA's work is indeed widespread. The U.S. aviation \nindustry supports over 11 million jobs and contributes $1 trillion in \neconomic activity. Our airlines carry 750 million passengers per year, \nwith that number expected to grow to a billion within 15 years. We ship \n52 percent of our exports by air, and in fact, the aviation industry \ncontributes more to the U.S. balance of trade than any other domestic \nmanufacturing industry.\n  Today we are at grave risk of losing the staff, facilities, and \nexpertise necessary to continue the long history of NASA's aeronautics \nresearch programs. We are at risk of essentially allowing the first \n``A'' in NASA--the one that stands for aeronautics--to die over the \nnext several years. What a tragedy that would be for the traveling \npublic, for our aviation industries, for our military, and really for \nour entire economy.\n  The budget we have before us does not contain specific references to \naeronautics funding. Nonetheless, we know of NASA's plans for \naeronautics from its fiscal year 2006 budget request. We know that the \nagency intends to reduce overall aeronautics funding by over 17 percent \nfrom fiscal year 2004, dropping another 12 percent by 2009. That is \nnearly one-third in just 5 years.\n  The cuts are even more severe within the ``vehicle systems'' \naccount--the portion of NASA's aeronautics program that focuses on \nmaking aircraft safer, faster, quieter, more fuel efficient, and \ndynamic. NASA has announced its intention to cut over 28 percent of its \nbudget in this area relative to fiscal year 2004, with plans to \neventually cut even deeper in the out years. What will the practical \nconsequences of these cuts be?\n  For starters, the cuts mean that all subsonic and hypersonic research \nwill be terminated. This is the research that focuses on designing \nstronger airframes and better turbine engines--technologies that with \njust a little work can be taken from the lab and applied directly to \nfunctional aircraft, whether commercial or military. As a result, \ndomestic aircraft and engine producers will lack the ability to draw on \na body of solid pre-competitive research, while competitors abroad \nbenefit from well financed efforts, such as the European Union's \n``Vision 2020'' aeronautics program. Ultimately, the consequence may be \nthe loss of our longstanding global leadership in civil aviation and \nall the economic benefits that flow from that leadership.\n  Second, many of the facilities necessary to design and test new \naeronautics technologies will likely be closed as a result of budget \nshortfalls. Wind tunnels and propulsion test facilities are used by \ngovernment, academia, and industry--often on a pay-for-use basis--and \nrequire minimal funding to maintain. A recent RAND National Defense \nResearch Institute determined that over 84 percent of these NASA \nfacilities serve strategic national needs, and concluded that the \nsuccess of the U.S. aerospace industry ``relies on our workforce and \ntest facility infrastructure . . . and will continue to need to predict \nairflow behavior over a range of designs.'' If we allow wind tunnels \nand propulsion labs to close, there will, in fact, be no way to serve \nthese needs.\n  So these proposed aeronautics cuts are a double threat to the U.S. \naviation industry: On the one hand, they get NASA out of the business \nof subsonic research, and on the other, they may well lead to the \nclosure of the very facilities industry and academia would need to \nreplace that research. There would, of course, be consequences for \ncross-cutting technologies used by the military and for the scores of \nAmericans employed in these areas. On balance, the overall long-term \nimpact would be devastating.\n  Instead of focusing on these subsonic and hypersonic aeronautics \nprogram areas, NASA intends to focus on ``barrier breaking'' flight \ndemonstrations. These are exciting projects that involve UAVs and \naircraft capable of quietly crossing the sound barrier, and they may \npay off 15, 20, or 25 years down the road. By then, however, it could \nbe too late for our aviation industry. The language offered by Senator \nAllen today addresses that fact head-on by restoring balance in NASA's \naeronautics programs.\n  We need to step back and re-evaluate where we are with aeronautics \nresearch, where we want to be in 5, 10, 15\n\n[[Page S2953]]\n\nyears, and make a commitment to do what it takes to get us there. A \nstudy specifically requested by Congress in the fiscal year 2004 \nomnibus appropriations bill mapping this course will be unveiled later \nthis month by the National Institute of Aerospace. Just yesterday, the \nHouse Science Committee held an important hearing on the direction of \naeronautics research.\n  There is movement on these issues, and we will have opportunities to \ndefine our goals as the year progresses. What Senator Allen is \nproposing to do is to say that we must keep all of our options open and \nour areas of expertise healthy until we are able to come to a \nconclusion between Congress, the administration, industry, academia, \nand really our Nation on what our direction will be. Senator Allen's \nlanguage, in essence, ensures that our debate on how to approach \naeronautics will not be over before it begins.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 220\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the Lieberman-Collins amendment No. 220 \nprovides $855 million to restore cuts to vital first responder programs \nin the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice, \nand for port security grants. The amendment provides an additional $565 \nmillion for programs that support our first responders, including State \nhomeland security formula grants, Urban Area Security Initiative \ngrants, FIRE Act grants, SAFER grants, Emergency Management Planning \nGrants, and the Metropolitan Medical Response System. It would restore \n$140 million for community policing and local law enforcement efforts \nunder the COPS and Byrne Grant programs. It would also provide $150 \nmillion for port security grants, ensuring at least the same amount of \nfunding for the Nation's ports as last year.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 217\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I submitted an amendment to the budget \nresolution with Senator Hatch, Senator Specter, Senator Biden, Senator \nDeWine, Senator Leahy, and Senator Baucus to restore funding for \njuvenile justice and local law enforcement programs closer to last \nyear's levels. Our amendment will increase funding for these programs \nfunded by the Department of Justice by $500 million. Specifically, this \nmoney will add $173 million to the Office of Juvenile Justice and \nDelinquency Prevention, OJJDP, budget, $200 million for the Byrne \nJustice Assistance Grant Program and the COPS program, and $127 million \nto the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, HIDTA, program. The \namendment accomplishes this by raising the functional total for the \njustice allocation by $500 million offset in function 920, which gives \nthe Appropriations Committee the flexibility to design the exact \noffsets.\n  Let me briefly illustrate why we must put money back into these \nprograms. Following the administration's lead, the Senate Budget \nCommittee allocated $187 million to the OJJDP budget, which is about \n$173 million less than what we appropriated last year. I am \nparticularly disturbed that the Senate budget resolution assumes \ncomplete elimination of the Juvenile Accountability Block Grant \nprogram, JABG, which received $55 million last year. JABG provides \nfunding for intervention programs that address the urgent needs of \njuveniles who have had run-ins with the law.\n  The Budget Committee seems to feel that the JABG program is \nineffective. An example from my home State of Wisconsin proves \notherwise. Using Federal dollars from the JABG program, the Southern \nOaks Girls School, a juvenile detention center outside of Racine, WI, \nbuilt a new mental health wing to provide much-needed counseling \nservices for the girl inmates. The administrator of this school cites a \n56 drop in violent behavior since the new mental services have been \noffered. This is just one example of JABG's many successes, a record \nthat supports keeping JABG alive and well-funded.\n  The same is true of title V Local Delinquency Prevention Program, the \nonly Federal program solely dedicated to juvenile crime prevention. The \nSenate budget assumes a $50 million cut to title V, penny pinching now \nthat will cost us dearly in the future. According to many experts in \nthe field, every dollar spent on prevention saves three or four dollars \nin costs attributable to juvenile crime. And who can put a dollar value \non the hundreds, even thousands of young lives turned from crime and \ninto productive work and community life by the juvenile crime \nprevention programs supported by title V?\n  Following the President's lead, the Senate Budget Committee also \ndrastically cuts the programs most important to state and local law \nenforcement. Congress appropriated a little more than $700 million last \nyear in both discretionary and formula funds for the Byrne Justice \nAssistance Grant program. The budget before us assumes no funding for \nthis program at all. Byrne grants pay for State and local drug task \nforces, community crime prevention programs, substance abuse treatment \nprograms, prosecution initiatives, and many other local crime control \nprograms.\n  Talk to any police chief or sheriff back in Wisconsin and they will \ntell you that the Byrne program is the backbone of Federal aid for \nlocal law enforcement. Do we really want to walk away from a program \nwith more than 30 years of success supporting our local police chiefs, \nsheriffs, and district attorneys?\n  The COPS program is another victim of this budget. The budget assumes \n$118 million for the COPS program. That is down from $388 million last \nyear. What is worse is that, within the COPS program, popular \ninitiatives like the COPS Universal Hiring Program and the COPS \nTechnology Grants Program are zeroed out entirely. We should remember \nthat just 3 years ago, the overall COPS program received more than a \nbillion dollars. Of that amount, $330,000,000 was for the hiring \nprogram that helped provide police officers for towns in Wisconsin like \nAshland and Onalaska. Another $154,000,000 was for the COPS technology \nprogram that helped fund critical communications upgrades in cities, \nlike Milwaukee and Madison and many other cities, not only in \nWisconsin, but across the Nation.\n  Almost 3 years ago, I asked Attorney General Ashcroft him why the \nCOPS program was being cut. He answered that that the COPS program was \na ``good thing'', that it ``worked very well'' and that it had been one \nof the ``most successful programs'' we have ever had. I call on the \nSenate to heed our former Attorney General's words and restore funding \nfor COPS in our budget.\n  Finally, The Senate budget assumes cuts in the High Intensity Drug \nTrafficking Areas, HIDTA program from $227 top $100 million. The HIDTA \nprogram is a vital collaboration between Federal, State and local law \nenforcement to combat drug trafficking through intelligence-gathering \nand cooperation. This proposed cut in the overall HIDTA program \nthreatens the future of smaller HIDTAs like the one in Milwaukee, a \nprogram that has been extremely successful in stemming crime.\n  The downward spiral of juvenile justice and local law enforcement \nfunding is a disturbing budget trend with ugly real world implications. \nAs a result of the Byrne, COPS, JABG, HIDTA and title V programs, we \nhave enjoyed steadily decreasing crime rates for the past decade. But, \nif we do not, at a minimum, maintain funding for crime fighting, we \ncannot be surprised if crime again infests our cities, communities, and \nneighborhoods.\n  The budget assumes more than $1.2 billion will be cut from what it \nwould take to fully fund OJJDP, the Byrne Grant Program, COPS, and \nHIDTA at last year's level adjusted for inflation. We restore $500 \nmillion of that, not enough to make these important crime fighting \nprograms whole, but enough to keep them functioning and working to keep \nour communities and families safe. Though some of us would prefer an \neven higher increase, my amendment represents a step in the right \ndirection. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 214\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the Snowe-\nWyden amendment. I am proud to cosponsor this amendment to allow the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate for the lowest \nprescription drug prices in Medicare.\n  Americans pay the highest drug prices in the world. Americans pay, on \naverage, two-thirds more than the Canadians, 80 percent more than the \nGermans, and 60 percent more than the\n\n[[Page S2954]]\n\nBritish. While drug companies argue that they need high prices in \nAmerica in order to fund research and development for new drugs, drug \ncompanies spend more on marketing, advertising, and administration than \nthey spend on research.\n  Our seniors deserve a Medicare prescription drug benefit that gets \nthe best prices for their medication. But the Medicare prescription \ndrug law actually prohibits the Federal Government from negotiating \nwith drug companies for lower prices. This is a missed opportunity and \na waste of taxpayers' dollars.\n  In light of the growing concerns over the rising cost of this \nbenefit--$57 billion more than originally expected--every effort should \nbe made to save our seniors and taxpayers dollars.\n  This amendment requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \nuse the tremendous purchasing power of the 41 million Medicare \nbeneficiaries to assist the private drug plans in getting the lowest \nprice for seniors. The savings provided by this amendment would go to \npay for deficit reduction.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense effort to lower \nprescription drug prices and reduce the deficit.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 172\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the Harkin \namendment. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this amendment, which \npreserves funding for Perkins career and technical education for the \nnext 5 years. While the Administration has determined that Perkins is \nineffective, I rise today to defend Perkins and highlight its proven \neffectiveness in my home State of Wisconsin.\n  Perkins provides over $24 million in education and job training to \nWisconsin students. These funds are allocated between the Wisconsin \nTechnical College System and the Wisconsin Department of Public \nInstruction.\n  Over the past 5 years, 97 percent of Wisconsin's high schools have \nparticipated in the federally funded Perkins career and technical \neducation programs. This includes over 98 percent of 11th and 12th \ngrade students, as well as secondary special students in the State. As \nthe result of this investment in career and technical programs, 96 \npercent of Wisconsin students completing high school career and \ntechnical education programs graduate, compared to the State's overall \ngraduation rate of 91 percent.\n  The Wisconsin Technica1 College System and its 16-member colleges \nreceive $13 million in Perkins funding to reach 25,000 students \nstatewide. Students who qualify for Perkins-funded services are those \nmost in need of assistance to ensure their future success in the \nworkforce. Many are academically and economically disadvantaged. Some \nhave disabilities, are single parents or have limited English \nproficiency. These students are provided counseling, disability support \nservices, services related to increasing students enrolled in non-\ntraditional occupations, remedial instruction, and transition services \nthat help students successfully move from K-12 education to technical \ncolleges and from technical colleges to the workforce.\n  Our technical colleges have demonstrated success helping their \nstudents meet these unique challenges. Six months after graduation, 91 \npercent of graduates are employed with an annual median salary of over \n$30,000. Five years after graduation, 97 percent are employed making \nnearly $36,000 a year. These graduates positively contribute to their \ncommunities and meet the needs of local businesses.\n  The loss of Perkins funding would significantly weaken our Nation's \neducational quality and economic competitiveness. This amendment is \nfully offset and provides deficit reduction. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport Senator Harkin's amendment to ensure that students in Wisconsin \nand elsewhere continue to benefit from Perkins to compete in the 21st \ncentury economy.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I was pleased to join with my colleague \nSenator Chafee in sponsoring a sense of the Senate resolution which \nsought to restore the Clean Water State Revolving Funds to the fiscal \nyear 2004 enacted level of $1.35 billion.\n  For the past 2 years, Senators Crapo, Jeffords, and I, along with \nother Members of this body, have offered successful amendments to the \nbudget resolution on the Senate floor seeking to boost funding for this \nprogram from $1.35 billion to $3.2 billion.\n  Unfortunately, these amendments were not accepted by the conference \ncommittee for fiscal year 2004, and there was no budget resolution in \nfiscal year 2005.\n  There is a tremendous need for increased funding for wastewater \ntreatment infrastructure improvements throughout the country. As we \nunderscore in this resolution, in 2002 the Congressional Budget Office \nestimated a spending gap for clean water needs between $132 billion and \n$388 billion over 20 years. This year we are proposing a very modest \namendment simply to hold the line.\n  All States will be affected by the President's proposed cut in \nspending, a cut of 33 percent from the fiscal year 2005 enacted funding \nand a cut of 46 percent from the 2004 enacted level.\n  This cut will have a devastating impact on the ability of States and \ncommunities to continue upgrading their wastewater infrastructure and \nto meet the requirements of the Clean Water Act.\n  This request to restore the funding has broad bipartisan support: 41 \nSenators joined me in a letter seeking this restoration.\n  Americans overwhelmingly believe that clean and safe water should be \na national issue and a national priority. Protecting our Nation's water \nis an essential Federal role, not just a State and local \nresponsibility.\n  In a recent poll, nearly three-quarters of Americans agreed that \n``clean and safe water is a national issue that requires dedicated \nnational funding.'' More than two-thirds think Federal spending to \nensure clean and safe water is more important than tax cuts. Across the \nNation, our wastewater systems are aging. Some systems currently in use \nwere built more than a century ago and have outlived their useful life.\n  Many communities cannot meet water-quality goals with their current \nsystems. The American Society of Civil Engineers recently released its \n2005 Report Card for America's Infrastructure and gave Wastewater \nsystems a D minus, down from a D 2 years ago.\n  Obviously, I would like to see a significant increase in these clean \nwater State revolving funds, which have been a highly effective means \nfor improving wastewater treatment for communities across the Nation. \nHowever, at a minimum, I urge a simple restoration of the funding to \nthe 2004 enacted level.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, my colleague, Senator Enzi, and I filed \nour amendment dealing with the defined benefit plan reform proposals in \nthis budget. The amendment provides the necessary flexibility with \nrespect to revenues and outlay savings between our two committees.\n  Unfortunately, a last-minute objection from staff on the other side \nsidetracked our amendment. We will pursue this amendment in the \nconference on the resolution.\n\n\n                            vote explanation\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, yesterday I inadvertently missed a vote on \nan amendment to increase funding for AMTRAK by $1.4 billion. The \namendment would have been paid for by closing corporate tax loopholes. \nIf I were present I would have voted yea.\n  AMTRAK is important to Arkansas. By shifting the AMTRAK funding \nburden to States we are doing a real disservice to those people in \nrural America who rely on rail service. And without adequate \nassistance, I fear we will witness a rapid decrease in Amtrak's \nperformance and infrastructure, and the end of rail service for my \nState.\n  I think it should be a goal of AMTRAK to achieve economic viability \nand I am open to discussions on how best to achieve that goal. But in \nthis budget we should not ignore their funding needs or the needs of \nour rail passengers and State and local governments. I commend Senator \nRobert Byrd for this amendment and I regret having inadvertently missed \nthis vote.\n\n\n                            vote explanation\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, had I been present for vote number 66, \namendment No. 230 sponsored by Senator Coleman, to restore funding for \nCommunity Development Block Grants and other programs, I would have \nvoted in favor of the amendment.\n  Due to the rapid scheduling of amendments at this time, I was unable \nto be here for that vote. However, my\n\n[[Page S2955]]\n\nposition with respect to CDBG funding is crystal clear. In fact, I was \na cosponsor of the Sarbanes amendment to restore CDBG funding, which \nunfortunately failed on a 50-50 vote.\n  Although I preferred the offset in the Sarbanes amendment, I \nnonetheless would have voted for the Coleman amendment as well. CDBG \nprovides critical funds to many communities in my State. It is one of \nthe Federal Government's most effective neighborhood privatization \nprograms. I am please that the Coleman amendment passed this body \ntoday, and I will continue to work in the Senate to ensure that the \nPresident's proposed cuts are not enacted into law.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nthe Budget resolution before us.\n  Let's start with the revenue reconciliation instructions. We have \nalready seen many amendments to raise taxes and I am sure we will see \nmore. But there is another tax increase on the horizon. I am referring \nto the tax increase our constituents will feel in their pocketbooks and \nwallets if we fail to extend current tax law.\n  The so-called ``tax cuts'' the other side keeps referring to is \nreally nothing more than just keeping current tax law. There are over \n40 provisions that American families and employers have come to rely on \nthat will expire at the end of this year if we do nothing.\n  The $70 billion in reconciliation that this resolution calls for is \nneeded to prevent a massive tax increase. This is about provisions in \ncurrent law that are important to our constituents and to our economy. \nWe cannot afford to allow them to expire and therefore be raised.\n  Let's take a look at the items that the Finance Committee, which I \nserve on, will examine this year. There is the R tax credit. This is \nan important provision of the Tax Code that spurs innovation and new \ntechnologies and one that I and most others here support.\n  In fact, the bill introduced in the Senate in the last Congress to \nmake this provision permanent had 40 cosponsors, including 22 \nDemocrats. It will cost $7 billion to extend this provision alone for \nthe 5 years of this budget.\n  Then there is the deduction for tuition expenses that will cost $10 \nbillion to extend for 5 years. And we need to address the ability of \ntaxpayers to deduct their State sales taxes from their Federal taxes. \nThis will cost $2 billion for just 1 year.\n  We have a temporary, 1-year fix for the alternative minimum tax that \nwill cost $30 billion.\n  Other items that expire this year include: the work opportunity and \nwelfare-to-work tax credits, mental health parity, a provision \nregarding military pay and the earned income tax credit, a deduction \nfor teachers who buy classroom supplies, the wind energy tax credit, \noil and gas tax provisions, tax credit bonds for school renovations. I \ncould go on and on.\n  Again, over 40 provisions in total will expire this year. Let me be \nclear, these are not new tax proposals. This is simply current law. If \nwe do not extend these provisions we will cause a substantial increase \nin the tax bills of American families and businesses.\n  Our Finance Committee needs every cent of the $70 billion in the \nreconciliation instruction to make that happen. And that is even before \nwe turn our attention to the dividends and capital gains tax provisions \nthat have been important to our economy. I will push hard to extend \nthese through the end of the budget window.\n  The amendments we have seen the last few days also deal with \n``closing tax loopholes'' to get so-called ``corporate cheats''. I \nserve on the Senate Finance Committee and I can tell my colleagues that \nno one is more committed to closing tax loopholes than Chairman \nGrassley.\n  In fact, the last tax bill we passed, the Jobs bill, had tens of \nbillions of dollars in tax loophole closers. If any doubts that Chuck \nGrassley will take every opportunity to shut down tax cheats, then I \nsuggest they go talk to him and look at the record on this issue.\n  And for the record, it has been a Republican Congress and President \nthat has gone after these loopholes and tax cheats in the Finance \nCommittee.\n  In addition to the over 40 tax extenders I referred to, we also have \nother priorities, such as the tax title of the Energy bill and \ncharitable provisions in the Care Act. Charities do such important work \nin America and offer incredible compassion. They touch lives in ways \nthe Government never can.\n  And if we want to be energy independent and less dependent on foreign \nsources, then we need to encourage the development of energy \nalternatives for the cleaner burning of fuels, such as clean coal \ntechnologies.\n  So I hope we can avoid getting caught in the rhetoric that calls the \nreconciliation instruction ``unnecessary.'' It is absolutely necessary \nif we are to prevent a massive tax increase. And it is especially vital \nwhen our economy is showing real signs of continuing solid growth.\n  I also want to address some of the complaints that we have heard \nabout the horrible so-called ``cuts'' in Medicaid spending that the \npresident asked for and we assumed in this budget.\n  Medicaid spending is projected to grow $1.112 trillion in the next 5 \nyears. The president's plan would call for a spending increase of \n$1.098 trillion over 5 years.\n  Notice that I said a spending increase of more than $1 trillion. That \nworks out to an annual growth rate of 7.2 percent. On what planet is an \nincrease of 7.2 percent a year a cut? Let's get honest about the \ncomplaints we are hearing. What we are hearing are complaints that an \nincrease of 40 percent in 5 years is just too little. Think about that: \n40 percent.\n  All we are asking of the Medicaid program, as we hand them a more \nthan $1 trillion funding increase, is to cut out $14 billion in abuse \nand waste. I don't understand how anyone can say with a straight face \nthat it is impossible to save less than 2 percent of the budget of any \nprogram over a 5-year period. It absolutely can be done. We just need \nto have the will to do it.\n  We absolutely must get a handle on entitlement and mandatory spending \nbecause the numbers are alarming. By 2030 Medicare, Medicaid and Social \nSecurity spending alone will be 13 percent of GDP. Unless we reform \nentitlement spending, we simply cannot continue on our current path.\n  This budget is a first step, a very small first step, toward \nbeginning to address the entitlement spending that threatens to \noverburden our economy.\n  I support this budget before us. It recognizes the realities of our \nworld with the need to limit spending and extend current tax law to \ncreate jobs and keep America on the road to economic recovery. I \ncongratulate Chairman Gregg on crafting a strong budget and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the \nconcurrent budget resolution presently before the Senate.\n  I want to start by congratulating Senator Judd Gregg, the new \nchairman of the Budget Committee, along with the other members of that \ncommittee, for accomplishing the difficult task of putting together and \nreporting to the Senate a budget resolution that begins to address our \nspending and deficit challenges in a modest yet significant way.\n  As with many of my fellow Utahns, I am very concerned about the large \nand persistent deficits with which our Federal Government still \nwrestles. I continue to hear from constituents who seem discouraged \nthat the Government has not been able to find more success in bringing \nthe budget into balance, particularly after the several years of \nsurplus we enjoyed in the latter part of the last decade.\n  Many Utahns have written to me to express their concerns that this \ngeneration is leaving a huge and growing burden on our children and \ngrandchildren, one that perhaps will be too onerous for them to bear. \nAs a long-time advocate of fiscal responsibility in families and in \nGovernment, I understand and agree with these concerns. The deficit and \nthe mountain of public debt owed by the Federal Government do matter, \nand will make life harder for Americans in the future.\n  And so, those of us from Utah share a collective frustration that \nthis budget does not make more progress toward cutting the deficit.\n  As I examine the budget resolution, however, I am struck by the fact \nthat we, as a nation, are still facing turbulent conditions that seem \nto defy our\n\n[[Page S2956]]\n\nbest efforts to control our fiscal destiny. As we get farther and \nfarther from the monumental events of the early part of this decade \nthat have shaped our current landscape in so many ways, perhaps it is \nbecoming easier to think that things are slowly returning to normal in \nour country.\n  But we need to remember that this Nation is still at war, and we \nstill face tremendous challenges in protecting our homeland from \nfurther terrorist attacks. These needs are paramount and eclipse even \nthe importance of balancing the budget. This budget resolution reflects \nthese facts and provides for increases, although a relatively modest \n4.1 percent growth in defense and homeland security spending.\n  At the same time, the budget places a virtual freeze on the growth of \nthe remainder of discretionary spending accounts. This is in stark \ncontrast to recent years, where such spending has grown at a relatively \nhigh rate. I believe this nondefense/homeland security freeze is a very \nimportant feature of this budget. Even though this restraint is rather \nmodest, it is being met with a great deal of concern from many who had \nhoped to see more growth in the programs that fall under this category.\n  The budget also makes some small progress in bringing mandatory \nspending under control. Over the 5-year budget period provided by this \nresolution, this type of spending growth is cut by $32 billion. \nAlthough this is just a fraction of the growth in entitlement spending \nprojected over this period, it is significant that this budget \nrepresents the first attempt to cut mandatory spending growth since \n1997.\n  The results of these changes on the deficit are not dramatic, but \nthey are noteworthy. The President set a goal last year to cut the \ndeficit for fiscal year 2004, which was $521 billion, or 4.5 percent of \nGDP, in half within 5 years. The budget resolution before us projects \nthis goal being met in fiscal year 2008 with a deficit of $258 billion \nthat year, and falling to $208 billion by 2010. In relative terms, the \ndeficit is projected to be 1.8 percent of GDP by 2008 and just 1.3 \npercent by 2010. While still too large, these deficits are certainly \nmore manageable than those of recent years.\n  To meet these goals, the resolution provides some pretty tough \ndiscretionary spending caps for the next three fiscal years, and \nretains the pay-as-you-go rule from the fiscal year 2004 budget \nresolution.\n  Some of my colleagues are questioning the need for the budget to \nprovide for approximately $70 billion in tax relief over the next 5 \nyears. We need this money set aside to prevent tax increases that would \nbe damaging to our growing economy.\n  Specifically, two provisions that have shown to be very important to \nincreasing Federal revenue growth and helping the economy to recover \nare set to expire at the end of 2008. These are the reduced tax rates \nfor dividend income and capital gain income that were enacted as part \nof the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003.\n  If Congress allows these lower tax rates to expire, we would, in \neffect, be placing a significant tax increase on the economy. Capital \ngains rates would increase from a maximum of 15 percent to 20 percent, \nand the tax rate on dividends would leap from 15 percent to as high as \n35 percent.\n  There is no doubt that these tax rate reductions, combined with the \nother tax cuts we passed in 2001, 2002, and 2003 have contributed to \nthe recovery of the economy. After declining for 3 years, 2001-2003, \nFederal collections began increasing again in 2004, rising by 5.5 \npercent that year. For the current fiscal year, 2005, revenues are \nprojected to jump by an impressive 9.4 percent. Moreover, revenues are \nexpected to increase by an average of 6.4 percent each year until the \nend of the decade. This demonstrates to me the wisdom of our earlier \ndecisions to cut taxes to get the economy growing again.\n  Allowing tax rates to increase might seem to some to be a smart way \nto fight the deficit, but I believe these revenue trends illustrate \nthat such a move would be counterproductive and exactly the wrong thing \nto do. Therefore, it is very important that this budget include the \nreconciliation instructions that provide the opportunity for the \nFinance Committee to report the legislation that will prevent these tax \ncuts from expiring.\n  I look forward to working my colleagues on the Finance Committee in \ncrafting a bill to extend both the dividends and capital gains tax rate \nreductions, as well as extending other important tax provisions that \nexpire later this year.\n  While this budget resolution perhaps does not go as far as I would \nlike to see in reducing the deficit and addressing spending growth, it \nis probably as strong as we can make it. I also recognize that this \nresolution has to garner a majority of votes in both the Senate and the \nHouse for it to take effect. Each one of my colleagues also has his or \nher own ideas of what would be the best combination of spending \npriorities for this coming fiscal year. In the end, what counts is what \nwe can get a majority of us to agree upon the lowest common \ndenominator.\n  Given the circumstances, the balances achieved in the budget \nresolution may well be the best we can do. It is not perfect, but it is \na start, and it deserves our support.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, for the past few years I have been \nadvancing a concept that embodies fiscal responsibility, a concept \nthat--if enacted--would be a sure sign to hard-working Americans that \nthe Federal Government is serious about fiscal discipline.\n  Federal spending is at an all time high, now topping $20,000 per \nhousehold, and that does not include spending from state and local \ntaxes. This is the highest level of federal spending since World War \nII.\n  The Federal Government is now spending $2,292,000,000 per year on \ndiscretionary and mandatory spending, including Social Security.\n  Mr. President, $2.292 trillion is a lot of money. My Kansas \nconstituents often say: ``I don't mind paying my taxes, but make sure \nmy hard-earned money gets spent wisely.''\n  Does Federal spending need to be so high? We would all agree that the \nFederal Government has an essential role to play in various capacities, \nbut are taxpayers getting the most out of every dollar sent to \nWashington? Again, I ask, does the Federal Government really need \n$20,000 per American household in order to operate?\n  And what real safeguards do we have in place to ensure that these \n$2.292 trillion are being spent wisely?\n  I am proud to have been elected to serve my constituents on a \nplatform of reducing wasteful Federal spending and reforming \nGovernment. After 10 years though, I can testify that it takes a great \ndeal of effort to keep a positive attitude. Balancing the budget, \nreducing Federal spending and returning taxpayer dollars to the \nfamilies that earned them is hard work.\n  The reason for the difficulty in achieving success, in what would \nseem to be an obvious thing to do--reducing government waste and \nprioritizing spending--is that the specific interests trump the general \ninterest on Capitol Hill.\n  For instance, there is a general interest to discourage smoking, and \nwe spend many taxpayer dollars both to this end and on the treatment of \nlung cancer; however, taxpayer dollars are also still spent to \nsubsidize tobacco because there is such specific interest pressure to \nkeep tobacco subsidies alive.\n  The budget we are debating cuts the deficit in half in 5 years. I \nthink we should balance the budget in seven years, but to be effective, \nwe must work within the parameters of the system.\n  Systems matter, and to get solid reform accomplished you must have an \napproach that recognizes this reality. The problem with our current \nsystem--with the specific interest crowding out the general--is that it \nmakes reform very difficult. Former Senator Phil Gramm taught me this \ntruth in the Senate.\n  I believe that we need a new systematic approach to spending in \nCongress. This whole week, amendment after amendment has been offered \non the Senate floor; generally speaking, each one of these amendments \nhas the voice of a particular specific interest behind it. After all of \nthe specific interest issues are raised, I will be happy if we can just \ncut the deficit in half in five years.\n  We need to create another mechanism, which will allow for the general\n\n[[Page S2957]]\n\ninterest to overcome the specific. Therefore, I put forward a new \nsystematic approach.\n  Over the last few years, I have developed the Commission on the \nAccountability and Review of Federal Agencies, CARFA Act, which is a \nsystematic approach.\n  Last year, we had a bipartisan hearing on the measure, in which all \nwitnesses supported this new concept. In this year's version of the \nbill, we are incorporating some of the suggestions made at that \nhearing.\n  CARFA would take all of the Federal Government agencies and programs \nand put them under the review of a bipartisan commission--the members \nof which are appointed by both Congress and the White House.\n  The commission would review Federal agencies and programs, and \npresent draft legislation to the Congress to realign or eliminate \nduplicative, wasteful, outdated, and failed agencies and programs.\n  Each house of Congress would get one vote on the bill--up or down--\nwithout amendment.\n  For example, if the commission finds 563 programs that are \nduplicative, wasteful, or already have accomplished their purpose and \nrecommends their realignment or termination, then the Congress would \nvote--up or down--without amendment to realign or eliminate all of them \nor keep all of them. And you get only one vote--one vote in the House \nand one vote in the Senate--to send it forward to the President.\n  It is a systematic approach to address the specific interests \ndominating the debate in Washington.\n  The CARFA approach tries to get at the issue and create a systematic \napproach by giving the general interest a voice in the system. So now \nyou have these 563 or 284 programs, and people come up to me and say: \n``Well, what if you've got an agriculture program that has some benefit \nto Kansas, that you want to help and keep?''\n  Then, I look at the program and see that it does help Kansas, but I \nonly get one vote and there are all of these other programs that I \nreally do think need to be eliminated. And it makes the overall goal of \nbalancing the Federal budget more achievable.\n  I am pleased that, once again this year, the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee has seen the need for this measure and recognized how vitally \nimportant it is, as he has included a sense of the Senate calling for a \ncommission along the lines of CARFA.\n  It is my hope that we will be able to work with the leadership this \nyear and see the new CARFA systematic approach become a reality.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The amendment to strip development in ANWR from the \nbudget yesterday ignores the outlook for the global consumption of oil. \nI am pleased that the Senate took a proactive approach to our current \nenergy crisis, and voted to keep ANWR in the budget.\n  After listening at length to the statements of those opposed to \nresponsible development on Alaska's North Slope, I was struck by the \nlack of concern over the national security implications of our \ndependence on foreign oil.\n  The global outlook for oil consumption is sobering, and it validates \nour decision yesterday to increase our domestic production by opening \nANWR. One of the most serious areas of concern is the projected \nincrease in China's oil consumption, which is set to grow at staggering \nrates.\n  China's economy is doubling every 8 to 10 years. This level of growth \nis expected to continue for at least 25 years.\n  To do this, China will need access to an increasing supply of oil. \nMilton Copulos, the President of the National Defense Council \nFoundation, told our House colleagues yesterday that fueling this \neconomic growth will require ``so much oil . . . that the ability of \ncurrent suppliers to produce it may be stretched to the breaking \npoint.''\n  Jeffery Logan, Senior Energy Analyst and China Program Manager for \nthe International Energy Agency, testified that, the average Chinese \ncitizen consumed only one fourteenth of the oil consumed by the average \nAmerican in 2004, but Chinese consumption is poised to increase \nrapidly.\n  Mr. Logan noted that in late 2003 China surpassed Japan to become the \nworld's second largest petroleum consumer. He said:\n\n       In 2004, Chinese demand expanded nearly 16 percent to 6.83 \n     million barrels per day . . . [but] Domestic crude output in \n     China has grown only very slowly over the past five years . . \n     . Imports now account for 40 percent of Chinese oil demand.\n\n  To put this in perspective, Chinese oil consumption was responsible \nfor 40 percent of the growth in global oil demand over the past four \nyears. This trend will continue and China's consumption is projected to \nrise from 5.56 million barrels per day in 2003 to 12.8 million barrels \nin 2025.\n  Mr. Logan told the subcommittee that eventually China's ``import \ndependency'' will reach 75 percent stressing an already tenuous world \noil supply.\n  Milton Copulos explained the consequences of this increase in Chinese \nconsumption. He said:\n\n       Under the best circumstances, the competition for oil \n     generated by the explosive economic growth in Asia will serve \n     to put a tremendous upward pressure on prices, driving them \n     well above the current $50 plus per barrel average. OPEC \n     officials have said oil prices could rise to as much as $80 a \n     barrel and they may well be correct.\n       Under the worst circumstances, . . . the competition for \n     oil could lead to armed conflict--particularly with China.\n\n  I remember well the days of the 1970's oil embargo, and I agree with \nMr. Copulos that, ``America is heading head-long into a disaster. Today \nour situation is far worse in 1973.''\n  I also agree with his assessment that:\n\n       The simple truth is that America's energy endowment is more \n     than sufficient to provide for all of our needs, both today \n     and in the future. The only real shortfall that we have is a \n     shortfall of the political will to find innovative ways to \n     fully utilize the resources we are blessed with.\n\n  Mr. Copulos discussed several areas where having the political will \nto take action could help turn our situation around. As an Alaskan, I \nam proud that our state can play a key role in the solutions he \nproposed.\n  The reality that some people do not want to face is the world is \nchanging. China's economy is growing at a staggering pace, and without \nnew domestic production, our country will face unimaginable competition \nfor oil. ANWR is part of the solution to this looming crisis, and I am \npleased Congress has finally had the political will to face this \nchallenge and take proactive steps to prevent it.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this budget, like the President's budget, \nreflects the wrong priorities. This budget short changes public \nservices such as education and health care for all Americans in order \nto further cut taxes mainly for the wealthiest Americans. This budget \nresolution is starkly out of touch with the vast majority of working \nfamilies in Michigan and across the United States. The American people \ndeserve better.\n  To create the impression that the budget cuts the deficit in half \nover the next 5 years, it simply leaves out several major expenses. \nThese omissions include the cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, \nthe cost of the personnel added to the Army and Marines and the cost of \nreforming the alternative minimum tax. Leaving these costs out of the \nbudget paints an incomplete picture of the deepening Federal deficit \nand the damage being done to the Nation's fiscal outlook.\n  If the deficit continues to expand at its current rate, by 2015, each \nAmerican's share of the debt will be at least $30,000. The bigger the \ndeficit grows, the more likely it is that we will face rising long-term \ninterest rates and slower economic growth. This will make it more \nexpensive to buy a house, pay for college or pay off credit card debt. \nThis is an unfair burden to pass on to our children and grandchildren.\n  The President's tax cuts are a major cause of our Nation's swing from \na record budget surplus into an increasingly deep deficit ditch. Yet \nthis resolution seeks $71 billion in additional tax breaks most of \nwhich are for the wealthiest Americans. The cornerstone of these \nproposed tax cuts is the extension of the capital gains and dividend \ntax cuts. These tax cuts would overwhelmingly benefit the wealthiest \namong us.\n  Largely as a result of its reckless tax cuts, this budget would \nactually increase, rather than decrease, the deficit. But this budget \nresolution, such as the President's budget, attempts to conceal the \ndamage it is doing to the Nation's fiscal outlook by using 5-year \nprojections instead of the customary\n\n[[Page S2958]]\n\n10-year numbers. Hidden just beyond the 5-year budget window is the \nexploding cost of the tax cut proposals and its growing effect on the \ndeficit.\n  I am disappointed that the Senate did not adopt the Feingold-Chafee \namendment to reinstate pay-as-you-go rules that would require both \nentitlement spending increases and tax cuts to be fully paid for or \nface a 60-vote point of order in the Senate. The pay-as-you-go rule, \nlike the one which was successful in the 1990s, would have helped \nrestrain the deficit without unduly harming critical public services.\n  I am pleased that the Senate rejected severe cuts to the Medicaid \nProgram in a crucial vote earlier today. This is a victory for the 53 \nmillion children, pregnant women, elderly and disabled who rely on \nMedicaid to meet their health care needs. It is also a victory for the \npeople that make our health care delivery system work.\n  Still the budget plan which is before the Senate today fails to \naddress some of our Nation's most pressing problems, such as the loss \nof millions of manufacturing jobs, cuts in education funding, and \nenvironmental protection.\n  I am also saddened that the Senate rejected an amendment to continue \nto protect the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. We have a \nresponsibility to promote a balanced energy plan that invests in \nAmerica's future and protects our environment, not one that damages our \nprotected lands. Rather than drilling in our pristine wilderness, the \nUnited States should be investing in alternative sources of power, \nrenewable energy programs and fuel efficient automotive technology to \nimprove fuel economy without harming our environment.\n  This budget slashes funding for vital programs for working families \nin order to extend massive and fiscally irresponsible tax cuts that \nsignificantly lower the Nation's revenue and explode the deficit. These \nare the wrong priorities for America. I cannot support it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this budget does not adequately protect \nchildren. That is why I filed an amendment to help lift millions of \nchildren out of poverty. I will plan to offer this amendment at the \nnext appropriate time.\n  In the last 4 years, over 4 million of our fellow citizens have \nfallen into poverty. Nearly 36 million Americans live below the poverty \nline; 3 million more Americans live in hunger or on the verge of hunger \ntoday than in the year 2000.\n  Today, nearly 13 million children live in poverty in the United \nStates. It is shameful that in the richest and most powerful nation on \nEarth, nearly a fifth of all children go to bed hungry at night. \nPoverty is a moral issue, and we have a moral obligation to address it.\n  Current policies are failing, and it is time to take a stronger \nstand. We should set a national goal of reducing child poverty by 50 \npercent within a decade and to eliminate it entirely as soon as \npossible after that. To help meet this commitment, we should enact a \none percent surtax for income over $1 million. This surtax, paid by our \nwealthiest citizens, will raise $3.5 billion this year, and more in \nsubsequent years, to meet the needs of our most vulnerable citizens.\n  The amendment will create a child poverty elimination fund with a \nboard to oversee the fund, and design the child poverty elimination \nplan.\n  We know how to achieve this goal. All it requires is the will, and \nthe leadership, to do it. Prime Minister Tony Blair made a commitment \nto do so in Britain, and they have begun to reach the goal. Their \napproach is to support both parents and children. They have pledged to \nincrease employment opportunities, raise incomes for those who work, \nincrease support for those who cannot work, and improve public services \nfor children and families.\n  It is time for America to make a similar commitment, and give real \nhope, real opportunity and real fairness to children and families mired \nin poverty in communities in all parts of our country.\n  We cannot continue to look the other way while millions of our fellow \ncitizens work hard, play by the rules, and still cannot escape a \nlifetime in poverty.\n  Everywhere we look, the current budget is a nightmare for those who \nneed our help the most. It cuts the Women, Infants, and Children \nProgram, which provides health information and nutritious meals to low \nincome pregnant women and their children. It cuts food stamps. It cuts \nMedicaid. It cuts low-income housing. It cuts low-income education. \nThat is unacceptable. And yet the White House pretends it has an anti-\npoverty agenda. Nonsense. This budget is not antipoverty, it is anti-\npoor.\n  As the wealthiest country on Earth, we are blessed with great \nabundance. In the powerful words of the Gospel, ``To whom much is \ngiven, much is required.'' That should be our national commitment to \nevery American living in poverty today. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a program very \nimportant to the children and families of Hawaii, as well as those who \nreside in other parts of the United States, the 21st Century Community \nLearning Centers Program. This program provides funding through a \ncompetitive grant process to fund ``centers that provide extended \nlearning opportunities for students and related services to their \nfamilies.''\n  The afterschool hours, those from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m., are a venturesome \ntime for the youth of our country. Many school age children are \nunsupervised during these 3 risky hours. Many of them lack constructive \nactivities such as sports or other school or community sponsored \nprograms. Those who lack such activities become vulnerable to mischief \nor even danger whether they are the victim of a crime or the \nperpetrator. Whether they are considering the use of tobacco, alcohol \nor drugs, or doing a myriad of other activities detrimental to their \nwell-being, they would be better served in supervised afterschool \nactivities, the kind of activities supported by the 21st Century \nCommunity Learning Centers Program.\n  According to FightCrime, an organization of law enforcement \nprofessionals representing all 50 states, ``Being unsupervised after \nschool doubles the risk that 8th graders will smoke, drink alcohol or \nuse drugs.'' They also report a study in Hawaii which noted an 84-\npercent drop in criminal convictions among school-aged males involved \nin quality afterschool programs funded by the 21st Century Community \nLearning Centers Program.\n  Afterschool programs can provide a critical link to positive growth \nfor many of these students. The academic support and socialization \nprovided by them will help many at-risk youth. These programs can \nprovide that extra bit of help to enable children to succeed, in \nacademics, and in life. This is what we are talking about, and this is \njust what this program provides.\n  The President's own evaluation system, the PART analysis, says that \nthis program gets ``high scores for purpose, planning and management.'' \nThis program was part of the President's signature education \ninitiative, the No Child Left Behind Act, and is authorized at $2.25 \nbillion for fiscal year 2006. Sadly, the President's fiscal year 2006 \nbudget funds afterschool programs at the level-funded amount of $0.999 \nbillion, less than 45 percent of its authorized level. In my own State \nof Hawaii, this underfunding results in more than 8,800 school-age \nchildren not being able to take advantage of programs to help with \ntheir education, character development or physical fitness, nor provide \nprograms to ensure a safe environment during the afterschool hours.\n  The Dodd amendment to S. Con. Res. 18 attempts to address this \nfunding shortfall. I am glad to be a cosponsor, and I thank him and the \nother members of the Afterschool Caucus, of which I am a part, for the \nleadership in trying to restore funding for this essential program.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I am in strong opposition to this budget. As \nI have listened to the arguments of my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle in favor of the budget, I am reminded of the Indian parable \nof the blind men and the elephant. Each could feel only one portion of \nthe elephant, so each came to wildly different--and wildly inaccurate--\nconclusions as to what it was.\n  Similarly, it is hard for me to believe that those who are supporting \nthis budget are looking at the whole picture. How can they call this \nbudget fiscally responsible, when it would increase deficits $130 \nbillion over where\n\n[[Page S2959]]\n\nthey would be if we did nothing at all? How can they brag that the \nbudget tackles the difficult issue of entitlement reform, when nowhere \nis there mention of Social Security and Medicare, our two largest \nentitlement programs?\n  How can they refer to this as a blueprint for Congressional action, \nwhen it leaves out major spending and tax initiatives that we know the \nleadership wants to pursue: funding for the Iraq war beyond 2006; the \ncost of fixing the alternative minimum tax; the multitrillion dollar \ncost of the President's plan to privatize Social Security?\n  No one can defend this budget as a reasonable or complete response to \nthe serious fiscal challenges this country faces. No one can defend \nthis budget as accurately reflecting the priorities of our nation--for \non those grounds, it is indefensible.\n  The President--along with Alan Greenspan and countless other wise \npundits--have focused our attention on the severe budgetary \nconsequences of the coming retirement of the baby boomers. Entitlements \nare growing at an unsustainable rate--and the time to address their \ngrowth is now.\n  Congress should act to strengthen Social Security now, rather than \nwait for the moment of crisis. Social Security can pay full benefits \nfor another 40 or 50 years. After that--even if nothing is done--Social \nSecurity could still pay 70 to 80 percent of promised benefits. But if \nwe act sooner rather than later, Social Security's long-term financial \nimbalance can be fixed through relatively modest adjustments. At the \nsame time, we need to recognize that growing budget deficits will \nstrain our ability to sustain not just Social Security, but other \nimportant programs like Medicare and Medicaid. We need to look at the \nentire Federal budget and act to bring these deficits under control so \nwe can preserve programs that will put a strain on our budget in coming \nyears.\n  How--given the President's crusade to ``save'' Social Security with \nprivate accounts, given the coming retirement of the Baby Boom--can \nthis budget ignore Social Security and Medicare? Not a dollar assumed \nsaved from either. Not a penny paid back to the Social Security trust \nfund. Not even an acknowledgement of the huge cost of the President's \nplan to divert Social Security payroll taxes into private accounts. \nEither this budget is incomplete or it is insincere.\n  I suppose we should be relieved not to see any provision made in the \nbudget for the President's proposed private accounts. The President has \nchosen to make Social Security his top domestic priority, but so far he \nhas only proposed the idea of private accounts, which he admits would \ndo absolutely nothing to improve Social Security's finances. Borrowing \nto pay for the transition cost would add up to $5 trillion to \nthe national debt. And because the President has taken all other \noptions off the table, the private accounts would require massive \nbenefit cuts to achieve solvency.\n\n  Obviously, Social Security reform--or entitlement reform in general--\nis not a priority to those who support this budget. And obviously, \ncontinued tax cuts financed with reductions in important government \nprograms and with debt are. The budget puts on the fast track $70 \nbillion in tax cuts--and not one penny of offsets. In fact, the Senate \nrejected Senator Feingold's amendment, which I supported, that would \nhave prohibited using debt to finance this sort of raid on the \nTreasury.\n  Instead, the Senate chose to expedite tax cuts that would \ndisproportionately affect the wealthy. The budget facilitates the \nextension through 2010 of tax cuts on capital gains and dividend \nincome. Nearly half of this will benefit households with incomes in \nexcess of $1 million; in contrast, only 12 percent of the cuts will \nbenefit families with incomes under $100,000. It is fiscal \nirresponsibility in truest form, to speed tax cuts through the Senate \nthat will directly add to our growing deficit. In addition, the $70 \nbillion figure includes permanent estate tax repeal. This provision, \ndespite the fact that its true effect won't be felt until 2011, carries \nwith it a price tag of more than $9 billion--$9 billion that will truly \nbenefit the wealthiest Americans.\n  And while the budget finds plenty of room to reward millionaires with \nbillion dollar tax cuts, it nickels and dimes the government programs \nthe average American family relies on.\n  American seniors pay the highest drug prices in the world. Our \nseniors deserve a Medicare prescription drug benefit that gets the best \nprices for their medication. But the Medicare prescription drug law \nactually prohibits the Federal government from negotiating with drug \ncompanies for lower prices. This is a missed opportunity and a waste of \ntaxpayers' dollars. Now, in light of the growing concerns over the \nrising cost of this benefit--more than $57 billion than originally \nexpected--every effort should be made to save our seniors and taxpayers \ndollars. We missed a golden opportunity in the Budget today to accept \nan amendment that I was proud to cosponsor and require the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services to use the tremendous purchasing power of the \n41 million Medicare beneficiaries to assist the private drug plans in \ngetting the lowest price for seniors. The savings provided by this \namendment would have gone to pay for deficit reduction. Unfortunately, \nthis commonsense effort to lower prescription drug prices and reduce \nthe deficit was rejected.\n  However, I do applaud my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for \nhaving the courage to stop the proposed $15 billion cut to Medicaid. \nStopping these drastic cuts will ensure that thousands of poor \nfamilies, disabled Americans and the elderly get the proper medical \ncare they need. The proposed $15 billion Medicaid cut would have \ntranslated to a loss of $300 million for Wisconsin. It would be \nextremely difficult for Wisconsin and other states to absorb a cut of \nthis magnitude while continuing to provide the level of services 53 \nmillion Americans depend on. Now, there should be a thorough discussion \nabout how Medicaid can work better to serve low-income Americans. But \nwe should never force arbitrary cuts in Medicaid without first taking \nthe time to consider the future efficiency and operation of the \nMedicaid program. Medicaid is an essential source of health care for \nmillions of our Nation's most vulnerable citizens, and any changes to \nthe program should be driven by informed, reasoned policy and not by \narbitrary budget targets. I am pleased to have cosponsored the \namendment that passed the Senate to protect Medicaid from these drastic \ncuts.\n\n  We have a continuing responsibility to meet the health care needs of \nour children, families, and elderly. But--even with the improvement in \nthe Medicaid policy, the cuts proposed in this budget do not match \nthose needs. Older Americans Act programs are level funded even as our \npopulation ages and the need for services grows. LIHEAP funding is cut \nby $182 million as more families and seniors face higher energy costs. \nFunding for health professions training has been reduced by 64 percent \nat a time when we face health care workforce shortages. And funding for \nrural health programs has been slashed by 80 percent when rural areas \nare in desperate need of adequate health resources.\n  Perhaps the worst failure of this budget--it fails our nation's \nchildren. This budget proposes the first cut in education spending in a \ndecade. Yet again, this budget fails to fully fund No Child Left \nBehind, leaving the Act underfunded by $39 billion since enactment. It \nfails to set special education on a glide path to full funding--it is \nslated to be nearly $4 billion short of what was authorized four months \nago. This budget should reflect our values and needs in education. It \nclearly does not.\n  This budget still fails to fulfill our commitment to our veterans. \nThe American people made a promise to our men and women in uniform that \nwhen they had completed their service, the Veterans Administration \nwould be there to help them meet their health care needs. When we made \nthat commitment, it was not conditional, and it did not involve high \nfees. Today we seem to be slowly changing the terms of service. We now \nsay to our veterans that they will have to wait months for an \nappointment, and some veterans are of such low priority to the system \nthat they may never receive care at all. I supported an amendment that \nwould have bridged the funding gap between the President's budget and \nthe funding level that the veterans' groups believe is necessary. \nUnfortunately, Senator Akaka's amendment was not agreed to.\n\n[[Page S2960]]\n\nWith that ``no'' vote, the Senate made a decision that some veterans \ndid not deserve the benefits they had been promised.\n  I am also disappointed over the funding levels for transportation in \nthis bill. I am especially disappointed that the Senate did not remedy \nthe shortfall in funding for Amtrak. I was proud to cosponsor an \namendment that would have fully funded Amtrak's basic needs at a level \nof $1.4 billion. The President's budget zeroed out funding for Amtrak, \nproviding only $360 million to the Surface Transportation Board--and \nthat would only be provided if Amtrak is forced to shut down in the \nNortheast Corridor. What the Administration fails to recognize, is that \nridership in other areas of the country has increased; in Wisconsin, \nthis means that 540,000 used Amtrak this past year. To force these \n540,000 people onto our overcrowded roads and airports would be \nirresponsible, and I hope the Senate will reconsider before the end of \nthe fiscal year.\n  While I am glad that we put the Senate on record opposing cuts to the \nCommunity Development Block Grant program, it is up to the \nAppropriators to decide whether to reverse the $2 billion cut in this \nvital program. CDBG and the 17 other federal community and economic \ndevelopment programs which the Administration proposed consolidating in \nthe Commerce Department provide funds that are critical to meeting the \nneeds of distressed and underserved communities. In my state of \nWisconsin, at least 19 entitlement communities and many other smaller \ncommunities across the state are slated to lose millions of dollars if \nwe do not stand firm and reverse this proposal.\n\n  I also regret that the Senate has decided to open up the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling. In the past bipartisan group \nof senators came together to protect this fragile ecosystem, but this \nyear we failed to beat back drilling. By using the budget rules in a \nnew, and some would say questionable, way a place that had been set \naside as too valuable to be spoiled by drilling was opened to potential \nenvironmental degradation. The real tragedy here is that the oil we get \nfrom ANWR will have no impact on the price of oil. There is simply not \nenough oil in Alaska to have any real impact on the worldwide price. We \nhave decided to risk irrevocable environmental damage but gained no \nadditional control over our thirst for foreign oil. Until we \naggressively address our domestic demand for oil, we will never be able \nbe able to end our dependence on OPEC.\n  Following the administration's lead, the Senate Budget Committee \nallocated $187 million to the Office of Juvenile Justice and \nDelinquency Prevention, OJJDP, budget, which is about $173 million less \nthan what we appropriated last year. I am particularly disturbed that \nthe Senate Budget Resolution assumes complete elimination of the \nJuvenile Accountability Block Grant Program, JABG, which received $55 \nmillion last year. JABG provides funding for intervention programs that \naddress the urgent needs of juveniles who have had run-ins with the \nlaw.\n  The same is true of Title V Local Delinquency Prevention Program, the \nonly federal program solely dedicated to juvenile crime prevention. The \nSenate budget assumes a $50 million cut to Title V--penny pinching now \nthat will cost us dearly in the future. According to many experts in \nthe field, every dollar spent on prevention saves three or four dollars \nin costs attributable to juvenile crime. And who can put a dollar value \non the hundreds, even thousands of young lives turned from crime and \ninto productive work and community life by the juvenile crime \nprevention programs supported by Title V?\n  Following the President's lead, the Senate Budget Committee also \ndrastically cuts the programs most important to state and local law \nenforcement. Congress appropriated a little more than $700 million last \nyear in both discretionary and formula funds for the Byrne Justice \nAssistance Grant Program. The Budget before us assumes no funding for \nthis program at all. Byrne grants pay for state and local drug task \nforces, community crime prevention programs, substance abuse treatment \nprograms, prosecution initiatives, and many other local crime control \nprograms.\n  The COPS program is another victim of this budget. The Budget assumes \n$118 million for the COPS program--that is down from $388 million last \nyear. What's worse is that, within the COPS program, popular \ninitiatives like the COPS Universal Hiring Program and the COPS \nTechnology Grants Program are zeroed out entirely. We should remember \nthat just three years ago, the overall COPS program received more than \na billion dollars. Of that amount, $330,000,000 was for the hiring \nprogram and roughly $154,000,000 for the COPS technology program that \nhelped fund critical communications upgrades in cities--like Milwaukee \nand Madison--and many other towns--like Ashland and Onalaska--across \nWisconsin and the nation.\n  Finally, the Senate budget assumes cuts in the High Intensity Drug \nTrafficking Areas, HIDTA, program from $227 to $100 million. The HIDTA \nprogram is a vital collaboration between federal, state and local law \nenforcement to combat drug trafficking through intelligence-gathering \nand cooperation. This proposed cut in the overall HIDTA program \nthreatens the future of smaller HIDTAs like the one in Milwaukee--a \nprogram that has been extremely successful in stemming crime.\n\n  The downward spiral of juvenile justice and local law enforcement \nfunding is a disturbing budget trend with ugly real world implications. \nAs a result of the Byrne, COPS, JABG, HIDTA and Title V programs, we \nhave enjoyed steadily decreasing crime rates for the past decade. But, \nif we do not, at a minimum, maintain funding for crime fighting, we \ncannot be surprised if crime again infests our cities, communities, and \nneighborhoods.\n  That is why I offered an amendment with Senators Hatch and Biden to \nrestore this dramatic loss of juvenile justice and local law \nenforcement funding. Cuts to these programs total more than $1.2 \nbillion. Our amendment restores $1 billion of that--not enough to make \nthese important crime fighting programs whole, but enough to keep them \nfunctioning and working to keep our communities and families safe.\n  For rural America, this budget leaves so much to be desired that it's \nhard to know where to begin. If you assume the President's vision on \ndiscretionary spending is carried out, as this budget proposes, basic \nagricultural research will be slashed beyond recognition. Rural \nhousing, rural development and conservation will suffer. Nutrition for \nkids and food stamps for the working poor will be on the chopping \nblock. And the fundamental fabric of rural America will be put at risk.\n  A budget is a statement of who we are as a nation. I do not believe \nwe are a country that takes from the poor and sick to make the rich \nricher. I do not believe we are a country that steals from our \nchildren's future to indulge ourselves today. I do not believe we are a \ncountry that ignores threats to our prosperity and stability. I do not \nbelieve we are who this budget says we are, and I will vote against it.\n  Let me make one final point. Often, we hear that it would be \nirresponsible for Congress to reject a budget. Not this year. If we \nreject this budget,--if we do nothing at all--deficits will be $130 \nbillion less than had we acted. A vote against the budget is a vote for \ndeficit reduction. It is also a vote for responsible accounting, for \nhonoring our commitments to our seniors and our children, for \ncompassion towards those who are hungry, sick, or just struggling to \nraise a family in an uncertain world. For that reason, I will vote \nagainst this budget, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, to govern is to choose. Nowhere are our \npriorities and our values made clearer than in the budgets we write \nhere every year.\n  In these times, we face many tough choices. This budget ducks them \nall. It chooses the powerful over those without a voice. It chooses to \nreward wealth instead of work. It chooses the present over the future. \nIt chooses debt and borrowing over sound finance.\n  This budget rejects the very rules that brought our budget into \nbalance just a few years ago. It ducks our duty to take responsibility \nfor our choices, and sends the bill to our children and grandchildren.\n  I will vote against this budget, and I urge my colleagues to reject \nit, too.\n  Just 4 years ago we were considering the first budget of the new Bush \nadministration. At that time, we could\n\n[[Page S2961]]\n\nlook forward to a decade of budget surpluses, totaling $5.6 trillion.\n  We were paying down the national debt, and with every dollar \naccumulating in surplus, we were making our future stronger. Social \nSecurity funds were not being spent, as they are today, to fund the \nother functions of Government. Interest payments on the debt were \nshrinking, not growing.\n  With the impending retirement of the Baby Boom generation, with the \nneed to educate and train a workforce to take on the world of the 21st \nCentury, we were doing the right thing--saving for challenges we could \nsee coming.\n  But instead of seeing those surpluses as an opportunity to get our \nhouse in order, instead of increasing our national savings by paying \ndown the debt, the incoming administration insisted on a course that \nhas resulted in the most dramatic reversal in our Nation's finances in \nour history.\n  The record at that time is full of warnings that tax cuts of that \nmagnitude would make it difficult, if not impossible, to meet the known \nchallenges ahead, much less any surprises that history could throw at \nus.\n  We were assured that the surpluses had to go, that we had all the \nmoney we needed to deal with recession, national security threats, \nnatural disasters--anything we might have to face. We would be able to \nbalance the budget, put money away for the surge in retirees, and meet \nevery threat and challenge.\n\n  A lot of us did not buy it. The record is full of warnings about the \nlong-term damage of massive tax cuts without regard for our future \nobligations.\n  But those tax cuts were passed. And more tax cuts followed every \nyear, in time of economic boom, in time of recession, in peacetime, in \nwartime, when our budget was in surplus, and increasingly, as our \nbudget deficits grew. Regardless of the situation, regardless of the \nfacts, more tax cuts.\n  In the face of all the challenges we face, we are now running our \nGovernment on a level of revenue not seen since the 1950s. A 21st \nCentury superpower, on a 1950s budget.\n  By the time they expire, the tax cuts we have put into law over the \nlast 4 years will cost almost $2 trillion.\n  But we will be asked to extend those cuts past their expiration. Not \nto do so, we are told, would be a tax increase. But those expiration \ndates were chosen to make the tax cuts look smaller. Extending those \ncuts will raise the total cost to over $5 trillion through 2015.\n  That should cause serious people to stop and think. We are now \nengaged in an open-ended global war on terror, in a shooting war and \nreconstruction in Iraq. Security challenges from domestic threats to \nnuclear proliferation will continue to demand additional resources.\n  Medicare and Medicaid are facing real crises, driven by an aging \npopulation and rising health care costs. Social Security has a long \nterm funding problem that will have to be confronted, the sooner the \nbetter.\n  As the global economy brings billions of new workers and customers \ninto its scope, our country is in a real fight to protect and create \ngood-paying jobs. That means strengthening our schools and \nuniversities, increasing research and innovation, investing in 21st \nCentury infrastructure. All of that takes money.\n  This budget chooses to ignore those priorities. In fact, it cuts the \nresources we need to meet those challenges.\n  But it does not touch a dime of the $5 trillion the tax cuts will \ncost if they are all extended. Not a moment's pause, not a penny \nreconsidered.\n\n  The President constantly reminds us that the world has changed \nprofoundly in the past four years. That is true. He tells us that we \nface unprecedented challenges. That is also true.\n  But his budget, the budget before us today, ignores those truths. It \ncontinues the most reckless budget policies I have seen in my 30 years \nin the Senate. Those policies have taken us from the strongest fiscal \nposition we have known to the brink of the abyss. There is no way under \nthese policies that we will ever get out of debt again.\n  We are now debating the most basic priorities of our Government. The \nbudget document we will vote on today will be the statement of this \nSenate on what we value, and what I we do not value.\n  I am sorry to say that the most basic premise of this budget, is \nwrong. This budget protects tax cuts for those who need them least, and \ncuts the health care, housing, and education of those who need the \nmost.\n  It protects the largest tax cuts in our history, in the face of the \nlargest deficits we have ever seen.\n  The priorities in this budget are wrong. I do not think they are the \npriorities of the vast majority of people in this country. I know that \nthey are not my priorities.\n  Time and again during the week of debate, we have tried to provide \nfunding for some priorities, and to reduce the money going to others.\n  During this debate, I offered an amendment to restore money for the \nCOPS program that has put 100,000 policemen on the streets of our \ncountry. To cover those costs, I proposed closing loopholes used by \ncorporations who move overseas to avoid paying taxes. But that \namendment was voted down. Cops versus corporate tax breaks. Cops lose.\n  I voted to provide money for our veterans' health care, so sorely \nneeded in these times. To pay for that, I was ready to close tax those \ntax loopholes. That amendment was voted down. Veterans versus corporate \ntax breaks. Veterans lose.\n  I voted to increase funding for first responders, our first line of \ndefense against terrorism here at home. It was paid for by closing \nthose loopholes. That amendment was rejected. Fighting terrorism versus \ncorporate tax breaks. First responders lose.\n  I voted restore money for our national passenger rail system that \ncarries 25 million people a year, for which not a dime has been put \ninto this budget. But that amendment was voted down. Passenger rail \nversus corporate tax breaks. Passenger rail loses.\n  These and many other examples reveal the real priorities of this \nbudget. Nothing makes that clearer than the outright rejection of the \nkind of common sense budget rules that helped us balance the budget \nduring the 1990s.\n  Facing deficits of historical size, with no end in sight, most folks \nwould consider it just common sense to set up some rules to rein this \nproblem in. If you want to cut taxes, then cut spending to match. If \nyou want to increase spending, you have to raise taxes to match.\n  Pay-as-you-go rules would require us to make tough choices, to take \nresponsibility for our choices, and not just add to the mountains of \ndebt we will dump on our children.\n  But not only does this budget reject those rules, it actually makes \nit easier to go deeper into debt, by protecting tax cuts, in time of \nrecord deficits. Senator Feingold and Senator Carper both offered \namendments to correct that, and both amendments were rejected.\n  This budget is not just irresponsible, it is openly hostile to any \nattempt to make us live within our means.\n  This budget fails to address our most basic needs in these difficult \ntimes. It ducks our responsibility to pay for our own decisions. It \ndoes not reflect our Nation's priorities.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in rejecting it.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I rise to express my views on our \nbudget and the priorities and ideas I believe we must focus on as a \nnation. First, I want to reiterate my extreme disappointment in \nPresident Bush's budget with respect to how it affects our rural \ncommunities. While reducing our Nation's historic deficit is essential, \nthe burden and sacrifice shouldn't rest disproportionately on the backs \nof rural America--all Americans should share the burden. In my opinion, \nthe President's budget relies too heavily on working families in rural \nAmerica to make sacrifices while the President continues to advocate \nadditional tax cuts for the ultrawealthy.\n  We have to find a responsible way for all Americans to share in this \nburden, and I think that my constituents stand ready to accept their \nshare of that sacrifice. However, I am not going to ask the working \nfamilies of this country to shoulder the entire burden. Rural programs \nare often the first programs on the chopping block, yet these are among \nthe most important to our local communities and the economies they \nsupport. Our spending cuts must be balanced even if it requires rolling \nback the tax cuts for the ultrawealthy.\n\n[[Page S2962]]\n\n  I have a long standing commitment to rural America and our Nation's \nfarmers and I understand the challenges they face to maintain and \nstrengthen their way of life. That is why I am so disappointed that \nthis President has decided, through his budget, that our farmers and \nour rural communities are no longer a priority for him and his \nAdministration.\n  I would like to take a few moments to focus on five areas where I \nbelieve the President failed rural America. The first area that the \nPresident's budget has come up short is with respect to rural law \nenforcement.\n  The President's budget cuts close to $1.9 billion in funding for \nlocal and state law enforcement and first responders. These cuts will \nbe particularly crippling to rural law enforcement and inhibit a wide \nrange of services including their ability to combat Arkansas' growing \nmethamphetamine problem.\n  The President's budget includes a 27 percent cut, totaling \napproximately $455 million, in first responders funding. These cuts \nwould hinder critical state and local efforts to protect our \ncommunities by making less funding available for the preparedness of \nfirst responders and citizens, public health, infrastructure security \nand other public safety activities. I am particularly concerned with \nhow these cuts would affect the amount of federal Homeland Security \nfunding provided to small and rural states such as Arkansas.\n  The President's budget includes a $215 million cut which would force \nrural fire departments to cut back on equipment purchase, safety \ntraining, fire prevention programs, and the purchase of new vehicles. \nThese grants are especially important to Arkansas' rural and volunteer \nfire departments. Since 2001, the FIRE Act grant program has provided \nvital resources to many of Arkansas' 900 fire departments, 85 percent \nof which are voluntary. Since last Spring, more than 180 awards have \nbeen granted to Arkansas fire departments, totaling over $12 million.\n  Also, the President's budget proposes eliminating the Edward Byrne \nMemorial Justice Assistance Grant Program, which was budgeted at $536.5 \nmillion last year. I am deeply concerned with the elimination of this \nimportant program because it would significantly impact the ability of \nArkansas law enforcement to combat the state's growing meth problem. \nThe existence of 19 Drug Task Forces, funded by the Byrne Grants, are \nespecially crucial in a state like Arkansas, which was recently ranked \nthird in the nation, per capita, in terms of the number of meth labs \nseized and has recently seen the number of labs seized per year exceed \n1,200.\n  The President's budget includes an 80 percent cut, totaling \napproximately $489 million, in COPS funding. Since Congress created \nthis successful initiative with my support in 1994, the COPS Programs \nhas assisted Arkansas law enforcement agencies in reducing violent \ncrime across the state. In doing so, it has helped counties throughout \nArkansas hire additional officers for community policing and homeland \nsecurity activities by helping provide for their salaries and benefits. \nSince 1998, the Drug Enforcement Administration has used COPS funds for \nthe training and certification of 379 state and local law enforcement \nofficers as of June, 2004.\n  I want to make a special note of the fact that this budget cuts the \nCOPS Methamphetamine Enforcement and Clean-Up by $32.5 million. These \ncuts would be greatly felt in Arkansas, where the use of \nmethamphetamine is growing and has become the #1 priority for my \nstate's drug law enforcement. COPS funding provided for the clean up \nand disposal of hazardous wastes found at 810 meth lab sites seized by \nArkansas state and local law enforcement in 2003, and funded the cost \nwhich totaled more than $1.39 million.\n  The President's budget includes a 49 percent cut, totaling \napproximately $186 million, in Juvenile Justice Programs. These cuts \nwould dramatically weaken the Juvenile Justice System, whose funds \nsupport state and local efforts to prevent juvenile delinquency and \naddress juvenile crime. The President also seeks the elimination of the \nJuvenile Accountability Block Grants, JABG, which was funded by \nCongress in FY 2005 at $55 million. All of these cuts will \nsignificantly hamper rural law enforcement.\n  The second area where this President's budget short changes rural \nAmerica is in hea1thcare. At a time when 45 million Americans are \nuninsured, the President's budget eliminates 28 important health \nprograms, which total $1.369 billion. Two of the most important \nprograms for rural health are Medicaid and the Area Health Education \nCenters or AHECs.\n  With respect to Medicaid, Arkansas will lose more than $560 million \nin Medicaid dollars over the next 10 years under the President's cuts. \nIn 2010, Arkansas will lose more than $55 million. Mr. President, these \ncuts would cause more than 5,700 Arkansas seniors and 22,000 children \nto lose their healthcare coverage.\n  One of the most devastating cuts affects Arkansas' Area Health \nEducation Centers. Arkansas has six such centers. The President's \nbudget would eliminate these vital centers for health and health \neducation.\n  The third area where this budget fails rural America is in regard to \neducation. The President has proposed cutting education funding by $530 \nmillion nationwide. Such a funding cut would hurt rural school \ndistricts in Arkansas that rely on federal dollars such as Title I, \nwhich provides services to low income students. The President's cuts to \nTitle I could affect more than 28,000 Arkansas children.\n  Arkansas school districts are already struggling to meet the demands \nof the new No Child Left Behind law, which the President has never \nfully funded, so now is not the time to cut such vital funding. I note \nwith special interest that the President's budget proposes extending \nthe No Child Left Behind law to high schools at the expense of \neliminating 48 programs, including all the vocational and technical \neducation programs, education technology state grants, GEAR UP, Safe \nand Drug-Free Schools initiatives and the Communities State Grants, \nTRIO Talent Search and Upward Bound programs.\n  This budget proposes funding Arkansas' program at $128 million, \nnearly $90 million less than what the No Child Left Behind Law calls \nfor. This budget proposes funding Arkansas' After School program at $12 \nmillion below what No Child Left Behind mandates. This could affect \nmore than 15,000 Arkansas children. On top of that the President's \nbudget cuts IDEA funding by more than $37 million.\n  The fourth area where this budget fails rural America is in relation \nto economic development. The President's budget would drastically cut \neconomic initiatives relied on by Arkansas' rural communities. The \neconomic development initiatives specifically benefit communities in \nArkansas of 3,000 or fewer residents.\n  The President's budget restructures how Community Development Block \nGrant (CDBG) Program grants are allocated. Last year, CDBG alone was \nfunded at $4.8 billion. The President proposes to consolidate CDBG with \n17 other local assistance programs and fund the entire group at $3.71 \nbillion. This would make it more difficult for Arkansas' Department of \nEconomic Development to compete for this type of funding. These cuts \ncould severely impair the state's ability to provide grants to \nArkansas' rural communities. In addition, this move would directly \nimpact the 14 entitlement cities that receive CDBG funds (cities \ninclude: Bentonville, Conway, Fort Smith, Jonesboro, Rogers, Texarkana, \nFayetteville, Hot Springs, Jacksonville, Little Rock, North Little \nRock, Pine Bluff, Springdale, and West Memphis). CDBG funds have been \nused for a variety of projects in Arkansas, including senior citizen \ncenters, public health facilities, childcare facilities, affordable \nhousing rehabilitation and construction projects, and rural fire \nstations.\n  The fifth area where this budget fails rural America is with respect \nto agriculture. The fine print of the President's budget includes \ndrastic cuts in farm and commodity programs that are vital to Arkansas' \nfarmers. The President's proposed cuts would break a firm promise the \nFederal government has made to American farmers and ranchers. \nFurthermore, the President's proposed cuts in Food Stamps will severely \nimpact rural Arkansans.\n  The President did not have to propose cuts in these programs. The \nentire farm bill is one-half percent of the Federal budget. Yet, he \nchose these cuts\n\n[[Page S2963]]\n\nthat endanger entire communities in rural America. He chose to protect \ntax cuts for the ultra wealthy above our working farm families who are \nthe backbone of rural America.\n  This should be a wake up call to the heartland of this country--many \nof whom supported President Bush's re-election. These programs have \nhuge impacts on the quality of life in our rural communities. From his \nrecent proposal to privatize Social Security, to these devastating cuts \nin his budget--the President has made it abundantly clear that he's \ngoing after working families in rural America.\n  Unfortunately, the FY 2006 Senate budget resolution we are debating \ntoday is only marginally better than the President's request. In my \nopinion, this resolution doesn't reflect the values and priorities of \nmy state or the nation. The proposal before us ignores critical needs \nin my state and in rural communities across our nation. Specifically, \nthe resolution, like the President's budget, would cut funding for \nVeterans, for education and training, for local law enforcement, for \ntransportation and for agriculture and nutrition programs.\n  I am pleased we have made some improvements in the budget presented \nby the President during consideration in the Senate but unfortunately I \nbelieve the burden imposed by this budget still falls \ndisproportionately on the backs of working families, especially those \nin rural communities throughout Arkansas and the nation.\n  Even though I am compelled to oppose the budget before the Senate \ntoday, I will continue to stand up for the priorities that are critical \nto the citizens of my state during the appropriations process ahead.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the President is setting a course that \njettisons sound stewardship of fiscal policy and that ignores America's \nreal needs, from education to first responders, and this budget \nresolution largely facilitates that reckless course.\n  Iraq's needs fare well in the President's spending priorities, but \nAmerica's needs deserve to fare better. In record time, the \nadministration's policies already have converted record surpluses into \nrecord deficits, and if these new policies are enacted, the worst is \nyet to come. More tax cuts for the wealthy, more borrowing, more \ndeficits, and fewer investments in the priorities that really count in \nthe everyday lives of America's families and communities.\n  We hear a lot in this town about ``compassionate conservatism.'' We \nhear speeches about declining family values and the breakdown of the \ntraditional family. And we hear about streamlining Government and \nmaking it run more like a business based on cost-benefit analysis.\n  But the truth is, this budget before the Senate today is neither \ncompassionate nor conservative. On the one hand it slashes, freezes, or \ntotally eliminates funding for programs that help the poorest and the \nmost vulnerable Americans, and on the other it uses smoke and mirrors \nto conceal the creation of a federal deficit larger than any other in \nour Nation's history.\n  This is a difficult time for many Americans, and this budget will \nonly make things worse. Fifteen million American households cannot find \naffordable housing, yet this budget would force housing costs onto \nstate and local governments.\n  Forty-four million Americans do not have health insurance, yet the \nbudget that was brought to the floor would force the costs of Medicaid \nright back onto our cash-strapped State and local governments. I am \npleased that we were able to soften this crushing blow to our states' \nMedicaid programs--for now--with a successful amendment. But there will \nbe determined efforts to undo that vote at every step of the \nlegislative process that lies ahead.\n  At a time when American companies are forced to hire from abroad \nbecause the students here lag behind in math and science skills, this \nbudget would eliminate education programs by the dozen and severely \nunderfund No Child Left Behind programs and funding for low-income \nschools. Perhaps most disturbingly, as we see more and more young \ntroops coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan in need of long term \nmedical and psychological care, this budget would dramatically reduce \nbenefits and services to veterans.\n  I recently received a letter from a charitable organization that I \nbelieve does great work, Catholic Charities USA, describing their views \non the proposed budget. I think it will surprise many members what they \nsay. I ask unanimous consent that March 8, 2005, Catholic Charities \nletter addressed to me be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    March 8, 2005.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, 433 Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: On behalf of Catholic Charities USA, I \n     urge you to support budget priorities for FY2006 that will \n     strengthen the capacity of states, localities, and private \n     agencies to protect and assist the poorest and most \n     vulnerable members of our society.\n       Although our economy has recovered somewhat from the \n     economic recession that began in late 2000, increasing \n     numbers of Americans ate facing significant hardship. \n     Unemployment remains high, as over 9 percent of the working \n     population is either unemployed or underemployed, according \n     to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Poverty rates are rising \n     again, and 35 million people--including 12 million children--\n     are now living under the federal poverty line.\n       For millions of families, the difficulties presented by the \n     weak economy have been exacerbated by other challenges. \n     Fifteen million American households cannot find affordable \n     housing, while forty-four million people in the U.S. lack \n     health insurance. High housing costs, unexpected health \n     costs, chronic illnesses aggravated by inconsistent health \n     care--these and other factors contribute to the economic \n     instability experienced by many families.\n       We at Catholic Charities USA are witness to the human toll \n     of the failure to address these problems adequately. For \n     instance, our agencies, which provide food, shelter, and \n     other forms of emergency assistance to 4.5 million people \n     annually, are reporting strong increases in requests for \n     emergency assistance, especially among families with \n     children. According to the U.S. Conference of Mayors, our \n     experience is not unique. Their 2004 survey of 27 cities \n     revealed that requests for emergency food and shelter \n     increased 14 and 6 percent, respectively.\n       We therefore urge you to produce a budget that will protect \n     funding for critical services and supports to help the \n     millions of families struggling to achieve stability and \n     self-sufficiency. Every decision of economic policy, \n     including the setting of national budget priorities, must be \n     judged in light of its impact on those who do not share in \n     the abundance of the American economy. At a time when the \n     United States is spending more on defense and homeland \n     security, a question arises about who will pay for it. It \n     should not be our nation's poorest citizens. We therefore ask \n     you to support the following budget priorities:\n       Place a priority on investments in federal programs that \n     protect and support low-income families and other vulnerable \n     populations. Funding for many poverty programs was already \n     cut or frozen in 2005. Others, such as Temporary Assistance \n     for Needy Families (TANF), the Child Care and Development \n     Block Grant (CCDBG), and the Social Services Block Grant \n     (SSBG) have been frozen since 1996. Congress should address \n     the budget deficit in a fair and balanced way maintaining \n     investments in our children, protecting programs assisting \n     seniors and persons with disabilities, and enhancing our \n     national security.\n       Oppose the inclusion of Medicaid cuts in fiscal year 2006 \n     budget reconciliation: Medicaid provides essential health \n     coverage to over 50 million of our most vulnerable low-income \n     children, working families, seniors, and people with \n     disabilities. Neatly every state has already enacted painful \n     cuts to its Medicaid program, including eligibility levels, \n     services, and provider payments, and many states are facing \n     deep Medicaid cuts again this year. Federal funding \n     reductions would force states to implement even deeper cuts \n     further restricting eligibility, eliminating or reducing \n     critical health benefits, and cutting or freezing provider \n     reimbursement rates. As a result, state Medicaid funding cuts \n     could add millions more people to the ranks of the uninsured \n     who would go without care, endangering their own health and \n     public health.\n       The budget resolution should not place arbitrary caps on \n     discretionary spending. The Administration has proposed \n     statutory rules to cap discretionary spending over the next \n     five years at its proposed 2006 spending levels. Such caps \n     would require cuts of $200 billion in spending for domestic \n     programs over\n\n[[Page S2964]]\n\n     the next five years, including funding for education, \n     veterans' health care, rental assistance, utility assistance, \n     and childcare. Such cuts would have a devastating impact on \n     agencies and communities that are already struggling to meet \n     the basic needs of vulnerable citizens.\n       We ask that Congress not attempt to balance the federal \n     budget through reductions in discretionary programs assisting \n     low-income families. Because domestic discretionary spending \n     constitutes only 16 percent of the federal budget, even deep \n     cuts in these programs would offer little help with the \n     federal deficit, while sharply reducing assistance to \n     families struggling to meet their basic needs.\n       If Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGO) rules are included in budget \n     reconciliation, they should be balanced. If Congress chooses \n     to reinstate PAYGO provisions, we urge that they be \n     implemented in a neutral manner that does not encourage \n     revenue reductions at the expense of critical programs \n     serving the nation's most vulnerable families. Under the \n     President's proposed PAYGO rules, entitlement program \n     increases would have to be offset by entitlement reductions \n     elsewhere. In contrast, tax reductions would require no \n     offsets in the federal budget. This unbalanced policy would \n     unfairly burden programs such as Medicaid that provide \n     families with critical assistance, and would likely fail to \n     achieve significant deficit reductions.\n       We recognize that Congress is faced with many difficult \n     choices. In your deliberations, please remember those who \n     have the fewest choices.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                 Fr. Larry Snyder.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what does this charitable religious group \nask? Less funding for family planning efforts? No. More tax cuts for \nthe wealthy? No. Tougher bankruptcy standards to help credit card \ncompanies? No. Class action relief for big corporations? No. Yet those \nhave been the White House's and the Congress's priorities so far this \nyear, and those are their priorities in this budget. But what this \ncharitable religious group convincingly asks that we do is far \ndifferent. They ask for the following: They ask Congress and the \nPresident to make a higher priority in the budget of federal programs \nthat protect and support low-income families and other vulnerable \npeople in our society. Oppose the inclusion of Medicaid cuts in Fiscal \nYear 2006 budget reconciliation. The budget resolution should not place \narbitrary caps on discretionary spending. And if pay-as-you-go rules \nare included in budget reconciliation, they should be balanced.\n  Now, these sound like reasonable proposals that would help the \nneediest among us. Those sound like priorities that would benefit the \n35 million people--including 12 million children--now living below the \nfederal poverty line. These proposals truly sound compassionate.\n  Some claim that the cuts in this budget are steps toward fiscal \nresponsibility. But anyone who looks closely at this budget will see \nthat any semblance of fiscal responsibility is lost because this budget \nleaves out a number of Governmental costs in the outyears. It leaves \nout the costs of ongoing U.S. responsibilities in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nIt leaves out the cost of any repair of the alternative minimum tax \nsystem. It leaves out the cost of extending the President's tax cuts. \nAnd most incredibly, it leaves out any of the expected $4.5 trillion in \ncosts for the President's plan to privatize Social Security. With these \ncosts factored in to the equation, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget \nOffice predicts that by 2012, the United States deficit will reach $527 \nbillion, making each family's share of the debt an astonishing $85,967.\n  I take very seriously this warning from the Government Accountability \nOffice in their February 2005 report titled ``21st Century Challenges: \nReexamining the Base of the Federal Government:''\n\n       Absent significant changes on the spending and/or revenue \n     sides of the budget, these long term deficits will encumber a \n     growing share of federal resources and test the capacity of \n     current and future generations to afford both today's and \n     tomorrow's commitments. Continuing on this unsustainable path \n     will gradually erode, if not suddenly damage, our economy, \n     our standard of living and ultimately our national security.\n\n  This budget will plunge the United States into red ink as far as the \neye can see. We have an obligation to be honest about the true costs of \nour budget to the people who are paying for it. If we continue to \nfollow this path of fiscal irresponsibility, we will be leaving our \nchildren and grandchildren with a debt that they cannot possibly begin \nto afford. We need to turn around the massive loss in total revenues \nthat we have seen during the Bush years. We need to strengthen our \ncurrent Social Security system so that less money is drained from the \ntrust fund. And we need to realign our budget priorities with the real \nneeds of the American people and discard these politically motivated \nbudget cuts.\n  I may be seen in this town as a progressive Senator from Vermont, but \nI have a conservative message for my colleagues today. We cannot \ncontinue down this reckless path of financial irresponsibility that we \nhave been led down for the past four years. We need to get our fiscal \nhouse in order. Foreign investors are growing weary of our record debt. \nOur sons and daughters in uniform--including those in our National \nGuard and Reserves--are in harm's way overseas and need to be properly \nequipped and to have the health insurance they deserve. And essential \nprograms for disadvantaged people across the country are being slashed \nto squeeze out more money for tax cuts to the wealthiest among us. This \nis not the American way. We are a more compassionate people than this \nbudget resolution assumes we are.\n  The American people deserve better than fiscal and budget policies \nsuch as these, and I will vote against this budget resolution.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, much to my amazement, and I suspect that of \nthe Senator from North Dakota, we are at the end of this exercise.\n  I will yield to the Senator from North Dakota for a closing comment. \nBefore I do that, I want to thank the staffs on both sides, the \nmajority staff and the Democratic staff. They have done exceptional \nwork under extremely intense, very difficult conditions. They have \nworked night and day for weeks on this, and now in the last few days \nthey have been going 24 hours a day.\n  I also thank the members of the staff of the Senate for their extreme \ncourtesy and extraordinary professionalism. Amendments have been thrown \nat them in an aggressive way, and they have handled it well. We thank \nthem for their professionalism.\n  I yield to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, very briefly, I thank Senator Gregg for \nthe tone he set not only in committee, but on the floor. I thank his \nstaff for their professionalism and cooperation. We have gotten to know \nthem and have worked closely with them and have enjoyed the experience.\n  I thank Members of the Senate who worked cooperatively. Just hours \nago, we could have been faced with being here until 3 o'clock in the \nmorning. Senators on both sides of the aisle really cooperated to allow \nus to complete business at this hour.\n  With all of that said, I urge Members to oppose this budget \nresolution. As I read it, this budget would increase the deficit by \nover $200 billion over and above what would happen if we just put this \nentire Government on autopilot. In addition, as I read this budget, it \nincreases the debt each and every year by over $600 billion.\n  Mr. President, this is at a time when we already have record deficits \nand soaring debt and are increasingly vulnerable to the decisions of \nforeign central banks, as we have increased our borrowing from them by \nnearly 100 percent in just 3 years.\n  Finally, I don't think this budget has the right priorities for \nAmerica. This has a dramatic cut in the COPS program, virtually \neliminating it. It has cuts in things like firefighters grants and, at \nthe same time, substantial tax cuts for the very wealthiest among us, a \ntax cut of more than $35,000 for millionaires in 2006 alone. That is at \na time when we are reducing funding for a whole series of national \npriorities, including veterans and education beyond what was \nauthorized.\n  Again, let me conclude by thanking colleagues on both sides for the \nprofessionalism with which this debate has been conducted.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, let me add a note of appreciation to the \nmajority leader and the assistant leader on our side and the Democratic \nleader and his assistant leader. They have done an exceptional job of \nhelping us on the bill.\n  Let me especially thank the Senator from North Dakota for the \nexpeditious and fair way this bill was handled. It\n\n[[Page S2965]]\n\nwas, in large part, due to his extraordinary effort. I thank him for \nthat. I thank his staff, led by Mary Naylor, and I thank Scott Gudes of \nmy staff and the extraordinary team I have for the great work they have \ndone.\n  This is not the perfect bill, not the bill I would choose had I \ncontrolled the magic wand. But it is a bill that is in the middle of \nthe process, and, hopefully, it will evolve into a better bill as we go \nthrough the process.\n  I hope colleagues will join in passing it, as it is our obligation as \na Government that we have a budget in order to guide the Government as \nwe go forward.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We will not end until the leader has worked things out, \nbut the chairman was concluding his statement.\n  Mr. GREGG. My verbosity obviously got the best of me. I was \nconcluded, and I thought it was an excellent conclusion. I appreciate \nthe input of the Senator from Nevada. He brought it to an end at the \nappropriate time. I hope we can move forward.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank my staff very much for an \nextraordinary effort. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we cannot leave until the majority leader \ngets on the floor. We have to find out what we are going to do when we \nget back here.\n  Mr. BIDEN. We can check the Record. Let's vote.\n  Mr. REID. Does the leader have an idea what we are going to do when \nwe get back?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, through the Chair, we are going to have a \nbusy session when we get back. I would love to continue our discussion. \nWe have a number of issues such as patient safety, and we have a couple \nof district judges that we need to do. We will see how far we get with \nwelfare reform. We can have a busy 3 weeks.\n\n  Mr. REID. Tuesday will be our first vote?\n  Mr. FRIST. Tuesday would be our first vote, if we vote Tuesday. We \nwould not vote on the first Monday back.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, may I inquire of the distinguished majority \nleader, will there be a session tomorrow?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I have not had a full discussion with the \nDemocratic leader about a session tomorrow. We can either have a \ndiscussion now or during the vote. We will discuss during the vote \nwhether or not we will have a session.\n  Mr. BYRD. If we are not going to have a session, my first inquiry \nwould be, how many days will the Record remain open for statements?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, through the Chair, in response to how many \ndays the Record will be open, we will work that out as well during the \nvote.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, upon the \nconclusion of the vote, I may be recognized to make some statements for \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the narrow 51-49 vote on the budget \nresolution we just passed reveals the delicate balance that our \nleadership forged between spending restraints and the funding \npriorities of the American people. On the one hand, there is a clear \nneed to dry up the red ink which threatens to plague our children, \ntheir children and generations to come. As the author of the Balanced \nBudget Constitutional amendment I am clearly aware of the need to \nmaintain fiscal discipline.\n  At the same time, I also have a responsibility to the citizens of UT \nto make certain that important programs in our state receive the \nfunding they need to operate on a sound basis.\n  Today, we cast many difficult votes which forced us to choose between \nthose two competing priorities. One of those votes was on the Smith \nMedicaid amendment. I am extremely concerned about the $60 billion \nreduction in proposed spending growth for Medicaid in the President's \nbudget. At the same time, it is important to note that even under the \nPresident's budget, Medicaid is projected to grow about 7 percent per \nyear.\n  I feel that it is incumbent upon the Finance Committee and its \nmembers, Secretary Mike Leavitt and the President to work with States \nand communities to ensure that we preserve the safety net Medicaid \noffers to the elderly, the disabled and the low income. I have pledged \nto Chairman Chuck Grassley and Secretary Leavitt that I will work with \nthem to ensure that there is adequate funding for this vital program. I \nam very concerned that we do right by this program which helps so many, \nmany Utahns each year. We can't allow it to be torn apart.\n  Another difficult amendment facing the Senate today was the amendment \noffered by Senator Norm Coleman to restore funding in the budget for \nthe Community Development Block Grant program, CDBG. As my colleagues \nare aware, I wrote to the Budget Committee and urged strongly that they \ninclude adequate room for the appropriators to fund the CDBG program. I \nwas very disappointed that funding was not reflected in the budget \nreported by the Senate Budget Committee.\n  I consider the Community Development Block grant program to be an \neffective tool and an extremely important program for communities \nthroughout the State of Utah. I feel it is important to note that the \npurpose of the Budget Resolution is to set out the framework for the FY \n2006 priorities which will determine the allocations provided to each \nof the Appropriations Subcommittees. We all know it is very difficult \nto begin the appropriations process without having a budget in place to \nguide our work. Whether or not the final budget agreement which emerges \nfrom the House-Senate conference includes an explicit funding reference \nfor the CDBG or not, action will turn to the Appropriations Committee \nwhich has the full authority, and indeed the responsibility, to provide \nfunding for this program.\n  Let me make it perfectly clear to the communities in Utah that I will \nnot drop my fight to secure adequate funding for the CDBG.\n  I want to assure my colleagues that my votes on the budget today do \nnot reflect any lessened commitment on my part to the CDBG, Medicaid or \nother vital programs in UT.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the budget \nresolution that the Senate just voted on.\n\n[[Page S2966]]\n\nThis budget is irresponsible and takes the country in the wrong \ndirection. It adds to our Nation's debt, continues to slash taxes for \nthose in our Nation who least need tax breaks, and would enact massive \ncuts in critical domestic priorities. And it is for these reasons that \nI was unable to support this budget resolution.\n  The budget of the United States is a declaration of our Nation's \nmoral priorities. It is a statement of where our Nation is now, and \nwhere we aim to be, years down the line. On all of these counts, this \nbudget fails to reflect this Nation's values.\n  I know that Members of this body have strong differences on our \nbudget priorities, but I think that we can all agree on the following \ntwo items. First, that our Nation is currently experiencing record-high \ndeficits.\n  Second, that these deficits are impeding our ability to meet our \nneeds in education, transportation, communication, health care, \nnational security, and homeland security. There are strong views on \nboth sides on how we got here. I believe that our change from record \nsurpluses to record deficits was not an accident, nor was it a product \nof unforeseen events, but was a direct result of the fiscal policies \npursued by the current administration. This result was not unforseen, \nnot unexpected, and in some corridors even desired since there are \nthose who have told us that deficits are ``good'' on the theory that \nchronically high deficits will preclude what they consider to be unwise \nand wasteful government spending, by which they mean spending on \neducation, transportation, research and development, among other \npriorities.\n  Unfortunately, the budget that just passed does not in good faith \naddress our record deficits. In fact, it worsens our Nation's fiscal \nhealth. This budget is a continuation of the reckless and unfair \npolicies that have been pushed forward by this administration since its \nfirst days in office, and by its supporters in Congress. The majority's \nbudget resolution would make deficits and debt worse, not better as \nthey have claimed. Over the next 5 years, this budget proposal would \nincrease deficits by $130 billion over what they would be under current \nlaw. And while the majority claims to be cutting the deficit in half \nwith this budget resolution, I am afraid that that this assertion is \nfalse. This budget resolution actually leaves out large and significant \ncosts, and in so doing masks the true size of the deficit.\n  The reality of the fact is that when omitted costs are factored in, \nsuch as the 10-year cost of AMT reform, $770 billion, and ongoing war \ncosts, $380 billion, the operating deficits will remain above $500 \nbillion and climb to $569 billion in 2010. These figures do not include \nthe President's Social Security privatization plan, which would likely \nadd an additional $4.4 trillion over 20 years to the national debt.\n  To make matters worse, by failing to provide estimates of the effects \nof its proposals beyond 2010, this budget resolution, obscures the fact \nthat its tax cuts would increase the deficit by a much larger amount in \nthe second 5 years--2011 through 2015--than in the first 5 years--2006 \nthrough 2010. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the tax \ncuts proposed in the budget would increase the deficit by another $1.4 \ntrillion from 2011 through 2015.\n  The national debt would continue to skyrocket under this budget \nresolution. In 2001, when President Bush took office we were actually \nhaving serious conversations about paying off the national debt by \n2008. Under this budget resolution, including the costs of AMT reform \nand ongoing war costs, we will see the publicly held debt go from its \ncurrent level of $4.3 trillion to at least $5.9 trillion by 2008. In \n2001, this would have seemed inconceivable. This budget resolution also \nincludes a reconciliation instruction for a $446 billion debt increase \nwhich means that a debt increase could happen in an expedited manner \nwithout affording the Senate full and proper consideration. While there \nwas an amendment to remove the reconciliation instruction on the debt \nincrease, it unfortunately did not pass.\n  Over the past few years, the administration has told us that figures \nlike the deficit and the national debt are merely numbers that have \nlittle impact on Americans' lives. This is yet another reflection of an \nadministration out of touch with reality.\n  What will be the ultimate result of our record budget and trade \ndeficits? Higher interest rates on small business loans, families' \nmortgages, and education loans. These amount to a tax hike on working \nfamilies and small businesses.\n  Americans may wonder, how does their government finance these \ndeficits? The answer is that our government does much what many \nfamilies or businesses do when faced with bills they can't pay--we \nborrow money. The money our government spends has to come from \nsomewhere--and with each passing year, more and more of it comes from \nforeign nations.\n\n  Since President Bush took office, foreign debt holdings have \nincreased almost 100 percent. We now owe $700 billion to Japan, $200 \nbillion to China, and $69 billion to South Korea. This makes us more \nvulnerable to the decisions of foreign central bankers since they can \ndecide that it's time to collect their debt--and we will have to pay \nup. If this were to happen, the implications for our economy would be \ncatastrophic.\n  The majority had an opportunity this week to truly tackle the \nskyrocketing deficit--by restoring a strong pay-as-you-go rule, PAYGO, \nthat would require any new mandatory spending or tax legislation to be \npaid for, or require 60 votes to pass. In 1983, I was one of the first \nSenators to offer a pay-as-you-go budget. It is smart budgeting; it \nworks. One major reason why we were able to move from deficit to \nsurplus in the 1990s is because we had a strong PAYGO rule. \nUnfortunately, the majority refused to support this important amendment \nthis week, thereby sending a message that it is okay that we continue \nto drown in deficits.\n  As I said at the outset, the budget that the Senate just passed is \nnot just a fiscal document. It is a statement about the majority's \nvalues. And just as this budget is fiscally irresponsible, it is also \nmorally irresponsible.\n  This budget will cause pain and debilitation to working families \nthroughout our country. In essence this budget tells working families \nthat they need to do more with less. This budget tells them that as a \nnation we just do not have money to buy new computers for schools, to \nprovide better health care, to provide services to the poor, the sick, \nthe frail, and the elderly. This is appalling, but what makes it even \nmore so is that at the same time, this budget turns around to the \naffluent of this country and gives more to them. This budget finds room \nto include tax cuts for millionaires, but does not have enough for the \nneeds of middle-class families.\n  Despite record deficits and debt, and despite our efforts to address \nthis, the budget before us provides for another $70 billion in tax cuts \nover 5 years using the ``reconciliation'' process which is a fast-track \nprocess that ensures that such legislation would need 51, rather than \n60 votes to pass. ``Reconciliation'' was originally established to \nensure fiscal responsibility, and here the majority is now using it to \nextend the tax cuts on dividends and capital gains. These tax breaks, \nwhich would average $35,000 a year, would disproportionately go to \nhouseholds that have incomes in excess of $1 million, a group that \nconstitutes only 0.2 percent of all households.\n  Such policies will bankrupt the country and unfairly place the burden \non the backs of middle-class workers. I strongly believe that this \nbudget sets us on a dangerous course when we consider the challenges we \nface in the coming years.\n  In the global economy of the 21st century, America faces ever-\nincreasing competition from foreign nations. How we fare in that \ncompetition will be a direct consequence of our willingness to make \nconcrete investments in the capabilities of our greatest and most \nabundant resource: the American people.\n  Investing in the American people begins with ensuring each and every \nAmerican receives a quality education. A quality education--beginning \nwhen a child is only a few years old, and continuing through college \nand beyond--is the key that opens the doorway to a lifetime of \nopportunity. Our competitors--nations like India and China--have \nrealized that. They are making serious investments in the intellectual \ncapacity of their citizens.\n  What are we doing?\n\n[[Page S2967]]\n\n  One in every three programs slated for elimination in the President's \nbudget are education programs. Aside from the eliminations, No Child \nLeft Behind is underfunded by $12 billion, special education is \nunderfunded by $3.6 billion, and afterschool programs are underfunded \nby $1.25 billion. How does the administration expect schools to raise \nthe level of achievement for students without the resources needed to \ndo it?\n  In today's global economy, we can ill afford to give our children any \nless than the best education available. As I have said many times \nbefore, education may be expensive but ignorance costs even more.\n  I was also appalled when I saw how little this budget provides for \nconcrete investments in scientific progress.\n  In real terms, the total Federal R portfolio would decline for the \nfirst time since 1996. Total Federal support of research--basic and \napplied--would fall 0.6 percent to $54.8 billion.\n  The proposed Federal Research and Development portfolio in fiscal \nyear 2006 is $132.3 billion, 0.6 percent or $733 million above this \nyear's funding level, far short of the $2.2 billion increase needed to \nkeep pace with inflation.\n  In many respects, I feel as if those who wrote this budget have \nforgotten the lessons of history. If we look at the groundbreaking \nscientific innovations over the past two centuries, we learn that an \noverwhelming number of them have been inextricably linked to real \ninvestments this Nation has made in research and development.\n  Where will we see the next great scientific achievement? Will it be \nhere in the United States? Or will it be in China? Or England? Or \nJapan? Or Italy? The answer to that question lies in our willingness to \nmake the right choices. Unfortunately, this budget does just the \nopposite.\n  While the budget contains an overall shortfall in R funding, I am \npleased, however, that an amendment that was introduced by our \ncolleague Senator George Allen and myself was accepted and included in \nthe budget resolution. The budget had proposed to cut over $700 million \nout of NASA's Aeronautics budget over the next five years. Our \namendment increases subsonic and hypersonic aeronautics research and \ndevelopment funding by $1.58 billion over 5 years, with an offset.\n  Aerospace and aviation are important assets for America and for my \nhome State of Connecticut. In addition to its obvious national security \nbenefits, the aeronautics industry makes a critical contribution to our \nNation's economic growth and standard of living. We cannot continue to \njust give the minimum to aeronautics research and development if we \nwant to be able to effectively compete in aeronautics and in the world \neconomy. Acceptance of this amendment is a step forward in \ndemonstrating that the United States is committed to our aviation and \naeronautics industry and innovation.\n  If I listed every area in which this budget fails our Nation, I would \nbe here much longer than my allotted time. But I would like to quickly \noutline just a few more of the critical priorities that this budget has \nshortchanged in order to provide tax cuts for millionaires:\n  Veterans funding would by cut by $14.5 billion. This administration \nconstantly preaches the rhetoric of supporting our troops, yet it has \nconsistently come up short when it comes to meeting the needs of those \nwho have made great sacrifices for our freedoms.\n  Just as this budget fails those who protected our freedoms abroad, it \nendangers those who keep us safe here at home. It cuts firefighter \nassistance grants--grants that have helped fire departments buy new \ntrucks, safety equipment, radios, hazmat suits--by 31 percent. It cuts \nfunding for the COPS program--which supports police officers throughout \nour nation--by 96 percent.\n  We have known since the first roads of the Roman Empire that the fate \nof nations hinges in many respects on their ability to move people, \ngoods, and services as efficiently as possible. Yet this budget cuts \n$15.9 billion in transportation funding.\n  Reductions in natural resource and environmental programs would total \n$29 billion over five years. This budget also fails to protect the \nArctic refuge from drilling.\n  The budget also cuts child care assistance for 300,000 children \nthrough 2009. It is absurd to be cutting child care assistance for \nstruggling parents at the same time that the President proposes that \nmore low-income parents work longer hours. It is not just absurd, it is \nirresponsible. If you want welfare reform, you simply must have child \ncare, as well.\n  This budget would terminate the Community Services Block Grant, \nleaving working poor families affected by the President's budget cuts \nwith nowhere to turn for assistance.\n  I know that we can do better than this budget. Actually, we must do \nbetter, so that we can truly move our country forward, and do what is \nbest for families everywhere.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/17/senate-section/article/S2967-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2967-S2968]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             HORIZON MINERS\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, Smithers, WV, is a town of 904 residents on \nthe banks of the Kanawha River, just outside of the state capitol of \nCharleston. Last October some 1,500 active coal miners and retirees, \nalong with their wives, their children, their families, sat inside a \nhot and crowded gymnasium trying to cope with how, in a few short \nweeks, their lives had been turned upside down.\n  Two months earlier, a bankruptcy judge whom they had never met, and \nwho resides in another state, vitiated their collective bargaining \nagreement. In West Virginia, this judge cost 270 active miners their \njobs, and, along with 1,270 retirees and their dependents, rescinded \ntheir health benefits. These folks gathered in that gymnasium trying to \nunderstand what had happened and what could be done.\n  They are the Horizon miners. They are good, strong people. They \ndevote themselves to their labors, and take pride in their work. They \nare committed, hardworking individuals who contribute much and ask for \nnothing more than simple fairness. And so imagine how they are made to \nfeel, the anguish, frustration, and betrayal they are made to feel, \nwhen they learn the health benefits they labored for, the job security \nthey I toiled for, has been taken away.\n  One can hardly blame these workers for feeling as though the world \nhas ganged up on them. Their former employer, Horizon Natural \nResources, for which they loyally worked for many years, had lobbied \nintensely in bankruptcy court to eliminate the health benefits of its \nown employees. In a U.S. court, where every honest man should expect a \nfair shake from an impartial judge, these workers were betrayed by the \njudicial system.\n  The judge, with the rap of a gavel, vitiated the 1992 Coal Industry \nRetiree Health Benefit Act, legislation passed by the Congress and \nsigned by the President, to provide qualified coal miners with \nguaranteed health benefits, a promise dating back to President Harry S. \nTruman's pledge to John L. Lewis in 1946. One judge overturned a 60-\nyear-old promise that had been codified by the Congress and endorsed by \nthree Presidents. It was a disgraceful, shameful act.\n  These Horizon coal miners, betrayed by their employer, beguiled by \nthe courts, now turn to their elected representatives in the Congress \nfor help. And, thanks in large part to the efforts of Congressman Nick \nRahall and Senators Rockefeller and Specter, the Senate is in a \nposition to get something done.\n  Building on Senator Rockefeller's efforts, Senator Specter has \nintroduced legislation to help the Horizon miners. I urge the Judiciary \nCommittee to take a careful look at that legislation. I urge the \ncommittee to hold hearings, and to listen to the plight of those coal \nminers and their families affected by Horizon's bankruptcy. This is an \nissue that affects not just the Horizon coal miners, but workers across \nthe Nation who have seen their pension and health benefits taken from \nthem.\n  It is happening across West Virginia. It is happening across the \nAppalachian region. It is happening in Indiana, Kentucky, and Illinois. \nIn West Virginia, it is affecting elderly workers who are near \nretirement. What security they had is gone. What they had been \npromised, they have no time to get back. In such circumstances, it is \nincumbent upon the Congress to take action.\n  I urge the Finance Committee, as well as the Judiciary Committee, to \nconsider these issues. I urge both committees to hold hearings and \nsolicit\n\n[[Page S2968]]\n\ntestimony from those workers affected. The chairman of the Finance \nCommittee has said that his committee ought to look at the issues \nraised by Senators Specter and Rockefeller in the context of a \ncomprehensive review and a comprehensive solution. That makes sense, \nand I am encouraged by his statement.\n  Abraham Lincoln reminds us that ``Inasmuch [as] most good things are \nproduced by labor, it follows that [all] such things of right belong to \nthose whose labor has produced them.''\n  The Horizon miners labored for their health benefits, and they ought \nby right have them. Let us organize our efforts. Let us build momentum, \nand let us, at long last, take a stand in defense of the men and women \nwho epitomize America's time-honored work ethic.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/17/senate-section/article/S2968-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2968-S2969]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LIONS AND LAMBS\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this Sunday is special for two reasons. It \nis the first day of spring and it is also Palm Sunday, the beginning of \nthe Christian Holy Week. Both events mark triumphant arrivals, of Jesus \ninto Jerusalem, and the start of the season of rebirth, of lengthening \ndays, warm earth, and growing things.\n  At this time of year, many people quote an adage to the effect that \n``March comes in like a lion, and goes out like a lamb.'' An unknown \npoet said it better:\n\n     The March wind roars\n     Like a lion in the sky,\n     And makes us shiver\n     As he passes by.\n\n     When winds are soft,\n     And the days are warm and clear,\n     Just like a gentle lamb,\n     Then spring is here.\n\n  The exact origins of the March saying are not clear. Observers of the \nweather may assert that the saying reflects common springtime weather \npatterns, when shifting pressure gradients create the strong gusty \nwinds so closely associated with March. Indeed, March marks the \nbeginning of the tornado season in North America. We have certainly \nseen some strong cold winds recently, shaking the few remaining dry \nbrown leaves out of the trees and whirling them across lawns and roads. \nDaffodils and crocus have been lured into bloom only to be buried under \nsnow or ice. This year, winter is still roaring in March, with howling \nwinds, snowstorms, ice, and rain across the nation. The poet Henry Van \nDyke (1852-1933) once observed that:\n\n       The first day of spring is one thing, and first spring day \n     is another. The difference between them is sometimes as great \n     as a month.\n\n  We can but hope that the gentle lamb-like weather arrives soon.\n  Some skywatchers believe the adage has a heavenly source. They point \nout that the constellation Leo, the lion, is rising in the eastern \nhorizon at the beginning of March, hence the ``coming in like a lion,'' \nwhile Aries, the ram, sets on the western horizon at the end of March, \nand so ``departs like a lamb.'' Some Christian observers point out that \nMarch is typically a Lenten month, in which Jesus, the Lamb of God, is \nsacrificed on the cross, only to return in the future as the Lion of \nJudah to rule over the world of men.\n  I do not know which theory is correct, but each is plausible and \nintriguing. They provide food for thought as gardeners rake out flower \nbeds and till vegetable plots on the warm, sunny afternoons that crop \nout amid the rain and late snow flurries. They reassure us that, \nwhichever is true, the world is behaving normally. If we are only \npatient a little while longer, the March winds will push winter along \nand leave the glorious spring in their wake.\n  Age is supposed to bring with it patience, but I find that each year \nI am just as eager for spring to arrive as I was when I was a boy. I \nmay be even more eager than I was as a boy, since snowball fights and \nsledding down hills have been replaced with shoveling walks, scraping \nicy windshields, and higher heating bills. I am ready to shed my winter \ncoat, ready to feel the sun on my face, ready to see the flowers bloom \nand the grass grow. I am ready to plant a few tomatos. I may not run \nthrough the fields and woods anymore, but I like to sit outside with my \nwife, Erma, and watch our little dog explore the backyard. I look \nforward to watching my grandchildren hunt for Easter eggs in the soft, \nnew grass.\n  The vernal equinox marks the first day of spring, the perfect balance \nof light and dark, day and night. On Sunday, for the first time each \nyear, day and night are equal. But then the sun triumphs over the dark \ndays of winter. Each day through the spring, the period of sunlight \ngrows a little longer, like the grass in the yard. Each day, the birds \nstart singing a little earlier, and continue their song just a little \nlater in the evening.\n\n     For winter's rains and ruins are over,\n     And all the season of snows and sins;\n     The days dividing lover and lover,\n     The light that loses, the night that wins;\n     And time remembered is grief forgotten\n     And frosts are slain and flowers begotten,\n     And in green underwood and cover Blossom by blossom the \n           spring begins.\n\n  So wrote the poet Algernon Charles Swinburne--1837-1909--in his 1965 \npoem, ``Atalanta in Calydon.'' In March, the daffodils, crocus, and \nforsythia bloom, adding their springtime yellow and Lenten purple to \nwinter's faded palette of gray and brown. But look closely, and you can \nsee buds swelling into life on twigs and branches. Vibrant reddish buds \nreassure gardeners that the roses came through the winter, and will \nsoon grace us with their beauty and sweet fragrance. The glorious \nparade of bloom and blossom will soon begin.\n  It seems more than happy coincidence that Easter is a springtime \nevent. Like spring itself, the story of Easter is one of rebirth, of \nlight triumphing over darkness. Palm Sunday, the arrival of Jesus into \nJerusalem those many years ago, is shadowed with the knowledge of the \ndark days to come--Jesus' betrayal, capture, and tortured procession \nwith the cross on his back and crown of thorns on his brow. But after \nhis death comes his resurrection and ascension, his rise from the \ndarkness of the tomb to the light of Heaven.\n\n  Each spring, as we relive his great sacrifice for us, we can rejoice \nin his great promise of rebirth, even as we are surrounded by the \nearth's rebirth.\n  The celebration of birth and growth persists even in the most \ncommercialized aspects of today's Easter celebration. Like the March \nwinds adage, the origins of the Easter egg have been lost to time, but \nfor untold centuries, eggs have symbolized fertility, resurrection and \nnew life. The ancient Greeks, Persians, and Chinese exchanged eggs \nduring their spring festivals. Some pagan traditions held that Heaven \nand Earth were formed from two halves of an egg.\n  Christian traditions have adapted this ancient symbol to the Easter \nritual, wedding the ideas of earthly rebirth to spiritual resurrection. \nOnce forbidden during Lent in the Middle Ages, eggs reappeared on \nEaster Sunday on the dinner table as well as being given as gifts. In \nGreece, eggs are dyed red to represent the blood of Christ. In Germany \nand Austria, green eggs are exchanged on Maundy, or Holy, Thursday. \nMany cultures have developed elaborate decorations for blown or \nhardboiled eggs, from the graphic Russian `pysanki' eggs to those with \nreligious symbols and scenes carefully painted on them.\n  Whatever the tradition, Easter eggs remain a springtime delight. The \nfun of making them is overcome only by the fun of hiding them and \nwatching small hands tightly clutching decorated baskets loaded with \ntheir brightly colored bounty. Of course, today's Easter baskets are \nalso filled with chocolate eggs, jelly beans, and marshmallow treats--\nsome 90 million chocolate Easter bunnies, 700 million marshmallow \nPeeps, and 16 billion jellybeans each year, according to some reports. \nOlder Easter food traditions, such as the hot cross buns once given to \nthe poor by monks, and pretzels, with crossed arms resembling a person \nat prayer, have fallen from favor before this onslaught of sugar.\n  As Erma and I watch our children, our children's children, and now, \nour great-grandchildren, continue this happy custom, we are thankful \nonce again for these, our blessings. Their new lives, like those of \nchildren everywhere, are treasured gifts. On this coming Easter, in \nthis first week of spring, I know I am not alone in giving thanks.\n  I close with a short poem by Louise Seymour Jones, called ``Who Loves \na Garden.'' In just a few lines, she marries the spheres of heaven and \nearth,\n\n[[Page S2969]]\n\nthe greening of the land, the rebirth of the flowers as well as the \nspirit, and work that is a labor of love.\n\n                           Who Loves a Garden\n\n     Who loves a garden\n     Finds within his soul\n     Life's whole;\n     He hears the anthem of the soil\n     While ingrates toil;\n     And sees beyond his little sphere\n     He waving fronds of heaven, clear.\n  Mr. President, I have a parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Today we had an opportunity to discuss and pass a very important \npiece of legislation. Most people would think I am referring to the \nbudget, which we spent the better part of the day on, but we spent 15 \nprecious minutes talking about an issue that many Americans are \nthinking about tonight; that is, the case of Terri Schiavo in the State \nof Florida. I wanted to congratulate my colleague from Florida, Senator \nMartinez, for his effort in drafting the piece of legislation that \ncould get, frankly, the impossible done--to get in the midst of an at \ntimes rancorous budget debate--a very unique consensus in this place, \nunique in this respect: 100 Senators had to agree to pass this bill. It \nis difficult enough to get 100 people, much less 100 Senators, to agree \nto do anything, particularly during an often difficult process that we \nhave been going through, but not only did we get 100 Senators to agree \nto allow this bill to be passed, but we did so when some Members on the \nother side of the aisle were not supporting the bill. That is somewhat \nremarkable.\n  I give a lot of credit to the Senator from Florida, Senator Martinez, \nthe two leaders, the ranking member of the Budget Committee, Senator \nConrad, Senator Harkin, and others who worked to bring this issue to \nthe Senate floor and to deal with it in a way that accomplished \nsomething vitally important; that is, giving the family of Terri \nSchiavo hope that the end will not begin tomorrow.\n  I will talk more specifically about it. I will yield to my colleague, \nSenator Martinez, and Senator Brownback. Both have been obviously \nincredibly active and helpful.\n\n  We are still working this process. The House has passed one bill, and \nwe have passed a different one. I have been, as well as many here in \nthis Chamber, back and forth between the House. I missed the next to \nthe last vote because of meetings I was having over in the House. I \nnever like to miss a vote, but I guess if we miss a vote, this is \nprobably as good a reason to miss one.\n  We are still working very hard to see if we can find some common \nground so we can address this issue that is so vitally important--not \nallowing a death sentence to be handed down to a young woman without a \nFederal court review.\n  We are working here on the Senate side very diligently. Not only do \nwe work together to pass the bill Senator Martinez authored, but we are \nworking on the House bill. There will be meetings tomorrow with several \nMembers of the Senate who have concerns about that bill to determine \nwhether there is a possibility that we can, in fact, accept the House \nbill on this side of the aisle. Those meetings will take place \ntomorrow, and we will have a session on Monday in which we can \npotentially, if we get an agreement, pass that bill. But that is \nsomething we are going to work on.\n  I can tell you, having spoken to both Senator Reid and Senator \nDurbin, and others on the other side of the aisle--they have helped us \narrange meetings with Members who have concerns about that issue, the \nHouse bill on the Democratic side of the aisle. We are putting those \nmeetings together. We are going to have those discussions, we are going \nto see if this is something that can be acceptable and passed, and \nagain we have to pass with unanimous consent. That process is underway.\n  Many in this Chamber believe the House bill is a superior way to go. \nI know the House strongly feels that way. Relief provided in the House \nbill does something that is essential; that is, take the case out of \nthe hands of the judge who seems determined to end the life of Terri \nSchiavo. Removing that case from that judge into the Federal court is \nthe most effective way to get a fair hearing. I think that has a lot of \nmerit.\n  We are hopeful we can have this good discussion. But I will tell you \nwe have had an air of cooperation here in the Senate that, candidly, \nwas heartwarming. We sort of got past not just the particulars, because \nI don't think there is any politics in this, but even some of the \nphilosophical and policy concerns that people have and understood the \ngenuine concern that many Members here have for the evolving situation \nin Florida.\n  I commend my colleagues. This was a very fine moment for the Senate. \nIt is continuing to be that as we continue to search for an answer--an \nanswer that can get the House and the Senate together. I am hopeful \nthat the House will do likewise, will reflect on the Senate bill. I \nknow it is a very difficult row to hoe for the House.\n  We will be back in session on Monday. The House will be back in \nsession on Monday. Again, I don't know whether we will be able to get \nanything solved by then. But I will tell you at least on the Senate \nside we will continue to work on that. We will continue to see if we \ncan find some common ground. I am hopeful we will be able to reach--in \nfact, we must reach a conclusion.\n  It would be unconscionable to leave with both parties having \nexpressed a will to do something. Both bodies with identical intent and \ncannot find the words to come together to accomplish that joint intent \nthat has passed overwhelmingly in both Chambers. That would be a crime \non top of a crime that is being committed in the State of Florida.\n  I am happy to yield to the Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania \nfor the incredible work he has been doing on behalf of this woman in \nFlorida. His guidance and leadership have been a great sign to me of \nhow effective a Senate can be and how compassionate a heart can be as \nwell. I echo his comments in terms of the cooperation in the Senate.\n  I believe today Members of both parties came together to pass a bill \nthat is designed to ensure this woman has an opportunity to have a \nreview of her case by a Federal judge in the hopes that maybe her \nparents may prevail, but whatever the outcome may be, so she may have \nand we may be assured that every last measure of justice has been given \nto her.\n  I also am very pleased the House of Representatives acted swiftly \noutside normal procedure in order to make this happen. I am very \ngrateful for their work. I am grateful for what they did. It is \nunfortunate we came at it because of the rush of business over the last \nseveral days, the very shortened period of time we had available to end \nup with two versions of this bill that differ. Their approach, which is \na removal of approach, is not specific to any one individual. I know \nthe House, for very good reasons, for historical reasons of good faith \nand for very good reasons, has had a reticence to do a private or \nindividual bill. I understand that concern. I also know how difficult \nit was for some Members on the other side of the aisle particularly to \ngo along with that measure because it was interpreted by some to maybe \nbe too broad.\n  We are acting in good faith, and their concerns were, again, \nreasonable, while maybe I would disagree with them. Unfortunately, the \nonly vehicle we could find in this very short timeframe was to utilize \nthe bill we had in the Senate\n\n[[Page S2970]]\n\nwhich found favor enough for there to be unanimous consent to proceed.\n  A number of inquiries have been made whether this is over. It is not. \nWe continue to work diligently. We continue to work toward a solution, \ntoward bringing the two bodies together so we can get a bill to the \nPresident. I am encouraged the President today has made it clear he \nwill sign a bill if we get it to him. We must continue to work in this \nspirit of cooperation, not only among both sides of the aisle, majority \nand minority in the Senate, but also across this building, one end to \nthe other, House and Senate, all intent on a result that will give this \nfinal review by a Federal court the opportunity for this woman to have \nthat final measure of compassion, and at the end I am hopeful we will \nreach a solution.\n  As my colleague from Pennsylvania stated, we will be in session on \nMonday, and we will continue to work and negotiate on this over the \nweekend, tomorrow, and I am very hopeful we will find a solution. I am \nan optimist, and I am of the belief that we will be able to prevail in \nthis matter. I am very grateful for the help and cooperation from our \nleader, who has been working very diligently, who did the research \nmedically, who became convinced about this case. I have had Members \nfrom both sides of the aisle say all day there is something about this \ncase, that it seems like it ought to have one more review. That is the \nspirit in which we say this.\n  I am happy to yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I join my colleagues from Pennsylvania and Florida to \ntalk about Terri Schiavo's case, and to the names of the people around \nthe world who are praying for Terri Schiavo, a lady they have never \nknown. They have seen pictures of her on television, but something is \njust striking at them, saying, this woman deserves to live. She \ndeserves to have another review. The covenant with death needs to be \nbroken, and will be.\n  This body has spoken tonight in a bipartisan, unanimous fashion to \nwork on this. There are a lot of opinions on the factual and legal \nissues surrounding it, but we came together unanimously to give her \nthat right to have one more review by a Federal court.\n  I thank Senator Reid from Nevada, who was very helpful in working \nthis, Senator Wyden, who worked on things for his State, and Senator \nLevin. A number of people helped to make this move forward, and Senator \nMartinez carried the freight with Senator Santorum.\n  This is a fine moment for this body, but it should not end here. I \nplead with those people involved directly, the courts directly involved \nin this, let this process move forward. Don't pull the tubes out \ntomorrow. We passed one bill in the House and one bill in the Senate. \nThat should be extraordinary enough that they say this deserves one \nmore look. Why wouldn't we give one more look? This is a purely \ninnocent life we are talking about. The lengths we will go to for \npeople who are convicted of a crime--we give much further review by a \ncourt of law. Here is a purely innocent life. Tomorrow, this could all \nend. But it shouldn't. It must not end that way.\n\n  We have some differences between the House and Senate version. \nFrankly, for myself, I think the House version is good. We could not \nmove that through. We will keep meeting here. I met with the House \nleadership and chairman in the House with concerns, feeling theirs is a \nbetter approach. That is accurate. That is the way to go.\n  We are at a point in time where we should no longer have debate. We \nhave to try to come together and plead with the court to hold this off \nso we can get moving. And more than that, a moral code in America right \nnow is being discussed and is being acted upon through one person's \nlife. It is so critical this be done right and be done thoughtfully and \nevery chance for final review be given for an innocent life. A purely \ninnocent life is at stake.\n  I am confident we can come forward with that. We must come forward \nwith that for the sake of Terri Schiavo and for the sake of this \ncountry and for its message around the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/17/senate-section/article/S2970-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2970-S2971]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   STATUS OF U.S. AND EUROPEAN UNION AIRCRAFT FINANCING NEGOTIATIONS\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, today the President of the United States \nnominated former Representative Rob Portman to serve as our next U.S. \nrepresentative and trade ambassador. I am hopeful that my colleagues on \nthe Senate Finance Committee will move expeditiously to hold a hearing \nand approve his nomination as soon as possible.\n  In January of this year, the current U.S. trade representative and a \nteam of European Union negotiators agreed to sit down to try to \nnegotiate a new agreement for how aerospace markets will work in the \nfuture. We are 60-days into the 90-day period that they set for their \nown discussions. Even though our current trade representative, \nAmbassador Zoellick, has been confirmed as Deputy Secretary of State, \nhe is going to continue negotiating on behalf of the U.S. Government. I \nknow these negotiations are in very capable hands, and I applaud the \naggressive stance being taken by the Administration on these trade \ntalks.\n  These trade talks were entered into by both sides knowing full well \nthat World Trade Organization sanctions were a real possibility if the \nplaying field in aerospace does not become fairer. Both sides \ndemonstrated a willingness to get rid of unfair subsidies and a good \nfaith stance on both sides to negotiate. That is why I come to the \nSenate floor now to make sure the European Union knows we in the United \nStates Senate remain very committed to these discussions. We are also \nvery concerned that they are not at the table in good faith, if in fact \nthe clock is ticking away and we are not making progress towards the \ngoal of eliminating unfair subsidized financing of airplanes.\n  That 90-day clock is indeed ticking, and if a settlement is going to \nbe reached on this matter without WTO intervention, it needs to happen \nimmediately. There are fewer than 30 days left in the agreed time \nframe.\n  From the news reports, these discussions seem to be at a standstill. \nObviously, these discussions need to be re-energized and, hopefully, \nachieve a successful end result. Otherwise, as I have mentioned, the \nparties will be forced into a WTO battle, and I am sure Congress will \nconsider other tools that are at our disposal, as the administration \ncontinues to seek swift and firm action in this case.\n  To date, the Bush administration and the trade negotiators have shown \nsolid leadership and strong resolve, first in bringing this case to the \nWTO last fall. Second, it approached subsequent negotiations with the \nEU in a serious commitment to reach an end resolution.\n  I have to say, in the beginning it seemed that the Europeans were \nequally interested in a settlement because Commissioner Mandelson, the \nEuropean Union's chief negotiator, signaled in a public comment, ``We \nneed to make progress, and I intend to do so.'' This was reported by \nthe Bloomberg News Service. He also said: ``The objectives of the \nnegotiations are primarily to establish fair market-based competition \nbetween Boeing and Airbus.''\n  Despite these public comments, EU negotiator actions and subsequent \nrhetoric suggest something different than ending unfair subsidized \nfinancing. Instead of a genuine commitment to end subsidies, the \nEuropeans have walked away from their commitment to this goal.\n  Now, it seems that the discussions may be dragged out over a much \nlonger period of time, maybe avoiding resolution or delaying a path to \nactually eliminating these subsidies. It is very important that the EU \nmeet its commitment to end these negotiations on time.\n  When these parties reached an initial accord in 1992, a number of \nimportant issues were unresolved. We do not want to make the same \nmistake this time by leaving too much on the table, only to see the WTO \ncome in, in a process that we know will be more of a winner-take-all \nprocess.\n  In particular, EU negotiators must remain intent in staying at the \ntable to discuss the issue of launch aid, the single most troublesome \nissue that I think we need to discuss. The United\n\n[[Page S2971]]\n\nStates cannot stand by while the EU stalls these discussions about \nlaunch aid.\n  Today, we all know the aerospace industry remains very important to \nthe United States. The aerospace sector generates about 15 percent of \nour Nation's gross domestic product. However, I think the real issue \nfor us is that the United States builds and finances planes through \nWall Street and the private marketplace. Our domestic companies should \nnot have to compete against the backing of European governments, \nagainst the deep pockets of governments that distort the global \nmarketplace.\n  If, in fact, the EU drags its feet, how will these issues be \nresolved? Will they continue to argue that these launch aid subsidies \nare not the issue? Launch aid has provided Airbus with over $15 billion \nin subsidization, really unfairly propping up Airbus at the expense of \nthe U.S. aerospace market and its workers. In the last 15 years, the \nU.S. aerospace industry has lost about 700,000 jobs.\n  Essentially, launch aid becomes a risk-free, low-cost government bank \nfor the development of new lines of aircraft. The company only needs to \nrepay the loans if the new product succeeds. Nowhere in our private \nsector does anybody, any company, get such a deal that they only have \nto pay the banker back if, in fact, the product succeeds. So this is a \nvery important issue.\n  Obviously, launch aid puts our domestic manufacturers at an unfair \ncompetitive disadvantage. Airbus remains unfettered by the realities of \nthe marketplace when launching new jetliners, while American companies \nmust assume substantial market risk every time they unveil a new \nproduct. If Airbus bets on the wrong plane, no problem, no harm, no \nfoul, the loans are forgiven. This means Airbus can proceed with the \ndesign and production of a new plane without ever turning a profit on \nan existing product line. It also means that Airbus can undercut the \nprice and pursue more aggressive financing practices than the U.S. can. \nObviously, you can see the end result is that Airbus can offer a \ncheaper plane in the marketplace by unfairly subsidizing the financing \nof their planes.\n  Well, nevertheless, Airbus has continued, even though it has grown \ninto a mature company, to receive 33 percent of the funding for its \nproduct development from European governments since 1992, translating \ninto billions in launch aid loans at below market rates. At the same \ntime, it has avoided an additional $35 billion in current debt due to \nthis subsidy. This launch aid distorts the global marketplace.\n  What we want to see in aerospace is competition that drives \nopportunities for the consumers. I believe that is why the United \nStates has taken its aggressive position in saying that it will go to \nthe WTO if necessary. I think it is time now to make sure that these \nnegotiations between the United States and the European Union, which \noriginally were announced in January, are completed as soon as \npossible. But maybe it is not surprising that they are lagging at this \nmoment.\n  I say that because Airbus has moved ahead with a plan to submit $1.7 \nbillion in an application for new launch aid for a new airplane, the A-\n350, which is designed to compete head-to-head with the Boeing 787. \nWhile negotiations to end launch aid are ongoing, there is \nsimultaneously a new application to the European Union to support \nlaunch aid for a new plane. I believe that is probably why the Airbus \nCEO stated, about the new plane, the A-350: `` . . . is easily \nfinanceable [sic] by Airbus without launch aid, but as long as there is \nrefundable launch aid available, we will apply for it.'' This means, as \nlong as they can get refunds later on launch aid, they will apply for \nit.\n\n  So while the European Union is supposedly at the table negotiating \nwith the United States about getting rid of launch aid subsidies, it is \ncontinuing to discuss deals about launch aid for new planes.\n  It is clear that this does not paint a pretty picture. The European \nUnion cannot have it both ways. It cannot pretend to be serious about \nnegotiations with the United States to end launch aid subsidies and all \nthe while sending a wink to Airbus about launch aid for the A-350.\n  The EU must level with the American public and the global community \non whether it is serious about ending unfair subsidized financing of \ntheir aircraft.\n  Specifically, I think Commissioner Mandelson and the EU should \nconsider the following actions: first, EU negotiators should declare \ntheir opposition to the launch aid for the A-350 and summarily reject \nthe pending application that Airbus has prepared. Second, the EU should \nalso reject all launch aid for future aircraft models.\n  We need to address these unfair subsidized financing issues and put \nan end to launch aid so that aircraft financing is on a level playing \nfield. Failure to follow these processes will lead to swift action by \nour administration and the U.S. Government. Today, the U.S. stands \nready to reach a resolution on this issue, but we must have a willing \npartner. The White House has expressed a strong commitment to finding \nan agreement, and the President has the backing of this Senator, and I \nbelieve many in Congress, to seek a resolution to this issue. I am sure \nmy colleagues will join me in considering all options at our disposal \nto help find a resolution to this issue.\n  Last week, I was invited to the Smithsonian for a commemorative \ncelebration of Space Ship One, a successful marvel, sponsored by Paul \nAllen and many others. The celebration marked the successful launch of \nthe first commercial, manned spaceflight-something from which \nindividual consumers will benefit in the future. The Smithsonian \nNational Air and Space Museum gave that award, and the flight signaled \na new chapter in aviation history. There's something about the spirit \nof competition, about a group of people who came together to compete \ntowards an exciting new chapter of aviation, and a level playing field \nof competition that delivered a great result.\n  Which is exactly what we have to get from the Europeans--a level \nplaying field, to deliver a better result for the entire global \ncommunity, for consumers, and for purchasers of aerospace and \ncommercial aviation equipment by guaranteeing that we are going to have \na level playing field.\n  I hope that these negotiations will continue in earnest and I am \nconfident that Ambassador Zoellick and the new nominee, Mr. Portman, \nwill continue to be aggressive in resolving this issue. I believe we in \nthe United States have fostered an environment for true competition for \nthe private sector, to drive this industry to the next level. However, \nwe need fair and balanced trade to make that successful.\n  I hope the Europeans will not stall these discussions, but that they \nwill embrace the idea of fair competition as the end result.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on March 9, 2005, President Bush went to \nColumbus, OH for one of his many town hall meetings. Besides attempting \nto sell his Social Security plan, he also spoke about the need for a \nnational energy policy. Not surprisingly, he raised the specter of high \ngas prices, increasing natural gas rates, and electricity blackouts as \na justification to pass his energy plan. However, this issue needs more \nthan just rhetoric. It needs real solutions.\n  The American people need look no further than the President's budget \nrequest to question that commitment to a serious energy policy. The \nPresident has cut funding for a number of important energy programs in \nhis budget. For example, he has said that he supports clean coal \ntechnologies. He started professing his support on the campaign trail \nin October 2000, and he promised to commit $2 billion over 10 years for \nthe Clean Coal Technology demonstration program. This is the very \nprogram that I started back in 1985. Yet, each of his five budgets has \nfailed to meet that goal. This year, he only requested $50 million, \ninstead of the promised $200 million. In effect, he has promised those \nin the coal fields one dollar but has only anted up two bits. \nFurthermore, he touts the need for the FutureGen project but cannot say \nwhere the funding for this facility is going to come from down the \nroad. His only option right now is to raid other clean coal programs, \nand I will not stand by and let him rob Peter to pay Paul.\n  The White House has proposed and the Majority has adopted just $4.56 \nbillion in energy tax incentives over five years in this Fiscal Year \n2006 budget. How much did the President include for clean coal tax \nincentives in this year's budget request, or in previous years' budget \nrequests? Nothing! We cannot demonstrate and deploy the next generation \nof clean coal technologies based on what this administration is \nactually willing to put on the table. The administration's co-called \nsupport for the clean coal technology programs is indicative of its \nsupport for so many important energy programs. This administration's \nmuch narrower package of energy tax incentives is inadequate to achieve \nour national energy policy goals.\n  I have long believed that the U.S. needs a comprehensive and balanced \nnational energy policy. The looming concerns of electricity blackouts, \nenergy prices, and increased dependence on foreign energy sources \nrepresent ominous clouds on the horizon. Sadly, our energy problems, \nlike so many other challenges, are being addressed with ever shrinking \nfunds and band-aid solutions. The pattern has been repeated over and \nover again. The Bush administration generates new initiatives, fails to \nfully fund them, and then simultaneously cuts other important programs. \nAt the same time, we have witnessed attempts to put a moratorium on \nfederal gas taxes, to tap the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and to make \nsecretive deals with Saudi Arabia to produce more oil. We have \nendeavored to treat the symptoms, rather than the core problem, for far \ntoo long. This President may talk a good game, but how are we going to \nfix our energy ills with this President's prescription?\n\n  The United States needs affordable, reliable, and clean energy \nresources and technologies to support a growing economy and a healthy \nenvironment. We need a comprehensive, balanced, and diversified \nnational energy policy that will promote a strong energy efficiency \nprogram and bolster our Nation's coal, natural gas, oil, renewable, \nnuclear, and other clean domestic energy technologies. A strong energy \npolicy must help to maintain and upgrade these our critical energy \ninfrastructure and support, retain, and create energy-related \nmanufacturing and other service jobs that are an underpinning of our \neconomy. A bipartisan energy strategy should encourage increased use of \nthe most advanced energy supply and energy efficiency technologies and \nmust support increased investments in an array of energy research and \ndevelopment programs.\n  Our Nation needs to begin defining alternative pathways and new \napproaches that go beyond the extremist debates and simplistic \nsolutions that define our very demanding energy security and \nenvironmental challenges. It is time to move along that path. I urge my \ncolleagues in the Senate to support an appropriate, equitable, and \ndiversified mixture of at least $15.5 billion in targeted energy tax \nincentives over the next ten years, and I urge the Finance Committee to \nfind offsets so that this can be done in a fiscally sound way.\n  In the 108th Congress, the Senate supported a similar level for \nenergy incentives. The Senate's Fiscal Year 2004 Budget Resolution, the \nlast budget that Congress passed, provided for $15.5 billion in energy \ntax incentives over ten years. In 2003, the Senate Finance Committee \nadopted and the Senate passed a balanced and bipartisan package of \nenergy tax incentives in the amount of $19.8 billion over ten years as \na part of the Senate Energy Policy Act of2003, part of which was \noffset. I supported that energy tax package as it provided an array of \ntargeted energy incentives, including approximately $2 billion to \ndeploy advanced clean coal technologies.\n  Such an energy tax incentives package would help strengthen the \neconomy, enhance our Nation's energy resources, promote an array of \nadvanced energy technologies, increase jobs, and provide for a healthy \nenvironment. Is there a Member in this Chamber who is opposed to that? \nIf there are going to be tax cuts in this budget, then we must increase \nfunding for a range of energy tax incentives. Supporting at least $15.5 \nbillion in energy tax incentives will send a strong message that these \nincentives are necessary to develop a national energy policy, and I \nurge my colleagues to stand with me in this request. Unless we can \nincrease the pie for all of these energy technology approaches, there \nwill not be enough to achieve our energy goals in any serious way.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/17/senate-section/article/S2972-2", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2972-S2974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                    Staff Sergeant Melvin L.

Lee was a native of Oklahoma City, OK. He graduated \nfrom Crooked Oak High School in 2000 and enlisted in the Army. Although \nSergeant Lee initially expected to stay only for the 3-year commitment, \nhe soon chose to make a career of military service. He was assigned to \nthe United States Army's 1st Battalion, 503rd Infantry Regiment, 2nd \nBrigade Combat Team, 2nd Infantry Division.\n  Sergeant Lee is remembered as an example of service and motivation. \nAs Rusty McMurtrey, Lee's 21-year-old brother, emotionally recalled, \n``He was the reason I graduated school and got as far as I did. Since I \ncan remember, Carl was the only one who'd been there for me.'' Rusty \ncredited his older brother with saving him from a life of gangs and \nviolence. The two planned on starting an automotive business together.\n  When he had any free time, Sergeant Lee would volunteer with a local \nSpecial Olympics. It was his heart that his friends and family remember \nmost.\n  Sergeant Lee's unit, usually stationed at Camp Howze, South Korea, \nwas deployed to Iraq. He served there as part of the effort to free the \nIraqi people from the chains of tyranny and terrorism. On November 28, \n2004, his unit was conducting a foot patrol in Ar Ramadi when it came \nunder enemy small arms fire. Sergeant Lee was hit twice and died from \nthose wounds.\n  Mr. President, it is difficult to express the pain of those he left \nbehind; Sgt Carl Lee meant so much to so many and he will forever be \nremembered as a hero. By putting himself in harm's way he showed \nbravery and self-sacrifice that few of us will ever know. He gave the \nultimate measure, and we are in his eternal debt.

Mr. President, I would like to set aside a few moments \ntoday to reflect on the life of Stephen McGowan. Steve epitomized the \nbest of our country's brave men and women who fought to free Iraq and \nto secure a new democracy in the Middle East. He exhibited unwavering \ncourage, dutiful service to his country, and above all else, honor. In \nthe way he lived his life--and how we remember him--Steve reminds each \nof us how good we can be.\n  A 1996 graduate of St. Mark's High School, Steve was the son of Ms. \nBobbie McGowan, a personal friend of my family. Steve then attended the \nUniversity of Delaware and Wilmington College, studying criminal \njustice. He joined the Army 3 years ago, wanting to serve in the Army \npartly because he could not find a job with enough challenge and \nadrenaline in other careers he had considered. According to his family, \nSteve enjoyed the challenge, especially physical challenge and the\n\n[[Page S2974]]\n\nmental challenge that went with a military career--the challenge to try \nharder, get stronger, and push the limits. That was true in all aspects \nof his life. He played soccer until he graduated from high school, but \nwhen that grew too tame for him, he switched to rugby.\n  Steve enlisted on September 17, 2002, and was selected for combat \nmedic training, which he pursued with distinction at the U.S. Army \nMedical School at Sam Houston, Texas.\n  Before being deployed to Iraq, Stephen earned a parachutist badge at \nthe U.S. Army Airborne School and served for approximately 15 months \nwith the 2nd Infantry Division near the DMZ in Korea. Steve volunteered \nto join his unit's 2nd Brigade Combat Team to spare medics with spouses \nand children and arrived with the unit in Kuwait in early August 2004. \nWithin a few weeks, he deployed to Ramadi, about 45 miles west of \nBaghdad, where his unit supported the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force \nand was responsible for VIP escort, area security and other ``highly \noperated missions.'' He died when an improvised explosive device \ndetonated near his military vehicle in Ramadi, Iraq. Before returning \nhome, Steve was awarded the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the \nNational Defense Service Medal, the Korean Defense Service Medal, Good \nConduct Medal, Purple Heart, Army Commendation Medal, Army Achievement \nMedal, Armed Service Ribbon, and Global War on Terror Expedition Medal. \nA Bronze Star will be awarded posthumously.\n\n  Steve was a highly regarded young soldier. He joined the military in \nsupport of Operation Iraqi Freedom because he felt that as a single \nperson with no children, he could go and take someone else's spot. His \nfamily remembers him as the embodiment of pride, honor and dignity. He \nwas admired by every man and woman he worked with and every commanding \nofficer with whom he served. According to his sister, Michaela, ``Steve \nwas raised with the values that you find in the military and he lived \nthem. Steve touched so many lives and I'm so proud of the man he \nbecame.''\n  Despite the close calls and the fact U.S. forces in Iraq are fighting \ninsurgents who wear civilian clothes and hide among the general \npopulation, Steve and his squad carried toys and athletic equipment \nwith them when they went on patrol. Last year, he asked family and \nfriends to send him small items that he could hand out as gifts for \nIraqi children rather than Christmas presents.\n  In one e-mail, he said that Iraqi girls had become entranced by the \nsight of some Beanie Baby dolls the soldiers handed out. The story so \ntouched his mother, Bobbie McGowan, that she organized a Beanie Baby \ndrive at the Charter School of Wilmington, where she is dean of \nhumanities. Students reacted so positively to her request for the dolls \nthat she was swamped with them. Students donated so many dolls that she \nhad to send them to her son in small lots because he did not have room \nto store them all. His mother, Bobbie, takes comfort in the fact that \nher son had not only saved lives in Iraq as a medic but that he had \nalso touched many more lives by passing out toys to children. This was \na true testament to the kind of soldier--the kind of man--Steve was.\n  He was a soccer, biking, and outdoor enthusiast and will be \nremembered especially for his rugby adventures with the University of \nDelaware, the Wilmington's Men League and the 2nd Infantry Division \nRugby Club. In 2001, Steve took a trip to New Zealand while \naccompanying his rugby mate who was exploring professional rugby \nopportunities. Steve's favorite team was the All Blacks. Traveling in \nNew Zealand gave him the opportunity to do what he loved--experience \nnew cultures and have a new adventure.\n  This tragedy strikes particularly close to home. Stephen's mother, \nBobbie, is a highly regarded member of the faculty at the Charter \nSchool of Wilmington, where our sons attend high school. Steve's death \nis a terrible blow to his family and a source of deep sorrow for those \nof us privileged to know his family. I rise today to commemorate Steve, \nto celebrate his life, and to offer his family our support and our \ndeepest sympathy on their tragic loss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/17/senate-section/article/S2974-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2974-S2981]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    CHANGES TO RULES OF PROCEDURE--SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS.

SUBPOENAS\n\n       Subpoenas authorized by the Committee for the attendance of \n     witnesses or the production of memoranda, documents, records \n     or any other material may be issued by the Chairman, the Vice \n     Chairman, or any member of the Committee designated by the \n     Chairman, and may be served by any person designated by the \n     Chairman, Vice Chairman or member issuing the subpoenas. Each \n     subpoena shall have attached thereto a copy of S. Res. 400, \n     94th Congress, 2nd Session and a copy of these Rules.\n\n\n         RULE 8. PROCEDURES RELATED TO THE TAKING OF TESTIMONY\n\n       8.1 Notice.--Witnesses required to appear before the \n     Committee shall be given reasonable notice, and all witnesses \n     shall be furnished a copy of these Rules.\n       8.2 Oath or Affirmation.--Testimony of witnesses shall be \n     given under oath or affirmation which may be administered by \n     any member of the Committee.\n       8.3 Interrogation.--Committee interrogation shall be \n     conducted by members of the Committee and such Committee \n     staff as are authorized by the Chairman, the Vice Chairman, \n     or the presiding member.\n       8.4 Counsel for the Witness.--(a) Any witness may be \n     accompanied by counsel. A witness who is unable to obtain \n     counsel may inform the Committee of such fact. If the witness \n     informs the Committee of this fact at least 24 hours prior to \n     his or her appearance before the Committee, the Committee \n     shall then endeavor to obtain voluntary counsel for the \n     witness. Failure to obtain such counsel will not excuse the \n     witness from appearing and testifying.\n       (b) Counsel shall conduct themselves in an ethical and \n     professional manner. Failure to do so shall, upon a finding \n     to that effect by a majority of the members present, subject \n     such counsel to disciplinary action which may include \n     warning, censure, removal, or a recommendation of contempt \n     proceedings.\n       (c) There shall be no direct or cross-examination by \n     counsel. However, counsel may submit in writing any question \n     he wishes propounded to his client or to any other witness \n     and may, at the conclusion of his client's testimony, suggest \n     the presentation of other evidence or the calling of other \n     witnesses. The Committee may use such questions and dispose \n     of such suggestions as it deems appropriate.\n       8.5 Statements by Witnesses.--A witness may make a \n     statement, which shall be brief and relevant, at the \n     beginning and conclusion of his or her testimony. Such \n     statements shall not exceed a reasonable period of time as \n     determined by the Chairman, or other presiding members. Any \n     witness desiring to make a prepared or written statement for \n     the record of the proceedings shall file a copy with the \n     Clerk of the Committee, and insofar as practicable and \n     consistent with the notice given, shall do so at least 72 \n     hours in advance of his or her appearance before the \n     Committee.\n       8.6 Objections and Rulings.--Any objection raised by a \n     witness or counsel shall be ruled upon by the Chairman or \n     other presiding member, and such ruling shall be the ruling \n     of the Committee unless a majority of the Committee present \n     overrules the ruling of the Chair.\n       8.7 Inspection and Correction.--All witnesses testifying \n     before the Committee shall be given a reasonable opportunity \n     to inspect, in the office of the Committee, the transcript of \n     their testimony to determine whether such testimony was \n     correctly transcribed. The witness may be accompanied by \n     counsel. Any corrections the witness desires to make in the \n     transcript shall be submitted in writing to the Committee \n     within five days from the date when the transcript was made \n     available to the witness. Corrections shall be limited to \n     grammar and minor editing, and may not be made to change the \n     substance of the testimony. Any questions arising with \n     respect to such corrections shall be decided by the Chairman. \n     Upon request, those parts of testimony given by a witness in \n     executive session which are subsequently quoted or made part \n     of a public record shall be made available to that witness at \n     his or her expense.\n       8.8 Requests to Testify.--The Committee will consider \n     requests to testify on any matter or measure pending before \n     the Committee. A person who believes that testimony or other \n     evidence presented at a public hearing, or any comment made \n     by a Committee member or a member of the Committee staff, may \n     tend to affect adversely his or her reputation, may request \n     to appear personally before the Committee to testify on his \n     or her own behalf, or may file a sworn statement of facts \n     relevant to the testimony, evidence, or comment, or may \n     submit to the Chairman proposed questions in writing for the \n     cross-examination of other witnesses. The Committee shall \n     take such action as it deems appropriate.\n       8.9 Contempt Procedures.--No recommendation that a person \n     be cited for contempt of Congress shall be forwarded to the \n     Senate unless and until the Committee has, upon notice to all \n     its members, met and considered the alleged contempt, \n     afforded the person an opportunity to state in writing or in \n     person why he or she should not be held in contempt, and \n     agreed, by majority vote of the Committee, to forward such \n     recommendation to the Senate.\n       8.10 Release of Name of Witness.--Unless authorized by the \n     Chairman, the name of any witness scheduled to be heard by \n     the Committee shall not be released prior to, or after, his \n     or her appearance before the Committee. Upon authorization by \n     the Chairman to release the name of a witness under this \n     paragraph, the Vice Chairman shall be notified of such \n     authorization as soon as practicable thereafter. No name of \n     any witness shall be released if such release would disclose \n     classified information, unless authorized under Section 8 of \n     S. Res. 400 of the 94th Congress or Rule 9.6.\n\n\n    RULE 9. PROCEDURES FOR HANDLING CLASSIFIED OR SENSITIVE MATERIAL\n\n       9.1 Committee staff offices shall operate under strict \n     precautions.

All documents or materials removed from \n     the Committee offices for such authorized purposes must be \n     returned to the Committee's secure storage area for overnight \n     storage.\n       9.3 Each member of the Committee shall at all times have \n     access to all papers and other material received from any \n     source. The Staff Director shall be responsible for the \n     maintenance, under appropriate security procedures, of a \n     registry which will number and identify all classified papers \n     and other classified materials in the possession of the \n     Committee, and such registry shall be available to any member \n     of the Committee.\n       9.4 Whenever the Select Committee on Intelligence makes \n     classified material available to any other Committee of the \n     Senate or to any Member of the Senate not a member of the \n     Committee, such material shall be accompanied by a verbal \n     or written notice to the recipients advising of their \n     responsibility to protect such material pursuant to \n     Section 8 of S. Res. 400 of the 94th Congress. The Clerk \n     of the Committee shall ensure that such notice is provided \n     and shall maintain a written record identifying the \n     particular information transmitted and the Committee or \n     members of the Senate receiving such information.\n       9.5 Access to classified information supplied to the \n     Committee shall be limited to those Committee staff members \n     with appropriate security clearance and a need-to-know, as \n     determined by the Committee, and, under the Committee's \n     direction, the Staff Director and Minority Staff Director.\n       9.6 No member of the Committee or of the Committee staff \n     shall disclose, in whole or in part or by way of summary, to \n     any person not a member of the Committee or the Committee \n     staff for any purpose or in connection with any proceeding, \n     judicial or otherwise, any testimony given before the \n     Committee in executive session including the name of any \n     witness who appeared or was called to\n\n[[Page S2976]]\n\n     appear before the Committee in executive session, or the \n     contents of any papers or materials or other information \n     received by the Committee except as authorized herein, or \n     otherwise as authorized by the Committee in accordance with \n     Section 8 of S. Res. 400 of the 94th Congress and the \n     provisions of these rules, or in the event of the termination \n     of the Committee, in such a manner as may be determined by \n     the Senate.

Information discussed in executive sessions of \n     the Committee and information contained in papers and \n     materials which are not classified but which are controlled \n     by the Committee may be disclosed only to persons outside the \n     Committee who have a need-to-know such information for an \n     official governmental purpose related to the work of the \n     Committee and only if such disclosure has been authorized by \n     the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Committee, or by the \n     Staff Director and Minority Staff Director, acting on their \n     behalf.\n       9.7 Failure to abide by Rule 9.6 shall constitute grounds \n     for referral to the Select Committee on Ethics pursuant to \n     Section 8 of S. Res. 400. Prior to a referral to the Select \n     Committee on Ethics pursuant to Section 8 of S. Res. 400, the \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman shall notify the Majority Leader \n     and Minority Leader.\n       9.8 Before the Committee makes any decision regarding the \n     disposition of any testimony, papers, or other materials \n     presented to it, the Committee members shall have a \n     reasonable opportunity to examine all pertinent testimony, \n     papers, and other materials that have been obtained by the \n     members of the Committee or the Committee staff.\n       9.9 Attendance of persons outside the Committee at closed \n     meetings of the Committee shall be kept at a minimum and \n     shall be limited to persons with appropriate security \n     clearance and a need-to-know the information under \n     consideration for the execution of their official duties. \n     Notes taken at such meetings by any person in attendance \n     shall be returned to the secure storage area in the \n     Committee's offices at the conclusion of such meetings, and \n     may be made available to the department, agency, office, \n     Committee or entity concerned only in accordance with the \n     security procedures of the Committee.\n\n\n                             rule 10. staff\n\n       10.1 For purposes of these rules, Committee staff includes \n     employees of the Committee, consultants to the Committee, or \n     any other person engaged by contract or otherwise to perform \n     services for or at the request of the Committee.

An unclassified version of each report may be made \n     available to the public at the discretion of the select \n     committee. Nothing herein shall be construed as requiring the \n     public disclosure in such reports of the names of individuals \n     engaged in intelligence activities for the United States or \n     the divulging of intelligence methods employed or the sources \n     of information on which such reports are based or the amount \n     of funds authorized to be appropriated for intelligence \n     activities.\n       (c) On or before March 15 of each year, the select \n     committee shall submit to the Committee on the Budget of the \n     Senate the views and estimates described in section 301(c) of \n     the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 regarding matters within \n     the jurisdiction of the select committee.\n       Sec. 5.

No employee of the select committee or any person \n     engaged by contract or otherwise to perform service for or at \n     the request of such committee shall be given access to any \n     classified information by such committee unless such employee \n     or person has (1) agreed in writing and under oath to be \n     bound by the rules of the Senate (including the jurisdiction \n     of the [Select Committee on Ethics]) and of such committee as \n     to the security of such information during and after the \n     period of his employment or contractual agreement with such \n     committee; and (2) received an appropriate security clearance \n     as determined by such committee in consultation with the \n     Director of Central Intelligence. The type of security \n     clearance to be required in the case of any such employee or \n     person shall, within the determination of such committee in \n     consultation with the Director of Central Intelligence, be \n     commensurate with the sensitivity of the classified \n     information to which such employee or person will be given \n     access by such committee.\n       Sec. 7. The select committee shall formulate and carry out \n     such rules and procedures as it deems necessary to prevent \n     the disclosure, without the consent of the person or persons \n     concerned, of information in the possession of such committee \n     which unduly infringes upon the privacy or which violates the \n     constitutional rights of such person or persons. Nothing \n     herein shall be construed to prevent such committee from \n     publicly disclosing any such information in any case in which \n     such committee determines the national interest in the \n     disclosure of such information clearly outweighs any \n     infringement on the privacy of any person or persons.\n       Sec. 8. (a) The select committee may, subject to the \n     provisions of this section, disclose publicly any information \n     in the possession of such committee after a determination by \n     such committee that the public interest would be served by \n     such disclosure. Whenever committee action is required to \n     disclose any information under this section, the committee \n     shall meet to vote on the matter within five days after any \n     member of the committee requests such a vote. No member of \n     the select committee shall disclose any information, the \n     disclosure of which requires a committee vote, prior to a \n     vote by the committee on the question of the disclosure of \n     such information or after such vote except in accordance with \n     this section.\n       (b)(1) In any case in which the select committee votes to \n     disclose publicly any information which has been classified \n     under established security procedures, which has been \n     submitted to it by the Executive branch, and which the \n     Executive branch requests be kept secret, such committee \n     shall--\n       (A) first, notify the Majority Leader and Minority Leader \n     of the Senate of such vote; and\n       (B) second, consult with the Majority Leader and Minority \n     Leader before notifying the President of such vote.\n       (2) The select committee may disclose publicly such \n     information after the expiration of a five-day period \n     following the day on which notice of such vote is transmitted \n     to the Majority Leader and the Minority Leader the President, \n     unless, prior to the expiration of such five-day period, the \n     President, personally in writing, notifies the committee that \n     he objects to the disclosure of such information, provides \n     his reason therefore, and certifies that the threat to the \n     national interest of the United States posed by such \n     disclosure is of such gravity that it outweighs any public \n     interest in the disclosure.\n       (3) If the President, personally, in writing, notifies the \n     Majority Leader and Minority Leader of the Senate and the \n     select Committee of his objections to the disclosure of such \n     information as provided in paragraph (2), the Majority \n     Leader and Minority Leader jointly or the select \n     Committee, by majority vote, may refer the question of the \n     disclosure of such information to the Senate for \n     consideration.\n       (4) Whenever the select committee votes to refer the \n     question of disclosure of any information to the Senate under \n     paragraph (3), the chairman shall not later than the first \n     day on which the Senate is in session following the day on \n     which the vote occurs, report the matter to the Senate for \n     its consideration.\n       (5) One hour after the Senate convenes on the fourth day on \n     which the Senate is in session following the day on which any \n     such matter is reported to the Senate, or at such earlier \n     time as the majority leader and the minority leader of the \n     Senate jointly agree upon in accordance with paragraph 5 of \n     rule XVII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, the Senate \n     shall go into closed session and the mater shall be the \n     pending business. In considering the matter in closed session \n     the Senate may--\n       (A) approve the public disclosure of all or any portion of \n     the information in question, in which case the committee \n     shall publicly disclose the information ordered to be \n     disclosed.\n       (B) disapprove the public disclosure of all or any portion \n     of the information in question, in which case the committee \n     shall not publicly disclose the information ordered not to be \n     disclosed, or\n       (C) refer all or any portion of the matter back to the \n     committee, in which case the committee shall make the final \n     determination with respect to the public disclosure of the \n     information in question.\n\n     Upon conclusion of the consideration of such matter in closed \n     session, which may not extend beyond the close of the ninth \n     day on which the Senate is in session following the day on \n     which such matter was reported to the Senate, or the close of \n     the fifth day following the day agreed upon jointly by the \n     majority and minority leaders in accordance with paragraph 5 \n     of rule XVII of the Standing Rules of the Senate (whichever \n     the case may be), the Senate shall immediately vote on the \n     disposition of such matter in open session, without debate, \n     and without divulging the information with respect to which \n     the vote is being taken. The Senate shall vote to dispose of \n     such matter by one or more of the means specified in clauses \n     (A), (B), and (C) of the second sentence of this paragraph. \n     Any vote of the Senate to disclose any information pursuant \n     to this paragraph shall be subject to the right of a Member \n     of the Senate or move for reconsideration of the vote within \n     the time and pursuant to the procedures specified in rule \n     XIII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, and the disclosure \n     of such information shall be made consistent with that right.\n       (c)(1) No information in the possession of the select \n     committee relating to the lawful intelligence activities of \n     any department or agency of the United States which has been \n     classified under established security procedures and which \n     the select committee, pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) of \n     this section, has determined should not be disclosed shall be \n     made available to any person by a Member, officer, or \n     employee of the Senate except in a closed session of the \n     Senate or as provided in paragraph (2).\n       (2) The select committee may, under such regulations as the \n     committee shall prescribe to protect the confidentiality of \n     such information, make any information described in paragraph \n     (1) available to any other committee or any other Member of \n     the Senate. Whenever the select committee makes such \n     information available, the committee shall keep a written \n     record showing, in the case of any particular information, \n     which committee or which Members of the Senate received such \n     information. No Member of the Senate who, and no committee \n     which, receives any information under this subsection, shall \n     disclose such information except in a closed session of the \n     Senate.\n       (d) It shall be the duty of the [Select Committee on \n     Ethics] to investigate any unauthorized disclosure of \n     intelligence information by a Member, officer or employee of \n     the Senate in violation of subsection (c) and to report to \n     the Senate concerning any allegation which it finds to be \n     substantiated.\n       (e) Upon the request of any person who is subject to any \n     such investigation, the [Select Committee on Ethics] shall \n     release to such individual at the conclusion of its \n     investigation a summary of its investigation together with \n     its findings. If, at the conclusion of its investigation, the \n     [Select Committee on Ethics] determines that there has been a \n     significant breach of confidentiality or unauthorized \n     disclosure by a Member, officer, or employee of the Senate, \n     it shall report its findings to the Senate and recommend \n     appropriate action such as censure, removal from committee \n     membership, or expulsion from the Senate, in the case of a \n     Member, or removal from office or employment or punishment \n     for contempt, in the case of an officer or employee.\n       Sec. 9. The select committee is authorized to permit any \n     personal representative of the President, designated by the \n     President to serve as a liaison to such committee, to attend \n     any closed meeting of such committee.\n       Sec. 10. Upon expiration of the Select Committee on \n     Government Operations with Respect to Intelligence \n     Activities, established by Senate Resolution 21, Ninety-\n     fourth Congress, all records, files, documents, and \n     other materials in the possession, custody, or control of \n     such committee, under appropriate conditions established \n     by it, shall be transferred to the select committee.\n       Sec. 11.

Mr. President, on March 14 the National Congress of \nthe People's Republic of China passed a bill termed the ``Anti-\nSecession'' law that preemptively positions China to take military \naction should it judge Taiwan to be moving toward formal independence. \nWhile the threat of force from Beijing is not new, legislation that \nrefers to ``non-peaceful means,'' even described as a ``last resort'' \ncan only be seen as counterproductive. At a minimum, it is not \nconducive to building confidence between Taiwan and China nor \nfacilitating dialogue, which are key to future stability in the straits \nand to peace and prosperity for both sides. This is not an issue that \ncan be successfully resolved through military means. All would lose.\n  The timing of this law is equally unfortunate. Since the beginning of \nthis year, Chinese and Taiwanese officials have taken concrete, \npragmatic steps to build better relations--such as direct flights, \nshipping links, and increased trade. There have also been gestures of \npersonal respect and there has been a lowering of the rhetorical \ntemperature, on both sides. These are heartening developments. I \nencourage both parties to seek to expand upon them. I am convinced that \nthis is the right road for China and Taiwan, to focus on mutually \nbeneficial programs and to continue to create opportunities for more \npersonal contacts.\n  In contrast, the Anti-Secession law is awkward and unhelpful. While I \nrecognize that it also does stress the chance for peaceful settlement \nof the Taiwan issue, its thrust, coupled with an ongoing Chinese \nmilitary build-up, will be viewed by Taiwan as inimical. I urge the \nChinese government to move beyond this legislation, and this moment, \nand to demonstrate its good faith intent to work toward renewed \ndiscussions and better relations. If Beijing does so, certainly I hope \nthat Taipei will respond in kind.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/17/senate-section/article/S2981-2", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2981-S2982]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   IN HONOR OF WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of Women's \nHistory Month to recognize the advancements that women have made this \nyear and to reflect on the challenges and opportunities for the years \nahead.\n  We have set aside this month to formally pay tribute to the \ncontributions of women in the United States and around the world.\n  I would like to start by paying tribute to the women in Iraq and \nAfghanistan who are working to build their countries and to make a \nbetter life for themselves and their families. These women have been \nfreed from oppressive regimes and as their nations rebuild now must \nsecure their rights for all time.\n  Women throughout the Arab World are making their way into public \nlife.\n\n[[Page S2982]]\n\nIn some countries, they are being elected to office, named to cabinet-\nlevel posts and appointed to leading positions in powerful civil \nsociety organizations--these are the thought-leaders and the pioneers. \nBut there is another, parallel movement that has also begun: the quiet \nleadership of ordinary women who are doing extraordinary things.\n  On January 30, scores of Iraqi women poured into polling stations in \ncities and rural communities. Braving bullets, bombs, and substantial \npersonal threat, they joined their fellow countrymen to vote in the \nnation's first free election, an act that warrants our deepest respect.\n  When I reflect on their courage, I realize that in the United States \nwe have no point of reference to understand what they must have felt on \nthat Monday in January. Though the women in our Nation have fought and \ncontinue to fight for justice and equal opportunity, the trip from our \nhomes to the voting booth has never involved a life or death decision. \nThe fact that 8 million people, 60 percent of whom were women according \nto some estimates, chose to risk their lives to vote is, quite frankly, \nastounding to me.\n  These women have grasped at democracy and they now clench it with \ntightened fists. I think we can learn something from this. I would like \nto call attention to their sacrifices and to highlight the lessons that \ntheir courage can teach women in the United States and around the \nworld.\n  It is easy to take for granted today, but women in America also had \nto fight for the right to vote. After a decades' long struggle, women \nfinally secured the right to vote in 1920 and since that time women \nhave made incredible advancements.\n  Women have risen to the top of Fortune 500 companies and fill the \ndomes of capitols and the halls of universities--today approximately 56 \npercent of college students are female, compared to 44 percent in 1973. \nThe wage gap, however, is still alarming. Women who work full-\ntime earned about 79.5 cents on the dollar compared to their male \ncounterparts in 2003.\n\n  Women are a true political force and continue to contribute every day \nall across this country. In the years that I have been in politics, \nwomen have changed the face of American politics.\n  Issues that were once relegated to the back burner--education, health \ncare, children, and seniors--are now at the top of America's political \nagenda.\n  Since I was first elected to the Senate in 1992, we have made \nremarkable progress for women by:\n  Increasing breast cancer research funding by 800 percent;\n  Tripling funding for domestic abuse shelters;\n  Raising lending to women through the Small Business Administration;\n  Passing the Family and Medical Leave Act and the Violence against \nWomen Act;\n  Covering mammogram screening for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries;\n  Extending maternity hospitalization to 48 hours; and\n  Requiring health care companies to fund breast reconstruction after \nmastectomies.\n  We have come a long way, but we still have a long way to go.\n  That is why I am cosponsoring the Equal Rights Amendment to the \nConstitution. This amendment is essential to guarantee that the rights \nand freedoms granted by our Founding Fathers apply equally to men and \nwomen.\n  In addition, women's reproductive rights are under attack in Congress \nlike never before, and I remain deeply committed to protecting a \nwoman's right to choose guaranteed by Roe v. Wade. I also believe that \nit is extremely important that we reduce the number of unintended \npregnancies and abortions.\n  I have spoken on this issue before and it is something that I feel \nvery strongly about. Recently, we have seen considerable setbacks in \nthe battle for reproductive rights and I fear that the advances we have \nfought so hard for are now threatened.\n  I am part of a generation of women who remember a time when a woman \ndid not have the right to decide when and if she would give birth. I \nwill not stand by and let us return to that time.\n  The decline of our rights under this administration has been slow but \nsteady. Subtle encroachments occur either through the high-profile path \nof judicial appointments or through the silent passageways of \nregulations, obscure amendments tacked on to large bills, or grant \nlimitations.\n  The current administration has systematically chipped away at the \nrights of women, and they have done so shielded from public scrutiny by \nemploying these quiet forms of repression and intimidation. I am here \nto say: we have noticed, we are paying attention and we will fight.\n  These are issues that affect every woman in the United States. Let us \nnot become complacent. Let us take inspiration from the women in Iraq \nwho risked their lives to exercise their rights as we continue the \nstruggle to defend our own. The time for basking in the glory of past \nachievements has passed; this is a battle that must be fought by the \neveryday women warriors. It is time to roll up our sleeves and get back \nto work.\n  Because of the women who have come before us, we are fortunate to \nparticipate in our democratic system of justice. We cannot take that \nopportunity and responsibility for granted.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/17/senate-section/article/S2982-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2982-S2983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           THE PRENATALLY DIAGNOSED CONDITIONS AWARENESS ACT\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I recently introduced S. 609, the \nPrenatally-diagnosed Conditions Awareness Act, with my colleague, the \nsenior Senator from Massachusetts. This bill will accomplish the \nfollowing:\n  One, ensure that pregnant women facing a positive prenatal test \nresult will be more likely to receive up-to-date, scientific \ninformation about the life expectancy, clinical course, intellectual \nand functional development, and prenatal and postnatal treatment \noptions for their child;\n  Two, provide pregnant women referrals to support services such as \nhotlines, Web sites, information clearinghouses, registries of families \nwilling to adopt babies with disabilities, and parent-to-parent \nprograms where people with children with disabilities meet with the \nnewly diagnosed family to provide support and real-world information;\n  Three, improve epidemiologic understanding of prenatally-diagnosed \nconditions, within a strict set of confidentiality protections;\n  Four, support health care providers who perform prenatal tests and \ndeliver results; and\n  Five, authorize a study of the effectiveness of existing health care \nand family support services for children with disabilities and their \nfamilies.\n  The need for this legislation and the public dialogue I hope it \nencourages could not be more urgent. Medical science has provided the \nopportunity to obtain a massive amount of information about our own \nbodies and health and that of our children. But I am concerned that our \nethical dialogue has not kept pace with new ethical challenges. We have \nbeen able to screen for certain conditions in the womb for quite some \ntime now, but I am concerned that we don't have a great track record \nfor handling that information very well. For some conditions that can \nbe detected in the womb, such as Down Syndrome, we are aborting 80 \npercent or more of the babies who test positive. The effect of this \nsort of ``weeding out'' represents a sort of new eugenics, a form of \nsystematic, disability-based discrimination.\n  Worse, trends suggest that this atrocity doesn't just end in the \nwomb. The Netherlands has recently enacted policies that make it \nacceptable for doctors to end the lives of terminally ill children up \nto age 12, resulting in about 100 cases of pediatrician-induced \nhomicides of children with severe handicaps each year. Belgium is \nconsidering similar policies. Unfortunately, these policies are \nstarting to trickle into our own country. In Texas, a court recently \nupheld a hospital's decision to remove life support from a 6-month-old \nhandicapped baby, against his mother's wishes.\n  It sounds too crazy to be true, but it is not just fringe thinking--\nleading so-called ethics experts have supported the killing of children \nwith disabilities, such as Princeton Professor Peter Singer, who wrote \nin 1993 in his book Practical Ethics, ``killing a defective infant is \nnot morally equivalent to killing a person . . . sometimes it is not \nwrong at all.'' These ideas echo back to Nazi Germany, and, \nunfortunately, there is a tragic history, even in our own country, of \nabuse of institutionalized people with disabilities, only\n\n[[Page S2983]]\n\na few decades ago. Once one goes down the path of valuing some lives \nmore than others, of saying that people with disabilities don't have \nthe same dignity and right to live as others, there are very few means \nthat don't justify the so-called ``worthy end'' of a disability-free \nsociety.\n  When I see beautiful children with Down Syndrome, spina bifida and \nother differences, I can't imagine why our society would ever condone \nthis sort of unnatural selection. We don't want a world where parents \nfeel driven to justify their children's existence. In addition to the \nmany abilities that people with disabilities have which are equivalent \nto others, these individuals so often have a perspective the rest of us \ndon't have. We learn compassion, heroism, humility, courage and self-\nsacrifice from these special individuals, and their gift to us is to \ninspire us, by their example, to achieve these virtues ourselves.\n  Published surveys suggest that our legislation is desperately needed. \nA survey of 499 primary care physicians delivering a prenatal diagnosis \nof Down Syndrome to expectant parents found that 10 percent actively \n``urged'' parents to terminate the pregnancies, and 13 percent \nindicated that they ``emphasized the negative aspects of Down Syndrome \nso that parents would favor a termination.''\n  This bill offers support to ensure that prenatal testing need not be \na negative experience for those whose children are diagnosed with a \ncondition like Down Syndrome. For instance, some pregnant women might \nchoose to carry their child to term if they knew there were waiting \nlists of families willing to adopt children with Down Syndrome. Some \nparents might be reassured about keeping their children if they were \nable to spend some time talking with a family that has a special needs \nchild about their real-life experience. Some parents would be helped by \nhearing a positive message about the potential and joy of living with \nchildren with disabilities, while also being presented with a realistic \nassessment of the challenges.\n  There are many people to thank for helping prepare this bill for \nintroduction, and I hope they will continue to help us as we move this \nbill towards the President's desk. In particular, I am honored to have \nmy friend the senior Senator from Massachusetts as a lead Democrat on \nthis bill. Senator Kennedy is an incredible champion for people with \ndisabilities. As we have worked together, he has educated me about some \nof the challenges faced by families with children with disabilities. In \nparticular, I want to thank Connie Garner on Senator Kennedy's staff, \nwhose tireless advocacy for the dignity and rights of people with \ndisabilities has been an inspiration to me and my staff.\n  Many thanks to our partners in the House of Representatives, who I \nhope will speedily pass the companion version of this bill, especially \nlead sponsor Chairman Sensenbrenner. Key House support has also come \nfrom my friend Congressman Pete Sessions and Congressman John \nHostettler.\n  I urge my colleagues to co-sponsor this legislation and I look \nforward to working with my colleague from Wyoming, the Chairman of the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, and the majority \nleader, to speed Senate passage of this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/17/senate-section/article/S2983-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2983-S2984]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FRATERNAL BENEFIT SOCIETIES\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, on January 27, the staff of the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation released a report requested by Senate Finance \nChairman Grassley and the ranking member, Senator Max Baucus, entitled \n``Options To Improve Tax Compliance and Reform Tax Expenditures.'' \nWhile I fully expect that many of the recommendations will be the \nsubject of extended debate in the Senate over the coming year, I want \nto highlight one recommendation that should be rejected immediately: \nthe joint committee staff's proposal to revoke the tax-exempt status of \nfraternal benefit societies.\n  Beginning with the Tariff Act of 1894, every Federal tax law has \ncontained a specific exemption for fraternal benefit societies, and \nwith good reason. These organizations, some of which have existed since \nthe Civil War, are a major force for good in America today. Last year, \nfor example, these organizations incurred almost $360 million in direct \nfraternal and charitable expenditures, while their individual members \ndevoted more than 80 million volunteer hours--valued at $1.4 billion--\nin community and social services. Fraternal benefit societies support \ntheir communities in every possible way, including helping families \nwith critically ill children, supporting homeless shelters and homes \nfor the aged, raising funds and supporting local food banks, repairing \nplaygrounds and other community facilities, and helping underprivileged \nyouth stay away from drugs. Fraternal benefit societies are among our \nNation's most important first responders; they acted quickly to provide \nalmost $17 million in financial relief to families affected by 9/11, \nand have raised upwards of $8 million in tsunami relief and counting.\n  What makes this extraordinary effort possible is the requirement \nunder the Internal Revenue Code that fraternal societies also make \navailable to their members insurance against death, disease, and \ndisability, a tradition of mutual aid that goes back to the earliest \ndays of fraternalism. I am troubled, Mr. President, by the fact that \nthe Joint Committee staff has dredged up an old idea that has been \nrejected once before. In 1984, the Treasury Department made a similar \nrecommendation that resulted in Congress mandating an extensive study \nof fraternal benefit societies that was issued in 1993. In that study, \nTreasury concluded that fraternal societies do not use their tax \nexemption to compete unfairly against commercial insurers, but instead, \nuse the revenues from insurance to support their fraternal and \ncharitable activities. Treasury left the decision up to Congress, but \nnoted that if the exemption was taken away, these fraternal and \ncharitable activities would be extinguished.\n  If anything, the rationale for encouraging fraternal benefit \nsocieties is greater today than it has been at any other time in our \nhistory. Fraternal societies have shown us that the private sector can \nand will step in to make a difference. As our need for fraternal \nsocieties has grown, so too has their devotion to our communities. \nFraternal and charitable expenditures were approximately $242 million \nin 1985, and the number of volunteer hours on behalf of society members \nwas just over 26 million. Last year fraternal and charitable \nexpenditures were almost $365 million and the number of volunteer hours \nhad grown to 83 million. At the same time, the share of the insurance \nmarket represented by fraternals during this time period has remained \nsteady at around 1.5 percent. In other words, the good that these \norganizations do has gone way up; they are no more a threat to \ncommercial businesses today than they were 20 years ago. Moreover, I \ncan tell you from personal experience that the 10 million Americans who \njoin fraternal societies are more devoted today to the cause that \nbrought them together--whether religious, patriotic, or a shared \nheritage--than ever before. Pennsylvania is fortunate to be home to \nmany of these organizations and dedicated citizens.\n  The Joint Committee staff has concluded that revoking the tax-\nexemption of fraternal benefit societies would raise $500 million over \n10 years. This pales by comparison to the $4 billion that fraternal \nsocieties are likely to put back into their communities over the same \ntime frame in direct fraternal and charitable expenditures, and the \nannual $1.4 billion that their members devote in volunteer time \nthroughout the country.\n  Recognizing the importance of fostering this type of private sector \nsupport for our communities, it is interesting to note that the \nplatform of the Republican National Committee in 2004, 2000, and 1996 \ncontained the following statement: ``Because of the vital role of \nreligious and fraternal benevolent societies in fostering charity and \npatriotism, they should not be subject to taxation.''\n  Mr. President, it often has been said that the power to tax is the \npower to destroy. This is the time to encourage, not destroy, \norganizations that devote themselves to social good, organizations from \nwhich this Nation has benefited immeasurably for more than 150 years. \nAs Congress concluded in 1985, let us again make sure that this joint \ncommittee recommendation is taken off the table.\n\n[[Page S2984]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/17/senate-section/article/S2983-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2983-S2984]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FRATERNAL BENEFIT SOCIETIES\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM.

Mr. President, last week I introduced a bill, S. 586, as an \nalternative to my previous bill, S. 290, regarding the taxation of FEMA \ndisaster mitigation grants. Both bills are designed to prevent the IRS \nfrom taxing these grants.\n  With the help of Senators Vitter, Talent, Voinovich, Nelson, \nFeinstein, and Landrieu, I introduced this new legislation as a \ncompanion to Congressman Mark Foley's bill, H.R. 1134, in House of \nRepresentatives. I commend Mr. Foley for his hard work and dedication \nto this proposal. Also, I commend the Department of Treasury for \nrecognizing the serious nature of this issue and committing to work \nwith Congress to resolve it.\n  This new legislation adds additional language to ensure that FEMA \ndisaster mitigation grant recipients do not abuse the tax-free nature \nof the grant by capitalizing on the increased value of his/her \nproperty. In addition, the new language provides for a prospective \neffective date.\n  It is important to note, however, that the President's budget \nproposal gives the Treasury Department the administrative authority to \napply the policies of S. 586 and H.R. 1134 to cases involving \nmitigation payments where the statue of limitations has not expired. It \nis my understanding that the Department of Treasury has agreed to issue \na notice to the IRS clearly indicating that, in accordance with the \npolicies of S. 586 and H.R. 1134, those taxpayers who are in receipt of \nthese mitigation grants prior to the enactment of this legislation will \nnot be subject to extra tax liabilities.\n  This legislation came about as a result of a direct threat by the IRS \nto tax these disaster mitigation grants. As I have said before, I am \nabsolutely stunned at this latest antic by the IRS. The last thing \nAmericans who are working to prevent potential destruction from floods, \ntornadoes, and hurricanes need is for Government-grant funding to be \nsubject to tax. My bill ensures that the IRS's disaster tax does not \nsee the light of day.\n  I ask unanimous consent that two letters from the Department of \nTreasury be printed in the Record. These letters are written to the \nchairmen of both the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and \nMeans Committee expressing support for S. 586 and H.R. 1134 and \ncommitting to prevent retroactive taxation at the request of Congress.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                   Department of the Treasury,\n\n                                  Washington, DC., March 14, 2005.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     Chairman, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Grassley: I am writing to express the \n     Administration's support for legislation to provide tax \n     relief to property owners who participate in Federal \n     Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) hazard mitigation \n     projects, specifically H.R. 1134 and S. 586 sponsored by \n     Representative Mark Foley and Senator Bond respectively.\n       FEMA provides grants through State and local governments to \n     mitigate potential damage from future natural hazards. \n     Examples of mitigation projects include demolition, retro-\n     fitting, and elevation of buildings. As a result, these grant \n     projects are distinguishable from other grant programs in \n     that their goal is to avoid the larger costs of damage that \n     otherwise would be compensated in the future out of the \n     taxpayer funded Disaster Relief Fund, National Flood \n     Insurance Program, other Federal assistance programs, and \n     State, local and private sources. Through hazard mitigation \n     programs, FEMA has funded community mitigation projects \n     affecting individual properties for over fifteen years. In \n     particular, FEMA makes grants under the Flood Mitigation \n     Assistance program, the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, and \n     the Pre-Disaster Mitigation program.\n       Under current law, gross income generally includes all \n     income from whatever source derived. Generally, the \n     mitigation grants from FEMA (or construction services paid by \n     grants) represent income to the recipients. Under specific \n     statutory and administrative exceptions, gross income does \n     not include certain government payments made to individuals \n     in response to need resulting from particular disasters. \n     However, grants under the three FEMA mitigation programs \n     described above often are made in anticipation of future \n     disasters and other natural hazards and are not need based. \n     Consequently, the mitigation grants generally do not qualify \n     for these specific exceptions.\n       Similarly, if a property owner participates in a FEMA-\n     assisted acquisition of his or her property, the property \n     owner generally is required to include in income any gain \n     from the sale of the property (subject to the $250,000/\n     $500,000 exclusion from income of gain from the sale of a \n     principal residence).\n       By explicitly excluding FEMA mitigation grants from income, \n     the Foley/Bond legislation provides tax relief to home and \n     property owners that receive the grants. Because \n     participation by property owners in FEMA projects is \n     voluntary, there is concern that owners of at-risk properties \n     might decline to participate because of the potential tax \n     obligation under current law, thus adding to long term \n     taxpayer funded recovery costs. This presents a potential \n     impediment to the policy Congress initially sought to \n     implement through these grant programs.\n       Finally, it is also my understanding that the effective \n     dates of the Foley/Bond legislation are prospective and that \n     the tax exemption for these FEMA mitigation grants will be \n     recognized upon date of enactment of the bill. Because the \n     issue of retroactivity is also one of fairness, it is our \n     hope that Congress, consistent with the Administration's \n     budget proposal, will encourage the Treasury Department to \n     provide retroactive relief to those individuals who have \n     utilized FEMA mitigation grants in the past.\n       I commend the House for acting quickly to address this \n     issue and urge the Congress to send this legislation to the \n     President for his signature.\n           Sincerely,\n     John W. Snow.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       Department of the Treasury,\n                                   Washington, DC, March 14, 2005.\n     Hon.

Under specific \n     statutory and administrative exceptions, gross income does \n     not include certain government payments made to individuals \n     in response to need resulting from particular disasters. \n     However, grants under the three FEMA mitigation programs \n     described above often are made in anticipation of future \n     disasters and other natural hazards and are not need based. \n     Consequently, the mitigation grants generally do not qualify \n     for these specific exceptions.\n       Similarly, if a property owner participates in a FEMA-\n     assisted acquisition of his or her property, the property \n     owner generally is required to include in income any gain \n     from the sale of the property (subject to the $250,000/\n     $500,000 exclusion from income of gain from the sale of a \n     principal residence).\n       By explicitly excluding FEMA mitigation grants from income, \n     the Foley/Bond legislation provides tax relief to home and \n     property owners that receive the grants. Because \n     participation by property owners in FEMA projects is \n     voluntary, there is concern that owners of at-risk properties \n     might decline to participate because of the potential tax \n     obligation under current law, thus adding to long term \n     taxpayer funded recovery costs. This presents a potential \n     impediment to the policy Congress initially sought to \n     implement through these grant programs.\n       Finally, it is also my understanding that the effective \n     dates of the Foley/Bond legislation are prospective and that \n     the tax exemption for these FEMA mitigation grants will be \n     recognized upon date of enactment of the bill. Because the \n     issue of retroactivity is also one of fairness, it is our \n     hope that Congress, consistent with the Administration's \n     budget proposal, will encourage the Treasury Department to \n     provide retroactive relief to those individuals who have \n     utilized FEMA mitigation grants in the past.\n       I commend the House for acting quickly to address this \n     issue and urge the Congress to send this legislation to the \n     President for his signature.\n           Sincerely,\n     John W. Snow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/17/senate-section/article/S2984-2", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2984-S2985]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        CONDEMNING VIOLENCE AND CRIMINALITY IN NORTHERN IRELAND\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues, Senators\n\n[[Page S2985]]\n\nKennedy, McCain and others in condemning ongoing violence and \ncriminality by the Irish Republican Army.\n  Our actions are prompted in part by our meeting yesterday with the \nsisters and fiance of Robert McCartney, a Catholic resident of Belfast \nwho was brutally murdered on January 30, by individuals who are members \nof the IRA. These six young women, Catherine McCartney, Paula Arnold, \nGemma McMacken, Claire McCartney, Donna Mary McCartney, and Bridgeen \nKaren Hagans, have publicly challenged the code of silence that \ngenerally surrounds IRA activities, including the brutal murder of \ntheir brother, an innocent bystander.\n  These brave women came to Washington seeking our help to ensure that \nthis heinous act is not forgotten as time passes and that justice is \ndone, not only on behalf of their brother, but for all the people of \nNorthern Ireland--Protestant and Catholic alike. They have called upon \nthe IRA and Sinn Fein to stop covering up Robert's murder, and to begin \nimmediately to cooperate directly with the Northern Ireland Policing \nService in order to bring to justice those responsible for this heinous \ncrime.\n  In response to their appeal we believe that it is important that the \nUnited States Senate express itself on their behalf. That is why we \nhave asked the Senate to act on the pending resolution. That is why \nPresident Bush met personally with these brave women at the White House \nearlier today--to highlight the importance of justice being done.\n  Our actions on this resolution and the President's meeting earlier \ntoday put the world on notice that we condemn such acts. In addition, \nwith this resolution we call on the leadership of Sinn Fein to insist \nthat everyone responsible for this murder be brought to justice and \nthat anyone with knowledge about the crime cooperate fully and directly \nwith the Police Service of Northern Ireland in making that possible.\n  As an Irish American, I look forward to the annual celebration of \nSaint Patrick's Day. Earlier today we participated in the Annual \nSpeaker's luncheon with visiting Prime Minister of Ireland, Bertie \nAhern to commemorate this day.\n  I must tell you that we did so with less exuberance than in past \nyears when there was frankly more to be joyful about.\n  Ten years ago on this day, there was excitement and promise at our \nSaint Patrick's Day celebration--the 1994 IRA ceasefire had been in \nplace for more than 6 months and there existed a positive climate \nconducive to finding a political resolution to a quarter century of \nsectarian violence.\n  Seven years ago, in 1998, there was even more concrete evidence that \nsectarian violence was over as we were literally days away from the \nparties signing the Good Friday Accords which they did on April 9 of \nthat year. That document was crafted by the political parties under the \nable leadership of former Majority Leader George Mitchell with the \nactive involvement of President Bill Clinton, and Prime Ministers Tony \nBlair and Bertie Ahern. It spelled out in black and white an agenda and \ninstitutions for delivering justice and equality to both traditions \nwithin a framework of inclusive self-government.\n  Our annual Saint Patrick's Day celebrations since 1998 have been an \nopportunity to take stock of the progress toward full implementation of \nthe Good Friday Accords. I for one have approached this day each year \nwith the hope that we might finally declare that the Accords were fully \nfunctioning, and that violence and terror were no longer a part of the \nfabric of Northern Ireland's society.\n  Sadly, this Saint Patrick's day we struggle to call the glass half \nfull with respect to progress on the Accords. The Northern Ireland \nAssembly is in suspension, the assembly's Executive is vacant. The \nparties are deadlocked over what must be done to restart the process. \nCollectively, Northern Ireland's political leaders must accept \nresponsibility for the political impasse that now exists. But Sinn Fein \nand the IRA carry a heavier burden than others for restarting the \nprocess. Sinn Fein, as an organization, must commit itself fully and \nunequivocally to solely political means to advance its agenda of \nequality and inclusion. There is no place in a democracy for a \npolitical organization to have its own private paramilitary \norganization. Sinn Fein cannot call itself a democratic organization if \nit does not severe all ties with the IRA, an organization which \nespouses, condones, and covers up unlawful acts such as murder and \nrobbery. And, if the IRA is in fact committed to the full \nimplementation of the Peace Accords as it has publicly stated, then it \nmust fully and verifiably decommission its weapons and go out business \nentirely.\n  In my opinion, nothing short of these actions is going to repair the \ndamage done to the peace process by the recent acts of criminality by \nthe IRA. Public demonstrations by the Catholic community in Belfast in \nsupport of the McCartney sisters' quest for justice made it patently \nobvious that whatever support might have existed for the IRA in that \ncommunity exists no longer. It is very clear that the people of \nNorthern Ireland want to live in peace--they want an end to vigilantism \nand intimidation--they want transparency and the rule of law. They want \na future for themselves and their children.\n  Today, Northern Ireland is a struggling democracy--at a crossroad. \nElections have occurred. Elected representatives have been chosen. The \nmechanisms of self-government are clearly spelled out in the Good \nFriday Accords. Everyone knows what needs to be done to move the \nprocess forward. I hope and pray that those with the power to make a \ndifference will have the courage to do the right thing. The people of \nNorthern Ireland deserve and expect nothing less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/17/senate-section/article/S2985-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2985]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/17/senate-section/article/S2985-2", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2985-S2987]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       OPPOSING THE NATIVE HAWAIIAN GOVERNMENT REORGANIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, it has come to my attention that persons \noutside of the Senate have told Senators that I do not oppose S. 147, \nthe latest incarnation of a bill that would create a tribal government \nfor Native Hawaiians. This is untrue; it is probably being said because \nI agreed that the issue could be brought to the Senate floor for a \nvote. I continue to believe that this bill is profoundly \nunconstitutional and poses serious moral and political problems. I \noppose this bill, and urge my colleagues to do so.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following three news columns by \nBruce Fein, constitutional scholar and former Reagan administration \nJustice Department official, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Mar. 11, 2005]\n\n                        The Pineapple Time Bomb\n\n                            (By Bruce Fein)\n\n       It is not because Native Hawaiians should be cherished less \n     but that equality under the law should be loved more that the \n     Akaka Bill to create a race-based government should be \n     opposed. The Senate Committee on Indian Affairs blithely \n     approved the legislation Wednesday without seriously \n     examining its constitutionality. The bill previously\n\n[[Page S2986]]\n\n     passed the House in 2000 as a ``noncontroversial,'' like \n     treating South Carolina's firing on Fort Sumter as a July \n     Fourth celebration.\n       The proposed legislation would ordain a Native Hawaiian \n     Governing Entity cobbled together by Native Hawaiians meeting \n     a threshold of Native Hawaiian blood. The Entity would \n     negotiate with the United States and the State of Hawaii for \n     lands, natural resources, civil and criminal jurisdiction, \n     and other matters within the customary purview of a \n     sovereign. It would be a race-based state within a state: a \n     government of Native Hawaiians, by Native Hawaiians, for \n     Native Hawaiians. It does not deserve birth.\n       The grandeur of the United States has been a history of \n     escape from ugly racial, ethnic or class distinctions. The \n     nation celebrates equality of opportunity and merit rather \n     than birth as the touchstone of destiny. American citizenship \n     is defined by common ideals and aspirations unstained by \n     hierarchy: no divisions between patricians or clergy, nobles \n     and commoners. Indeed, the Constitution forbids titles of \n     nobility.\n       Accordingly, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia \n     instructed in Adarand Constructors v. Pena (1995): ``To \n     pursue the concept of racial entitlement--even for the most \n     admirable and benign of purposes--is to reinforce and \n     preserve for future mischief the way of thinking that \n     produced race slavery, race privilege and race hatred. In the \n     eyes of government, we are but one race here. It is \n     American.''\n       The United States has flourished by overcoming stains on \n     its creed of equality. Black slavery was ended by the 13th \n     Amendment, and Jim Crow died with the Civil Rights Act of \n     1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965. Individual Japanese-\n     Americans got an apology and compensation for race-based \n     maltreatment in World War II in the Civil Liberties Act of \n     1988.\n       Racism is defeated by its renunciation, not its practice. \n     The latter pits citizen against citizen and invites strife \n     and jealousies that weaken rather than strengthen.\n       An exclusive Native Hawaiian government is no exception. \n     Justice Anthony Kennedy persuasively discredited the argument \n     that the Akaka Bill will bring reconciliation between Native \n     Hawaiians and their co-citizens in Rice v. Caytano (2000). In \n     voiding a race-based restriction on the franchise for \n     trustees of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, Justice Kennedy \n     sermonized: ``One of the principal reasons race is treated as \n     a forbidden classification is that it demeans the dignity and \n     worth of a person to be judged by ancestry instead of by his \n     or her own merit and essential qualities. . . . [T]he use of \n     racial classifications is corruptive of the whole legal order \n     democratic elections seek to preserve. The law itself may not \n     become an instrument for generating the prejudice and \n     hostility all too often directed against persons whose \n     particular ancestry is disclosed by their ethnic \n     characteristics and cultural traditions.''\n       The Akaka Bill would create an unprecedented race-based \n     government in Hawaii. Prior to the 1893 dethronement of Queen \n     Lili'uokalani, the monarchy treated Native Hawaiians and \n     immigrants alike. Each enjoyed equal rights under the law. \n     Ditto under the successor government and territorial \n     authority after Hawaii's annexation by the United States in \n     1898. In other words, the race-based legislation would not \n     restore the 1893 legal landscape, but enshrine an odious \n     political distinction amongst Hawaii's inhabitants that never \n     before existed.\n       A Native Hawaiian enjoys the same freedoms as other \n     Americans. Native Hawaiians may celebrate a distinctive \n     culture under the protection of the Constitution, like the \n     Amish. Racial discrimination against a Native Hawaiian is \n     illegal. And the civil and political rights of Native \n     Hawaiians dwarf what was indulged by the sovereign under the \n     former monarchy.\n       Stripped of rhetorical adornments, the Akaka Bill is racial \n     discrimination for the sake of racial discrimination; a \n     dishonoring of the idea of what it means to be an American \n     and a formula for domestic convulsions.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Oct. 5, 2004]\n\n                          A Race-Based Drift?\n\n                            (By Bruce Fein)\n\n       The nation's mindless celebration of multiculturalism and \n     denigration of the American creed has reached a new plateau \n     of destructiveness. A bill recently reported by the Senate \n     Appropriations Committee (S. 344) would establish a race-\n     based government for Native Hawaiians unconstrained by the \n     restrictions of the U.S. Constitution. The bill's enactment \n     would mark the beginning of the end of the United States, \n     akin to the sack of Rome by Alaric the Great in 410 A.D. A \n     country that wavers in its fundamental political and cultural \n     values--like a nation half slave and half free--will not long \n     endure.\n       S. 344 would erect an independent government for the lineal \n     descendants of Native Hawaiians to honor their asserted \n     ``rights as native people to self-determination and self-\n     governance.'' Best estimates place their number at more than \n     400,000. Like Adolf Hitler's blood tests for Jews, a \n     minuscule percentage of Native Hawaiian ancestry would \n     establish an entitlement to participate in the new racially \n     exclusive domain.\n       The right to self-determination means the right of a people \n     to choose their sovereign destiny, whether independence, \n     federation, accession to another nation or otherwise. Thus, \n     the bill would overturn the past and prevailing understanding \n     of the Civil War. As Chief Justice Salmon Portland Chase \n     lectured, Ulysses S. Grant's defeat of Robert E. Lee \n     established an indivisible national unity among \n     indestructible states.\n       The Native Hawaiian government would be unbothered by the \n     ``irritants'' of the U.S. Constitution. Thus, it might choose \n     theocracy over secularism; summary justice over due process; \n     indoctrination over freedom of speech; property confiscations \n     over property rights; subjugation over equality; or, group \n     quotas over individual merit. The Native Hawaiian citizens of \n     the Native Hawaiian government would also be exempt from \n     swearing or affirming allegiance to the United States of \n     America or the U.S. Constitution.\n       The race-based sovereignty created by S. 344 is first \n     cousin to a revolution against the United States. As the \n     Declaration of Independence elaborates, revolutions may be \n     justified by repression or deafness to pronounced grievances. \n     Thomas Jefferson's indictment of King George III is \n     compelling on that score. But S. 344 does not and could not \n     find Native Hawaiians are oppressed or maltreated in any way. \n     They are first-class American citizens crowned with a host of \n     special privileges. Indeed, the proposed legislation \n     acknowledges that, ``Native Hawaiians . . . give expression \n     to their rights as native peoples to self-determination and \n     self-governance through the provision of governmental \n     services to Native Hawaiians, including the provision of \n     health care services, educational programs, employment and \n     training programs, children's services, conservation \n     programs, fish and wildlife protection, agricultural \n     programs, native language immersion programs and native \n     language immersion schools from kindergarten through high \n     school.''\n       The annexation of Hawaii by the United States in 1898 has \n     proven a bright chapter in the history of democracy and human \n     rights. Native Hawaiians had failed for centuries to build a \n     democratic dispensation and the rule of law. When Queen \n     Lili'uokulani was ousted from power in 1893, the potentate \n     was no more eager to yield monarchical powers than was the \n     shah of Iran. Annexation and statehood in 1959 brought all \n     Hawaiian residents irrespective of race or ethnicity the \n     blessings of the U.S. Constitution--government of the people, \n     by the people, for the people. Native Hawaiians prospered far \n     beyond the destiny available under Queen Lili'uokulani and \n     her royal successors. Suppose Japan had attacked Pearl Harbor \n     when under the queen's sovereignty. The Hawaiian Islands \n     would have been colonized and brutalized as was Korea from \n     1910-1945.\n       American civilization has been a boon, not an incubus, for \n     the Native Hawaiians living today. Generally speaking, they \n     thrive from the benefits of science, medicine, literature, \n     higher education, free enterprise, private property and \n     freedom of inquiry, amenities and enjoyments not found in \n     lands untouched by Western values and practices. As \n     elaborated in the report of Senate Committee of Indian \n     Affairs accompanying S. 344, Native Hawaiians' nagging \n     resistance to complete assimilation seems to explain their \n     suboptimal demographics. Hawaiian law, for example, has \n     invariably guaranteed subsistence gathering rights to the \n     people to retain native customs and traditions.\n       Not a crumb of legitimate grievance justifies the odious \n     race-based government championed by S. 344. To borrow from \n     Associate Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia in Adarand \n     Construction vs. Pena (1995), in the eyes of the law and the \n     creed of the United States, there is only one race in the \n     nation. It is American. And to be an American is to embrace \n     the values of freedom, individual liberty and equality \n     acclaimed in the Declaration of Independence, Constitution \n     and Gettysburg Address. S. 344 would create a distinct race \n     of Native Hawaiians subject to a race-based Native Hawaiian \n     government with the purpose of creating and preserving non-\n     American values: namely, ``Native Hawaiian political and \n     cultural identity in accordance with their traditions, \n     beliefs, customs and practices, language, and social and \n     political institutions.''\n       Native Hawaiians hold no more right to a race-based \n     government than countless other racial or ethnic groups in \n     the United States. They are no more entitled to secede from \n     the jurisdiction of the U.S. Constitution than were the \n     Confederate States of America. Enacting S. 344 would \n     surrender the intellectual and moral underpinnings of the \n     United States.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        E Pluribus Unum--Debating the Legality of the Akaka Bill\n\n                            (By Bruce Fein)\n\n       Hawaii Attorney General Mark Bennett is dead wrong in his \n     support of the Akaka Bill.\n       The proposed legislation celebrates race-based divisiveness \n     over America's highest aspirations for unity and equality. \n     The bill is blatantly unconstitutional.\n       E Pluribus Unum is the nation's birth certificate.\n       Ben Franklin sermonized that if we do not all hang \n     together; we assuredly shall all hang separately. Abraham \n     Lincoln preached that ``A house divided against itself cannot \n     stand.'' Supreme Court Justice Benjamin Cardozo in Baldwin v. \n     Seelig (1935) observed: ``The Constitution was framed . . . \n     upon the theory that the peoples of the several states must \n     sink or swim together, and that in the long run prosperity \n     and salvation are in union and not division.'' Justice \n     Antonin Scalia lectured in Adarand Constructors v.\n\n[[Page S2987]]\n\n     Pena (1995) that the Constitution acknowledges only one race \n     in the United States. It is American.\n       Attorney General Mark J. Bennett's spirited defense of the \n     Akaka Bill (Hawaii Reporter, December 20, 2004) ignores this \n     wisdom. It is nonsense on stilts. He talks about Congress' \n     power to recognize tribes, but the Akaka Bill is not about \n     recognizing a real tribe that truly exists. Instead, it \n     proposes to crown a racial group with sovereignty by calling \n     it a tribe. But to paraphrase Shakespeare, a racial group by \n     any other name is still a racial group. Congress cannot \n     circumvent the Constitution with semantics. The United States \n     Supreme Court in United States v. Sandoval (1913) expressly \n     repudiated congressional power arbitrarily to designate a \n     body of people as an Indian tribe, whether Native Hawaiians, \n     Jews, Hispanics, Polish Americans, Italian Americans, \n     Japanese Americans, or otherwise. Associate Justice Willis \n     Van Devanter explained with regard to congressional \n     guardianship over Indians: ``[I]t is not meant by this that \n     Congress may bring a community or body of people within the \n     range of this power by arbitrarily calling them an Indian \n     tribe, but only that in respect of distinctly Indian \n     communities the questions whether, to what extent, and for \n     what time they shall be recognized and dealt with as \n     dependent tribes requiring guardianship and protection of the \n     United States are to be determined by Congress, and not by \n     the courts.''\n       Attorney General Bennett incorrectly argues that the \n     Supreme Court has interpreted the Indian Commerce Clause to \n     endow Congress with plenary ``power to deal with those it \n     finds to be Indian Tribes. . . .'' No such interpretation has \n     ever been forthcoming, and thus Mr. Bennett is unable to cite \n     a single case to support his falsehood. Indeed, it is \n     discredited by the Sandoval precedent.\n       Congress enjoys limited powers under the Constitution. They \n     are generally enumerated in Article I, section 8, and include \n     the power to regulate commerce ``with the Indian tribes.'' \n     Clause 18 also empowers Congress to make all laws ``necessary \n     and proper'' for executing its enumerated authorities. \n     Contrary to the Hawaii Attorney General, the Indian Commerce \n     Clause has been understood by the Supreme Court as conferring \n     a power to regulate the nation's intercourse with Indian \n     Tribes, but not to summon a tribe into being with a statutory \n     bugle. The Attorney General is also unable to articulate a \n     connection between any enumerated power of Congress and the \n     Akaka Bill's proposal to endow Native Hawaiians with the \n     quasi-sovereignty and immunities of Indian Tribes.\n       He absurdly insists that the Founding Fathers intended an \n     open-ended definition of Indian Tribe because contemporary \n     dictionaries defined tribe as ``[a] distinct body of people \n     as divided by family or fortune or any other \n     characteristic.'' But the Constitution's makers employed \n     ``Indian'' to modify tribe. That modifier was understood to \n     include only peoples with an Indian ancestry coupled with a \n     primitive culture that necessitated federal protection from \n     predation by States or private citizens. In Sandoval, for \n     example, Congress properly treated Pueblos as an Indian tribe \n     because ``considering their Indian lineage, isolated and \n     communal life, primitive customs and limited civilization, \n     this assertion of guardianship over them cannot be said to be \n     arbitrary. . . .'' Chief Justice John Marshall in The \n     Cherokee Nation v. Georgia (1831) likened an Indian Tribe's \n     dependency on the United States to the relation of a ward to \n     his guardian. The Akaka Bill, however, does not and could not \n     find that Native Hawaiians need the tutelage of the United \n     States because of their backwardness or child-like \n     vulnerability to exploitation or oppression. Indeed, their \n     political muscle has made them spoiled children of the law, \n     as Attorney General Bennett himself underscores. Finally, the \n     Constitution aimed to overcome, not to foster, parochial \n     conflicts or jealousies. That goal would be shipwrecked by a \n     congressional power to multiply semi-sovereign Indian tribes \n     at will.\n       He stumbles again in attributing to a court the statement, \n     ``Indian tribes do not exist in Alaska in the same sense as \n     in [the] continental United States.'' The statement was made \n     by the Secretary of the Interior in a letter noting that \n     Alaskan tribes occupied land which had not been designated as \n     ``reservations,'' in contrast to Indian tribes.\n       Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment further undermines \n     the Attorney General's accordion conception of Indian Tribe. \n     It apportions Representatives among the States according to \n     population, but ``excluding Indians not taxed.'' Mr. \n     Bennett's argument would invite the majority in Congress to \n     manipulate apportionment by designating entire States that \n     generally voted for the opposition as Indian Tribes.\n       Finally, the Attorney General wrongly insinuates that \n     Congress would be powerless to rectify historical wrongs to \n     Native Hawaiians absent the Akaka Bill. Congress enjoys \n     discretion to compensate victims or their families when the \n     United States has caused harm by unconstitutional or immoral \n     conduct, as was done for interned Japanese Americans in the \n     Civil Liberties Act of 1988. Congress might alternatively \n     establish a tribunal akin to the Indian Claims Commission to \n     entertain allegations of dishonest or unethical treatment of \n     Native Hawaiians. As the Supreme Court amplified in United \n     States v. Realty Co. (1896): ``The nation, speaking broadly, \n     owes a `debt' to an individual when his claim grows out of \n     general principles of right and justice; when, in other \n     words, it is based on considerations of a moral or merely \n     honorary nature, such as are binding on the conscience or the \n     honor of the individual, although the debt could obtain no \n     recognition in a court of law. The power of Congress extends \n     at least as far as the recognition of claims against the \n     government which are thus founded.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/17/senate-section/article/S2987-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2987]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DECLAN CASHMAN\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Ms. Declan \nCashman who tomorrow marks her 20th year of service in the Senate.\n  Declan began her career in the Senate back in 1985 as a legislative \nsecretary for my distinguished friend, Senator Dave Durenberger of \nMinnesota. She was promoted to positions on the Subcommittee on \nIntergovernmental Relations, the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations, and the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions. Today, she serves as my executive assistant, where she is \ninvaluable to me and so many others on my staff. I do not sign a letter \nwithout first asking, ``Has Declan looked at this?''\n  Despite her busy work schedule, Declan has many creative pursuits. \nShe is both a lover of the theater and a talented actress herself. \nRecently, she has performed at Washington's Studio Theater, the Chevy \nChase Players, and the Silver Spring stage.\n  Declan is an inspiration to the young men and women who come to work \nin Washington every year. Every morning, she is the first to arrive in \nmy office, where she proceeds to scour her hometown Boston Globe, the \nNew York Times, the Washington Post's Style section, and Page Six, over \na cup of black coffee. As her coworkers arrive, she enthusiastically \nshares the best stories with them.\n  On behalf of her Senate coworkers over the past 20 years and the \nthousands of constituents she has assisted, I thank Declan for her \ndedication and excellent public service. I hope that she will grace my \noffice with her presence for the next 2 years. Then someone else will \nbe my fortunate successor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/17/senate-section/article/S2987-2", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2987-S2988]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     RECOGNITION OF THE 80TH ANNUAL PRINCE OF PEACE EASTER PAGEANT\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of the 80th \nAnnual ``The Prince of Peace'' Easter Pageant that has been performed \nannually in the historic Holy City of the Wichitas since 1926. I am \nvery proud of this truly outstanding Oklahoma tradition and would like \nto congratulate the dedicated performers and organizers both past and \npresent who have kept it alive all these years.\n  The pageant was the brainchild of a young pastor, Reverend Anthony \nMark Wallock, of the First Congregational Church in Lawton, OK. Eighty \nyears ago, he gathered a few hardy souls from his church and Sunday \nschool class on a mountain peak at Medicine Park, OK, where he \nconducted a short Easter morning service. That worship ceremony, which \nwas carried out in word, song, and pantomime, eventually became the \nworld-renowned Easter pageant, ``The Prince of Peace.''\n  Word about the pageant spread quickly, and began attracting a larger \naudience. As a result, the pageant was moved to the foot of Mount \nRoosevelt in the heart of the Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge. The \ntwenty-two buildings at the new site were completed and dedicated on \nMarch 31, 1935, and the first pageant there, performed on April 21, \ndrew a crowd of 82,000 people.\n  In the 1940's, the pageant even drew the attention of Hollywood and \nin 1948 the film, ``The Lawton Story--The Prince of Peace'' was \nproduced with the participation of many local citizens in Lawton and \nthe surrounding area. Although Reverend Wallock passed away on December \n26 of that year, the story of the pageant he founded lived on in the \ncommunity that he loved.\n  Since then, hundreds upon thousands of volunteers have carried on the \nannual tradition of presenting this historic production. It has become \nthe longest continuously running outdoor Easter pageant in America. \nEvery Easter season, on Palm Sunday Eve and Easter Eve, starting at \n9:00 in the evening, 300 costumed volunteer performers bring the \npageant to life.\n\n[[Page S2988]]\n\n  The voices of the characters come from the reading cast. Their timed \nspeaking gives life to the pantomiming actors. Those in charge of \nmusic, sound effects, and the all-important lighting give realism to \nthe story. The brilliant costumes, live animals, and surprise special \neffects all contribute to a rich and beautiful depiction of the life of \nChrist.\n  Mr. President, as the Easter season approaches and this storied \npageant enters its 80th year, I extend my gratitude for all those who \nhave committed to keep its flame burning. The message of hope and human \nredemption that is at the heart of this pageant is one that we sorely \nneed today, and I hope that Reverend Wallock's inspiring legacy will \nlive on for 80 more years and beyond.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/17/senate-section/article/S2988-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2988]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        IN MEMORY OF JAY CUTLER\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to inform the \nSenate of the passing of Jay Cutler on March 4, 2005. Jay was a dear \nfriend to many in Washington, a loving husband, father, and grandfather \nto his family, and a true asset to Capitol Hill and the field of mental \nhealth policy. Both on the Hill and in his role as the lobbyist for the \nAmerican Psychiatric Association, Jay worked diligently to educate \npeople about mental health and to alleviate the stigma attached to \nmental illness. I had the pleasure of working closely with Jay on a \nnumber of issues affecting millions of Americans afflicted with these \nmaladies.\n  Most importantly, Jay had an overwhelming love for his family, \nespecially his wife, children, and grandchild. They, along with me, the \nUnited States Senate and Washington, DC will miss Jay dearly because he \nwas a true inspiration to us all. In memory of Jay Cutler, I ask \nunanimous consent that Rabbi Joseph B. Meszler's eulogy of Jay be \nprinted in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     Jay Cutler (Yosef ben Moishe)\n\n\n Rabbi Joseph B. Meszler, Washington Hebrew Congregation, March 7, 2005\n\n       Sometimes, when people reach retirement, they experience \n     what people call a second childhood. They are able to be a \n     kid again and enjoy themselves. Jay Cutler, however, never \n     stopped knowing how to be a kid, how to enjoy life to the \n     utmost, and how to marvel at people and places and \n     situations. He was always a big, wonderful, loving man whose \n     warmth you felt almost instantly. Perhaps the pain at the \n     injustice of his sudden death is tempered by the fact that he \n     did not wait until his retirement to go out and enjoy life. \n     Jay Cutler was a good man who was a wonderful husband and \n     father, and the best grandfather. He was an extremely \n     generous man in every sense of the word. A Hebrew proverb \n     says, Neir Adonai nishmat adam; the light of God is a \n     person's soul. Jay's soul gave a great deal of light and \n     warmth.\n       We are here in this unbelievable situation, to grieve for \n     the death of Jay, to try to accept the reality of this loss, \n     and to feel the pain of grief. His family and friends are \n     gathered because it feels like a huge light has gone out, and \n     we are groping in the dark. At the same time, Jay would \n     always find something light and even funny even in the \n     darkest situations. And in telling stories about Jay, we are \n     liable to laugh just as much as cry.\n       Jay was born the only child to Murray and Shirley Cutler in \n     Brooklyn. He was not only the only child but also the first \n     grandchild, and so his grandparents closed down the street \n     and had a block party for him upon his arrival into this \n     world. It would foreshadow a great deal of Jay's spirit in \n     times to come.\n       Jay loved his parents, and they loved him dearly. He \n     attended Tilden High School and then went to New York \n     University as a business major. In his neighborhood, \n     attending his same high school, was a young woman named \n     Randy. Randy was on the cheering squad, and her friend wanted \n     to set her up with this guy named Jay. ``You'll have a great \n     time,'' her friend assured her. ``He makes great seal \n     noises.'' They went to Jahn's Ice Cream Parlor. Jay was 19, \n     and Randy was 16. Later, Jay would make the time to drive his \n     car over to Randy's house so the two of them could wash it \n     together. His car must have been very dirty because he did \n     this almost every day. On weekends, they would go out on \n     dates. They were married on April 5, 1952 at a synagogue in \n     Brooklyn, and while they did not have a honeymoon, Jay and \n     Randy said that they honeymooned for many years on many trips \n     after that. Their marriage took place before Jay had to go \n     overseas during the Korean War, and Randy remembers well \n     their time in Georgia when they shared a house with other \n     couples before Jay was shipped out.\n       Jay and Randy's love for each other was something to \n     behold. They simply loved being together, and it is hard if \n     not impossible to think of them apart. They have been married \n     for almost 53 years, and they shared everything.\n       When Jay came back from the service, he went to Brooklyn \n     Law School. In order to get by, they needed family support, \n     and Jay clerked for his Uncle Julie and also worked at night \n     in order to bring in some money. Soon Hollie was born, and \n     Jay studied for the bar while Randy tried to keep her quiet.\n       In 1958, the family moved to Washington, DC, where Perri \n     was born. Jay went to work for Granik & Marshall, a lobbying \n     law firm that dealt often with public television, and Jay \n     became especially interested in the production end of things. \n     He worked there for ten years, but then Jay went to work for \n     Senator Jacob Javitz of New York on Capital Hill.\n       Jay loved working on the Hill. He loved writing legislation \n     and being a part of the process. He was also unusual. He was \n     not only competent but helpful and friendly when many other \n     people were not. A plaque in his office read, ``Mirthful Jay \n     Cutler.'' Hollie was especially proud when people at work \n     would meet her and say, ``You're Jay Cutler's daughter?'' And \n     even though he was extremely modest, Jay accomplished a great \n     deal. He would never put on airs or boast, but he was \n     extremely good at getting people together and getting things \n     done. A book that was written at the time called The Dance of \n     Legislation which followed the development of the National \n     Health Service Corps, and it featured Jay as one of its \n     subjects. It became clear with regards to this major \n     legislation that a great deal would not have happened if it \n     weren't for Jay.\n       After working on Capitol Hill for ten years, Jay went to \n     work as a lobbyist for the American Psychiatric Association. \n     He worked for them for some 25 years, and he made a name for \n     himself as not only a professional but as a mentor to others. \n     He was well-respected and well-liked, and it might not be an \n     exaggeration to say that he mentored half of the health \n     lobbyists working on Capitol Hill today. Jay and Randy also \n     did a tremendous amount of traveling, going all over the \n     world on numerous trips. It was part of their life together \n     to go to new places. He retired just last year and was \n     looking forward to doing more consulting.\n       Upon his retirement, the Congressional Record, entered on \n     April 30, 2003 by Senator Kennedy, praises Jay for his work. \n     It explains that Jay was part and parcel of legislation \n     having to do with mental illness reform and substance abuse \n     treatment, and he believed passionately in improving the \n     government's policies, alleviating suffering, and removing \n     the stigma that mental illness can often bring. It also makes \n     sure to mention Randy, his ever-present companion and \n     support. Jay was, after all, first and foremost a family man. \n     And all know him for the giving soul that he was. He was very \n     generous, and gave of himself and his time freely.\n       As a father, Jay was always incredibly loving and playful \n     with Hollie and Perri. He could make any child smile, laugh, \n     and play. And he was not above stealing the chocolate \n     frosting off of someone's plate if you left the table or \n     pouring sugar into ashtrays at restaurants and setting them \n     on fire. His children remember how much he loved the beach \n     and could be found there from ten in the morning until \n     sunset, and he would have been there earlier if he didn't \n     like sleeping in while on vacation. He always seemed to have \n     a permanent tan.\n       Jay was always there for his children, present but not \n     intrusive, and was always positive and upbeat. Hollie knows \n     what a special father she had, and she, too, went to law \n     school. And Perri especially remembers her trip to King's \n     Dominion with him and how he went on the rides with her even \n     though he was somewhat horrified at the thought. And for the \n     whole family, for Randy's siblings and their partners, Zelda \n     and Arthur, Louis and Barbara, for his nieces and nephews: \n     Sherry, Bonnie, Scott, Darrell, and Craig, and to his son-in-\n     law Eric, bringing Rachael into his life, Jay was a source of \n     happiness and strength.\n       But the center of his life was his love for his \n     granddaughter, Mikayla. Jay's sun rose and set on this \n     beautiful little girl who would lovingly call him ``Ga.'' He \n     would do anything for her, and to her, he was one big, \n     lovable toy. Only she was allowed to mess up his hair, and \n     only she could bring him to entirely new levels of joy. His \n     love and his life will have an impact on her far into the \n     future.\n       Someone once wrote that life and death are not in our \n     hands. Just as we do not choose to be born, so we do not \n     choose to die. Jay's death is profoundly unfair. But he \n     leaves a legacy of love and life that is hard to beat. He \n     would have us smiling. His soul is certainly one of God's \n     lights. Zichrono livracha. Jay's memory will always be a \n     blessing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/17/senate-section/article/S2988-2", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2988-S2989]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  LOSS OF FEDERAL AGENT DAVID WILHELM\n\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, tragedy struck Atlanta, GA this past \nFriday, March 11, 2005. A quiet day in a county courthouse turned into \na horrific shooting spree that took the lives of four innocent people \nthroughout the Georgia capital. Among those who fell victim that day \nwere U.S. Immigration\n\n[[Page S2989]]\n\nand Customs Enforcement Assistant Special Agent-in-Charge David \nWilhelm, who was shot and killed while working to finish his Atlanta \nhome. Friday's heartbreak touches everyone in this country, and is \nsincerely felt in my hometown of Salisbury, NC, which Special Agent \nDavid Wilhelm also called home.\n  David Wilhelm is remembered as a true patriot, whose commitment to \nhard work, justice, and the enforcement of the law were admired by all \nwho knew him. After graduating from West Rowan High School in 1982, \nSpecial Agent Wilhelm earned a criminal justice degree at the \nUniversity of North Carolina at Charlotte. He began his Federal service \nas a U.S. Customs Agent in June 1987, in Beaufort, SC, and also served \nin Charlotte, NC and Norfolk, VA before relocating to Atlanta, GA last \nNovember. In Atlanta, he was second in command, managing the U.S. \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement investigations involving financial \ncrimes, narcotics smuggling, human smuggling, and customs violations. \nHis law enforcement colleagues knew him to be tenacious professionally \nand a superb team-builder with ace investigative skills and a generous \nspirit.\n  David Wilhelm's 18-year commitment to Federal service is most \ncommendable. He spent 16 years with the U.S. Customs Service and 2 \nyears with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. In 2001, he was \nrecognized for his dedication and was awarded the prestigious U.S. \nCustoms Service Blue Eagle Award for work on an important narcotics \nsmuggling case resulting in the seizure of approximately two tons of \nmarijuana and $2.4 million in cash. The Blue Eagle Award is bestowed \nannually for significant work that goes beyond the expected daily \nduties.\n  I have immense respect for the many Federal law enforcement agents \nwho risk their lives daily to protect Americans. I am truly saddened by \nthe loss of David Wilhelm, and my thoughts and prayers are certainly \nwith his wife Candee, his brother Patrick, who serves as an Immigration \nand Customs Enforcement Agent in Atlanta, GA, and all his family and \nfriends. May Special Agent David Wilhelm's dedication, sense of duty \nand honor never be forgotten. In addition, I would like to send my \nsincere condolences to the families, friends, and co-workers of the \nother three victims of Friday's violence, Judge Rowland Barnes, court \nreporter Julie Ann Brandau, and Sergeant Hoyt Teasley of the Fulton \nCounty Sheriff's Department.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/17/senate-section/article/S2989-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2989]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RETIREMENT OF CAROLE GEAGLEY\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, at the end of March, 2005, Carole Geagley \nis retiring from the U.S. Senate, and I rise today to pay her tribute.\n  Carole began her Capitol Hill career in 1977 when she began working \nfor the Joint Economic Committee, where she rose to the position of \npersonal assistant to the executive director. Before that Carole was \nthe office manager at the law firm of Seltzer and Suskird, from 1971 to \n1977.\n  In 1990 she joined the Senate Appropriations Committee staff. At \nfirst Carole worked for the Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural \nDevelopment, and Related Agencies. She then made the move to Labor, \nHealth and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies. As the \nSenate majority changed over the years she worked for both Senator \nHarkin and myself, helping manage the seamless transition between \nchairmanships for more than 15 years. As office administrator Carole \nhas toiled behind the scenes to efficiently prepare many hearings this \nsubcommittee has conducted. She has done everything from letters of \ninvitation to witnesses, preparing background information for hearing \nbooks, creating data tables, and maintaining Member requests from \nMembers of the Senate. For the professionalism of her work, she will be \nmissed.\n  Yet it is for Carole's many other attributes that we will miss her \nthe most. The youngest of four siblings, Carole's cheerful disposition, \neffervescent personality, and her famous cakes have made her the Perle \nMesta of the Appropriations Committee. Her cakes and pies are so well \nknown that Tom Harkin, who is quite the chef himself, has asked for her \nrecipes--especially her Coca-Cola cake. It should also be noted that \nher award-winning cheesecake is featured at a well-known restaurant in \nher home State of Maryland.\n  Carole has many other talents as well. She and her husband, Ron, are \nchampionship bridge players and have played in many national \ntournaments. In fact, that is how she met Ron, at a bridge tournament \nin 1975. They were married in 1977 and raised a beautiful daughter, \nLori. They are now blessed with three grandchildren who we can all hope \nwill inherit their grandmother's knack at cooking. My best wishes to \nCarole and her family on this occasion of her retirement.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I join my colleague in thanking Carole Geagley for her \nservice to the U.S. Senate and wishing her well as she embarks in a new \nphase of her life.\n  Carole is an institution on the Appropriations Committee and not one \nthat will soon be forgotten. She spent the longest period of her \nAppropriations life assisting the group of offices that staff call \n``the Bullpen,'' a crowded space in the Hart Building that holds \nanywhere from five to seven subcommittee staffs. With different bills \nmoving at different paces through the Senate, that area is often the \nlocus for much activity, and Carole managed those interactions with a \ncalm demeanor.\n  In that capacity, Carole came into contact with many Senators and \nmany Senate offices. She is a storehouse of institutional knowledge, \nwhich she imparted to younger staffers when perspective and history \nneeded to be their guides. And just as importantly, she fed them. Every \nstaff birthday was celebrated with a Carole Geagley creation. One thing \nis certain: Appropriations Committee staff will never eat as well as \nthey did when they worked with Carole.\n  I know that Carole will treat retirement with the same gusto with \nwhich she performed her various duties in the Senate. So today we \ncongratulate Carole. We thank her for her longtime service to this \ninstitution and we wish the whole Geagley family the best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/17/senate-section/article/S2989-2", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2989-S2990]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             TRIBUTE TO A GREAT NEW MEXICAN: J.

Paul Taylor has touched the lives of so many of the people \nthroughout our great State of New Mexico, but what is most remarkable \nis that he has done so in so many different facets of life. News \narticles about him have never really captured but one small piece of \nhis life, as they focus on: J. Paul Taylor: The Artist; J. Paul Taylor: \nThe Historian; J. Paul Taylor: The Educator; J. Paul Taylor: The \nPolitician; J. Paul Taylor: The Father of Border Health; J. Paul \nTaylor: The Advocate for the Poor; J. Paul Taylor: Children's Advocate.\n  Only J. Paul Taylor could be honored in the wide array of ways he \nhas, including having New Mexico State University establish the J. Paul \nTaylor Endowment in the College of Education, the New Mexico Human \nNeeds Coordinating Council establishing the J. Paul Taylor Legislative \nChampion Award to honor other legislators, the New Mexico Library \nAssociation naming him a ``New Mexico Library Treasure,'' getting the \nLifetime Achievement Award with his wife from the New Mexico Historic \nPreservation Division, receiving the Voice for Children Award from the \nNew Mexico Voices for Children, and the awards go on and on.\n  Representative Taylor was recently honored by his legislative \ncolleagues in the New Mexico Roundhouse, both Democrats and \nRepublicans. As the Las Cruces Sun-News reported, ``Taylor was \ndescribed as `the great gentleman of New Mexico politics,' and `a \npopulist advocate for the poor and disenfranchised.' He was also lauded \nfor his effort to create the Office of Childhood Development and for \nthe donation\n\n[[Page S2990]]\n\nof his home in Mesilla, to be converted into a museum following the \ndeath of Taylor and his wife, Mary.''\n  Earlier this month, J.

Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the \nUniversity of Arkansas Track and Field Team on earning their 40th NCAA \nTitle last weekend. This win also marks the team's 18th indoor track \ntitle, the most of any Division 1 athletic program in the Nation.\n  Saturday's win continues a long tradition of excellence for a program \nthat boasts some the best attendance at track events nationwide. A \ncrowd of 5,461 faithful fans cheered them on to victory in \nFayetteville, AR last Saturday. The success of our talented athletes \nand coaches is a source of pride for all Arkansans.\n  Under the leadership of Head Coach John McDonnell, the Razorbacks \nhave been a consistent powerhouse in collegiate athletics, earning him \nthe honors as the Nation's winningest track and field coach. In his \n33rd year as head coach, McDonnell has won 74 conference championships, \n31-straight cross-country conference titles, and 5 NCAA triple crowns.\n  In fact, Coach McDonnell's team has won at least one national title \nin cross country, indoor or outdoor track in 20 of the past 21 years. \nIt is no wonder that he has been named National Coach of the Year a \ntotal 27 times for his work with Arkansas athletics. Indeed, his record \nof success reads like a page out of the Guinness Book of World Records. \nHis ability to recruit and hone the talents of the most outstanding \nathletes in collegiate track and field rightly identifies him with the \ngreatest names in the history of college sports.\n  The young men that join the University of Arkansas track squad are \nmodels of athletic excellence. Their hard work and dedication to the \nsport are a source of pride and inspiration for Arkansans and sports \nfans everywhere. Among them are 156 All-American athletes who have won \na total of 585 All-American honors for individual events, and the \nmembers of the Arkansas track and field team have earned a remarkable \n102 national championships for individual events. In fact, the official \nweb site of Razorback Athletics, www.hogwired.com, boasts that ``[track \nand field] athletes who letter four years are likely to leave with more \nrings than fingers.'' Additionally, twenty-five U of A track athletes \nhave gone on to compete in the Olympic Games, the highest honor for an \namateur athlete.\n  I would be remiss if I neglected to mention the essential \ncontribution that the University of Arkansas's Athletic Director, Frank \nBroyles, makes to the success of the track program. Frank is a \nsteadfast supporter of track and field, and by appointing Coach \nMcDonnell to head the program in 1977 and funding the track program at \nan optimal level for the many years thereafter, this 40th National \nTitle is a tribute to him and his work to make Arkansas athletics what \nit is today. A legend in the world of collegiate athletics and a model \nArkansan, it is fitting the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette named Frank \nBroyles the most influential figure in athletics in the state during \nthe 20th Century.\n  The Senate has a tradition of recognizing particularly extraordinary \naccomplishments of Americans, whether in military service, scholarly \nresearch, the arts, athletics or other fields. I believe that the \nUniversity of Arkansas Track and Field Program deserve this \nrecognition. Out of profound respect for the achievements of all the \noutstanding athletes that have played a role in the success of the \nArkansas track and field program, the coaching staff under the \ndirection of John McDonnell, and all the athletic staff at the \nUniversity of Arkansas, I am pleased to express my congratulations to \nthe Arkansas Razorbacks on their 40th National Track and Field \nTitle.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/17/senate-section/article/S2990-2", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2990-S2991]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             PAUL KLEBNIKOV\n\n Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I will take some time today to \ntell the Senate about a New Yorker named Paul Klebnikov. Paul Klebnikov \nwas an American journalist who was shot and killed in Moscow on July 9, \n2004, as he left his office after work. The most plausible reason for \nhis killing appears to be his investigative journalism, which has \nexplored the connections between business, politics, and crime in \nRussia. The stilling of Paul Klebnikov's voice represents a direct \nchallenge to independent journalism, democracy, and the rule of law in \nRussia. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, CPJ, in the \nlast 5 years, 11 journalists in Russia, including Paul Klebnikov, have \ndied in ``contract-style'' killings.\n  Mr. Klebnikov's murder illustrates in tragic terms one of several \nthreats faced by the press in today's Russia. Observers have described \nthese threats as including the lack of accountability for the killing \nof journalists and government restrictions on the media.\n  It is in the broader context of the challenges to press freedom in \nRussia that the importance of Paul Klebnikov's murder has been brought \nhome to me in a very personal way by his family, which has long ties to \nNew York. Paul, with family roots in Russia, grew up in New York, and \nhis wife and their children still reside in New York. At the time of \nhis death at age 41, Paul Klebnikov was working in Moscow as the \neditor-in-chief of Forbes Russia, after having served as a senior \neditor at Forbes.\n  Paul Klebnikov's contributions to press freedom have received special \nrecognition since his death. He was a recipient of the CPJ 2004 \nInternational Press Freedom Award. He was also a recipient of the 2004 \nKnight International Press Fellowship Award for achievements in the \nface of threats.\n  At the CPJ 2004 International Press Freedom Awards ceremony, Paul's \nwidow Musa underlined Paul's deep sympathy for the plight of the \nRussian people and the way in which he chose to translate his ideals \ninto action: ``Being surrounded by criminality, greed and misuse of \npower has made people suffer from apathy and hopelessness. Paul wanted \nto help ordinary Russians find courage. He was thrilled to edit a \nmagazine for Russians, and use it to expose economic and moral \ncorruption, and offer positive models instead.''\n  As Paul's widow Musa makes clear, a free press is an essential \ncomponent of the effort to enhance transparency. A free and vital press \nhelps to keep citizens informed and knowledgeable regarding the most \nimportant issues in their lives. Without accurate information on the \nmost pressing public issues of the day, people are hindered in the \nexercise of their other rights, as well as in the conduct of the many \nother civic activities that are essential to the healthy functioning of \na democracy.\n  That is why I have been seeking ways to bring attention to the \ncontract-style killing of Paul Klebnikov at the highest levels of \ngovernment. I have joined with a bipartisan group of my colleagues on \nthe US Helsinki Commission, on which I serve, in writing to President \nPutin urging him to ensure the case is aggressively investigated and \nall those responsible are brought to justice.\n  And I wrote to President Bush to ask him to raise the issue of Paul's \nmurder with President Putin during their meeting in Bratislava, \nSlovakia on February 24th. That meeting with President Putin presented \nan opportunity to make clear that all those involved in instigating, \nordering, planning and carrying out the murder should be prosecuted to \nthe full extent of the law.\n  I expressed to President Bush that his personal involvement would \ncontribute enormously to the effort to bring all those responsible for \nPaul's murder to justice. And that such a result, in turn, would help \nto move Russia along the path to freedom and democracy, and strengthen \nRussian civil society.\n\n[[Page S2991]]\n\n  Recent comments by Secretary Rice encourage me in my hope that the \nadministration will emphasize, both in public to the world, as well as \nin private to Russian officials, the vital role a free press has to \nplay in Russia. During Secretary Rice's February fifth visit to Warsaw, \nshe underlined that it ``is important that Russia make clear to the \nworld that it is intent on strengthening the rule of law, strengthening \nthe role of an independent judiciary, permitting a free and independent \npress to flourish. These are all the basics of democracy.''\n  And around the same time as the Bratislava meeting between President \nBush and President Putin, we learned of encouraging news reports. \nAccording to these reports, two suspects in the murder of Paul \nKlebnikov, who had been arrested in Belarus, were extradited to Russia; \nand one of them was charged in connection with Paul's murder.\n  Nonetheless, under the current state of affairs in Russia, I am \nconvinced that if all those responsible for this crime are to be \nbrought to justice, it is absolutely essential for President Bush and \nsenior members of his Administration personally to raise Paul's case \nwith senior officials of the Russian Government, including President \nPutin. It is my hope that if consistent pressure is applied in a \ndetermined manner by the U.S. Government, the Russian government will \nhave the strongest incentive to follow through on the investigative \nefforts already begun, and pursue the leads in this case wherever, and \nhowever high, they reach.\n  It is vital that all those responsible for the murder of Paul \nKlebnikov be held accountable. Bringing those involved in his murder to \njustice will help to end any perception that those perpetrating \nviolence against journalists in Russia are immune from the reach of the \nlaw. A free press, not threatened by violence or coercion, will aid the \nRussian people immeasurably in their quest for freedom and democracy. \nIt is our obligation to continue to impress on the Russian Government \nthe importance of bringing to justice those responsible for Paul \nKlebnikov's murder, both for Paul's sake and to strengthen the rule of \nlaw and a free press in Russia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/17/senate-section/article/S2991-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2991]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  IN PRAISE OF DAVID VIGLIAROLO BAUER\n\n Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am proud to submit this \nstatement in praise of David Vigliarolo Bauer, a New York City public \nschool student who won the top $100,000 prize in this year's Intel \nScience Talent Search, STS. David attends Manhattan's Hunter College \nHigh School, known for its excellence and high educational standards. \nHis project, which was inspired by the events of September 11, began in \nthe bio-organic chemistry lab of Professor Valeria Balogh-Nair at the \nCity College of New York, CCNY. A coworker at the CCNY lab had been \nexposed to asbestos at Ground Zero the day of the attack. David has \ndesigned a new type of universal sensor for neurotoxins in the body \nwhich he believes has the potential to save thousands of lives by \nrapidly detecting and evaluating individual exposure to biochemical \nagents.\n  The Intel STS is often considered the ``junior Nobel Prize'' and is \nAmerica's oldest and most highly regarded precollege science \ncompetition. Alumni of the program hold more than 100 of the world's \nmost coveted science and math honors, including six Nobel Prizes.\n  David and his family can be proud of this outstanding achievement, \nand I am heartened by his interest in using science to the potential \nbenefit of our first responders in the war on terrorism. I ask that the \nfollowing New York Times article of March 16, 2005 be printed in the \nRecord. I congratulate David Bauer for his creativity and leadership.\n  The article follows:\n\n                            [March 16, 2005]\n\n          New Yorker Takes Top Prize in Intel Science Contest\n\n                            (By Lia Miller)\n\n       New York City public school student whose project was \n     inspired by the events of Sept. 11 has won the top prize of a \n     $100,000 scholarship in this year's Intel Science Talent \n     Search.\n       The winner, David L. V. Bauer, is a 17-year-old senior at \n     Hunter College High School in Manhattan. He worked on a new \n     method to detect toxic agents in the nervous system. Mr. \n     Bauer said that his study could result in a patch, worn \n     somewhat like a radiation patch is on a jacket, that would \n     quickly detect how much neurotoxin a person had been exposed \n     to.\n       ``I was thinking more in terms of paramedics and individual \n     exposure, so in the event of a terrorist attack, we would \n     know the nature of the attack,'' he said.\n       Forty finalists have been competing for the last five days \n     in Washington for $530,000 in scholarship money. Each \n     finalist will receive at least $5,000.\n       Mr. Bauer began his study last year while working in the \n     bio-organic chemistry lab of Prof. Valeria Balogh-Nair at the \n     City College of New York. He said that a co-worker at the lab \n     had been at ground zero the day of the attack. Mr. Bauer was \n     amazed to hear that testing showed that the co-worker had a \n     different level of exposure to asbestos in the bloodstream \n     than others in the same area. It was this finding, Mr. Bauer \n     said, that led him to begin thinking of a way to quickly \n     determine a person's neurotoxin exposure levels through the \n     use of fluorescent nanocrystals.\n       Mr. Bauer, who is from the Bronx, plans to attend the CUNY \n     Honors College in the fall to study chemistry and hopes to \n     teach at the university level one day.\n       Now that the competition is over, he said he was looking \n     forward to taking up some of his other interests, which \n     include fencing and overseeing an organization he founded \n     called United Liberia, which runs a Web site that provides \n     news about Liberia. Since seventh grade, Mr. Bauer has \n     attended Hunter College High, a public high school \n     administered by the college.\n       Professor Balogh-Nair, who was Mr. Bauer's mentor, said: \n     ``He is an unusual student, both by the depth of his \n     understanding of science--but he is multitalented--you seldom \n     find a combination of talents in one person. He has great \n     people skills, too.''\n       The last time a student from the New York metropolitan area \n     won the top prize was in 2000, when Viviana Risca from Paul \n     D. Schreiber Senior High School in Port\n       Washington, N.Y., won for encrypting a message on a DNA \n     strand. This year there were 13 finalists from New York \n     State, but only Mr. Bauer made the top 10.\n       The second-place winner was Tim Credo, 17, a senior from \n     the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy. He won a \n     $75,000 scholarship for a study involving particle \n     accelerators and a more precise way to measure brief \n     intervals of time known as picoseconds. Third place went to \n     Kelly Harris, 17, from C. K. McClatchy High School in \n     Sacramento. She won a $50,000 scholarship for her study on Z-\n     DNA and viral proteins.\n       The technology company Intel has sponsored the contest \n     since 1999. Before then, the Westinghouse Electric \n     Corporation sponsored it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/17/senate-section/article/S2991-2", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2991]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RUTH CHICKERING CLUSEN\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue code of 1986 to allow \ndistilled spirits wholesalers a credit against income tax for their \ncost of carrying Federal excise taxes prior to the sale of the product \nbearing the tax; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will resolve a longstanding inequity in the tax treatment of U.S. \ndistilled spirits that penalizes the wholesalers, and some suppliers, \nof these products.\n  Under current law, wholesalers of distilled spirits are not required \nto pay the Federal excise tax on imported spirits until after the \nproduct is removed from a bonded warehouse for sale to a retailer.\n  In contrast, the tax on domestically produced spirits is included as \npart of the purchase price and passed on from the supplier to \nwholesaler. After factoring in the Federal excise tax (FET)--which is \n$13.50 per proof gallon--domestically produced spirits can cost \nwholesalers 40 percent more to purchase than comparable imported \nspirits.\n  In some instances, wholesalers and even suppliers can carry this tax-\npaid inventory for an average of 60 days before selling it to a \nretailer. Interest charges--more commonly referred to as float--\nresulting from financing the Federal excise tax can be quite \nconsiderable.\n\n[[Page S2999]]\n\n  For example, at a 5 percent interest rate on the sale of 100,000 \ncases of domestic spirits, a wholesaler will incur finance charges of \n$21,106.85 for loans related to underwriting the cost of paying the \nFederal excise tax. It is important to note that it is not uncommon for \nwholesalers to sell a million or more cases per year of domestic \nspirits.\n  The costs associated with financing Federal excise taxes amount to a \ntax on a tax, making the effective rate of the Federal excise tax for \ndomestic spirits much higher than $13.50 per proof gallon.\n  The Domestic Spirits Tax Equity Act would give wholesalers and \nsuppliers in bailment States a tax credit toward the cost of financing \nthe FET for domestically produced products.\n  I believe this legislation is fundamentally fair and will help \nprotect and create jobs for the wholesale tier in Kentucky and many \nother States. This legislation, which has broad support in both \nchambers and on both sides or the aisle, has passed the Senate Finance \nCommittee and the House Ways and Means Committee several times, and has \nreached the President's desk under a previous Administration. It's time \nto finally get this legislation over the goal line.\n  I wish to emphasize, however, that I will reject any connection \nbetween a repeal of Section 5010 of the Internal Revenue Code or an \nincrease in Federal taxes for distilled spirits. Tax equity for one \ntier should not be achieved by placing additional burden on other tiers \nwithin the same industry.\n\n  My colleagues, Senators Lincoln, Lott and Bond join me in introducing \nthis legislation, I which the Joint Tax Committee estimates would \nreduce Federal revenues by approximately $249 million over ten years. I \nunderstand that similar legislation will be introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation when \nit comes before the Senate.\n      By Mr. LUGAR (for himself, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Nelson of \n        Nebraska, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Frist, Mr. Johnson, Mr. \n        Talent, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Coleman, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Thune, Mr. \n        Bayh, Mr. DeWine, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Dayton, Mr. \n        Obama, Mr. Salazar, and Mr. Bond):\n  S. 650. A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to increase production and \nuse of renewable fuel and to increase the energy independence of the \nUnited States, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n  LUGAR. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to introduce bi-\npartisan legislation to increase the security of our Nation, improve \nour environment, and add job opportunities in all 50 States in the \nunion. This legislation has the strong support of 20 of my fellow \ncolleagues and is the product of a great deal of bipartisan work.\n  This legislation seeks to curb the negative consequences that stem \nfrom our Nation's insatiable appetite for oil. Oil has served America \nwell and indeed has fueled a dramatic portion of this Nation's rise to \nprosperity. However, our dependence on oil carries a multitude of risks \nand costs in addition to the ever higher prices paid by Americans at \nthe fuel pump.\n  Oil is a magnet for conflict. The problem is simple--everyone needs \nenergy, but the sources of the world's transportation fuel are \nconcentrated in relatively few countries. Well over two-thirds of the \nworld's remaining oil reserves lie in the Middle East.\n  Energy is vital to a country's security and material well-being. A \nstate unable to provide its people with adequate energy supplies or \ndesiring added leverage over other people often resorts to force. \nConsider Saddam Hussein's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, driven by his desire \nto control more of the world's oil reserves, and the international \nresponse to that threat. The underlying goal of the U.N. force, which \nincluded 500,000 American troops, was to ensure continued and \nunfettered access to petroleum.\n  This unwelcome dependence keeps U.S. military forces tied to the \nPersian Gulf, forces foreign policy compromises and sinks many \ndeveloping nations into staggering debt as they struggle to pay for \nexpensive dollar-denominated oil.\n  The growth of economies in China and India, representing a third of \nthe world's population that grows by 200,000 people per day, will bring \ngreater stress on the finite supply of natural resources, refining \ncapacity and distribution capability, and the consequential \nskyrocketing prices would be a destabilizing economic blow.\n  In addition, oil causes environmental conflict. The possibility that \ngreenhouse gases will lead to catastrophic climate change is \nsubstantially increased by the 40 million barrels of oil burned every \nday by vehicles. Subsequent environmental problems are often predicted \nas destabilizing factors in the form of drought, flooding or famine.\n  Such political, economic and environmental trauma is preventable if \nwe are on a course of developing more homegrown energy and developing \nnew technology.\n  That is why I have joined with my colleagues to introduce the Fuels \nSecurity Act of 2005. This act would more than double the current \nproduction of renewable fuels derived from sources available in every \ncorner of the United States. More importantly, this increased \nproduction and use will spur investment in critical infrastructure that \nwill allow for the economical use of renewable fuels by all Americans. \nSpecifically, this bill would require the use of 4 billion gallons of \nrenewable fuels per year in 2006 increasing to 8 billion gallons per \nyear by 2012. Thereafter the requirements may be increased based on the \nnation's production and use of these fuels, as well as consideration of \nour economy and environment. While these figures may sound impressive, \nthey still only represent a small portion of our nation's \ntransportation fuel use of over 185 billion gallons last year.\n  Some critics have argued that the production of renewable fuels \nbenefits only corn and soybean farmers in the Midwest. And while I \nagree that agriculture communities will benefit, farmers will be less \nreliant upon direct government subsidy payments while encouraging land \nconservation and providing energy security for our country. \nAdditionally, many farmers view their ability to produce domestic fuels \nas a matter of patriotism in defense of this nation. However, the \ncurrent ability of U.S. grains to free us from the shackles of oil \ndependence does have its limits. This is why I have long supported \nefforts to increase the production of fuels from all parts of a plant, \nwhich could be grown throughout the United States.\n  When I was chairman of the Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry \nCommittee, I initiated a biofuels research program to help decrease \nU.S. dependency on foreign oil. The Biomass Research and Development \nAct of 2000, which I authored and worked to pass, remains the nation's \npremier legislation guiding renewable fuels research. During a time of \nrelatively low fuel prices I also co-authored ``The New Petroleum'' in \nForeign Affairs with former CIA Director James Woolsey, extolling the \nneed to accelerate the use of ethanol, especially that derived from \ncellulose, in order to stem future world conflict. It is clear from \nthis research and the evolving instability in oil-rich regions of our \nworld that it is time to act to enhance the use of renewable fuels.\n  This legislation is an important and rational step forward in our \nnation's overall security and economic well-being. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues in the Senate in passing this bill for the \ngood of the American people.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 650\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today, along with my colleague, Senator \nLugar, and a bipartisan coalition of 19 other Senators, am introducing \nimportant legislation to set an ambitious Renewable Fuels Standard for \nthis country. This legislation will more than double the amount of \nethanol and biodiesel in the Nation's fuel supply to at least 8 billion \ngallons a year by 2012. It firmly commits our Nation to clean sources \nof domestic energy, and is a bold step toward energy security, a strong \nrural economy, and a healthier environment.\n  We have a growing problem of energy supplies and prices in this \ncountry. Today, 97 percent of our transportation fuel comes from oil, \nnearly two-thirds of which is from foreign sources.\n  This heavy dependence on petroleum undermines our energy security. It \nwreaks havoc on consumers, with record high prices now for gasoline. It \ncosts jobs--27,000 lost U.S. jobs for every $1 billion in imported \noil--and threatens our environment. A full one-third of greenhouse \ngases now come from vehicle emissions.\n  We have a choice. We can stand by and fuel our addiction to foreign \noil, or we can make an aggressive shift toward clean, domestic \nrenewable fuels like ethanol and biodiesel.\n  In the 108th Congress, we approved an RFS of 5 billion gallons a year \nby 2012. At the time, this represented a strong push for renewable \nfuels. But since that time, renewable fuels production in this country \nhas grown dramatically. Domestic ethanol production grew 21 percent in \n2004 to 3.4 billion gallons, helping to buffer rising crude oil prices.\n  The Environment and Public Works Committee, recognizing this success, \nreported yesterday a modestly increased RFS of 6 billion gallons a year \nby 2012. I applaud this step forward, but we can do more. The Energy \nFuture Coalition has said that ``increased production of domestic \nrenewable fuels is the single most important step the United States \ncould take to reduce its dependence on foreign oil,'' and I agree.\n  Our Nation already has the capacity to produce nearly 4 billion \ngallons of ethanol a year, almost a third of it in Iowa. The biofuels \nindustry's output is on track to surpass even our ambitious target of 8 \nbillion gallons a year by 2012. Several studies further indicate that \nrenewable fuels could provide more than 25 percent of our \ntransportation fuel by 2025. Our bill will ensure that market demand \nfor these fuels grows accordingly.\n  Many of the biofuels plants that will be built will be farmer-owned, \nbringing tremendous added value to our rural economies. For example, \naccording to a recent study, each typical ethanol plant built in the \nUnited States creates 700 jobs, expands the local economic base by over \n$140 million, and increases the local corn price by 5 to 10 cents a \nbushel. Iowa's ethanol plants are expected to contribute $4 billion \nannually to our state's economy once all are in production. This RFS is \nexpected to create over 200,000 new jobs nationwide, add nearly $200 \nbillion to our GDP, and do more to reduce foreign oil dependence than \nall of the oil in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge could possibly \ndo.\n  This legislation has built-in flexibility through a system of \ntradable credits for refiners who exceed their minimum requirement. It \ntakes strong\n\n[[Page S3004]]\n\nmeasures to protect air and water quality, and it rewards production of \nsecond-generation biofuels such as cellulosic ethanol that promise \ntremendous value to farmers, consumers and the environment.\n  For these reasons, our bill has generated strong support from a broad \nrange of interests. I have here a letter endorsing our bill signed by \nmore than a dozen groups, including the Iowa Renewable Fuels \nAssociation, the National Renewable Fuels Association, the Energy \nFuture Coalition, the National Farmers Union, the National Corn Growers \nAssociation, the American Farm Bureau Federation, the American Soybean \nAssociation, the American Coalition for Ethanol, and many others.\n  Farmers and biofuel producers are ready to lead our Nation toward a \nfuture based on renewable energy. I sincerely hope that Congress and \nthe administration will get behind commonsense energy policy and \nsupport this ambitious RFS. I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill, along with the letter, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   March 17, 2005.\n     Re the Fuels Agreement and the Renewable Fuels Standard.\n     The Hon. Bill Frist,\n     U.S. Senate Majority Leader,\n     Washington, DC.\n     The Hon. Harry Reid,\n     U.S. Senate Minority Leader,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Frist and Minority Leader Reid: The \n     undersigned organizations are writing to express our strong \n     support for S. 650, legislation establishing a Renewable \n     Fuels Standard (RFS) growing to 8 billion gallons by 2012. \n     This landmark legislation would increase the nation's energy \n     independence, protect air and water quality, provide \n     increased flexibility for refiners, and stimulate rural \n     economies through the increased production of domestic, \n     renewable fuels.\n       The ethanol and biodiesel industries have undergone \n     unprecedented growth over the past several years. In fact, \n     the U.S. currently has the capacity to produce more than 3.7 \n     billion gallons of ethanol and biodiesel, and plants under \n     construction will add an additional 700 million gallons of \n     capacity by the end of the year. Most of this growth has been \n     in farmer-owned plants, which taken as a whole, now represent \n     the single largest producer in the country. Clearly, the \n     renewable fuels industry is poised to make a significant \n     contribution to this nation's energy supply.\n       With rising crude oil and gasoline prices hurting \n     consumers, and record petroleum imports exacerbating our \n     trade imbalance and slowing economic growth, we need to be \n     maximizing the production and use of domestic renewable fuels \n     such as ethanol and biodiesel. Enacting an RFS that would \n     provide a market of 8 billion gallons by 2012 demonstrates a \n     firm commitment to reducing this nation's foreign oil \n     dependence while providing a significant impact to the \n     American economy. Specifically (in 2005 dollars):\n       The production and use of 8 billion gallons of ethanol, \n     biodiesel and other renewable fuels by 2012 will displace \n     over 2 billion barrels of crude oil and reduce the outflow of \n     dollars largely to foreign oil producers by $64.1 billion \n     between 2005 and 2012. As a result of the RFS, America's \n     dependence on imported oil will be reduced from an estimated \n     68 percent to 62 percent.\n       The renewable fuels sector will spend an estimated $6 \n     billion to build 4.3 billion gallons of new ethanol and \n     biodiesel capacity between 2005 and 2012.\n       The renewable fuels sector will spend nearly $70 billion on \n     goods and services required to produce 8 billion gallons of \n     ethanol and biodiesel by 2012. Purchases of corn, grain \n     sorghum, soybeans, corn stover and wheat straw, alone will \n     total $43 billion between 2005 and 2012.\n       The combination of this direct spending and the indirect \n     impacts of those dollars `` circulating throughout the \n     economy will:\n       Add nearly $200 billion to GDP between 2005 and 2012.\n       Generate an additional $43 billion of household income for \n     all Americans between 2005 and 2012, and\n       Create as many as 234,840 new jobs in all sectors of the \n     economy by 2012.\n       We urge your support of this important bill as the Congress \n     considers comprehensive energy policy legislation. The RFS is \n     a vital and necessary component of any energy policy designed \n     to reduce our nation's dependence on foreign sources of \n     petroleum.\n           Sincerely,\n       Renewable Fuels Association, American Farm Bureau \n     Federation, National Corn Growers Association, American \n     Soybean Association, National Grain Sorghum Producers, \n     American Coalition for Ethanol, National Biodiesel Board, \n     Energy Future Coalition, Biotechnology Industry Organization, \n     New Uses Council, National Sunflower Association, United \n     States Canola Association, Ethanol Producers & Consumers, \n     Environmental & Energy Study Institute, National Farmers \n     Union.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to join twenty of my Senate \ncolleagues in introducing landmark legislation that will double the \namount of ethanol used in motor fuel by 2012.\n  The Fuels Security Act of 2005 establishes a renewable fuels standard \nprogram beginning with 4 billion gallons in 2006 and culminating in 8 \nbillion gallons in 2012--nearly a 40 percent increase from legislation \nthat I first sponsored in 2003. The legislation creates a functioning \nand flexible market for ethanol produced from South Dakota's farmer-\nowned plants. South Dakota has more farmer-owned ethanol plants than \nany other State, and South Dakota producers deliver a greater \npercentage of corn for ethanol production than any neighboring State. \nRevising and strengthening the proposed RFS is important to South \nDakota producers and our value-added economy.\n  In 2004, the domestic ethanol industry produced a record 3.4 billion \ngallons of ethanol and an additional 700 million gallons of capacity \nwill be added in 2005. Because of the strong increase in ethanol \nproduction over the last few years it is necessary to revisit and \nrevise the proposed RFS to more accurately reflect the growing market. \nIncreasing the RFS schedule to 8 billion gallons in 2012 ensures market \nstability and encourages investment in ethanol plants and \ntransportation infrastructure.\n  Ethanol stands out as an agriculture sector that is resisting the \nmove toward greater consolidation and concentration. The Fuels Security \nAct of 2005 goes a long way toward ensuring that farmers retain market \npower and will continue to play a leading role in renewable energy \nproduction.\n  While adjusting the schedule to match growth is crucial, equally \nimportant is ensuring that the schedule and standard are not eroded by \na permissive credit program or inconsistent and suspect waiver \nauthority provisions. To that end, the Fuels Security Act of 2005 \ncreates a one-year credit program to provide flexibility to blenders \nwithout diluting the RFS requirement. An ill-defined or open-ended \ncredit program will cause investors to hedge against investing in new \nethanol facilities as the guarantee of an increased baseline is \nweakened through multi-year credit trading language.\n  Additionally, the bill includes an effective tool to ensure that \nafter 2012, America's renewable fuel market does not diminish and \ncapacity and production match demand. The bill directs the Secretaries \nof Agriculture and Energy, as well as the Environmental Protection \nAgency to ensure the RFS schedule grows with the overall motor vehicle \nfuel pool after 2013.\n  I am proud to stand with over a dozen agriculture, clean energy and \nrenewable fuels organizations that support this legislation. \nAccordingly, I ask unanimous consent that a letter written by over a \ndozen agriculture and energy groups be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1)\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am encouraged that as a consequence of \nthe strong bipartisan support for increasing the RFS to 8 billion \ngallons, my colleagues and I can add this bill to a comprehensive \nenergy proposal working through the Senate.\n  Furthermore, as a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, I remain committed to working with my Senate colleagues, \nChairman Domenici and Majority Leader Frist and Minority Leader Reid \ntoward ensuring that the Fuels Security Act of 2005 becomes law.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                   March 17, 2005.\n     Re the Fuels Agreement and the Renewable Fuels Standard.\n\n     Hon.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join as a cosponsor of the \nFuels Security Act of 2005, which sets a renewable fuels standard for \nthe years 2006 to 2012.\n  To lessen our dependence on foreign oil and strengthen our economy \nhere at home, renewable fuels like ethanol ought to be a larger part of \nour domestic fuel supply. This bill will contribute to that objective, \nand I commend Senators Lugar and Harkin for their leadership in \ncrafting this legislation.\n  Yesterday, during the markup of a similar bill in the Senate \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, I expressed strong support for \nestablishing a meaningful renewable fuels standard as an important part \nof a comprehensive national energy policy. The bill before the \nCommittee set targets at 3.8 billion gallons in 2006 and 6 billion \ngallons in 2012, improving upon last year's RFS provision in the energy \nbill conference report that set targets at 3.1 billion gallons and 5 \nbillion gallons, respectively.\n  I voted for the chairman's mark yesterday because it gets the RFS \ndebate rolling in the new Congress. However, I also noted that it has \nbeen widely reported in the trade press that the 30-state Governors \nEthanol Coalition has recommended to the President that refiners be \nrequired to purchase a minimum volume of ethanol of at least 4 billion \ngallons in 2006, rising to 8 billion gallons in 2012. This \nrecommendation adds weight to the view expressed by me and others that \nthe committee's targets are too conservative.\n  Why are these specific targets so important? They are important if we \nare to maximize the ethanol industry's ability to boost farm income by \nproviding a new market for corn; to promote economic growth in rural \ncommunities by increasing production in existing plants and attracting \ninvestment in new community-sized ethanol facilities; and to reduce our \nalarming dependence on imported oil by expanding the volume of ethanol \nin our transportation fuel mix.\n  These are important objectives. They matter. And that is why it is \nimportant to get the specific targets right.\n  In committee yesterday, I suggested that since ethanol production is \nexpected to reach 4 billion gallons this year, we ought to adjust the \ncommittee bill's RFS targets on the Senate floor to reflect current \nmarket reality. I am pleased that Chairman Inhofe seemed open to that \ndebate.\n  I think the Governors Ethanol Coalition recommendation of at least 4 \nbillion gallons in 2006 and 8 billion gallons in 2012 is a good place \nto start this debate. I think any RFS legislation enacted by Congress \nshould contain these levels.\n  That is why I am pleased to cosponsor the Fuels Security Act \nintroduced by Senators Lugar and Harkin today. The ethanol volume \ntargets in this bill--4 billion gallons in 2006 and 8 billion gallons \nin 2012--are in much greater alignment with expected ethanol production \nin future years than those in the Committee bill.\n  Earlier this week, I had the opportunity to tour the Aventine ethanol \nplant in Pekin, IL. My visit reminded me of the work of a Pekin native \nmore than 50 years ago. That person--Senator Everett Dirksen--\nencouraged federal lawmakers to consider ``processing our surplus farm \ncrops into an alcohol . . . to create a market in our own land for our \nown people.''\n  Today, farmers across Illinois, including farmers near Pekin, are \ngrowing corn for fuel, both strengthening our energy security and \nproviding an economic boost to rural communities. By enacting a \nmeaningful RFS, we are displacing more foreign oil with homegrown \nenergy. We are expanding the market for Illinois corn. And we are \npromoting the use of renewable fuel. Remember, unlike other energy \nsources, when you run out of ethanol, you can simply grow more.\n  For too many years, America has been overly dependent on foreign oil \nto meet its domestic energy needs. And, despite rising crude oil prices \nand unsettling volatility in the Persian Gulf, that trend is \nincreasing, not declining. Renewable fuels such as ethanol can help \naddress this dangerous dependence on foreign oil. And a strong \nrenewable fuels standard will maximize this contribution.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S. 651.

A bill to provide financial assistance for the rehabilitation \nof the Benjamin Franklin National Memorial in Philadelphia, \nPennsylvania, and the development of an exhibit to commemorate the \n300th anniversary of the birth of Benjamin Franklin; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \nintroduce a bill to authorize Federal funding for the rehabilitation of \nthe Benjamin Franklin National Memorial. This memorial, an attraction \nfor some 1 million visitors annually, is truly a national treasure, yet \nit has come under significant deterioration. The Franklin statue has \nnot been thoroughly cleaned since 1998; there are structural impacts to \nthe statue from changes in temperature and humidity; the lighting and \nsound systems are obsolete; and the marble walls and stained glass dome \nare discolored from days when smoking was permitted. The bill that \nSenator Santorum and I are introducing today will help ensure that \nFederal funding is made available to preserve and protect our Nation's \nmemorial to Benjamin Franklin, America's distinguished scientist, \nstatesman, inventor, and diplomat.\n  In the 108th Congress, Senator Santorum and I introduced similar \nlegislation to authorize this much needed funding and we were pleased \nthat Senator Domenici, Senator Thomas, and their colleagues on the \nSenate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources favorably reported an \namended version of our legislation to the Senate on September 28, 2004. \nSubsequently, this legislature passed the Senate on October 10, 2004; \nhowever, the limited time available prior to adjournment of the 108th \nCongress precluded passage of this measure by the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Unlike other national memorials, the Benjamin Franklin National \nMemorial does not receive an annual allocation of Federal funds to \nprovide for preventative maintenance or other important activities.\n  The significant burden of maintaining this national memorial has \nbecome a challenge to the Franklin Institute Science Museum of \nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania, custodian of the Benjamin Franklin National \nMemorial. In 1972, The Institute--a non-profit organization--absorbed \nthe sole responsibility for providing the funds necessary to preserve \nand maintain the memorial when Public Law 92-511 designated the \nMemorial Hall at The Franklin Institute Science Museum as the Benjamin \nFranklin National Memorial. In 1973, a Memorandum of Agreement was \nexecuted by the U.S. Department of the Interior and the Franklin \nInstitute that directed the Department to cooperate with the Institute \nin ``all appropriate and mutually agreeable ways in the preservation \nand presentation of the Benjamin Franklin National Memorial Hall as a \nnational memorial,'' however, the Department has not provided any \nFederal funding to the Franklin Institute for those purposes other than \n$300,000 that Senator Santorum and I secured from the ``Save America's \nTreasures'' program in the Fiscal Year 2000 Interior Appropriations Act \nto help improve handicap accessibility to the memorial.\n\n[[Page S3007]]\n\n  The Benjamin Franklin National Memorial at the Franklin Institute \nserves as the Nation's primary location honoring Franklin's life, \nlegacy, and ideals. As we expect visitors to converge on Philadelphia, \nPennsylvania from throughout the world for the Benjamin Franklin \nTercentenary Celebration beginning in January 2006, it is important \nthat the Franklin Institute, as custodian of the Memorial, begin a \nmeticulous restoration and enhancement promptly. I urge my colleagues \nto support this legislation to preserve this national tribute to \nBenjamin Franklin for years to come.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. \n        Dodd):\n  S. 654. A bill to prohibit the expulsion, return, or extradition of \npersons by the United States to countries engaging in torture, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, our Nation has a proud history as the \nleading advocate of human rights around the world. Throughout this \nhistory, we have committed ourselves to numerous international human \nrights treaties, including the Convention Against Torture and Other \nCruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. The bill that I \nintroduce today will reaffirm our obligations under this Convention and \nreassure the world that we are a nation committed to the rule of law. I \nwant to thank my cosponsors, Senators Durbin, Kennedy, and Dodd, for \nworking with me on this legislation, and for their leadership on these \nissues.\n  It has been nearly a year since the first horrific images from Abu \nGhraib prison appeared in the media, shocking the world and shattering \nthe image of the United States. As the Administration circled the \nwagons and claimed the abuses were committed by a ``few bad apples,'' \nnew details about the widespread abuse of detainees continued to \nemerge. I have spoken many times about the need for a comprehensive, \nindependent investigation into the abuse of detainees. I have no doubt \nthat such an investigation would be painful, but it is also a necessary \nstep to moving forward.\n  Prisoner abuse by U.S. personnel is deeply troubling, but it is only \none aspect of a broader and serious problem. While we must ensure that \nprisoners are treated humanely by our own personnel, we must also \nprohibit the use of so-called ``extraordinary renditions'' to send \npeople to other countries where they will be subject to torture. \nArticle 3 of the Convention Against Torture states that ``no State \nParty shall expel, return or extradite a person to another State where \nthere are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger \nof being subjected to torture.'' The bill I introduce today, the \n``Convention Against Torture Implementation Act,'' will ensure that we \nhonor this commitment.\n  We have addressed this issue before. Congress implemented Article 3 \nof the Convention Against Torture in the Foreign Affairs Reform and \nRestructuring Act of 1998, but this Administration has exploited \nloopholes in that law to transfer detainees to countries where they are \nsubjected to torture. Attorney General Gonzales recently said that U.S. \npolicy is not to send detainees ``to countries where we believe or we \nknow that they're going to be tortured,'' but he acknowledged that we \n``can't fully control'' what other nations do, and added that he does \nnot know whether countries have always complied with their promises. In \nfact, they have not.\n  My proposed legislation does not broaden the obligations that we \nagreed to by ratifying the Convention Against Torture; it simply closes \nthe loopholes in the 1998 law and ensures that we honor our commitment \nnot to outsource torture to other countries.\n  The case of Maher Arar provides a chilling example of extraordinary \nrendition, and illustrates why this bill is necessary. Mr. Arar, a \nCanadian and Syrian citizen, was stopped by immigration officers at \nJohn F. Kennedy International Airport in September 2002 as he attempted \nto change planes on his way home to Canada from Tunisia. He claims that \nhe was interrogated by an FBI agent and a New York City police officer, \nand that he was denied access to a lawyer. He further claims that he \nrepeatedly told U.S. officials that he feared he would be tortured if \ndeported to Syria. After being detained for nearly two weeks in a \nFederal detention center in New York, Mr. Arar was transferred by U.S. \nauthorities to Syria and held at the Bush administration's request. Mr. \nArar claims that he was physically tortured during the first two weeks \nof his detention in Syria, and that he was subjected to severe \npsychological abuse over the following 10 months, including being held \nin a grave-like cell and being forced to undergo interrogation while \nhearing the screams of other prisoners.\n  According to Administration officials, the CIA received diplomatic \nassurances from Syria that it would not torture Mr. Arar. But those \nassurances amounted to little more than a wink and a nod. Unnamed \nintelligence officials were later quoted in the press, saying that Arar \nconfessed under torture in Syria that he had gone to Afghanistan for \nterrorist training. Syria has a well-documented history of state-\nsponsored torture. In fact, President Bush stated on November 7, 2003, \nthat Syria has left ``a legacy of torture, oppression, misery, and \nruin'' to its people.\n  Rather than rely on assurances that a country will not torture an \nindividual, we must make our own unbiased determination. We already \nhave the necessary information to do so. Each year, as required by law, \nthe State Department publishes country reports on human rights \npractices. The most recent report on Syria states that its torture \nmethods include ``administering electrical shocks; pulling out \nfingernails; forcing objects into the rectum; beating, sometimes while \nthe victim was suspended from the ceiling; hyperextending the spine; \nbending the detainees into the frame of a wheel and whipping exposed \nbody parts; and using a backward-bending chair to asphyxiate the victim \nor fracture the victim's spine.''\n  Some will argue that the post-9/11 world is different; that we must \nuse any and all means available to extract information from suspected \nterrorists. Their argument might be more credible if every person who \nturned up on a terrorist watch list were, in fact, a terrorist. I \ncannot say whether Mr. Arar had ties to terrorist groups or not, but we \ndo know that he was never charged with a crime. After enduring months \nof torture at the hands of the Syrians, he was released and sent back \nto Canada.\n  Nor was Mr. Arar's experience an isolated incident. A recent article \nin The New Yorker titled ``Outsourcing Torture'' provides disturbing \ndetails about how the administration embraced the use of rendition \nafter the 9/11 attacks. Several press reports detail the CIA's use of \nits own Gulfstream V and Boeing 737 jets to secretly transfer detainees \nto countries around the world, where it is likely that they will be \ntortured.\n  The Convention Against Torture Implementation Act addresses the \nextraordinary rendition problem in a straightforward manner. It \nrequires the State Department to produce annually a list of countries \nwhere torture is known to occur. The list would be based on information \ncontained in the State Department's country reports on human rights \npractices. The bill prohibits the transfer of individuals to any \ncountry on this list or to any other country if there are substantial \ngrounds for believing that the person would be tortured. It also \nprovides reasonable exceptions to this prohibition to allow for legal \nextraditions and removals.\n  Most importantly, the bill closes the diplomatic assurances loophole. \nWe would no longer accept assurances from governments that we know \nengage in torture. Our past reliance on diplomatic assurances is \nblatantly hypocritical. How can our State Department denounce countries \nfor engaging in torture while the CIA secretly transfers detainees to \nthe very same countries for interrogation? The President says he does \nnot condone torture, but transferring detainees to other countries \nwhere they will be tortured does not absolve our government of \nresponsibility. By outsourcing torture to these countries, we diminish \nour own values as a nation and lose our credibility as an advocate of \nhuman rights around the world.\n  Last June, in the aftermath of the Abu Ghraib scandal, the President \nwas asked if he had authorized abusive interrogation techniques. He \nreplied,\n\n[[Page S3008]]\n\n``The authorization I issued was that anything we did would conform to \nU.S. law and would be consistent with international treaty \nobligations.'' The legislation I introduce today will help us fulfill \nthe President's promise.\n  The Senate gave its advice and consent to the ratification of the \nConvention Against Torture more than a decade ago. It is time to honor \nour commitment and show the world that we will hold ourselves to the \nsame standards that we demand of others.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na section-by-section analysis be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 654\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Convention Against Torture \n     Implementation Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON CERTAIN TRANSFERS OF PERSONS.\n\n       (a) Prohibition.--No person in the custody or control of a \n     department, agency, or official of the United States \n     Government, or of any contractor of any such department or \n     agency, shall be expelled, returned, or extradited to another \n     country, whether directly or indirectly, if--\n       (1) the country is included on the most recent list \n     submitted to Congress by the Secretary of State under section \n     3; or\n       (2) there are otherwise substantial grounds for believing \n     that the person would be in danger of being subjected to \n     torture.\n       (b) Exceptions.--\n       (1) Waivers.--\n       (A) Authority.--The Secretary of State may waive the \n     prohibition in subsection (a)(1) with respect to a country if \n     the Secretary certifies to the appropriate congressional \n     committees that--\n       (i) the acts of torture that were the basis for including \n     that country on the list have ended; and\n       (ii) there is in place a mechanism that assures the \n     Secretary in a verifiable manner that a person expelled, \n     returned, or extradited to that country will not be tortured \n     in that country, including, at a minimum, immediate, \n     unfettered, and continuing access, from the point of return, \n     to such person by an independent humanitarian organization.\n       (B) Reports on waivers.--\n       (i) Reports required.--For each person expelled, returned, \n     or extradited under a waiver provided under subparagraph (A), \n     the head of the appropriate government agency making such \n     transfer shall submit to the appropriate congressional \n     committees a report that includes the name and nationality of \n     the person transferred, the date of transfer, the reason for \n     such transfer, and the name of the receiving country.\n       (ii) Form.--Each report under this subparagraph shall be \n     submitted, to the extent practicable, in unclassified form, \n     but may include a classified annex as necessary to protect \n     the national security of the United States.\n       (2) Extradition or removal.--The prohibition in subsection \n     (a)(1) may not be construed to apply to the legal extradition \n     of a person under a bilateral or multilateral extradition \n     treaty or to the legal removal of a person under the \n     immigration laws of the United States if, before such \n     extradition or removal, the person has recourse to a United \n     States court of competent jurisdiction to challenge such \n     extradition or removal on the basis that there are \n     substantial grounds for believing that the person would be in \n     danger of being subjected to torture in the receiving \n     country.\n       (c) Assurances Insufficient.--Written or verbal assurances \n     made to the United States by the government of a country that \n     persons in its custody or control will not be tortured are \n     not sufficient for believing that a person is not in danger \n     of being subjected to torture for purposes of subsections \n     (a)(2) and (b)(2), or for meeting the requirement of \n     subsection (b)(1)(A)(ii).\n\n     SEC. 3. REPORTS ON COUNTRIES USING TORTURE.\n\n       Not later than 30 days after the effective date of this \n     Act, and annually thereafter, the Secretary of State shall \n     submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report \n     listing each country where torture is known to be used. The \n     list shall be compiled on the basis of the information \n     contained in the most recent annual report of the Secretary \n     of State submitted to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the \n     Senate under section 116(d) of the Foreign Assistance Act of \n     1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151n(d)).\n\n     SEC. 4. REGULATIONS.\n\n       (a) Interim Regulations.--Not later than 60 days after the \n     effective date of this Act, the heads of the appropriate \n     government agencies shall prescribe interim regulations for \n     the purpose of carrying out this Act and implementing the \n     obligations of the United States under Article 3 of the \n     Convention Against Torture, subject to any reservations, \n     understandings, declarations, and provisos contained in the \n     Senate resolution advising and consenting to the ratification \n     of the Convention Against Torture, and consistent with the \n     provisions of this Act.\n       (b) Final Regulations.--Not later than 180 days after \n     interim regulations are prescribed under subsection (a), and \n     following a period of notice and opportunity for public \n     comment, the heads of the appropriate government agencies \n     shall prescribe final regulations for the purposes described \n     in subsection (a).\n\n     SEC. 5. SAVINGS CLAUSE.\n\n       Nothing in this Act shall be construed to eliminate, limit, \n     or constrain in any way the obligations of the United States \n     or the rights of any individual under the Convention Against \n     Torture or any other applicable law.\n\n     SEC. 6. REPEAL OF SUPERSEDED AUTHORITY.\n\n       Section 2242 of the Foreign Affairs Reform and \n     Restructuring Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-277; 8 U.S.C. 1231 \n     note) is repealed. Regulations promulgated under such section \n     that are in effect on the date this Act becomes effective \n     shall remain in effect until the heads of the appropriate \n     government agencies issue interim regulations under section \n     4(a).\n\n     SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       (a) Defined Terms.--In this Act:\n       (1) Appropriate government agencies.--The term \n     ``appropriate government agencies'' means--\n       (A) the intelligence community (as defined in section 3(4) \n     of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 401a(4))); \n     and\n       (B) elements of the Department of State, the Department of \n     Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department \n     of Justice, the United States Secret Service, the United \n     States Marshals Service, and any other Federal law \n     enforcement, national security, intelligence, or homeland \n     security agency that takes or assumes custody or control of \n     persons or transports persons in its custody or control \n     outside the United States, other than those elements listed \n     or designated as elements of the intelligence community under \n     section 3(4) of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. \n     401a(4))).\n       (2) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term \n     ``appropriate congressional committees'' means--\n       (A) the Committees on Armed Services, Homeland Security and \n     Government Affairs, Judiciary, Foreign Relations, and the \n     Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate; and\n       (B) the Committees on Armed Services, Homeland Security, \n     Judiciary, International Relations, and the Permanent Select \n     Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives.\n       (3) Convention against torture.--The term ``Convention \n     Against Torture'' means the United Nations Convention Against \n     Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or \n     Punishment, done at New York on December 10, 1984, entered \n     into force on June 26, 1987, signed by the United States on \n     April 18, 1988, and ratified by the United States on October \n     21, 1994 (T. Doc. 100-20).\n       (4) Expelled person.--A person who is expelled is a person \n     who is involuntarily transferred from the territory of any \n     country, or a port of entry thereto, to the territory of \n     another country, or a port of entry thereto.\n       (5) Extradited person.--A person who is extradited is an \n     accused person who, in accordance with chapter 209 of title \n     18, United States Code, is surrendered or delivered to \n     another country with jurisdiction to try and punish the \n     person.\n       (6) Returned person.--A person who is returned is a person \n     who is transferred from the territory of any country, or a \n     port of entry thereto, to the territory of another country of \n     which the person is a national or where the person has \n     previously resided, or a port of entry thereto.\n       (b) Same Terms as in the Convention Against Torture.--\n     Except as otherwise provided, the terms used in this Act have \n     the meanings given those terms in the Convention Against \n     Torture, subject to any reservations, understandings, \n     declarations, and provisos contained in the Senate resolution \n     advising and consenting to the ratification of the Convention \n     Against Torture.\n\n     SEC. 8. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act shall take effect on the date that is 30 days \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 9. CLASSIFICATION IN UNITED STATES CODE.\n\n       This Act shall be classified to the United States Code as a \n     new chapter of title 50, United States Code.\n\n   Convention Against Torture Implementation Act of 2005 Section-by-\n                            Section Analysis\n\n       Sec. 1. Short Title. The Convention Against Torture \n     Implementation Act of 2005.\n       Sec. 2. Prohibition on Certain Transfers of Persons. This \n     section implements Article 3 of the Convention Against \n     Torture, which prohibits expelling, returning, or extraditing \n     persons to countries where they are in danger of being \n     subjected to torture. Subsection (a) prohibits the transfer \n     of a person in the custody or control of the United States \n     government to a country included on a list generated by the \n     State Department, as required by Section 3 of this Act, or to \n     countries where there are substantial grounds for believing \n     that the person would be in danger of being subjected to \n     torture. Subsection (b) allows exceptions to the prohibition \n     if the Secretary of State waives the prohibition or if the \n     transfer is done under an extradition treaty or as a legal \n     removal under United States immigration laws. Agencies that\n\n[[Page S3009]]\n\n     transfer a detainee under the waiver exception must submit a \n     report of the transfer to appropriate congressional \n     committees. Subsection (c) states that assurances made to the \n     United States by another government that persons in its \n     custody will not be tortured are not sufficient for the \n     United States to conclude that a person will not be subjected \n     to torture.\n       Sec. 3. Reports on Countries Using Torture. This section \n     requires the Secretary of State, on an annual basis, to \n     compile a list of countries where torture is known to be \n     used. The United States is prohibited from transferring \n     persons to the countries on this list, except in accordance \n     with the exceptions contained in section 2. The list shall be \n     compiled based on information contained in the most recent \n     State Department country reports on human rights practices, \n     which the Department submits annually in accordance with \n     section 116(d) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 \n     U.S.C. 2151n(d)).\n       Sec. 4. Regulations. This section requires appropriate \n     government agencies (as defined in section 7) to prescribe \n     regulations in accordance with this Act. Interim regulations \n     must be prescribed within 60 days of the effective date of \n     the Act. Final regulations must be prescribed, through notice \n     and comment rulemaking, not more than 180 days thereafter.\n       Sec. 5. Savings Clause. This section ensures that the Act \n     does not eliminate, limit, or constrain the obligations of \n     the United States or the rights of any individual under the \n     Convention Against Torture or any other applicable law.\n       Sec. 6. Repeal of Superseded Authority. This section \n     repeals section 2242 of the Foreign Affairs Reform and \n     Restructuring Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-277; 8 U.S.C. 1231 \n     note). This law also implemented Article 3 of the Convention \n     Against Torture, but lacked specific guidance for agencies \n     and allowed the United States to rely on diplomatic \n     assurances that a government would not torture a person \n     transferred to its custody. This section also requires agency \n     regulations promulgated under section 2242 to remain in \n     effect until the appropriate government agencies issue new \n     regulations in accordance with section 4 of this Act.\n       Sec. 7. Definitions. This section defines ``Appropriate \n     Government Agencies,'' ``Appropriate Congressional \n     Committees,'' ``Expelled Person,'' ``Extradited Person,'' \n     ``Returned Person,'' and ``Convention Against Torture.'' It \n     also states that terms used in the Act, unless otherwise \n     provided, have the meanings given to those terms in the \n     Convention Against Torture.\n       Sec. 8. Effective Date. Makes the Act effective 30 days \n     after its enactment.\n       Sec. 9. Classification in United States Code. This section \n     requires the Act to be classified as a new chapter of title \n     50 in the United States Code. The superseded authority was \n     classified as a note in title 8 in the United States Code. \n     Given the scope and applicability of the Act, it is more \n     accurate to classify it in the War and National Defense title \n     than in the Aliens and Nationality title.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the entire world continues to wait for \nsigns that the administration takes seriously its moral and legal \nresponsibilities to eliminate torture and abuse. It is long past time \nfor the administration to give the American people and the world an \nironclad assurance that these shameful tactics are no longer being used \nin any prison or detention facility under American control and that we \nare not outsourcing our torture to regimes well known for using them.\n  I strongly support the legislation that Senator Leahy has introduced \nto deal with this urgent problem and to see that our Nation is not \nfarming out abusive interrogations to other countries. The bill makes \ncrystal clear that we can't torture by proxy.\n  Abhorrence to torture is a fundamental value. Our attitude toward \ntorture speaks volumes about our national conscience, our dedication to \nthe rule of law, and our essential ideals. \n9/11 is no excuse for abandoning our ideals.\n  The line separating right from wrong must clearly exclude the \nreprehensible practice called extraordinary rendition, the ridiculous \ncode word for torture by proxy. Article 3 of the Treaty Against \nTorture, which the United States has ratified, provides: ``No State \nParty shall expel, return, or extradite a person to another State where \nthere are substantial grounds for believing he would be in danger of \nbeing subjected to torture.'' The secretive U.S. practice of rendition \nis a violation of international law because it involves detaining \nprisoners without a shred of due process and delivering them for \ninterrogation into the hands of countries known to commit torture. As \none commentator noted: ``In terms of bad behavior, it stands side by \nside with contract killings.''\n  Ask Maher Arar. In the fall of 2002, Arar, a Canadian citizen, was \nreturning to Montreal from a family visit in Tunisia and he made a \nstopover at Kennedy Airport in New York City. Acting in part on flawed \nintelligence from Canadian officials, U.S. Immigration officials seized \nMr. Arar at the airport. He was not charged with a crime, or given a \nchance to talk with a lawyer. Instead, he was held in Brooklyn and \ninterrogated for days by U.S. law enforcement authorities.\n  When the interrogation failed to produce incriminating information, \nMr. Arar was flown to Jordan and handed over to Jordanian authorities. \nHe was chained, blindfolded, and beaten in a van that transported him \nto the Syrian border. In Syria, he was placed in a small, dark cell--\nthree feet by six feet, like a grave--and was held there for almost a \nyear. He was slapped, beaten, and whipped on his palms, wrists, and \nback with an electric cable. He begged them to stop. He heard other \nprisoners screaming as they were tortured. He signed any confessions he \nwas told to sign.\n  Mr. Arar was released in October 2003. Syrian officials told \nreporters that their investigators found no link between Mr. Arar and \nal-Qaida. His confession turned out to be worthless and his suffering \nwas pointless. Mr. Arar is now home in Canada.\n  How can any of us stand idly by knowing that this country condoned \nand facilitated such brutality?\n  Tragically, Mr. Arar is not the only victim. On March 6, 60 Minutes \naired a report on rendition. On the program, Michael Scheuer, a \nrecently retired CIA official who created its rendition program, \nadmitted that he would ``have to assume'' that suspects the U.S. sends \nto Egypt are tortured. ``It's very convenient,'' he said. ``It's \nfinding someone else to do your dirty work.''\n  The Defense Department has attempted to justify this tactic. On June \n25, 2003, Defense Department General Counsel William Haynes wrote to \nSenator Leahy, stating that whenever the U.S. transfers an individual \nto another country, ``United States policy is to obtain specific \nassurances from the receiving country that it will not torture the \nindividual being transferred to that country. We can assure you that \nthe United States would take steps to investigate credible allegations \nof torture and take appropriate action if there were reason to believe \nthat those assurances were not being honored.''\n  Mr. Haynes' ``assurances,'' are difficult to accept. The State \nDepartment's annual human rights report, released last month, \ncriticized numerous countries for a range of interrogation practices it \nlabeled as torture. The State Department identified Syria, Egypt, and \nSaudi Arabia, among others, as countries practicing torture. Press \nreports make clear that since \n9/11, the U.S. has flown 100-150 suspects to countries such as these. \nThe State Department condemns Syria for torturing its prisoners, but \nMr. Haynes blindly relies on Syria's promise that the prisoners we send \nthere will be treated humanely.\n  Recent press reports also suggest that the assurances of humane \ntreatment sought by the CIA are worth very little. According to today's \nWashington Post, ``one government official who visited several foreign \nprisons where suspects were rendered by the CIA said \n. . . `It's widely understood that the interrogation practices that \nwould be illegal in the U.S. are being used.' '' The official also \nsaid, ``they say they are not abusing them . . . but we all know they \ndo.''\n  According to the Post, an Arab diplomat, whose country is actively \nengaged in counterterrorism alongside the CIA said it was unrealistic \nto believe the CIA really wants to follow up on assurances. He said: \n``It would be stupid to keep track of them because then you would know \nwhat's going on.'' He said, ``it's like don't ask don't tell.''\n  So, it seems that we are not fooling anybody but the American public.\n  We are a Nation of laws, not hypocrites. Our country is strong and \nour constitutional system has endured because it permits us to do great \nthings and still ensure that we treat people fairly and humanely. We \nare not supposed to ``disappear'' people here.\n  Yet, that is exactly what rendition and the related tactic of ``ghost \ndetainees'' amounts to, making people vanish into a shadowy world of \nsecret abuse. In his report on the abuses at Abu Ghraib prison, MG. \nAntonio Taguba\n\n[[Page S3010]]\n\nwrote that prisoners had not been registered as required by Army \nregulations and they were being moved around to avoid detection by the \nRed Cross. General Taguba called the practice ``deceptive, contrary to \nArmy doctrine, and in\n   violation of international law.'' Last September, Army investigators \ntold the Senate Armed Services Committee that as many as 100 detainees \nat Abu Ghraib had been hidden from the Red Cross at the CIA's \ndirection.\n\n  Last month, the Associated Press reported that one of the ``ghost \ndetainees'' held at Abu Ghraib, Manadel al-Jamadi, died in November \n2003 under CIA interrogation. He had been suspended by his wrists, with \nhis hands cuffed behind his back. According to an Army guard who was \nasked by the interrogator to adjust al-Jamadi's position, blood gushed \nfrom his mouth ``as if a faucet had been turned on'' after he was \nreleased from his shackles.\n  Behavior like that forces us all to ask, ``what has America become?''\n  The issue shows no signs of abating. Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva \nConvention states that transfers of detainees from occupied territory \nto any other country ``are prohibited, regardless of their motive.'' \nViolations of the Article constitute ``grave breaches'' of the Treaty \nand qualify as ``war crimes'' under Federal law. Nevertheless, a \nJustice Department memorandum in March, 2004 re-interpreted the Treaty \nto allow the CIA to remove prisoners from Iraq for the purpose of \n``facilitating interrogation.'' According to press reports, the CIA \nused this ``Goldsmith Memorandum'' as justification to transport ``as \nmany as a dozen detainees'' out of Iraq. The legal analysis in the \nmemorandum is an embarrassment. Yet it appears to have provided the \nlegal justification for the CIA to commit war crimes.\n  The New York Times recently reported that the U.S. plans to transfer \nas many as half the 550 detainees held at Guantanamo Bay to prisons in \nother countries. This week, a Federal judge blocked the government from \ntransferring 13 citizens of Yemen until a hearing can be held on the \npropriety of the move. Lawyers for the detainees expressed concern that \nthe prisoners would be delivered into the hands of torture.\n  Even worse, last week Attorney General Gonzales defended the practice \nof rendition, despite admitting that he ``can't fully control'' what \nother nations do and that he doesn't know whether countries have always \ncomplied with their promises.\n  Congress can't allow these shameful tactics to continue. Senator \nLeahy's bill is designed to prevent them. It states that no person in \nthe custody or control of the United States can be sent to another \ncountry on the State Department list of countries that commit torture. \nNor, may any person be sent to a country, even if it is not on the \nState Department list, where there are grounds to believe the person \nwould be in danger of being tortured. The bill states that mere \ndiplomatic assurances that detainees will be treated humanely are not \nsufficient to permit a detainee's transfer. Instead, in certain \ncircumstances, the act permits delivery of the detainee where there is \nan actual mechanism to verify that the person will not be tortured, \nsuch as by allowing unfettered access to the detainee by humanitarian \norganizations.\n  The Bush administration's has clearly condoned the use of torture and \nabuse by our own government, as well as handing prisoners over to other \ncountries for the same purpose. Officials have approved and used \ninterrogation techniques that include feigning suffocation, feigning \ndrowning, ``stress positions,'' sleep deprivation, and the use of \nunmuzzled dogs. According to one report, ``The methods employed by the \nCIA are so severe that senior officials of the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation have directed its agents to stay out of many of the \ninterviews of the high-level detainees . . . ``because the FBI fears \nthat the techniques could subject their agents to criminal lawsuits.\n  The anti-rendition bill offered today is a way to start addressing \nthe problem. It deserves to pass as soon as possible. Torture and other \nabuses of prisoners in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Guantanamo have done \nimmense damage to America's standing in the world and has clearly made \nthe war on terrorism harder to win. We need to repair that damage and \nre-claim our national commitment to fairness and decency.\n  As Edmund Burke said, ``The only thing necessary for the triumph of \nevil is for good men to do nothing.'' We in Congress have it in our \npower to prevent the triumph of an evil practice. Knowing what we now \nknow, the Senate cannot simply look away and do nothing. I urge my \ncolleagues to support us in ending these despicable abuses.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENSIGN (for himself and Ms. Landrieu):\n  S. 657. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nmake a technical correction in the definition of outpatient speech-\nlanguage pathology services; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, today I introduced a bill that would \nexpand access to speech-language pathology care.\n  Speech-language pathology, or speech therapy, includes services for \npatients with speech, hearing and language disorders, which result in \ncommunication disabilities. Speech therapy also includes the diagnosis \nand treatment of swallowing disorders, regardless of the presence of \ncommunications disability. Communications disabilities most frequently \naffect patients who suffer from a stroke, tumor, head injury, or have \nbeen diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis \n(ALS) , or other neuromuscular diseases.\n  As a result of a legislative anomaly, patients cannot receive \nMedicare coverage for speech-language pathology care in a private \npractice setting. Under the Medicare program, the same patient is able \nto receive such care in a hospital, skilled nursing facility, or \nrehabilitation facility. This bill would not create a new benefit. \nRather, it would provide a technical correction to a section of \nMedicare statute that originated more than 30 years ago. Under current \nlaw, physical therapy and occupational therapy care can be received by \npatients in the private practice setting.\n  In 1972, speech-language pathology services were added to the \nMedicare statute under the physical therapy definition section. 14 \nyears later, occupational therapy was defined under a separate section. \nUnlike speech-language pathology services, occupational therapy \nservices were not incorporated within the physical therapy definition. \nAs a result, a patient can receive both physical and occupational \ntherapy care in an independent practice setting. The legislation I am \nintroducing today would enable patients to likewise receive speech-\nlanguage therapy services in private practice settings.\n  Without this legislative fix, beneficiaries may confront situations \nin which they either do not have access to a Medicare-covered setting \nor do not meet the requirements to receive care from other settings. \nThis can be especially problematic in rural communities with fewer \nhospitals, skilled nursing facilities, and rehabilitation facilities.\n  For example, consider an elderly patient who is discharged from a \nhospital, but requires follow-up physical therapy and speech-language \npathology care. The patient would be able to obtain necessary physical \ntherapy care in an independent practice setting, but would not be able \nto receive necessary speech-language pathology care in the same \nsetting. The patient would have to see the necessary speech-language \npathology care in another Medicare setting, possibly having to travel \nfarther distances to receive such care or not receive it all.\n  Essentially, the legislation I am introducing today would ensure that \npatients have access to speech-language pathology services, \nparticularly in rural areas. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this commonsense legislation.\n  This legislation compliments the measure I introduced last month, \ncalled the Medicare Access to Rehabilitation Services Act (S. 438). \nBoth bills ensure access to needed therapy care within the Medicare \nprogram. I am committed to working toward their enactment and believe \nthat they will help Medicare beneficiaries obtain the quality health \ncare that they deserve.\n\n[[Page S3011]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Allard, Mr. \n        Bunning, Mr. Burr, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Craig, Mr. \n        Crapo, Mr. Demint, Mr. DeWine, Mrs. Dole, Mr. Domenici, Mr. \n        Ensign, Mr. Graham, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. \n        Kyl, Mr. Martinez, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Sessions, \n        Mr. Shelby, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Thune, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Voinovich, \n        and Mr. Talent):\n  S. 658. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to prohibit \nhuman cloning; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the Brownback-\nLandrieu Human Cloning Prohibition Act, which we introduce today.\n  The Brownback-Landrieu Human Cloning Prohibition Act remains the only \neffective ban on human cloning.\n  This legislation has passed the U.S. House of Representatives twice \nby large margins. This bill would also bring the U.S. into conformity \nwith the recent vote at the United Nations, where the General Assembly \ncalled on all member states ``to prohibit all forms of human cloning'' \nby a strong 84 to 34 margin.\n  President Bush has also spoken eloquently on the Brownback-Landrieu \nHuman Cloning Prohibition Act, when he ``wholeheartedly'' endorsed the \nlegislation.\n  The President said: ``Human cloning is deeply troubling to me, and to \nmost Americans. Life is a creation, not a commodity.\n  ``Our children are gifts to be loved and protected, not products to \nbe designed and manufactured. Allowing cloning would be taking a \nsignificant step toward a society in which human beings are grown for \nspare body parts, and children are engineered to custom specifications; \nand that's not acceptable. . . .\n  ``I strongly support a comprehensive law against all human cloning. \nAnd I endorse the bill wholeheartedly endorse the bill--sponsored by \nSenator Brownback and Senator Mary Landrieu.''\n  The President could hardly have been clearer.\n  We should take a stand against those that would turn young human \nbeings into commodities and spare parts. We should not use human life \nfor research purposes.\n  The legislation introduced by Sen. Landrieu and myself, along with \nover one quarter of the Senate, answers that human life should not be \nused for research purposes.\n  Let there be no doubt. Science affirms that the young human, at his \nor her earliest moments of life, is a human. It is wrong to treat \nanother person as a piece of property that can be bought and sold, \ncreated and destroyed, all at the will of those in power.\n  The issue of human cloning--and specifically how we treat the young \nhuman--will determine the kind of future we will give to our children \nand grandchildren.\n  The essential question is whether or not we will allow human beings \nto be produced, to preordained specifications, for their eventual \nimplantation or destruction, depending upon the intentions of the \ntechnicians who created them.\n  Will we create life simply to destroy it?\n  I firmly believe that human life should be cherished and that human \ndignity should be protected.\n  I also firmly believe that ethically-sound research should proceed in \nthe search for cures. The legislation that we introduce today takes a \nvery thoughtful approach and is careful not to ban or interfere with \ngene therapy, IVF practices, or DNA, cell or tissue cloning--other than \nwith cloned embryos.\n  Now, some of our colleagues will tell you that they oppose \n`reproductive cloning,' but then turn around and call for `therapeutic \ncloning' or `SCNT.' Whether intentional or not, to argue that there are \ndifferent types of human cloning creates a distinction that simply does \nnot exist.\n  All human cloning is `reproductive.' The question is simply: What do \nyou do with the young, cloned human? Do you implant it and bring it to \nbirth--like the sheep Dolly--or do you research on and kill the young \nhuman being, as advocates of so-called `therapeutic' cloning would have \nus do?\n  Any other so-called human cloning bans, outside of the Brownback-\nLandrieu Human Cloning Prohibition Act, are not enforceable. Once the \nyoung human has been cloned, you cannot distinguish it from any other \nhuman embryo produced by IVF or embodied sexual intercourse.\n  If so-called `therapeutic' human cloning proceeds--and there are no \nlaws in the U.S. against it--one of these human clones will be \nimplanted, and there is nothing we can do to stop human cloning once we \nreach this point.\n  Even if we detected a clonal human pregnancy, nothing could be done \nabout it. Any remedies or punishments would be highly unpopular and \nunenforceable.\n  As I have already stated, over a quarter of all U.S. Senators have \nagreed to be original cosponsors of this bill, and it is our intention \nto press for a clean vote in the Senate during the 109th Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Grassley, and Mrs. \n        Lincoln):\n  S. 661. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor the modernization of the United States Tax Court, and for other \npurposes, to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Tax Court \nModernization Act. I am joined in this legislation by the Chairman and \nRanking Democrat of the Finance Committee, Senator Grassley and Senator \nBaucus, and my colleague Senator Lincoln.\n  The United States Tax Court plays an important role in our tax \nsystem. However, it has been years since Congress has taken a good hard \nlook at the Tax Court. This bipartisan piece of legislation will \nimprove this Court in a number of ways, and I would like to take a \nmoment to summarize some of its provisions.\n  First, the TCMA would make minor changes in the Tax Court's \njurisdiction. These are small changes that will have a big impact on \nthe Court's efficiency. For example, the bill would allow the Tax Court \nto hire employees on its own, just as other courts do. Currently, the \nTax Court is forced to hire through the Executive Branch's Office of \nPersonnel Management, entangling the executive power with the judicial \npower. Restoring the constitutional separation of powers in the hiring \nprocess will increase the independence of the Tax Court.\n  Second, the TCMA would improve the way that Tax Court judges receive \nretirement benefits and other non-salary benefits. I believe that Tax \nCourt judges should be treated the same way that bankruptcy, Court of \nFederal Claims, and Article III judges are treated when it comes to \nfringe benefits.\n  Tax Court judges are often not provided with the same benefits as \nsimilarly appointed Article I and Article III judges. For example, \nCongress allows Article III, bankruptcy, and Court of Federal Claims \njudges to participate in the Thrift Savings Plan in addition to the \nCivil Service Retirement System, while Tax Court judges are ineligible \nto participate in this program. These disparities in the treatment of \nour Tax Court judges affect the Court's ability to attract and retain \nseasoned judges, as well as talented employees.\n  This legislation is non-controversial and is the result of many years \nof work. The Finance Committee passed the bill three separate times \nduring the 108th Congress, but it unfortunately was not included in a \nvehicle that made it to enactment. Hopefully, we will be able to get \nthese provisions to the President's desk this year.\n  I have spent many years observing the Federal judiciary. I have spent \nmany years trying to improve the Judicial Branch of our government and \nto make it the very finest court system the world has ever known. I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues on the Senate Finance \nCommittee on this important piece of legislation. I urge my colleagues, \nboth on the Finance Committee and in the Senate as a whole, to support \nthis legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a summary of the \nprovisions of the U.S. Tax Court Modernization Act.\n\n[[Page S3012]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         U.S. Tax Court Modernization Act Summary of Provisions\n\n       Jurisdiction of Tax Court over collection due process \n     cases. Currently, if a taxpayer's underlying tax liability \n     does not relate to income taxes or a type of tax over which \n     the Tax Court normally has deficiency jurisdiction, there is \n     no opportunity for Tax Court review and the taxpayer must \n     file in a District Court to obtain review. This provision \n     consolidates judicial review of collection due process \n     activity in the Tax Court.\n       Authority for special trial judges to hear and decide \n     certain employment status cases. This provision clarifies \n     that the Tax Court may authorize its special trial judges to \n     enter decisions in employment status cases that are subject \n     to small case proceedings under section 7436(c).\n       Confirmation of authority of Tax Court to apply doctrine of \n     equitable recoupment. The common-law principle of equitable \n     recoupment permits a party to assert an otherwise time-barred \n     claim to reduce or defeat an opponent's claim if both claims \n     arise from the same transaction. This provision confirms \n     statutorily that the Tax Court may apply equitable recoupment \n     principles to the same extent as District Courts and the \n     Court of Federal Claims.\n       Tax Court filing fee in all cases commenced by filing \n     petition. This provision clarifies, in keeping with current \n     Tax Court procedure, that the Tax Court is authorized to \n     impose a $60 filing fee for all cases commenced by petition. \n     The proposal would eliminate the need to amend section 7451 \n     each time the Tax Court is granted new jurisdiction.\n       Amendments to appoint employees. Currently, the Tax Court \n     has to go to the executive branch, the Office of Personnel \n     Management, to change a position. It is inappropriate to \n     require the Tax Court to seek permission from the executive \n     since that branch is a party (Commissioner of Internal \n     Revenue) before the Tax Court. This change would allow the \n     Tax Court to be independent in fact and perception from the \n     Executive Branch while ensuring that basic employee rights, \n     protections, and remedies are retained or required in an \n     appropriate way (e.g., whistleblower protection, civil \n     rights, merit system principles, etc.).\n       Expanded use of Tax Court practice fee for pro se \n     taxpayers. The Tax Court is authorized to charge \n     practitioners a fee of up to $30 per year and to use these \n     fees to pursue disciplinary matters. The provision expands \n     use of these fees to provide services to pro se taxpayers. \n     Fees could be used for education programs for pro se \n     taxpayers.\n       Annuities for survivors of Tax Court judges who are \n     assassinated. The reality is that many people do not like to \n     pay taxes. There is as much risk of a Tax Court judge being \n     assassinated as any other Federal judge. The proposal would \n     conform the treatment of Tax Court judges to District Court \n     judges.\n       Cost-of-living adjustments for Tax Court judicial survivor \n     annuities. All Federal employees have this provision except \n     the Tax Court. Survivors of Tax Court judges are subject to \n     an obsolete method of indexing.\n       Life insurance coverage for Tax Court judges. This simply \n     codifies current Office of Personnel Management \n     interpretation, as was previously done for District Court \n     judges.\n       Cost of life insurance coverage for Tax Court judges age 65 \n     or over. Congress established the Tax Court in 1969 and \n     required that Tax Court judges receive the same compensation \n     as District Court judges. The District Court judges were \n     given this benefit to ensure that there was no diminution of \n     their compensation (as required by the Constitution). This \n     provision is in keeping with the original intent of Congress.\n       Modification of timing of lump-sum payment of judge's \n     accrued annual leave. District Court judges are allowed to \n     receive a lump-sum payment due to the life-time tenure of \n     Article III judges. Tax Court judges, while they have a 15 \n     year term, effectively have a life-time term because they are \n     always subject to recall.\n       Participation of Tax Court judges in the Thrift Savings \n     Plan. The proposal would allow Tax Court judges to \n     participate in Thrift Savings Plan. Currently, only 19 \n     federal government employees are left out of the Thrift \n     Savings Plan (i.e., Tax Court judges).\n       Exemption of teaching compensation of retired judges for \n     limitation on outside earned income. After retirement, Tax \n     Court judges should have the same ability to teach as \n     District Court judges.\n       General provisions relating to magistrate judges of the Tax \n     Court. ``Magistrate'' is more recognizable to the American \n     public because it is the term used by Article III courts. The \n     provision changes the term ``Special Trial Judge'' to \n     ``Magistrate Judge of the United States Tax Court'' and \n     provides for alignment of term of office and removal \n     applicable to District Court magistrate judges.\n       Annuities to surviving spouses and dependent children of \n     magistrate judges of the Tax Court. This section gives \n     Magistrates/Special Trial Judges the same advantages as Tax \n     Court judges, thus ensuring a greater pool of participants in \n     the fund.\n       Retirement and annuity program for magistrate judges. A \n     retirement and annuity program more aligned with District \n     Court Magistrates and the Tax Court judges is key for \n     attracting and retaining qualified judges.\n       Incumbent magistrate judges of the Tax Court. The provision \n     provides transition rules similar to those given to the \n     District Court magistrate judges.\n       Provisions for recall. Article III judges are ``self-\n     recalling'' (i.e., they decide for themselves whether they \n     are recalled). In contrast, Tax Court judges are subject \n     mandatory recall by the Chief Judge. These provisions \n     authorize the recall in a manner similar to those now \n     applicable to the regular judges of the Court.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to support the United States \nTax Court Modernization Act. I am pleased to be an original cosponsor \nof this important legislation along with Senators Hatch, Grassley and \nLincoln.\n  In 1969, Congress elevated the U.S. Tax Court as a Federal court of \nrecord under Article I of the Constitution of the United States. \nCongress created the Tax Court to provide a judicial forum in which \naffected persons could dispute tax deficiencies determined by the \nCommissioner of the Internal Revenue Service prior to payment of the \ndisputed amounts. That means that the Tax Court's jurisdictional \nrequirements are, in part, a recognition that lower and middle income \ntaxpayers cannot necessarily pay the tax deficiency before taking their \ndispute to court.\n  Congress also closely linked the legislation governing the Tax Court \nwith the laws governing the Article III District Courts. Unfortunately, \nthe Congress did not include the Tax Court in the changes made for \nArticle III courts.\n  This legislation is designed to restore parity between the Tax Court \nand Article III courts, and to modernize their personnel and pension \nsystems.\n  I thank Senator Hatch for sponsoring the legislation. I also want to \nthank former Senator Breaux, who sponsored the legislation in the last \nCongress and who was a strong advocate for the Tax Court as well as \nthis package of modernization provisions.\n  This modernization package is non-controversial and long overdue. In \nthe 108th Congress, the Finance Committee passed the Tax Court \nlegislation three times: as a stand alone bill, as part of the National \nEmployee Savings and Trust Equity Guarantee Act, and as part of the Tax \nAdministration Good Government Act.\n  The Finance Committee intends to mark-up the United States Tax Court \nModernization Act next month. I fully expect the Committee to once \nagain unanimously pass the legislation. I also hope that, soon after \nCommittee action, Majority Leader Frist and Minority Leader Reid will \nbring the United States Tax Court Modernization Act to the floor for \nswift passage.\n  The Finance Committee and the House Ways & Means Committee fought to \nretain jurisdiction over the Tax Court as an Article I, rather than an \nArticle III court. The Committees recognized the benefit to the \nAmerican taxpayer of having a court composed of technical tax law \nexperts. History has proven the wisdom of this decision. The Tax Court \nis composed of dedicated, talented, nonpartisan tax experts. Their \ncommitment to public service is noble. We should recognize the \ncommitment of our Tax Court judges by acting upon the responsibility \nthat the Members before us, our predecessors on the Finance Committee \nand the House Ways and Means Committee, fought to retain by ensuring \nthat the Tax Court modernization provisions become law during the 109th \nCongress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Carper, and Mr. Voinovich):\n  S. 662. A bill to reform the postal laws of the United States; to the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Carper, to introduce the Postal Accountability and \nEnhancement Act of 2005, a bill designed to help the 225-year-old \nPostal Service meet the challenges of the 21st Century. This \nlegislation represents the culmination of a process that began in the \nsummer of 2002 when I introduced a bill to establish a Presidential \nCommission charged with examining the problems the Postal Service \nfaces, and developing specific recommendations and legislative \nproposals that Congress and the Postal Service could implement.\n  I originally introduced the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act \nlast\n\n[[Page S3013]]\n\nMay. In June of 2004, the bill was unanimously reported out of the the \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. That bill, S. \n2468, had the strong endorsements of the National Rural Letter Carriers \nAssociation, the National Association of Letter Carriers, the National \nAssociation of Postmasters of the United States, and the Coalition for \na 21st Century Postal Service--which represents thousands of the major \nmailers, employee groups, small businesses, and other users of the \nmail. It also had the strong bi-partisan support of twenty-two members \nof the United States Senate. Unfortunately, due to a variety of \nfactors, my efforts to have the bill considered before the full Senate \nwere stalled.\n  Since last Fall, Administration representatives have become actively \nengaged in postal reform efforts, and have given me their commitment to \nworking with Congress to ensure passage of a reform bill this year. I \nhave every expectation that this will be the year comprehensive postal \nreform legislation is signed into law.\n  It has long been acknowledged that the financial and operational \nproblems confronting the Postal Service are serious. At present, the \nPostal Service has more than $90 billion in unfunded liabilities and \nobligations, which include $1.8 billion in debt to the U.S. Treasury, \n$7.6 billion for Workers' Compensation claims, $3.5 billion for \nretirement costs, and as much as $47 billion to cover retiree health \ncare costs. The Government Accountability Office's Comptroller General, \nDavid Walker, has pointed to the urgent need for ``fundamental reforms \nto minimize the risk of a significant taxpayer bailout or dramatic \npostal rate increases.'' The Postal Service has been on GAO's ``High-\nRisk'' List since April of 2001. The Postal Service is at risk of a \n``death spiral'' of decreasing volume and increasing rates that lead to \nfurther decreases in volume.\n  In December of 2003, President Bush announced the creation of a \nbipartisan commission charged with identifying the operational, \nstructural, and financial challenges facing the U.S. Postal Service. \nThe President charged this commission with examining all significant \naspects of the Postal Service with the goal of recommending legislative \nand administrative reforms to ensure its long-term viability.\n  The President's Commission conducted seven public hearings across the \ncountry at which they heard from numerous witnesses. On July 31, 2003, \nthe Commission released its final report, making 35 legislative and \nadministrative recommendations for the reform of the Postal Service.\n  As I read through the Commission's report, I was struck by what I \nconsidered the Commission's wake up call to Congress: its statement \nthat ``an incremental approach to Postal Service reform will yield too \nlittle, too late given the enterprise's bleak fiscal outlook, the depth \nof current debt and unfunded obligations, the downward trend in First-\nClass mail volumes and the limited potential of its legacy postal \nnetwork that was built for a bygone era.'' That is a very strong \nstatement, and one that challenged both the Postal Service and Congress \nto embrace far-reaching reforms.\n  To the relief of many, including myself, the Commission did not \nrecommend privatization of the Postal Service. Instead, the Commission \nsought to find a way for the Postal Service to do, as Co-Chair Jim \nJohnson described to me, ``an overwhelmingly better job under the same \ngeneral structure.''\n  The Postal Service plays a vital role in our economy. The Service \nitself employs more than 750,000 career employees. Less well known is \nthe fact that it is also the linchpin of a $900-billion mailing \nindustry that employs 9 million Americans in fields as diverse as \ndirect mailing, printing, catalog production, paper manufacturing, and \nfinancial services. The health of the Postal Service is essential to \nthe vitality of thousands of companies and the millions that they \nemploy.\n  One of the greatest challenges for the Postal Service is the decrease \nin mail volume as business communications, bills and payments move more \nand more to the Internet. The Postal Service has experienced declining \nvolumes of First-Class mail for three straight years. This is highly \nsignificant, given that First-Class mail accounts for 48 percent of \ntotal mail volume, and the revenue it generates pays for more than two-\nthirds of the Postal Service's institutional costs.\n  The Postal Service also faces the difficult task of trying to cut \ncosts from its nationwide infrastructure and transportation network. \nThese costs are difficult to cut. Even though volumes may be \ndecreasing, carriers must still deliver six days a week to more than \n139 million addresses.\n  As Chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs, I held a series of eight hearings, including a joint hearing \nwith the House, during which we reviewed the recommendations of the \nPresident's Commission. The bill Senator Carper and I introduce today \nreflects what the Committee learned from dozens of witnesses.\n  First and foremost, the Collins-Carper bill preserves the basic \nfeatures of universal service--affordable rates, frequent delivery, and \nconvenient community access to retail postal services. As a Senator \nrepresenting a large, rural State, I want to ensure that my \nconstituents living in the northern woods, or on the islands, or in our \nmany rural small towns have the same access to postal services as the \npeople of our cities. If the Postal Service were no longer to provide \nuniversal service and deliver mail to every customer, the affordable \ncommunication link upon which many Americans rely would be jeopardized. \nMost commercial enterprises would find it uneconomical, if not \nimpossible, to deliver mail and packages to rural Americans at rates \ncharged by the Postal Service.\n  The Collins-Carper bill allows the Postal Service to maintain its \ncurrent mail monopoly, and retain its sole access to customer \nmailboxes. It grants the Postal Service Board of Governors the \nauthority to set rates for competitive products like Express Mail and \nParcel Post, as long as these prices do not result in cross subsidy \nfrom market-dominant products. As a safeguard, our bill establishes a \n30 day prior review period during which the proposed rate changes shall \nbe reviewed by the Postal Regulatory Commission.\n  It replaces the current lengthy and litigious rate-setting process \nwith a rate cap-based structure for market-dominant products such as \nFirst-Class Mail, periodicals and library mail. This would allow the \nPostal Service to react more quickly to changes in the mailing \nindustry. The rate caps would be linked to the Consumer Price Index. \nThe goal would be to make rate increases more predictable and less \nfrequent and to provide incentives for the Postal Service to operate \nefficiently. Price changes for market-dominant products would be \nsubject to a 45 day prior review period by the Postal Regulatory \nCommission.\n  Our bill would introduce new safeguards against unfair competition by \nthe Postal Service in competitive markets. Subsidization of competitive \nproducts by market-dominant products would be expressly forbidden, and \nan equitable allocation of institutional costs to competitive products \nwould be required.\n  The President's Commission recommended that the regulator be granted \nthe authority to make changes to the Postal Service's universal service \nobligation and monopoly. The vast majority of the postal community, \nhowever, shared my belief that these are important policy \ndeterminations that should be retained by Congress. The Collins-Carper \nbill keeps those public policy decisions in congressional hands.\n  The existing Postal Rate Commission would be transformed into the \nPostal Regulatory Commission with greatly enhanced authority. Under \ncurrent law, the Rate Commission has very narrow authority. We wanted \nto ensure that the Postal Service management has both greater latitude \nand stronger oversight. Among other things, the Postal Regulatory \nCommission will have the authority to regulate rates for non-\ncompetitive products and services; ensure financial transparency; \nestablish limits on the accumulation of retained earnings by the Postal \nService; obtain information from the Postal Service, if need be, \nthrough the use of new subpoena power; and review and act on complaints \nfiled by those who believe the Postal Service has exceeded its \nauthority. Members of the Postal\n\n[[Page S3014]]\n\nRegulatory Board will be selected solely on the basis of their \ndemonstrated experience and professional standing. Senate confirmation \nof all Board Members will be required.\n  To meet the Presidential Commission's call for increased financial \ntransparency, the Collins-Carper bill will require the Postal Service \nto file with the Postal Regulatory Commission certain Securities and \nExchange Commission financial disclosure forms, along with detailed \nannual reports on the status of the Postal Service's pension and \npostretirement health obligations.\n  The Governmental Affairs Committee dedicated two hearings to the \nexamination of the Commission's workforce-related recommendations. The \nPostal Service is a highly labor intensive organization, using $3 out \nof every $4 to pay the wages and benefits of its employees. Their \nworkforce is comprised of more than 700,000 dedicated letter carriers, \nclerks, mail handlers, postmasters, and others, many of whom place \ngreat value on their right to collectively bargain. Our bill reaffirms \nthat right. This bill only makes changes to the bargaining process that \nhave been agreed to by both the Postal Service and the four major \nunions. We replace the rarely used fact-finding process with mediation, \nand shorten statutory deadlines for certain phases of the bargaining \nprocess.\n  Additionally, the Collins-Carper bill corrects what I believe to be \nan anomaly in the federal workers' compensation law that results in \nhigh costs for the Postal Service. Under the Federal Employees \nCompensation Act (FECA), federal employees with dependents are eligible \nfor 75 percent of their take-home pay, tax free, plus cost of living \nallowances. In addition, there is no maximum dollar cap on FECA \npayments. As a result, employees often opt not to retire, staying on \nthe more generous workers' compensation program permanently.\n  According to a March 2003 audit issued by the Postal Service's Office \nof Inspector General, the Postal Service's workers' compensation rolls \ninclude 81 cases that originated 40 to 50 years ago, with the oldest \nrecipient being 102 years old. The IG's office found 778 cases that \noriginated 30 to 40 years ago; and 1,189 cases that originated 20 to 29 \nyears ago.\n  The Collins-Carper bill works to protect the financial resources of \nthe Postal Service by converting workers' compensation benefits for \ntotal or partial disability to a retirement annuity when the affected \nemployee reaches 65 years of age. This change would reflect the fact \nthat disabled postal employees would likely retire at some point were \nthey not receiving workers' compensation. I would like to note that the \naverage postal employee retires far earlier than age 65, so this is \nstill a generous program. It is important to point out that the Postal \nService has reduced their workplace injury rate by twenty-eight percent \nover the past three years.\n  The Collins--Carper bill also puts into place a three-day waiting \nperiod before an employee is eligible to receive 45 days of \ncontinuation of pay. This is consistent with every state's workers' \ncompensation program that requires a three- to seven-day waiting period \nbefore benefits are paid.\n  To address the President's Commission's recommendation for improved \nexecutive compensation, this bill will allow the Postal Service to \nraise their overall executive compensation level from Executive Level 1 \nto that of the Vice President. This would bring the Postal Service in \nline with authority granted to federal agencies. This new authority \nwill be contingent upon the development of a meaningful performance \nappraisal system.\n  Our bill has reached an important compromise on the issue of \nworkshare discounts. The workshare program was developed by the Postal \nService and the Postal Rate Commission to enable customers to pay lower \nrates when they perform mail preparation or transportation activities. \nThe language in our bill supports the principle that workshare \ndiscounts should generally not exceed the costs that the Postal Service \navoids as a result of the worksharing activity. However, the bill \nspells out certain circumstances under which workshare discounts in \nexcess of avoided costs are warranted.\n  Finally, our bill would repeal a provision of Public Law 108-18 which \nrequires that money owed to the Postal Service due to an overpayment \ninto the Civil Service Retirement System Fund be held in an escrow \naccount. Repealing this provision would essentially ``free up'' $78 \nbillion over a period of 60 years. These savings would be used to not \nonly pay off debt to the U.S. Treasury and to fund health care \nliabilities, but also to mitigate rate increases as well. In fact, \nfailure to release these escrow funds could mean, for mailers, a \ndouble-digit rate increase in 2006--an expense most American businesses \nand many consumers are ill-equipped to afford.\n  The bill would also return to the Department of Treasury the \nresponsibility for funding CSRS pension benefits relating to the \nmilitary service of postal retirees. No other agency is required to \nmake this payment. Ratepayers should not be held responsible for this \n$27 billion obligation.\n  The Postal Service has reached a critical juncture. If we are to save \nand strengthen this vital service upon which so many Americans rely for \ncommunication and their livelihoods, the time to act is now.\n  I look forward to working with all of my colleagues in the Senate, \nand House Government Reform and Oversight Committee Chairman Tom Davis, \nwho, together with Congressman John McHugh, also recently introduced a \npostal reform bill, H.R. 22.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 662\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

and\n       (v) such additional topics and recommendations as the \n     Postal Service considers appropriate.\n       (d) Alternate Retail Options.--The Postal Service plan \n     shall include plans to expand and market retail access to \n     postal services, in addition to post offices, including--\n       (1) vending machines;\n       (2) the Internet;\n       (3) Postal Service employees on delivery routes;\n       (4) retail facilities in which overhead costs are shared \n     with private businesses and other government agencies;

SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING POSTAL SERVICE \n                   PURCHASING REFORM.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the Postal Service \n     should--\n       (1) ensure the fair and consistent treatment of suppliers \n     and contractors in its current purchasing policies and any \n     revision or replacement of such policies, such as through the \n     use of competitive contract award procedures, effective \n     dispute resolution mechanisms, and socioeconomic programs; \n     and\n       (2) implement commercial best practices in Postal Service \n     purchasing policies to achieve greater efficiency and cost \n     savings as recommended in July 2003 by the President's \n     Commission on the United States Postal Service, in a manner \n     that is compatible with the fair and consistent treatment of \n     suppliers and contractors, as befitting an establishment in \n     the United States Government.\n\n           postal accountability and enhancement act of 2005\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise today to join my friend from Maine, \nSenator Collins, in introducing the Postal Accountability and \nEnhancement Act of 2005, legislation that makes the reforms necessary \nfor the Postal Service to thrive in the 21st Century and to better \nserve the American people. This bill is almost identical to S. 2468, \nthe version of the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act that was \nunanimously reported out of the Governmental Affairs Committee last \nJune on a 17-0 vote.\n\n[[Page S3029]]\n\n  When I rose with Senator Collins to introduce S. 2468 last year, I \nnoted that some of our colleagues may wonder why we need postal reform. \nMost of us probably receive few complaints from our constituents about \nthe Postal Service. Most Americans like the Postal Service just the way \nit is and don't want to see it changed. We must keep in mind, however, \nthat, despite the fact that the mailing industry, and the economy as a \nwhole, have changed radically over the years, the Postal Service has, \nfor the most part, remained unchanged for more than three decades now.\n  Senator Collins and I are re-introducing this bill today, then, \nbecause the Postal Service continues to operate under a business model \ncreated a generation ago.\n  In the early 1970s, Senator Stevens led the effort in the Senate to \ncreate the Postal Service out of the failing Post Office Department. At \nthe time, the Post Office Department received about 20 percent of its \nrevenue from taxpayer subsidies. Labor-management relations were at \ntheir worst, service was suffering and there was little hope the \ndepartment would be able to muster the resources necessary to service a \ngrowing delivery network.\n  By all accounts, the product of Senator Stevens' labors, the Postal \nReorganization Act signed into law by President Nixon in 1971, has been \na phenomenal success. The Postal Service today receives virtually no \ntaxpayer support. The service its hundreds of thousands of employees \nprovide to every American, nearly every day is second to none. The \nPostal Service now delivers to 141 million addresses each day and is \nthe anchor of a $900 billion mailing industry.\n  As we celebrate the success of the Postal Reorganization Act, \nhowever, we need to be thinking about what needs to be done to help the \nPostal Service continue to thrive in the years to come.\n  The Postal Service is clearly in need of modernization once again. \nBack in the early 1970s, none of the Postal Service's customers had \naccess to fax machines, cell phones or pagers. Nobody imagined that we \nwould ever enjoy conveniences like e-mail and electronic bill pay that \ncould replace a First Class letter. That, of course, is no longer the \ncase. Most of the mall I receive from my constituents these days \narrives via fax and e-mail instead of hard copy mail, a marked change \nfrom my days in the House and even from my more recent days as Governor \nof Delaware.\n  This continuing electronic diversion of mail, coupled with a slow \neconomy and the threat of terrorism, has made for some rough going at \nthe Postal Service of late. In 2001, as Postmaster General Potter came \nonboard, the Postal Service was projecting its third consecutive year \nof deficits. They lost $199 million in 2000 and $1.68 billion in 2001. \nThey were projecting losses of up to $4 billion in fiscal year 2002. \nMail volume was falling, revenues were below projections and the Postal \nService was estimating that it needed to spend $4 billion on security \nenhancements in order to prevent a repeat of the tragic anthrax attacks \nthat took several lives. The Postal Service was also perilously close \nto its $15 billion debt ceiling and had been forced to raise rates \nthree times in less than two years in order to pay for its operations.\n  A number of positive steps have been taken since 2001. General Potter \nhas led a commendable effort to improve productivity and make the \nPostal Service more efficient. Billions of dollars in costs have been \ntaken out of the system--some $4.3 billion since 2002--according to the \nPostal Service's most recent annual report. Thousands of positions have \nbeen eliminated through attrition and successful automation programs \nhave yielded great benefits, resulting in the smallest workforce seen \nat the Postal Service since the early 1980s.\n  Perhaps most dramatically, the Postal Service learned in 2002 that an \nunfunded pension liability they once believed was as high as $32 \nbillion was actually significantly lower. Senator Collins and I \nresponded with legislation, the Postal Civil Service Retirement System \nFunding Reform Act, which cut the amount the Postal Service must pay \ninto the Civil Service Retirement System each year by nearly $3 \nbillion. This has freed up money for debt reduction and prevented the \nneed for further rate increases until at least next year. The Postal \nService's debt to the Treasury now stands at about $1.8 billion--the \nlowest it's been in more than 20 years--and rates have remained stable \nsince the passage of the pension bill.\n  Aggressive cost cutting and a lower pension payment, then, have put \noff the postal emergency we thought was right around the corner just a \nfew years ago. But cost cutting can only go so far and will not solve \nthe Postal Service's long-term challenges. These long-term challenges \nwere laid out in stark detail last year when Postmaster General Potter \nand then-Postal Board of Governors Chairman David Fineman testified \nbefore the House Government Reform Committee's Special Panel on Postal \nReform. Mr. Fineman pointed out in his testimony that the total volume \nof mail delivered by the Postal Service has declined by more than 5 \nbillion pieces since 2000. Over the same period, the number of homes \nand businesses the Postal Service delivers to have increased by more \nthan 5 million. First Class mail, the largest contributor to the Postal \nService's bottom line, is leading the decline in volume. Some of those \ndisappearing First Class letters are being replaced by advertising \nmail, which earns significantly less. Many First Class letters have \nlikely been lost for good to fax machines, e-mail and electronic bill \npay.\n  Despite electronic diversion, the Postal Service continues to add \nbetween 1.6 million and 1.9 million new delivery points each year, \ncreating the need for thousands of new routes and thousands of new \nletter carriers to work them. In addition, faster-growing parts of the \ncountry will need new or expanded postal facilities in the coming \nyears. As more and more customers turn to electronic forms of \ncommunication, however, letter carriers are bringing fewer pieces of \nmail to each address they serve. The rate increases that will be needed \nto maintain the Postal Service's current infrastructure, finance \nretirement obligations to its current employees, pay for new letter \ncarriers and build facilities in growing parts of the country will only \nerode mail volume further.\n  The Postal Service has been trying to modernize on its own. General \nPotter and his management team are making progress, but there is only \nso much they can do without legislative change. Even if the Postal \nService begins to see volume and revenues pick up, we will still need \nto make fundamental changes in the way the Postal Service operates in \norder to make them as successful in the 21st Century as they were in \nthe 20th Century.\n  This is where the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act comes in. \nFirst, our bill begins the process of developing a modern rate system \nfor pricing Postal Service products. The new system, to be developed by \na strengthened Postal Rate Commission, re-named the Postal Regulatory \nCommission, would allow retained earnings, provide the Postal Service \nsignificantly more flexibility in setting prices and streamline today's \nburdensome rate making process. To provide stability, predictability \nand fairness for the Postal Service's customers, rates would remain \nwithin a cap to be set each year by the Regulatory Commission.\n  The second major provision in the Postal Accountability and \nEnhancement Act requires the Postal Service to set strong service \nstandards for its Market Dominant products, a category made up mostly \nof those products, like First Class mail, that are part of the postal \nmonopoly. The new standards will improve service and will be used by \nthe Postal Service to establish performance goals, rationalize its \nphysical infrastructure and streamline its workforce.\n  Third, the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act ensures that the \nPostal Service competes fairly. The bill prohibits the Postal Service \nfrom issuing anti-competitive regulations. It also subjects the Postal \nService to state zoning, planning and land use laws, requires them to \npay an assumed Federal income tax on products like packages and Express \nMail that private firms also offer and requires that these products as \na whole pay their share of the Postal Service's institutional costs. \nThe Federal Trade Commission will further study any additional legal \nbenefits the Postal Service enjoys that\n\n[[Page S3030]]\n\nits private sector competitors do not. The Regulatory Commission will \nthen find a way to use the rate system to level the playing field.\n  Fourth, the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act improves Postal \nService accountability, mostly by strengthening oversight. \nQualifications for membership on the Regulatory Commission would be \nstronger than those for the Rate Commission so that Commissioners would \nhave a background in finance or economics. Commissioners would also \nhave the power to demand information from the Postal Service, including \nby subpoena, and have the power to punish the Postal Service for \nviolating rate and service regulations. In addition, the Regulatory \nCommission will make an annual determination as to whether the Postal \nService is in compliance with existing rate regulations and service \nstandards and will have the power to punish them for any \ntransgressions.\n  Fifth, the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act revises two \nprovisions from the ``Postal Civil Service Retirement System Funding \nReform Act in an effort to shore up the Postal Service's finances in \nthe years to come. As our colleagues may be aware, that bill required \nthe Postal Service, beginning in 2006, to deposit any savings it enjoys \nby virtue of lower pension payments into an escrow account. In this \nbill, we eliminate that requirement in order to allow the Postal \nService to spend the money that would have gone into escrow to begin \npre-funding on a current basis its $50 billion retiree health \nobligation. Leftover savings would be used to continue paying down debt \nto the Treasury and to maintain rate stability.\n  The bill Senator Collins and I are introducing today also reverses \nthe provision in the Postal Civil Service Retirement System Funding \nReform Act that made the Postal Service the only Federal agency \nshouldered with the burden of paying the additional pension benefits \nowed to their employees by virtue of past military service.\n  Finally, and most importantly, the Postal Accountability and \nEnhancement Act preserves universal service and the postal monopoly and \nforces the Postal Service to concentrate solely on what it does best--\nprocessing and delivering the mail to all Americans. Our bill limits \nthe Postal 'Service, for the first time, to providing ``postal \nservices,'' meaning they would be prohibited from engaging in other \nlines of business, such as e-commerce, that draw time and resources \naway from letter and package delivery. It also explicitly preserves the \nrequirement that the Postal Service ``bind the Nation together through \nthe mail'' and serve all parts of the country, urban, suburban and \nrural, in a non-discriminatory fashion. Any service standards \nestablished by the Postal Service will continue to ensure delivery to \nevery address, every day. In addition, the bill maintains the \nprohibition on closing post offices solely because they operate at a \ndeficit, ensuring that rural and urban customers continue to enjoy full \naccess to retail postal services.\n  As I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, this bill that Senator \nCollins and I are introducing today is almost identical to the version \nof the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act that was unanimously \nreported out of the Governmental Affairs Committee last June on a 17-0 \nvote. A similar bill was unanimously reported out of the House \nGovernment Reform Committee last year as well. Neither bill was \nconsidered on the floor of the Senate or the House, however, due--I'm \ntold--to objections raised by the administration.\n  I was deeply disappointed that we were unable to complete action on \npostal reform last year. However, Senator Collins and I, our staffs and \nour colleagues in the House have had a series of discussions with \nadministration officials since the 108th Congress adjourned last year \nand have narrowed our differences with them on these issues \nsignificantly. I'm pleased to report that this bill contains a handful \nof new provisions drafted to address specific concerns raised by the \nAdministration.\n\n  First, we demand even greater financial transparency from the Postal \nService. The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act gives the Postal \nService more room to operate like a private business. For quite some \ntime, however, it's been clear that the financial reporting required of \nthe Postal Service has been lacking. It's difficult to look at the \nPostal Service's financial reports and learn as much as we'd like to \nlearn about its current condition and its future liabilities. For this \nreason, our bill requires the Postal Service to begin filing the very \nsame quarterly and annual Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure \nforms that private sector firms must file.\n  Second, we add language drafted at the request of the Treasury \nDepartment that would ensure that the Postal Service does its banking \nand investing with the Federal Financing Bank. Our original bill would \nhave given the Postal Service almost total freedom to invest any \nrevenue earned by its competitive products in the market as if they \nwere a private business. Treasury feared this could have a negative \nimpact on the markets and the issuance of federal debt.\n  Third, we give the Postal Board of Governors the ability to better \nreward top Postal Service executives for their performance and recruit \ntop talent. We accomplish this by raising the cap on executive pay at \nthe Postal Service to the level of compensation given to the Vice \nPresident. This will allow the Board to reward high-performing \nmanagers. It should also make it easier to recruit and retain qualified \nmanagers.\n  Fourth, we ensure that the rate cap to be developed by the Postal \nRegulatory Commission is truly workable by requiring that the cap be \nbased on the Consumer Price Index. A CPI-based cap should guarantee \nthat the Postal Service has the room to operate each year without \nbreaking the cap or turning to the Treasury for assistance while still \ngiving mailers the predictability they need.\n  This is significant progress but we still have our work cut out for \nus. I look forward to working in the coming weeks with Chairman \nCollins, my colleagues on the Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee, our House counterparts and the administration to \nwork out any remaining differences we have. It's vitally important that \nwe succeed.\n  The Postal Board of Governors voted last month to go forward with a \nrate increase. If approved by the Postal Rate Commission, this increase \nwill go into effect sometime next year. Thanks to increased \nproductivity, this is expected to be a lower increase than many \nobservers feared. Without postal reform, however, especially the \nlanguage freeing the Postal Service from the escrow requirement and the \nmilitary pension obligation, future rate increases will be higher. \nProbably much higher. This will only speed the flight from hard copy \nmail to electronic forms of communication. The impact of this flight \nwill be significant, not just at the Postal Service but throughout the \nentire economy.\n  A recent study conducted by the Envelope Manufacturers Association \nFoundation's Institute for Postal Studies found that, if mail volume \nwere to decline by 10 percent more than 780,000 mail-related jobs will \nbe at risk across the country. More than 2,000 of those jobs are in \nDelaware. If mail volume were to decline by 20 percent more than \n1,500,000 mailing industry jobs will be at risk across the country. \nMore than 4,000 of those jobs are in Delaware. We need to act soon to \nprevent this from happening.\n  In closing, I'd like to point out how amazing it is to me to think \nthat the Postal Service, something Senator Stevens was literally able \nto put together at his kitchen table at the very beginning of his \ncareer, could have lasted so long and had such an enduring impact on \nevery American. I'm hopeful that the model Senator Collins and I have \nset out in this bill today can last at least that long and have just as \npositive an impact on our nation and our economy as the Postal Service \nhas had over the past 35 years.\n\n\n              collins and gregg colloquy on postal reform\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today I introduce the Postal \nAccountability and Enhancement Act of 2005, a bill designed to help the \n225-year-old Postal Service meet the challenges of the 21st century. I \noriginally introduced this bill last May. In June of 2004, the bill was \nunanimously reported out of the Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee. That bill, S. 2468,\n\n[[Page S3031]]\n\nhad the strong endorsements of the National Rural Letter Carriers \nAssociation, the National Association of Letter Carriers, the National \nAssociation of Postmasters of the United States, and the Coalition for \na 21st Century Postal Service--which represents thousands of the major \nmailers, employee groups, small business, and other users of the mail. \nIt also had the strong bi-partisan support of twenty-two members of the \nUnited States Senate. Unfortunately, the 108th Congress expired before \nmy bill passed the Senate.\n  It has long been acknowledged that the financial and operational \nproblems confronting the Postal Service are serious. At present, the \nPostal Service has roughly $70 billion to $80 billion in unfunded \nliabilities and obligations, which include $1.8 billion in debt to the \nU.S. Treasury, $7.6 billion for workers' compensation claims, $3.5 \nbillion for retirement costs, and as much as $47 billion to cover \nretiree health care costs. The Government Accountability Office's \nComptroller General, David Walker, has pointed to the urgent need for \n``fundamental reforms to minimize the risk of a significant taxpayer \nbailout or dramatic postal rate increases.'' The Postal Service has \nbeen on GAO's ``High-Risk'' List since April of 2001. The Postal \nService is at risk of a ``death spiral'' of decreasing volume and \nincreasing rates that lead to further decreases in volume.\n  The Postal Service is the linchpin of a $900-billion mailing industry \nthat employs 9 million Americans in fields as diverse as direct \nmailing, printing, catalog production, and paper manufacturing. The \nhealth of the Postal Service is essential to the vitality of thousands \nof companies and the millions that they employ.\n  First and foremost, my bill preserves the basic features of universal \nservice--affordable rates, frequent delivery, and convenient community \naccess to retail postal services. If the Postal Service were no longer \nto provide universal service and deliver mail to every customer, the \naffordable communication link upon which many Americans rely would be \njeopardized.\n  This postal reform legislation grants the Postal Service Board of \nGovernors the authority to set rates for competitive products like \nExpress Mail and Parcel Post, as long as these prices do not result in \ncross subsidy from market-dominant products. It replaces the current \nlengthy and litigious rate-setting process with a rate cap-based \nstructure for market-dominant products such as first-class mail, \nperiodicals, and library mail. The bill also introduces new safeguards \nagainst unfair competition by the Postal Service in competitive \nmarkets.\n  The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act will greatly improve \nthe financial transparency of the Postal Service. The USPS would be \nrequired to file with the Postal Regulatory Commission certain \nSecurities and Exchange Commission financial disclosure forms, along \nwith detailed annual reports on the status of the Postal Service's \npension and postretirement health obligations in order to ensure \nincreased financial transparency.\n  The legislation repeals a provision of Public Law 108-18 which \nrequires that money owed to the Postal Service due to an overpayment \ninto the Civil Service Retirement System Fund be held in an escrow \naccount, which would essentially ``free up'' $78 billion over a period \nof 60 years. These savings would be used to not only pay off debt to \nthe U.S. Treasury and to fund health care liabilities, but also to \nmitigate rate increases. It also returns to the Department of the \nTreasury the responsibility for funding CSRS pension benefits relating \nto the military service of postal retirees--a responsibility that the \nTreasury Department bears for all executive branch departments and \nagencies.\n  The bill also converts workers' compensation benefits for total or \npartial disability to a retirement annuity when the affected employee \nreaches 65 years of age, and puts into place a 3-day waiting period \nbefore an employee is eligible to receive 45 days of continuation of \npay. These changes will save the Postal Service approximately $50 \nmillion in workers' compensation costs over a 10-year period.\n  The Postal Service has reached a critical juncture. If we are to save \nand strengthen this vital service upon which so many Americans rely for \ncommunication and their livelihoods, the time to act is now.\n  I therefore ask the Senior Senator from New Hampshire and chairman of \nthe Senate Budget Committee whether I can count on his assistance and \nsupport to help pass this legislation this Congress.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the chairman of the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee for her question. I do recognize the \neconomic importance of a healthy postal service, and as a Senator from \nthe rural State of New Hampshire, I appreciate the role of a healthy \nPostal Service in meeting the universal service needs of rural \nresidents. I look forward to reading the bill, reading the CBO cost \nestimate of the bill, and working with the Senator from Maine to ensure \nthat a true, fiscally responsible postal reform bill is enacted.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank my friend from New Hampshire and look forward to \nworking with him on this important piece of legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Isakson, and Mr. \n        Burns):\n  S. 663. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nself-employed individuals to deduct health insurance costs in computing \nself-employment taxes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today my colleague, Senator Thomas, and \nI along with Senator Isakson are re-introducing the ``Equity for Our \nNation's Self-Employed Act of 2005.'' This important legislation \ncorrects an inequity that currently exists in our tax code that forces \nself-employed workers to pay payroll taxes on the funds used to pay for \ntheir health insurance while larger businesses do not. Because of this \ninequity, health insurance is more expensive for the self-employed. At \na time when the uninsured are growing at an alarming rate, we need to \nfind ways to reduce the cost of health insurance. This legislation is a \nfirst logical step.\n  Under current law, the self-employed are allowed an income tax \ndeduction for the amount they pay for health insurance, but must still \ncalculate their payroll taxes as if they were not allowed this income \ntax deduction. The result is that the self-employed are paying payroll \ntaxes on the amount they pay for health insurance. As previously \nstated, larger businesses do not include pay payroll taxes on the \namount they pay for health insurance. The legislation we are \nintroducing today would stop this inequitable tax treatment and allow \nthe self-employed to deduct the amount they pay for health insurance \nfrom their calculation of payroll taxes.\n  This problem affects all self-employed who provide health insurance \nto their families. According to the Census Bureau, there are almost \n74,000 self-employed workers in New Mexico. While we have no idea how \nmany of these people in New Mexico have health insurance, we do know \nthat roughly 3.6 million working families in the United States paid \nself-employment tax on their health insurance premiums. Estimates \nindicate that roughly 60 percent of our Nation's uninsured are either \nself-employed or work for a small business. According to the Kaiser \nFamily Foundation, self-employed workers spend more than $9,000 per \nyear to provide health insurance for their family. Because they cannot \ndeduct this as an ordinary business expense, those that spend this \namount will pay a 15.3 percent tax on their premiums resulting in \nalmost $1,400 of taxes annually.\n  This problem was identified by the National Taxpayer Advocate in \nseveral of her annual reports to Congress and our legislation to \ncorrect it is supported by a variety of groups including the National \nAssociation for the Self-Employed, the National Small Business \nAssociation, the National Federation of Independent Businesses, the \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce, the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, and \nthe Small Business Legislative Council.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to get this important \nlegislation passed.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S3032]]\n\n                                 S. 663\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bil. to reauthorize and improve the Spark M. Matsunaga \nHydrogen Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1990 to \nestablish a program to commercialize hydrogen and fuel cell technology, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a piece of \nlegislation, along with Mr. Graham, that I believe is needed to solve \nour long-term energy need. It is imperative that our Nation implements \na roadmap to achieving our goal of creating a hydrogen fuel-cell \neconomy. I believe this measure is the best way to diversify our energy \nportfolio and protect our national security interests.\n  This legislation would invest $7.9 billion over 10 years in hydrogen \nfuel cell research and deployment. Additionally, the measure would \nchange the current direction of the hydrogen program, allowing each \nprogram related to developing hydrogen to build off of each other. \nSimilar to what has been recommended by the National Academies, it \nrealizes a more conscious systems approach to program design.\n  You see, currently the hydrogen program is like a series of small \nblock grants. We send money to the Department of Energy, DOE, and \nsimply tell them to come up with a program. Under this scenario, with \nlittle accountability or direction, the program has not moved as \nswiftly as we would like.\n  Changing the structure of the hydrogen program will ensure that the \nlong-term goal is reached and the benefits are reaped. What this \nlegislation does is compartmentalize each program at DoE related to \nhydrogen development. Instead of sending a chunk of money, the funds \nwill now be targeted to programs that will be the foundation for \nbuilding and commercializing a hydrogen fuel-cell economy.\n  Additionally, this measure uses the successful ``learning \ndemonstration'' technique of building institutional relationships among \nkey industries and with the Government that has strong support from \nboth the fuels industry and the auto sector, and applies this as a \nprogram design to all large scale systems demonstrations. These \ndemonstrations are then linked to refining the R tasks again after \nthe demonstrations complete their early phases, so that concrete \nlearning is integrated directly into a final round of more focused R\n  This bill enables a more strategic approach to program planning in \nthe formation of a hydrogen economy. It also includes more interaction \nbetween R and demonstrations--with emphasis on development--that is \nthe key to accelerating commercialization and movement to market.\n  This measure does not reinvent the wheel. Instead, it takes what we \nhave learned thus far and focuses our efforts for the future. Providing \ndevelopmental targets and accountability will also allow us to adjust \nour priorities appropriately.\n  Introduction of this measure could not come at a more critical time. \nToday, oil prices are at an all time high of $57.00 a barrel. This \nincrease has directly hit consumers where it hurts most--in their \nwallets. Today in the State of North Dakota, consumers will spend \n$330,000 more for gasoline than they did this time last year. This is \nnothing more than an additional tax on hard working families who have \nto drive around during the course of their daily lives. It is no longer \na question of whether you can afford to sign your children up for extra \ncurricular activities like baseball or ballet; it is now a question of \nwhether you can afford to even take them to these activities.\n  It shouldn't be this way, especially in America. However, we continue \nto be beholden to the same generational argument: Where can we dig and \ndrill next? We need to jump over this debate and I believe this measure \ndoes that.\n  Let me describe why I think we ought to do this and why focusing our \nattention and resources is important. I will harken back to the Apollo \nprogram. On May 25, 1961, President John F. Kennedy announced our \nNation was establishing a goal of sending a man to the Moon and having \na safe return by the end of the decade.\n  The Apollo project was an enormous undertaking. The NASA annual \nbudget increased from $500 million in 1960 to $5.2 billion in 1965. It \nrepresented 5.3 percent of the Federal budget in 1965. Think about \nthat. In today's terms, that would be over $115 billion. NASA engaged \nprivate industry, university research, and academia in a massive way \nand contractor employees increased by a factor of 10, to 376,000 \npeople, in 1965.\n  When President Kennedy said in 1961 it was his vision to have a man \nwalk on the Moon by the end of the decade, there was no technological \ncapability to do so at that moment and no guarantee it could even be \ndone. During the height of the cold war, the Soviets had an advantage \nin space flight and that advantage was of great concern to us. They had \nput up a satellite called Sputnik and the technological barriers facing \nthe U.S. in catching up were very significant. The expense and resolve \nwere daunting, but yet, on July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong and Buzz \nAldrin stood on the surface of the Moon and pantomimed a golf game. In \na single decade, the President and the country set and reached an \nunthinkable goal.\n  Now let's talk about another goal, another big idea, one that we \nought to establish now for this country and for its future. That is the \ngoal of deciding, as President Bush has suggested, that we move toward \na hydrogen economy and fuel-cells for our vehicles. I will describe why \nI think this is important.\n  America's energy security is threatened by our dependence on foreign \noil. Oil prices are at record highs and America now imports 62 percent \nof the oil it consumes. Our import level is expected to grow to 68 \npercent by 2025. Nearly all of our cars and trucks run on gasoline, and \nthey are the main reason America imports so much oil. Two-thirds of the \noil Americans use each day is used for transportation; fuel-cell \nvehicles offer the best hope of dramatically reducing our long-term \ndependence on foreign oil and protecting our national security \ninterests.\n  The American economy is and will be held hostage by our ability to \nfind and import oil from outside of our country's borders. Should this \ncause all of us great concern? Yes. This is a very serious problem. If \nwe wake up tomorrow morning, God forbid, and terrorists have \ninterrupted the supply of oil to this country--and, yes, that could \nhappen--this country's economy will be flat on its back. It will be \nflat on its back because we rely on oil from sources outside this \ncountry, much of it from very troubled parts of the world. And our \ndependence is only expected to increase.\n  Whenever we discuss oil, the debate centers around two issues--\ndrilling in ANWR and CAFE standards. If it is only those two issues, we \nlose. We need to move beyond these issues. Yes, we can address them, \nbut it seems to me if these are our only options, every few years we \nwill debate exactly the same issues: Where do we drill next? and, How \nmuch more efficient can we make a carburetor, through which we run \ngasoline?\n  If our energy strategy for this country's future is simply digging \nand drilling, then it is a strategy I call `yesterday forever,' which \nmeans it doesn't really change very much. Every few years we can debate \nthe issue of how dependent we are on oil imports and how dangerous it \nis for us. I think we should have a different debate, one that breaks \nour normal cycle.\n  That does not mean we should not dig and drill. We will, we can, and \nwe should. We will always use fossil fuels. But these resources must be \nused in a sustainable and efficient manner. We will continue to dig and \ndrill, but that cannot be all we do. If it is, we really\n\n[[Page S3033]]\n\nhave not moved the ball forward at all. So what else can we do? I \nbelieve we should chart a different course.\n  First of all, using fuel-cells and hydrogen is twice as efficient in \ngetting power to a wheel as using the internal combustion engine. \nSecond, when we use hydrogen fuel-cells in automobiles or vehicles, we \nare sending water vapor out the tailpipe. What a wonderful thing for \nour environment and our economy. We double the efficiency of the energy \nsource, while at the same time eliminating the pollution out of the \ntailpipe. That makes great sense to me.\n  In the past I have introduced legislation saying let's move to a \ndifferent kind of technology, a different kind of energy economy; let's \nmove to a hydrogen economy using fuel-cells. This bill is different \nfrom my previous bills because it would not only authorize higher \nfunding levels, but just as importantly, it would change the way the \nprogram works.\n  My point is simple. We need accountability and targets and timetables \nin all the programs developing hydrogen. While this measure \nspecifically states that we should set a target of 100,000 vehicles on \nthe road by 2010 and 2.5 million by 2020, it also includes \ndevelopmental milestones within each program, essentially giving us a \nroadmap of where we need to go and how to get there. If we do not set \nthis out, we will not get there. If we do not have the same resolve \ntowards establishing a hydrogen fuel-cell economy as President Kennedy \nhad in putting a man on the Moon then we are not going to get there. \nNot without the focus and commitment needed.\n  Are there issues that need to be resolved? Sure there are, but we \nwill never resolve them unless we implement a plan to do so. That is \nwhy I feel this legislation is the best approach. We focus on what is \nneeded, while building on what we have. Instead of having two or more \nprojects moving in different directions, with no connection, we set out \na more focused approach where we can see exactly the progress we are \nmaking.\n  This commitment is what is needed and this direction is supported \nthroughout the hydrogen industry. We cannot let this opportunity pass \nus by. If we sit and do nothing when the price of oil is at its \nhighest, then I fear we will never do anything. This type of commitment \nand resolve is needed for our economic future, as well as to ensure our \nnational security interests.\n  If we start now, I have no doubt that hydrogen fueled vehicles will \nbe to our grandchildren what gasoline was to our grandparents.\n  Mr. DORGAN.

TAX INCENTIVES TO BUILD THE HYDROGEN ECONOMY.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that Congress should provide \n     any necessary tax incentives to encourage investment in and \n     production and use of hydrogen and fuel cell systems during \n     critical stages of market growth, including--\n       (1) a hydrogen fuel cell motor vehicle credit;\n       (2) a credit for the installation of hydrogen fuel cell \n     motor vehicle fueling stations;\n       (3) a credit for residential fuel cell property; and\n       (4) a credit for business installation of qualified fuel \n     cells.\n\n\n           the hydrogen and fuel cell technology act of 2005\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Hydrogen and \nFuel Cell Technology Act of 2005, a bill to amend the Spark M. \nMatsunaga Hydrogen Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of \n1990. A reauthorization of the Matsunaga Act is badly needed. I have \nintroduced bills in the 106th Congress, in the 107th Congress jointly \nwith my friend Senator Harkin, and in the 108th Congress to reauthorize \nthe essential hydrogen research and development programs in the \nDepartment of Energy. The core provisions of these bills were included \nin each of the omnibus energy bills, whether we were in the majority or \nin the minority, suggesting widespread, bipartisan agreement that we \nneed a robust hydrogen program for the future.\n  As a founding member of the Senate's Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Caucus, I \nhave worked with my colleagues to draft this bill and am pleased to be \nan original cosponsor. The caucus has heard from a wide variety of \ninterest groups, engineers, and scientists providing input on the \npotential for a ``hydrogen economy.'' The caucus, under the able \ncoleadership of my colleagues Senator Dorgan and Senator Graham, has \nactively solicited input from fuel cell producers anti councils, \nautomobile manufacturers, oil and gas companies, utilities, university \nresearch institutes, the Department of Energy, and national \nassociations. The recommendations of the National Commission on Energy \nPolicy and the National Academy of Sciences were instrumental in \ndeveloping this bill.\n  I am more convinced than ever that we need to move now to reauthorize \nthe Matsunaga Act and to refine and enhance the Department of Energy's \nresponsibilities while maintaining strong oversight over the progress \nof the activities. We cannot delay the move to a ``hydrogen economy.''\n  This bill does several things that are important for the management \nof hydrogen programs in the Department of Energy and will help move the \nnation toward using hydrogen as an energy source in our daily lives. It \nprovides greater focus for the hydrogen fuel cell technology research \nand development programs without losing the focus on renewable sources \nof hydrogen. It emphasizes factors that are critical to the development \nof hydrogen infrastructure and the supply of vehicles and electric \npower. It directs the Secretary to carry out activities to improve \ntechnology with the goal of cost reduction, particularly for hydrogen \nproduction, the supply of hydrogen, storage of hydrogen, and the end \nuses of hydrogen. The bill authorizes $200 million for hydrogen supply \nand $160 million for fuel cell technologies in fiscal year 2006. It \nemphasizes the importance of enhancing sources of renewable fuels and \nbiofuels for hydrogen production, a factor that is critical to remote \nareas and island states such as Hawaii where we need local sources of \nenergy.\n  This bill is a realistic one, providing specific footpaths to the \nhydrogen economy domestically and internationally. The bill \nacknowledges that transportation and the availability of reasonably \npriced cars may be the first market break through for the hydrogen \neconomy.\n  Title II authorizes demonstration programs through the Department of \nEnergy for fuel cell systems for mobile, portable, and stationary uses. \nDemonstrations are a critical component of moving a product to market. \nTitle III of the bill, ``Transition to Market,'' succinctly states the \ngoal of this section. Section 301 authorizes Federal procurement of \nfuel cell vehicles and hydrogen energy systems. This provision is \nintended to stimulate the market by requiring the Federal Government, \nthe largest single user of energy in the United States, to adopt \nhydrogen technologies as soon as practicable. Energy savings are an \nimportant part of this title. The Department is required to collect \ndata on energy savings as a result of this program and\n\n[[Page S3037]]\n\nto evaluate whether the program is achieving energy savings.\n  Lastly, this bill provides important directions to the Secretary to \naddress the development of safety codes and standards relating to fuel \ncell vehicles, hydrogen energy systems, and stationary, portable, and \nmicro fuel cells. This provision recognizes the importance of public \nacceptance of hydrogen as a safe and secure energy source; and it \nrecognizes the industry's needs for standards of safety codes and \nstandards for hydrogen energy systems whether stationary, mobile, or \nportable. The bill does not require the standards to be developed ``in-\nhouse'' within the Department of Energy, but importantly authorizes the \nSecretary of Energy to enter into cooperative agreements, grants, and \ncontracts with industry groups and with the cooperation of the Federal \ninteragency Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technical Task Force.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues in the Senate to support this \nbill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Harkin, \n        Ms. Collins, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Smith, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. \n        Lautenberg, Mr. McCain, Mr. Reed, Ms. Snowe, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. \n        Chafee, and Mr. Specter):\n  S. 666. A bill to protect the public health by providing the Food and \nDrug Administration with certain authority to regulate tobacco \nproducts; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I join our colleagues Senators \nKennedy, Lugar, Collins, Smith, Cornyn, McCain, Snowe, Harkin, Durbin, \nDodd, Lautenberg, Reed, Murkowski, Chafee and Specter to introduce a \nbill designed to help protect consumers--especially children--from the \ndangers of tobacco. Simply, our bill would finally give the Food and \nDrug Administration (FDA) the authority it needs to effectively \nregulate the manufacture and sale of tobacco products.\n  I say finally, because there are some tobacco proponents who would \nhave you believe that the Master Settlement Agreement, which was signed \nin 1998 by 46 states, resolved the issue of tobacco use by imposing \nadvertising restrictions.\n  I say finally, because my colleagues--first Senator McCain, then \nSenator Frist, then Senator Gregg, and then Senator Kennedy and I--have \nbeen seeking FDA regulation of tobacco products since the mid- to late-\n1990's.\n  And, I say finally, because the bill that we are introducing today is \nthe product of long and hard discussions and negotiations that I have \nhad with Senator Kennedy and public interest groups and industry. Our \nbill has the support of the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, Philip \nMorris, the American Heart Association, the American Lung Association, \nand the American Cancer Association. It is a bill that I am proud of--\none that is worthy of the Senate's consideration, and one that will \nprovide the FDA--finally--with strong and effective authority over the \nregulation of tobacco products.\n  The introduction of this bill couldn't come at a better time. The \nbudget is on the Floor, and people anticipate the slowed-spending in \nMedicaid, and the economic burden of cigarettes is enormous. According \nto the 2004 Surgeon General's Report entitled The Health Consequences \nof Smoking, from 1995 to 1999, smoking-related costs totaled $157.7 \nbillion each year. This figure includes more than $75 billion in direct \nmedical costs for adults (things like ambulatory care, hospital care, \nprescription drugs, nursing homes, and other care), about $82 billion \nin indirect costs from lost productivity, and $366 million for neonatal \ncare. This equals an estimated $3,000 per smoker, per year.\n  In a budget year when Congress is looking to find savings in \nMedicaid--in the ballpark of $15 billion over 5 years--Congress should \nlook at the cost savings that would be made possible by FDA regulation \nof tobacco. We already know that doing nothing costs our country, our \ntaxpayers, and our employers and employees $157 billion a year. Isn't \nit time that the federal government consider that it has a \nresponsibility to find savings through the regulation of tobacco?\n  Not having access to all the information about this deadly product \nmakes no sense and it is something that needs to change. By introducing \nthis bill, we are saying that. we are not going to let tobacco \nmanufacturers have free reign over their markets and consumers any \nmore. We are taking a step toward making sure the public gets adequate \ninformation about whether to continue to smoke or even to start smoking \nin the first place. With this bill, we are not just saying ``buyer \nbeware.'' We are saying ``tobacco companies be honest.'' We are saying \n``tobacco companies stop marketing to innocent children and tell \nconsumers about what they are really buying.''\n  Ultimately, our bill would give consumers the information they need \nto make healthier and better choices about tobacco use. I have faith \nthat informed consumers make better choices, and those choices could \nlead to cost-savings for the society overall.\n  Our bill would give the FDA the authority to regulate a product that \nhas gone unregulated for far too long--a product that for the past \ncentury has not revealed its ingredients to the consumer--a product \nwhose manufacturing facilities are not inspected or accountable for \nfollowing good manufacturing practices--a product that is never \nreviewed or approved before reaching the hands of 40 million consumers, \nmany of whom are just children. Mr. President, Congress should put an \nend to this. Congress should put an end to the marketing of tobacco \nproducts to our children. Congress should put an end to the ability of \ntobacco companies to make claims, whether they are implied claims or \ndirect claims, about their products. Congress should put an end to \ntobacco companies putting any ingredient they want into their products \nwithout disclosing it to the consumer. It is time Congress gives the \nFDA authority to it needs to fix these problems.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 666\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The use of tobacco products by the Nation's children is \n     a pediatric disease of considerable proportions that results \n     in new generations of tobacco-dependent children and adults.\n       (2) A consensus exists within the scientific and medical \n     communities that tobacco products are inherently dangerous \n     and cause cancer, heart disease, and other serious adverse \n     health effects.\n       (3) Nicotine is an addictive drug.\n       (4) Virtually all new users of tobacco products are under \n     the minimum legal age to purchase such products.\n       (5) Tobacco advertising and marketing contribute \n     significantly to the use of nicotine-containing tobacco \n     products by adolescents.\n       (6) Because past efforts to restrict advertising and \n     marketing of tobacco products have failed adequately to curb \n     tobacco use\n\n[[Page S3038]]\n\n     by adolescents, comprehensive restrictions on the sale, \n     promotion, and distribution of such products are needed.\n       (7) Federal and State governments have lacked the legal and \n     regulatory authority and resources they need to address \n     comprehensively the public health and societal problems \n     caused by the use of tobacco products.\n       (8) Federal and State public health officials, the public \n     health community, and the public at large recognize that the \n     tobacco industry should be subject to ongoing oversight.\n       (9) Under article I, section 8 of the Constitution, the \n     Congress is vested with the responsibility for regulating \n     interstate commerce and commerce with Indian tribes.\n       (10) The sale, distribution, marketing, advertising, and \n     use of tobacco products are activities in and substantially \n     affecting interstate commerce because they are sold, \n     marketed, advertised, and distributed in interstate commerce \n     on a nationwide basis, and have a substantial effect on the \n     Nation's economy.\n       (11) The sale, distribution, marketing, advertising, and \n     use of such products substantially affect interstate commerce \n     through the health care and other costs attributable to the \n     use of tobacco products.\n       (12) It is in the public interest for Congress to enact \n     legislation that provides the Food and Drug Administration \n     with the authority to regulate tobacco products and the \n     advertising and promotion of such products. The benefits to \n     the American people from enacting such legislation would be \n     significant in human and economic terms.\n       (13) Tobacco use is the foremost preventable cause of \n     premature death in America. It causes over 400,000 deaths in \n     the United States each year and approximately 8,600,000 \n     Americans have chronic illnesses related to smoking.\n       (14) Reducing the use of tobacco by minors by 50 percent \n     would prevent well over 10,000,000 of today's children from \n     becoming regular, daily smokers, saving over 3,000,000 of \n     them from premature death due to tobacco induced disease. \n     Such a reduction in youth smoking would also result in \n     approximately $75,000,000,000 in savings attributable to \n     reduced health care costs.\n       (15) Advertising, marketing, and promotion of tobacco \n     products have been especially directed to attract young \n     persons to use tobacco products and these efforts have \n     resulted in increased use of such products by youth. Past \n     efforts to oversee these activities have not been successful \n     in adequately preventing such increased use.\n       (16) In 2002, the tobacco industry spent more than \n     $12,466,000,000 to attract new users, retain current users, \n     increase current consumption, and generate favorable long-\n     term attitudes toward smoking and tobacco use.\n       (17) Tobacco product advertising often misleadingly \n     portrays the use of tobacco as socially acceptable and \n     healthful to minors.\n       (18) Tobacco product advertising is regularly seen by \n     persons under the age of 18, and persons under the age of 18 \n     are regularly exposed to tobacco product promotional efforts.\n       (19) Through advertisements during and sponsorship of \n     sporting events, tobacco has become strongly associated with \n     sports and has become portrayed as an integral part of sports \n     and the healthy lifestyle associated with rigorous sporting \n     activity.\n       (20) Children are exposed to substantial and unavoidable \n     tobacco advertising that leads to favorable beliefs about \n     tobacco use, plays a role in leading young people to \n     overestimate the prevalence of tobacco use, and increases the \n     number of young people who begin to use tobacco.\n       (21) The use of tobacco products in motion pictures and \n     other mass media glamorizes its use for young people and \n     encourages them to use tobacco products.\n       (22) Tobacco advertising expands the size of the tobacco \n     market by increasing consumption of tobacco products \n     including tobacco use by young people.\n       (23) Children are more influenced by tobacco advertising \n     than adults, they smoke the most advertised brands.\n       (24) Tobacco company documents indicate that young people \n     are an important and often crucial segment of the tobacco \n     market. Children, who tend to be more price-sensitive than \n     adults, are influenced by advertising and promotion practices \n     that result in drastically reduced cigarette prices.\n       (25) Comprehensive advertising restrictions will have a \n     positive effect on the smoking rates of young people.\n       (26) Restrictions on advertising are necessary to prevent \n     unrestricted tobacco advertising from undermining legislation \n     prohibiting access to young people and providing for \n     education about tobacco use.\n       (27) International experience shows that advertising \n     regulations that are stringent and comprehensive have a \n     greater impact on overall tobacco use and young people's use \n     than weaker or less comprehensive ones.\n       (28) Text only requirements, although not as stringent as a \n     ban, will help reduce underage use of tobacco products while \n     preserving the informational function of advertising.\n       (29) It is in the public interest for Congress to adopt \n     legislation to address the public health crisis created by \n     actions of the tobacco industry.\n       (30) The final regulations promulgated by the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services in the August 28, 1996, issue of \n     the Federal Register (61 Fed. Reg. 44615-44618) for inclusion \n     as part 897 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, are \n     consistent with the First Amendment to the United States \n     Constitution and with the standards set forth in the \n     amendments made by this subtitle for the regulation of \n     tobacco products by the Food and Drug Administration and the \n     restriction on the sale and distribution, including access to \n     and the advertising and promotion of, tobacco products \n     contained in such regulations are substantially related to \n     accomplishing the public health goals of this Act.\n       (31) The regulations described in paragraph (30) will \n     directly and materially advance the Federal Government's \n     substantial interest in reducing the number of children and \n     adolescents who use cigarettes and smokeless tobacco and in \n     preventing the life-threatening health consequences \n     associated with tobacco use. An overwhelming majority of \n     Americans who use tobacco products begin using such products \n     while they are minors and become addicted to the nicotine in \n     those products before reaching the age of 18. Tobacco \n     advertising and promotion plays a crucial role in the \n     decision of these minors to begin using tobacco products. \n     Less restrictive and less comprehensive approaches have not \n     and will not be effective in reducing the problems addressed \n     by such regulations. The reasonable restrictions on the \n     advertising and promotion of tobacco products contained in \n     such regulations will lead to a significant decrease in the \n     number of minors using and becoming addicted to those \n     products.\n       (32) The regulations described in paragraph (30) impose no \n     more extensive restrictions on communication by tobacco \n     manufacturers and sellers than are necessary to reduce the \n     number of children and adolescents who use cigarettes and \n     smokeless tobacco and to prevent the life-threatening health \n     consequences associated with tobacco use. Such regulations \n     are narrowly tailored to restrict those advertising and \n     promotional practices which are most likely to be seen or \n     heard by youth and most likely to entice them into tobacco \n     use, while affording tobacco manufacturers and sellers ample \n     opportunity to convey information about their products to \n     adult consumers.\n       (33) Tobacco dependence is a chronic disease, one that \n     typically requires repeated interventions to achieve long-\n     term or permanent abstinence.\n       (34) Because the only known safe alternative to smoking is \n     cessation, interventions should target all smokers to help \n     them quit completely.\n       (35) Tobacco products have been used to facilitate and \n     finance criminal activities both domestically and \n     internationally. Illicit trade of tobacco products has been \n     linked to organized crime and terrorist groups.\n       (36) It is essential that the Food and Drug Administration \n     review products sold or distributed for use to reduce risks \n     or exposures associated with tobacco products and that it be \n     empowered to review any advertising and labeling for such \n     products. It is also essential that manufacturers, prior to \n     marketing such products, be required to demonstrate that such \n     products will meet a series of rigorous criteria, and will \n     benefit the health of the population as a whole, taking into \n     account both users of tobacco products and persons who do not \n     currently use tobacco products.\n       (37) Unless tobacco products that purport to reduce the \n     risks to the public of tobacco use actually reduce such \n     risks, those products can cause substantial harm to the \n     public health to the extent that the individuals, who would \n     otherwise not consume tobacco products or would consume such \n     products less, use tobacco products purporting to reduce \n     risk. Those who use products sold or distributed as modified \n     risk products that do not in fact reduce risk, rather than \n     quitting or reducing their use of tobacco products, have a \n     substantially increased likelihood of suffering disability \n     and premature death. The costs to society of the widespread \n     use of products sold or distributed as modified risk products \n     that do not in fact reduce risk or that increase risk include \n     thousands of unnecessary deaths and injuries and huge costs \n     to our health care system.\n       (38) As the National Cancer Institute has found, many \n     smokers mistakenly believe that ``low tar'' and ``light'' \n     cigarettes cause fewer health problems than other cigarettes. \n     As the National Cancer Institute has also found, mistaken \n     beliefs about the health consequences of smoking ``low tar'' \n     and ``light'' cigarettes can reduce the motivation to quit \n     smoking entirely and thereby lead to disease and death.\n       (39) Recent studies have demonstrated that there has been \n     no reduction in risk on a population-wide basis from ``low \n     tar'' and ``light'' cigarettes and such products may actually \n     increase the risk of tobacco use.\n       (40) The dangers of products sold or distributed as \n     modified risk tobacco products that do not in fact reduce \n     risk are so high that there is a compelling governmental \n     interest in insuring that statements about modified risk \n     tobacco products are complete, accurate, and relate to the \n     overall disease risk of the product.\n       (41) As the Federal Trade Commission has found, consumers \n     have misinterpreted advertisements in which one product is \n     claimed to be less harmful than a comparable product, even in \n     the presence of disclosures and advisories intended to \n     provide clarification.\n       (42) Permitting manufacturers to make unsubstantiated \n     statements concerning modified risk tobacco products, whether \n     express\n\n[[Page S3039]]\n\n     or implied, even if accompanied by disclaimers would be \n     detrimental to the public health.\n       (43) The only way to effectively protect the public health \n     from the dangers of unsubstantiated modified risk tobacco \n     products is to empower the Food and Drug Administration to \n     require that products that tobacco manufacturers sold or \n     distributed for risk reduction be approved in advance of \n     marketing, and to require that the evidence relied on to \n     support approval of these products is rigorous.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to provide authority to the Food and Drug \n     Administration to regulate tobacco products under the Federal \n     Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.), by \n     recognizing it as the primary Federal regulatory authority \n     with respect to the manufacture, marketing, and distribution \n     of tobacco products;\n       (2) to ensure that the Food and Drug Administration has the \n     authority to address issues of particular concern to public \n     health officials, especially the use of tobacco by young \n     people and dependence on tobacco;\n       (3) to authorize the Food and Drug Administration to set \n     national standards controlling the manufacture of tobacco \n     products and the identity, public disclosure, and amount of \n     ingredients used in such products;\n       (4) to provide new and flexible enforcement authority to \n     ensure that there is effective oversight of the tobacco \n     industry's efforts to develop, introduce, and promote less \n     harmful tobacco products;\n       (5) to vest the Food and Drug Administration with the \n     authority to regulate the levels of tar, nicotine, and other \n     harmful components of tobacco products;\n       (6) in order to ensure that consumers are better informed, \n     to require tobacco product manufacturers to disclose research \n     which has not previously been made available, as well as \n     research generated in the future, relating to the health and \n     dependency effects or safety of tobacco products;\n       (7) to continue to permit the sale of tobacco products to \n     adults in conjunction with measures to ensure that they are \n     not sold or accessible to underage purchasers;\n       (8) to impose appropriate regulatory controls on the \n     tobacco industry;\n       (9) to promote cessation to reduce disease risk and the \n     social costs associated with tobacco related diseases; and\n       (10) to strengthen legislation against illicit trade in \n     tobacco products.\n\n     SEC. 4. SCOPE AND EFFECT.\n\n       (a) Intended Effect.--Nothing in this Act (or an amendment \n     made by this Act) shall be construed to--\n       (1) establish a precedent with regard to any other \n     industry, situation, circumstance, or legal action; or\n       (2) affect any action pending in Federal, State, or Tribal \n     court, or any agreement, consent decree, or contract of any \n     kind.\n       (b) Agricultural Activities.--The provisions of this Act \n     (or an amendment made by this Act) which authorize the \n     Secretary to take certain actions with regard to tobacco and \n     tobacco products shall not be construed to affect any \n     authority of the Secretary of Agriculture under existing law \n     regarding the growing, cultivation, or curing of raw tobacco.\n\n     SEC. 5. SEVERABILITY.\n\n       If any provision of this Act, the amendments made by this \n     Act, or the application of any provision of this Act to any \n     person or circumstance is held to be invalid, the remainder \n     of this Act, the amendments made by this Act, and the \n     application of the provisions of this Act to any other person \n     or circumstance shall not be affected and shall continue to \n     be enforced to the fullest extent possible.\n\n         TITLE I--AUTHORITY OF THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION\n\n     SEC. 101.

Mr. President, today, Senator DeWine and I are \nintroducing legislation to give the Food and Drug Administration broad \nauthority to regulate tobacco products for the protection of the public \nhealth. We cannot in good conscience allow the fuderal agency most \nresponsible for protecting the public health to remain powerless to \ndeal with the enormous risks of tobacco, the most deadly of all \nconsumer products.\n  Last year, a large bipartisan majority of the Senate voted to grant \nthe FDA authority to regulate tobacco products. It was a major step \nforward in the long-term effort to enact this legislation, which health \nexperts believe is the most important action Congress could take to \nprotect children from this deadly addiction. Unfortunately, the \nlegislation was blocked by a small group of House conferees.\n  We are reintroducing our bill today and we are hopeful that 2005 will \nbe the year when Congress takes the final steps to enact this \nextraordinarily important health legislation. This bill has majority \nsupport in the Senate and strong support amongst rank and file members \nin the House. Now is the time to make it the law of the land.\n  The stakes are vast. Five thousand children have their first \ncigarette every day, and two thousand of them become daily smokers. \nNearly a thousand of them will die prematurely from tobacco-induced \ndiseases. Smoking is the number one preventable cause of death in the \nnation today. Cigarettes kill well over four hundred thousand Americans \neach year. That is more lives lost than from automobile accidents, \nalcohol abuse, illegal drugs, AIDS, murder, suicide, and fires \ncombined. Our response to a public health problem of this magnitude \nmust consist of more than half-way measures.\n  We must deal firmly with tobacco company marketing practices that \ntarget children and mislead the public. The Food and Drug \nAdministration needs broad authority to regulate the sale, \ndistribution, and advertising of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco.\n  The tobacco industry currently spends over eleven billion dollars a \nyear to promote its products. Much of that money is spent in ways \ndesigned to tempt children to start smoking, before they are mature \nenough to appreciate the enormity of the health risk. The industry \nknows that more than 90 percent of smokers begin as children and are \naddicted by the time they reach adulthood.\n  Documents obtained from tobacco companies prove, in the companies'\n\n[[Page S3054]]\n\nown words, the magnitude of the industry's efforts to trap children \ninto dependency on their deadly product. Recent studies by the \nInstitute of Medicine and the Centers for Disease Control show the \nsubstantial role of industry advertising in decisions by young people \nto use tobacco products.\n  If we are serious about reducing youth smoking, FDA must have the \npower to prevent industry advertising designed to appeal to children \nwherever it will be seen by children. This legislation will give FDA \nthe ability to stop tobacco advertising which glamorizes smoking from \nappearing where it will be seen by significant numbers of children. It \ngrants FDA full authority to regulate tobacco advertising ``consistent \nwith and to the full extent permitted by the First Amendment.''\n  FDA authority must also extend to the sale of tobacco products. \nNearly every state makes it illegal to sell cigarettes to children \nunder 18, but surveys show that those laws are rarely enforced and \nfrequently violated. FDA must have the power to limit the sale of \ncigarettes to face-to-face transactions in which the age of the \npurchaser can be verified by identification. This means an end to self-\nservice displays and vending machine sales. There must also be serious \nenforcement efforts with real penalties for those caught selling \ntobacco products to children. This is the only way to ensure that \nchildren under 18 are not able to buy cigarettes.\n  The FDA conducted the longest rule-making proceeding in its history, \nstudying which regulations would most effectively reduce the number of \nchildren who smoke. Seven hundred thousand public comments were \nreceived in the course of that rulemaking. At the conclusion of its \nproceeding, the Agency promulgated rules on the manner in which \ncigarettes are advertised and sold. Due to litigation, most of those \nregulations were never implemented. If we are serious about curbing \nyouth smoking as much as possible, as soon as possible; it makes no \nsense to require FDA to reinvent the wheel by conducting a new multi-\nyear rulemaking process on the same issues. This legislation will give \nthe youth access and advertising restrictions already developed by FDA \nthe immediate force of law, as if they had been issued under the new \nstatute.\n  The legislation also provides for stronger warnings on all cigarette \nand smokeless tobacco packages, and in all print advertisements. These \nwarnings will be more explicit in their description of the medical \nproblems which can result from tobacco use. The FDA is given the \nauthority to change the text of these warning labels periodically, to \nkeep their impact strong.\n  Nicotine in cigarettes is highly addictive. Medical experts say that \nit is as addictive as heroin or cocaine. Yet for decades, tobacco \ncompanies have vehemently denied the addictiveness of their products. \nNo one can forget the parade of tobacco executives who testified under \noath before Congress that smoking cigarettes is not addictive. \nOverwhelming evidence in industry documents obtained through the \ndiscovery process proves that the companies not only knew of this \naddictiveness for decades, but actually relied on it as the basis for \ntheir marketing strategy. As we now know, cigarette manufacturers \nchemically manipulated the nicotine in their products to make it even \nmore addictive.\n  The tobacco industry has a long, dishonorable history of providing \nmisleading information about the health consequences of smoking. These \ncompanies have repeatedly sought to characterize their products as far \nless hazardous than they are. They made minor innovations in product \ndesign seem far more significant for the health of the user than they \nactually were. It is essential that FDA have clear and unambiguous \nauthority to prevent such misrepresentations in the future. The largest \ndisinformation campaign in the history of the corporate world must end.\n  Given the addictiveness of tobacco products, it is essential that the \nFDA regulate them for the protection of the public health. Over forty \nmillion Americans are currently addicted to cigarettes. No responsible \npublic health official believes that cigarettes should be banned. A ban \nwould leave forty million people without a way to satisfy their drug \ndependency. FDA should be able to take the necessary steps to help \naddicted smokers overcome their addiction, and to make the product less \ntoxic for smokers who are unable or unwilling to stop. To do so, FDA \nmust have the authority to reduce or remove hazardous ingredients from \ncigarettes, to the extent that it becomes scientifically feasible. The \ninherent risk in smoking should not be unnecessarily compounded.\n  Recent statements by several tobacco companies make clear that they \nplan to develop what they characterize as ``reduced risk'' cigarettes. \nThis legislation will require manufacturers to submit such ``reduced \nrisk'' products to the FDA for analysis before they can be marketed. No \nhealth-related claims will be permitted until they have been verified \nto the FDA's satisfaction. These safeguards are essential to prevent \ndeceptive industry marketing campaigns, which could lull the public \ninto a false sense of health safety.\n  Smoking is the number one preventable cause of death in America. \nCongress must vest FDA not only with the responsibility for regulating \ntobacco products, but with full authority to do the job effectively.\n  This legislation will give the FDA the legal authority it needs--to \nreduce youth smoking by preventing tobacco advertising which targets \nchildren--to prevent the sale of tobacco products to minors--to help \nsmokers overcome their addiction--to make tobacco products less toxic \nfor those who continue to use them--and to prevent the tobacco industry \nfrom misleading the public about the dangers of smoking.\n  Enacting this bill this year is the right thing to do for America's \nchildren.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 668. A bill to provide enhanced criminal penalties for willful \nviolations of occupational standards for asbestos; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the ``Asbestos \nStandards Enforcement Act.'' This legislation provides for enhanced \ncriminal penalties for willful violations of occupational standards for \nasbestos.\n  Currently, the Occupational Safety and Health Act provides for \ncriminal sanctions only in those cases where a willful violation of \nstandards results in the death of a worker. This circumstance is not \nlikely to occur when an employer is cited for an asbestos violation, \ndue to the long latency of the disease, and the fact that the \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration is required to issue \ncitations within six months after inspectors find workplace violations.\n  This legislation would subject employers who willfully violate OSHA \nasbestos standards to fines at levels set by the Uniform Criminal Code, \nas well as imprisonment of up to five years, or both. If the conviction \nis for a violation committed after a first conviction, this legislation \nwould provide punishment by penalties in accordance with the Uniform \nCriminal Code, imprisonment for not more than ten years, or both.\n  Strong enforcement actions against parties that violate OSHA asbestos \nrules are necessary to avoid putting workers and the public at risk of \nasbestos related diseases. I have incorporated these strong measures in \nmy discussion draft of the ``Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution \nAct.'' While that legislation is being considered, there is no reason \nnot to proceed with OSHA legislation that would come before the Senate \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pension Committee.\n  There are still egregious practices by employers, particularly when \nit comes to asbestos abatement, that must be stopped. In a recent case, \nowners of an asbestos removal firm were convicted of exposing hundreds \nof workers to such high levels of asbestos that many of these workers \nare almost certain to contract asbestosis, lung cancers, and \nmesothelioma. Yet this case involved criminal prosecution under \nenvironmental laws because the OSHA Act does not contain sufficient \nauthority for criminal prosecution in such cases. In many other \nasbestos cases, it may not be possible to successfully apply \nenvironmental laws to protect workers. The bill I am introducing today \nwould permit criminal prosecution directly under the OSHA Act, the law \nthat is supposed to protect safety and health\n\n[[Page S3055]]\n\nin the workplace. I urge the Senate to pass this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Salazar):\n  S. 670. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to conduct \na special resource study of sites associated with the life of Cesar \nEstrada Chavez and the farm labor movement; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by Senator \nSalazar in introducing the Cesar Estrada Chavez Study Act. This \nlegislation would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a \nspecial resource study of sites associated with the life of Cesar \nChavez. Mr. Chavez's legacy is an inspiration to us all and he will be \nremembered for helping Americans to transcend distinctions of \nexperience and share equally in the rights and responsibilities of \nfreedom. It is important that we honor his struggle and do what we can \nto preserve appropriate sites that are significant to his life.\n  Cesar Chavez, an Arizonan born in Yuma, was the son of migrant farm \nworkers. While his formal education ended in the eighth grade, his \ninsatiable intellectual curiosity and determination helped make him \nknown as one of the great American leaders for his successes in \norganizing migrant farm workers. His efforts on behalf of some of the \nmost oppressed individuals in our society is an inspiration and through \nhis work he made America a bigger and a better nation.\n  While Chavez and his family migrated across the southwest looking for \nfarm work, he evolved into a defender of worker's rights. He founded \nthe National Farm Workers Association in 1962, which later became the \nUnited Farm Workers of America. He gave a voice to those who had no \nvoice. In his words, ``We cannot seek achievement for ourselves and \nforget about progress and prosperity for our community . . . our \nambitions must be broad enough to include the aspirations and needs of \nothers, for their sakes and for our own.''\n  This legislation, which passed the Senate unanimously during the last \nCongress, has received an overwhelming positive response, not only from \nmy fellow Arizonans, but from Americans all across the Nation. The bill \nwould direct the Secretary of the Interior to determine whether any of \nthe sites significant to Chavez's life meet the criteria for being \nlisted on the National Register of Historic Landmarks. The goal of this \nlegislation is to establish a foundation for future legislation that \nwould then designate land for the appropriate sites to become historic \nlandmarks.\n  Cesar Chavez was a humble man of deep conviction who understood what \nit meant to serve and sacrifice for others. His motto in life, ``si se \npuede'' or it can be done, epitomizes his life's work and continues to \ninfluence those wishing to improve our Nation. Honoring the places of \nhis life will enable his legacy to inspire and serve as an example for \nour future leaders.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about an exemplary \nAmerican and passionate champion of human and civil rights, Cesar \nEstrada Chavez, and to introduce legislation that takes an important \nfirst step in memorializing his tremendous contributions to our \ncountry.\n  Together with Senator John McCain, I will introduce the Cesar Estrada \nChavez Study Act. This bill will direct the Secretary of the Interior \nto conduct a study of sites associated with the life of Cesar Chavez \nand will lay the necessary groundwork for the preservation of these \nsites as national historic landmarks. In the 108th Congress, Senator \nMcCain and Representative Hilda Solis sponsored similar legislation in \nthe House of Representatives, and I am pleased to join their efforts.\n  Like many great American heroes, Cesar Chavez came from humble roots, \nbut his strength of character led him to achieve great things. Chavez \nwas born on March 31, 1927 in Yuma, AZ, where he spent his early years \non his family's farm. At age 10, his family lost their farm in a bank \nforeclosure, forcing them to join the thousands of farm workers that \nwandered the Southwest to find work. They worked in fields and \nvineyards, harvesting the fresh fruits and vegetables that people \nthroughout the world enjoyed unaware of the daily hardships endured by \nfarm workers.\n  Cesar Chavez experienced these hardships and witnessed first hand the \ninjustices in farm worker life. He became determined to bring dignity \nto farm workers and in 1962, he founded the National Farmworkers \nAssociation, which would later become the United Farmworkers of America \n(UFW). Through the UFW, Chavez called attention to the terrible working \nand living conditions of America's farm workers. Most importantly, he \norganized thousands of migrant farm workers to fight for fair wages, \nhealth care coverage, pension benefits, livable housing, and respect.\n  Like Cesar Chavez, I am the son of farmers. Everyday, I am reminded \nof my family's tradition of working the land by the sign on my desk \nthat reads ``No Farms, No Food.'' And without farm workers, who would \nharvest the fruits and vegetables we all enjoy? Cesar Chavez understood \nthis--he championed the rights of these forgotten Americans and helped \nshine a light of their plight. He once remarked, ``It is my deepest \nbelief that only by giving our lives do we find life.'' He gave his \nlife to ensure farm workers, and all workers, were afforded the rights \nand dignity they deserved.\n  For these reasons and many more, I proudly join my colleague from \nArizona in introducing significant legislation that will honor Cesar \nChavez. It is my hope that Congress can work together to quickly pass \nthis important bill that honor the places of Chavez' life and allow his \nlegacy to inspire and serve as an example for our future leaders.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE:\n  S. 674. A bill to provide assistance to combat HIV/AIDS in India, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nmake India eligible for assistance under the Emergency Plan for AIDS \nRelief (PEPFAR).\n  India is at a tipping point. A silent tsunami is at hand, and we can \neither act now or witness the preventable deaths of millions of people. \nAn estimated 5.1 million people are infected with the HIV virus in \nIndia, second only to South Africa. HIV/AIDS has been reported in \nalmost all the states and union territories of the country. In some \nparts of the country, the prevalence rates are similar to those in the \nhardest-hit areas of sub-Saharan Africa. In Belgaun in Karnataka, for \ninstance, a district whose population is greater than that of Ireland, \n4.5 percent are infected.\n  The epidemic is spreading rapidly from urban to rural areas and from \nhigh-risk groups such as sex workers and IV drug users to the general \npopulation. The mobility of India's population threatens to spread HIV/\nAIDS around the country. And with an overall population larger than the \nwhole of Africa, there exists a serious threat of catastrophe. One \nestimate, by the CIA, predicted that 20 to 25 million could be infected \nby 2010, more than in any other country in the world.\n  India's political leaders, public health officials, non-governmental \norganizations, and medical and scientific communities have taken \nimportant steps to combat HIV/AIDS. India, the world's largest \ndemocracy, has skilled governmental and civil society actors who are \ncommitted to a new awareness of the AIDS crisis and strategic \napproaches to combating the disease. But significant gaps remain in the \nIndian health care system's ability to address the crisis. Only 29 \ncents per capita are spent in India to combat HIV/AIDS. This amount is \nsignificantly less than in countries that have succeeded at stemming \nthe disease, such as Thailand (55 cents) and Uganda ($1.85).\n  There is an urgent need for assistance in care and treatment. More \nresources are necessary for public education, as demonstrated by the \nfact that 90 percent of Indians with HIV do not know they are infected. \nThere is also a desperate need for assistance in tracking and \nmonitoring the epidemic, merely to ascertain its full scope. These and \nother gaps require immediate and sustained U.S. engagement and \ncontribution of resources.\n  The U.S. government is doing important work to combat HIV/AIDS in \nIndia, but the available resources are insufficient. To provide the \nnecessary\n\n[[Page S3056]]\n\nassistance, and to demonstrate America's commitment to helping India \ncombat HIV/AIDS, it is critical that India become eligible for the \nPresident's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. Smaller countries may seem \nmore manageable. Combating HIV/AIDS in a country the size of India may \nseem daunting. But if we invest now in stopping this epidemic, if we \ntake advantage of this window of opportunity, we can head off a \ncatastrophe.\n  In addition to adding India to the list of countries eligible for \nPEPFAR assistance, this bill authorizes whatever funds are necessary to \nprovide this assistance. It thus ensures that confronting the epidemic \nin India does not come at the expense of other countries. We must \ncontinue to expand the list of eligible countries in recognition of the \nglobal nature of this pandemic. We must also accelerate assistance to \nAfrican and Caribbean countries already included as focus countries. \nFinally, we must increase overall funding to combat HIV/AIDS.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 674\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ASSISTANCE TO COMBAT HIV/AIDS IN INDIA.\n\n       Section 1(f)(2)(B)(ii)(VII) of the State Department Basic \n     Authorities Act of 1956 (22 U.S.C. 2651a(f)(2)(B)(ii)(VII)) \n     is amended by inserting ``India,'' after ``Haiti,''.\n\n     SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       In addition to any amounts otherwise available for such \n     purpose, there is authorized to be appropriated to the \n     President such sums as may be necessary for fiscal years 2006 \n     through 2008 to provide assistance to India pursuant to the \n     United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and \n     Malaria Act of 2003 (22 U.S.C. 7601 et seq.) and the \n     amendments made by that Act.\n  By Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Johnson, \nMr. Durbin, Mr. Burns, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Dayton, and Mr. Harkin):\n  S. 675. A bill to reward the hard work and risk of individuals who \nchoose to live in and help preserve America's small, rural towns, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today Senators Hagel, Brownback, Johnson \nand many of our colleagues are re-introducing the New Homestead Act \nthat will help address one of the most serious threats to the future of \nAmerica's Heartland--the loss of its residents and Main Street \nbusinesses.\n  Over the past several years, we have described for our colleagues--\nand the American people--the economic devastation that population loss \nhas had on America's Heartland. Hundreds of thousands of people have \nleft small towns in rural areas throughout the Great Plains in search \nof opportunities elsewhere.\n  In North Dakota, we have experienced greater than 10 percent net out-\nmigration in nearly 90 percent of our counties over the past two \ndecades. My home county, Hettinger, saw its population dwindle from \n4,257 in 1980 to just 2,715 in 2000. Its population is projected to \ndrop to just 1,877 by 2020.\n  However, this out-migration problem isn't limited to North Dakota. \nNearly all of America's Heartland is facing population losses of epic \nproportions. Seventy percent of the rural counties in the Great Plains \nhave seen their population shrink by at least one-third.\n  If you are a business owner, mayor, school board member, minister or \nresident of one of these rural communities, you know firsthand about \nthis problem. People who are from these areas know that you simply \ncan't grow or run a business in an environment where the overall \neconomy is shrinking, current and potential customers are leaving, and \npublic and private investment is falling. Too many communities in North \nDakota and other rural States lack the critical mass of people and \nresources it takes to keep a community alive and growing.\n  The New Homestead Act of2005 that we are introducing today will help \nstem the problem of chronic rural out-migration and allow many rural \nareas to grow and prosper again. This one-of-a kind bill is virtually \nidentical to the bill we introduced in the last Congress. The New \nHomestead Act gives people who are willing to commit to live and work \nin high out-migration areas for 5 years added incentives to buy a home, \npay for college, build a nest egg, and start a business--or just plain \nget ahead in life. These incentives include repaying a portion of \ncollege loans, offering a tax credit for the purchase of a new home, \nprotecting home values by allowing losses in home value to be deducted \nfrom Federal income taxes, and establishing Individual Homestead \nAccounts that will help people build savings and have access to credit.\n  This legislation also would establish a new venture capital fund with \nstate and local governments as partners to ensure that entrepreneurs \nand companies in these areas get the capital they need to start and \ngrow their businesses.\n  Our rural areas have been fighting for their very survival for years, \nyet until recently, most Amen:s didn't even know about this struggle. \nToday, however, general awareness about the problem of chronic rural \nout-migration is growing. This issue has been the subject of national \nsymposiums, forums, town hall meetings and congressional hearings.\n  Last year, the U.S. Senate acted on some provisions from the New \nHomestead Act that offer state and local governments much-needed tools \nto encourage businesses to locate or stay in rural areas that are \nsuffering from high out-migration. With the help of the leaders of the \ntax-writing Senate Finance Committee, Chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa \nand Ranking Democrat Max Baucus of Montana, the Senate passed two key \ninvestment tax credit measures in the New Homestead Act as part of a \nmajor corporate tax bill considered last year. These investment tax \ncredits would have been used to encourage businesses to move to or \nexpand their operations in high out-migration rural counties. Together, \nthese rural investment tax provisions would have made an estimated $641 \nmillion in tax credits available for business over the next decade.\n  Regrettably, these tax provisions were dropped from the final tax \nbill sent to the President. But the Senate's action sent a message of \nhope and opportunity to many rural communities: Federal policymakers do \nunderstand that rural out-migration is a serious threat to the economic \nwell-being of the Nation's Heartland and that the New Homestead Act is \na serious proposal for addressing it.\n  I think our colleagues would agree that our Nation's rural areas are \ngreat places to live and raise a family. Most rural communities have \ngood schools, low crime rates, and a level of civic involvement that \nwould make any public official proud. But unfortunately it has been a \nconstant struggle for many rural communities in North Dakota and the \nGreat Plains to survive. This shouldn't be the case.\n  I look forward to working with all of my Senate colleagues to try to \nreverse the trend of population loss and grow the economies of rural \nareas in North Dakota, Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas and the rest of America's \nHeartland. Enacting the policy changes recommended in the New Homestead \nAct is a very good place to start.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the New Homestead Act in the 109th \nCongress by cosponsoring it and helping us move this important bill \nforward, once again, in the legislative process.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. STEVENS (for himself, Mr. Frist, Mr. Specter, Mr. \n        Alexander, Mr. DeWine, Mrs. Clinton, and Mrs. Hutchison):\n  S. 676. A bill to provide for Project GRAD programs, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have introduced today the Graduation \nReally Achieves Dreams, GRAD, Act, which will help improve our nation's \ngraduation rate by authorizing a program that has a proven track \nrecord--Project GRAD USA. I am joined by my colleagues, Senators Frist, \nClinton, Alexander, DeWine, Hutchison and Specter.\n  Currently in our Nation, we graduate only 70 percent of our students \nfrom high school. In high poverty urban districts, we often graduate \nfewer than half that many--one in three. In rural areas, where one-\nthird of American students are educated--only 58.8 percent of students \nattend colleges and\n\n[[Page S3057]]\n\nuniversities, compared with 68.2 percent in urban and suburban areas. \nThe problem is especially acute in Alaska, where Alaska Natives are \nalmost twice as likely as other students to drop out of high school.\n  We must provide better support and resources for our most vulnerable \nstudents. Project GRAD USA is already doing that job in 12 sites \nnationwide, including one in my own State of Alaska.\n  Project GRAD USA is a national program to increase the number of low-\nincome and at-risk students who attend college and earn degrees. Unlike \nother national programs, Project GRAD USA is a comprehensive non-profit \nK-12 education reform program. It serves at-risk students, beginning in \nkindergarten, and staying with them through college, by offering \nresearch-based programs in reading, math, classroom management, social \nservices, and college preparation. Students who qualify then receive a \nfour-year college scholarship. Scholarships are funded by private-\nindustry donations and foundation grants, as well as previously-\nappropriated Federal dollars.\n  In Alaska, Project GRAD established a program in the Kenai Peninsula \nand serves six K-12 schools and one K-10 school, reaching 600 students. \nThree schools serve small Alaska Native communities; three serve \nRussian Old Believer communities; and the seventh school serves a mixed \ncommunity of Alaska Natives, Russians and other Caucasians. More than \n47 percent of the students Project GRAD Kenai serves are at poverty \nlevel, and 49.2 percent of Kenai students report that a language other \nthan English is spoken at home. Project GRAD is committed to \nmaintaining cultural relevance in each of the schools it serves and \ncreating individualized components developed with community leaders, \nteachers and families.\n  This legislation would provide funds so Project GRAD can continue to \ngrow in the States where it now operates and expand its proven model \nelsewhere. It also requires the local sites to match federal funds it \nreceives with local dollars and in-kind support. In this way, federal \nfunds are leveraged to increase support for needed educational reform \nand enhancement.\n  When I visit the Kenai Peninsula in Alaska, I see first hand the \nimpact Project GRAD has made on the students in this district as well \nas the significant economic impact to the overall Peninsula. In the \nfirst five years of the program, over $6 million will be invested in \nprogram development and implementation and nearly $250,000 will be \nawarded in scholarships.\n  Project GRAD USA has proven its effectiveness nationwide and now \nserves over 133,000 students. High school graduation rates for long-\nterm participants have increased by 85 percent, and those who have gone \non to college have earned college degrees at a rate of 89 percent above \nthe national average. These results have not gone unnoticed as \nPresident Bush and Majority Leader Frist have both strongly supported \nthe program. Further, Fortune magazine chose GRAD as its ``charity of \nchoice'' for 2004.\n  Proven education, retention and graduation initiatives aimed at our \nstudents most at-risk deserve every policy maker's attention as we aim \nto do the most good with limited resources. I am proud to support this \nlegislation, and I encourage my colleagues to join me to ensure Project \nGRAD's continued success for our children.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM (for himself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Ensign, Mr. \n        Lieberman, Mr. Brownback, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Smith, Mr. Schumer, \n        Mr. Talent, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Coburn, and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 677. A bill to amend title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to \nestablish provisions with respect to religious accommodation in \nemployment, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Workplace \nReligious Freedom Act. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by \nSenator Kerry and appreciate the work he has done on this bill over the \nyears. I am also pleased to have a number of Senators, both Democrats \nand Republicans, liberals and conservatives, join me in cosponsoring \nthis important legislation.\n  The bill we introduce today is intended to ensure that employees are \nnot forced to choose between their religious beliefs and practices and \nkeeping their jobs. It recognizes that an individual's faith impacts \nevery part of their life, including the many hours spent in the \nworkplace. America is distinguished internationally as a land of \nreligious freedom, and it should be a place where people are not forced \nto choose between keeping their faith and keeping their job. This \nsimple proposition is why we are re-introducing the Workplace Religious \nFreedom Act (WRFA), which provides a balanced approach to reconciling \nthe needs of people of faith in the workplace with those of employers.\n  Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was meant to address \nconflicts between religion and work. It requires employers to \nreasonably accommodate the religious needs of their employees so long \nas it does not impose an undue hardship on the employer. The problem is \nthat our federal courts have essentially ruled that any hardship is an \nundue hardship and have thus left religiously observant workers with \nlittle or no legal protection. WRFA will re-establish the principle \nthat employers must reasonably accommodate the religious needs of \nemployees. This legislation is carefully crafted and strikes an \nappropriate balance, respecting religious accommodation while ensuring \nthat an undue burden is not forced upon employers. WRFA is also careful \nto ensure that the accommodation of an individual employee's religious \nconscience will not adversely affect the delivery of products or \nservices to an employer's customers or clients.\n  The balance that this legislation seeks to establish is evident in \nthe broad spectrum of groups supporting this bill, including the Union \nof Orthodox Jewish Congregations, the Southern Baptist Convention, the \nNational Council of Churches, the North American Council for Muslim \nWomen, the Sikh Resource Taskforce, the Seventh Day Adventist Church, \nthe American Jewish Committee, Agudath Israel of America, the U.S. \nConference of Catholic Bishops and many others.\n  America is a great nation because we honor not only the freedom of \nconscience, but also the freedom to exercise one's religion according \nto the dictates of that religious conscience. This fundamental freedom \nis protected and strengthened in this legislation by re-establishing an \nappropriate balance between the demands of work and the principles of \nfaith.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this \nlegislation be printed in the Record after my statement.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 677\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to require the \nregistration of contractors' taxpayer identification numbers in the \nCentral Contractor Registry database of the Department of Defense, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the Central \nContractor Registry Act. This legislation is particularly relevant this \nweek, as we debate a tough budget to restore fiscal discipline.\n  Last year the Government Accountability Office testified at a hearing \nbefore the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations that over 27,000 \ncontractors at the Department of Defense owed over $3 billion in unpaid \nFederal taxes. If we want to demonstrate fiscal discipline, it seems to \nme that we ought to be looking at places like this before we start \ntalking about cuts to Medicaid or the farm bill. Asking companies that \nwin lucrative government contracts to simply pay their taxes seems like \ncommon sense to me.\n  That's why I have introduced the Central Contractor Registry Act. \nThis bill will close a $3 billion tax loophole and will help to recover \nover $100 million annually from federal contractors who have not filed \nfederal tax returns or who have not paid the taxes they owe the \ngovernment.\n  The bill is simple: it establishes a centralized contractor database \nwithin the Department of Defense, and requires federal contractors who \nregister in that database to provide their taxpayer identification \nnumber and their consent to verifying that number with the Internal \nRevenue Service as a condition that must precede the awarding of a \ncontract by the Department of Defense.\n  Normally, companies that are delinquent in paying their taxes are \nlevied 15 percent of the payments they receive as government \ncontractors. In fiscal year 2002, this should have amounted to over \n$100 million from tax delinquent Department of Defense contractors. \nHowever, actual collections for that year were less than $500,000. And \nin 2001, over 26,000 of the defense contracts submitted to the IRS to \ndetermine contractors' tax liability were unusable.\n  One of the principal reasons for this anemic state of collections and \nthe large volume of unusable information returns is the inability of \nthe Department of Defense and the Internal Revenue Service to reach an \naccord on verifying the taxpayer identification numbers of the \ncontractors who have registered in the Department of Defense's Central \nContractor Registration database. Under current law, the Department of \nDefense's authority to verify contractors' taxpayer identification \nnumbers is limited to those contractors who have contracts with the \nDepartment of Defense and for whom the department is required to report \nmiscellaneous income to the Internal Revenue Service on a Form 1099 \ninformation return. However, there are contractors who have registered \nin the Central Contractor Registration for whom the Department of \nDefense lacks authority to verify their taxpayer identification \nnumbers, including individuals and companies who would like to contract \nwith the federal government and contractors who have contracts with \nagencies and departments other than the Department of Defense. And \noften the numbers provided are incorrect, but there is no recourse.\n  My bill will resolve the impasse between the Department of Defense \nand the Internal Revenue Service by requesting contractors' consent to \nthe validation of their taxpayer identification number as part of the \nregistration process. Contractors will not be required to provide their \nconsent. But if they do not, they will not be awarded a contract by the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  Further, my bill requires the Department of Defense to warn \ncontractors as part of the registration process that if they do not \nprovide a valid taxpayer identification number they may be subject to \nbackup withholding. This would apply to those contractors who list an \ninvalid taxpayer identification number, have a contract with the \nDepartment of Defense, and will earn miscellaneous income that is \nrequired to be reported to the Internal Revenue Service.\n  I would like to briefly summarize the major provisions of my bill. It \nprovides a statutory basis for the Central Contractor Registration and \nrenames the database as the Central Contractor Registry. It requires \nthat the registry contain contractors' taxpayer identification numbers, \ntheir consent to verifying their numbers with the Internal Revenue \nService and for the Internal Revenue Service to provide a corrected \nnumber if possible. It requires that registrants furnish this \ninformation as a condition for registration, and requires the \nDepartment of Defense to warn contractors who fail to provide a valid \ntaxpayer identification number that they may be subject to backup \nwithholding and requires implementation of backup withholding in cases \nwhere it is required. It precludes awarding a contract to any \nregistrant who has not provided a valid taxpayer identification number \nand excludes from coverage any registrant who is not required to have a \ntaxpayer identification number. It directs the Secretary of Defense to \napply to the Internal Revenue Service for inclusion in the Taxpayer \nIdentification Number Matching Program and directs the Commissioner of \nInternal Revenue to provide response to the Department of Defense. It \ndirects the Secretary of Defense to provide any registrant who is \ndetermined to have an invalid taxpayer identification number with an \nopportunity to provide a valid number. It further requires that the \nCentral Contractor Registry clearly indicate whether a registrant's \ntaxpayer identification number is valid, under review,\n\n[[Page S3059]]\n\ninvalid, or not required. Finally, it requires that contractors' \ntaxpayer identification numbers be treated as confidential by federal \ncontract officers who have access to the Central Contractor Registry.\n  This bill will ensure that tax cheats are not rewarded with Federal \ncontracts. As we debate the budget this week, I encourage my colleagues \nto join me in supporting this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 679\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Central Contractor Registry.''.\n\n\n              INTRODUCING CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRY ACT\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I join my colleagues, Senators Norm \nColeman, Susan Collins and Jack Reed, in introducing the Central \nContractor Registry Act of 2005. The purpose of this bipartisan bill is \nto strengthen the ability of the Federal Government to stop tax cheats \nfrom obtaining Federal contracts, and for those who have managed to \nobtain contracts, to use a portion of their contract payments to repay \ntheir tax debts.\n  Now, even more than when we introduced a similar bill in May 2004, it \nis clear that new legislation is essential to confront the problem of \nFederal contractor tax debt. Last year the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations, on which Senator Coleman and I sit, raised this issue \nin a hearing based on a report issued by the Government Accountability \nOffice, GAO. The report showed that over 27,000 contractors at the \nDepartment of Defense, DOD, owed $3 billion in unpaid taxes. \nApproximately 90 percent of these unpaid taxes were payroll taxes, \nmoney that should be going to help fund the social security and \nmedicare expenditures that are climbing so rapidly. Too many \ncontractors are continuing to duck payment of these payroll taxes, \nwhile at the same time holding out their hands for taxpayer dollars.\n  Beyond the loss in substantial government revenue, allowing tax \ncheats to bid on Federal contracts is a disservice to all citizens who \nmeet their tax obligations. It is also a disservice to all of the \nhonest companies that compete for the same government contracts, since \ncompanies that do not pay their taxes have lower costs and a \ncompetitive advantage over the companies that do.\n  Current law requires DOD and other government agencies to identify \nany government contractor with unpaid taxes, to withhold 15 percent or \nmore of their contract payments, and to forward that money to the IRS \nto be applied to the contractor's tax debt. The official title of the \nDOD program to carry out this obligation is the Federal Payment Levy \nProgram, sometimes referred to as the DOD tax levy program.\n  In order to identify tax delinquent contractors before they receive \npayment, DOD and other agencies participate in a computer matching \nprogram administered by the Treasury Department that cross-checks lists \nof upcoming contractor payments with IRS lists of delinquent taxpayers. \nIf a match occurs, DOD--in the case of defense contractors--and the \nTreasury Department for all other government contractors is supposed to \nwithhold money from the identified contractor's upcoming contract \npayments.\n  The problem is that the computer matching program has so far produced \nrelatively few matches. In 2003, for example, DOD collected only about \n$680,000 of back taxes through its tax levy program instead of the $100 \nmillion that GAO estimates should have been collected. That means DOD \ncollected less than one percent of the back taxes it should have.\n  One major impediment to the computer matching program has been that \nit depends upon a Federal agency's providing the correct taxpayer \nidentification number or TIN for each of its contractors, when many \ncontractors have either failed to submit a TIN or supplied an incorrect \nnumber. When a TIN is incorrect or missing, the computer matching \nprogram is unable to determine whether the relevant government\n\n[[Page S3060]]\n\ncontractor is on the IRS list of delinquent taxpayers. For example, in \n1 year, data indicates that DOD sent the IRS over 26,000 invalid TINs \nthat could not be used.\n\n  To increase the efficiency of the computer matching program, the IRS \nhas tried to improve the accuracy of the TINs in agency contractor \ndata. The IRS has, for example, set up a computer-based TIN validation \nsystem that can electronically verify a TIN number in seconds. This \nelectronic system is available for use by DOD and all other federal \nagencies. Unfortunately, the IRS has also interpreted certain tax laws \nas prohibiting DOD from obtaining TIN validations for many types of \ncontracts. In addition, in the case of TIN numbers with clerical \nerrors, the IRS has interpreted current taxpayer confidentiality laws \nas prohibiting it from supplying a DOD with a corrected number.\n  The bill we are introducing today would eliminate this bureaucratic \nredtape and significantly increase the effectiveness of the tax levy \nprogram by increasing the accuracy of the TINs used by DOD.\n  The bill would strengthen TIN accuracy by focusing primarily on the \nTINs in the Central Contractor Registry, a government-wide database of \npersons wishing to bid on Federal contracts. This registry is currently \nadministered by DOD, and current Federal regulations require potential \nbidders to self-register in the system by supplying specified \ninformation. As part of the process, registrants are supposed to supply \na TIN, but many either do not or supply an incorrect number. The bill \nwould, for the first time, impose a legal requirement on registrants to \nsupply a valid TIN and would also bar contracts from being awarded to \ncontractors who fail to supply a valid TIN.\n  In addition, the bill would require registrants to authorize DOD to \nvalidate their TINs with the IRS and obtain a corrected TIN from the \nIRS, if needed and possible. This requirement would apply to all \nregistrants in the Central Contractor Registry, no matter what type of \ncontract is involved and whether the contract is with DOD or another \nFederal agency. It would also allow the IRS to supply corrected TINs \nwhere it can promptly and reasonably do so.\n  If, by chance, a registrant managed to obtain a DOD contract without \nhaving supplied a valid TIN, the bill would direct DOD to withhold a \nportion of their contract payments to satisfy their tax debt as \nspecified under existing law. Although this backup holding requirement \nhas been on the books for years, DOD has not implemented it. The bill \nwould require DOD to start doing so.\n  Finally, the bill would provide a number of protections. It would \nprotect privacy by prohibiting DOD and other Federal procurement \nofficials from making TIN numbers available to the public. The \ninformation would be kept confidential within the procurement community \nusing the Central Contractor Registry. It would explicitly exempt from \nthe TIN requirements any contractor, such as a foreign business, not \nrequired by U.S. law to have a taxpayer identification number. The bill \nwould also require DOD to show in the registry database whether a \nparticular TIN has been validated, is awaiting validation, has been \nfound invalid, or is not required, so that procurement officials using \nthe database will know the status of a contractor's TIN. If the IRS \nwere to determine that a particular TIN was invalid, the bill would \nrequire DOD to give the relevant contractor an opportunity to correct \nthe number. The bill would also require DOD to warn all registrants in \nthe Central Contractor Registry of the possibility of backup \nwithholding in the event a contractor fails to provide a valid TIN.\n  DOD and the IRS have indicated that they are willing to undertake \nmany of the changes suggested in the legislation, such as requiring all \nCCR registrants, as a condition of their registration, to authorize DOD \nto validate their TINs with the IRS and obtain a corrected TIN from the \nIRS, if needed and possible. DOD has even drafted possible language to \naccomplish this objective. The IRS, however, has yet to agree to the \nspecific language or to take steps to improve TIN validation efforts, \ndespite the passage of nearly a year since we introduced this bill in \nlast Congress, and despite the fact that some CCR registrants continue \neither to omit their TINs or to provide an invalid TIN. Even if the IRS \nand DOD were to act as promised, the CCR and the privacy protections \nmentioned earlier would benefit from specific statutory language \naddressing this issue. That is why we are re-introducing this bill in \nthe 109th Congress.\n  It is common business sense for the Federal Government to require \ncontractors who want to be paid with Federal taxpayer dollars to allow \nthe United States to determine whether they owe any taxes and, if so, \nto offset a portion of their contract payments to reduce their tax \ndebts. To accomplish that objective, the Federal Government has to do a \nbetter job in identifying federal contractors with unpaid taxes. Our \nbill, by improving the accuracy of taxpayer identification numbers in \nthe Central Contractor Registry, will strengthen DOD's ability to \nidentify tax delinquent contractors and either deny them new contracts \nor reduce their tax debts.\n  I hope all my colleagues will join us in supporting this \nlegislation's enactment during this Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Harkin, \n        and Mr. Specter):\n  S. 681. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to establish a \nNational Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network to prepare, store, and \ndistribute human umbilical cord blood stem cells for the treatment of \npatients and to support peer-reviewed research using such cells; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce ``The Cord Blood \nStem Cell Act of 2005.'' I am particularly gratified that Senators \nDodd, Brownback, Harkin, and Specter have joined me as cosponsors of \nthis bipartisan bill. Since I first introduced this bill last Congress, \nthere has been strong interest in Federal support for public cord blood \nbanks as a widely accepted source of hematopoietic stem cells for \ntransplant and research. The purpose of the Cord Blood Stem Cell Act is \nto create an easily accessible network to prepare, store, and \ndistribute human umbilical cord blood stem cells for the treatment of \npatients and to support research using such cells.\n  Today, thousands of Americans receive and are saved by bone marrow \ntransplants each year. But thousands more die for lack of an \nappropriate donor. The good news is that research now suggests that the \nblood and stem cells from human placenta and umbilical cords may in \nsome cases provide an alternative to bone marrow transplantation. For \nsome patients, particularly those for whom a bone marrow match cannot \nbe found, transplantation of these cells may be a life-saving therapy. \nCord blood stem cell transplants are readily available, and they \nrequire less stringent matching from donors to recipients, thus \ndecreasing the difficulty of finding a fully matched donor.\n  Cord blood transplantation has been used successfully to treat \nleukemia, lymphoma, immunodeficiency diseases, sickle cell anemia, and \ncertain metabolic diseases. However, the number of available cord blood \nstem cell units in the United States is insufficient to meet the need. \nThe Cord Blood Stem Cell Act of 2005 proposes to establish an inventory \nof 150,000 cord blood stem cell units that reflects the diversity of \nthe United States. In conjunction with the 5 million registered bone \nmarrow donors, this registry will enable 95 percent of Americans to \nreceive an appropriately matched transplant. The inventory would \nprovide a critical additional resource for those in need of transplants \nand allocate a certain proportion of units to sustain further research \non cord blood stem cells.\n  In 2004, Congress asked the Institute of Medicine to provide an \nassessment of existing cord blood programs and inventories and to make \nrecommendations to enhance the structure, function, and utility of such \nprograms. Following a year-long process of review and evaluation, the \nInstitute of Medicine will soon issue recommendations on the best \nmethods to create and implement this public cord blood bank network. I \nlook forward to reviewing these recommendations and ensuring that they \nare appropriately reflected in any legislation.\n\n[[Page S3061]]\n\n  Let me be clear--I am open to all options. It is my goal to create \nthe best system to provide patients, clinicians, and families with \naccess to these life-saving treatments by ensuring that the number of \ncord blood units available for transplant and research increases in the \ncoming years.\n  The system will include a network of qualified donor banks which will \ncollect, test, and preserve cord blood stem cells. In addition, the \nsystem should educate and recruit donors, facilitate the rapid matching \nof donors and recipients, and quickly make such cells available to \ntransplant centers for stem cell transplantation.\n  I also strongly endorse the excellent work done by the National \nMarrow Donor Program (NMDP), which Congress created in 1986 and \ncontinues to fund. This registry already lists more than 42,000 units \nof umbilical cord blood and provides important patient advocacy and \nsupport services. It also provides an online service which allows \nphysicians to compare potential cord blood matches with potential adult \nvolunteer donor matches so that they can select the source of cells \nthat best meets their patients' needs. Cord blood should be used to \nexpand patient choices, not to restrict them. Patients, in consultation \nwith their physicians, should have the ability to decide which is best \nfor them.\n  The establishment of a national infrastructure for cord blood will \nhelp save the lives of thousands of critically ill Americans. And while \nthis legislation is not perfect, it is my hope that its introduction \nwill encourage discussions on cord blood and the federal government's \nrole in helping to increase the inventory of cord blood units in the \nUnited States.\n  In my opinion, we must be sure that our nation can meet the needs of \npatients and physicians by ensuring a strong future for cord blood in \nthis country. My primary goal is to ensure that the number of cord \nblood units available for transplant and research increases in the \ncoming years. The only way that goal may be accomplished is through \nstrong federal support. I look forward to working with my colleagues on \ndoing everything possible to provide transplant patients with the best \npossible options by ensuring a strong future for cord blood \ntransplantation in this country.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Hatch and \nSenator Brownback in introducing legislation to advance the use of \numbilical cord blood for clinical applications and research. I first \nbecame aware of the potential therapeutic benefits of cord blood when \nmy first daughter was born three and a half years ago. At that time, \nour doctor informed me and my wife that preserving a small amount of \nblood from the umbilical cord could prove enormously beneficial later \nin her life. Should she become ill with a disease requiring bone marrow \nreconstitution, such as leukemia, her own cord blood stem cells could \nbe used. This would eliminate the need to find a suitable bone marrow \ndonor.\n  The bill that we are introducing today will begin a new national \ncommitment to the development of this technology--which has the \npotential to reduce pain and suffering and save the lives of so many \nAmericans afflicted with some of the most debilitating illnesses. Cord \nblood has already been used successfully in treating a number of \ndiseases, including sickle cell anemia and certain childhood cancers. \nHowever, the use of cord blood is still fledgling. Recent developments \nhave suggested that the stem cells derived from cord blood may be \nuseful in treating a much wider range of diseases, such as Parkinson's \ndisease, diabetes, and heart disease.\n  Like many Americans, I had never heard of cord blood before the birth \nof my daughter. It is not widely used--at least in this country. \nApproximately 95 percent of all bone marrow reconstitutions were done \nusing a bone marrow transplant. Only five percent used cord blood. This \nfigure is surprising when we consider the potential benefits of cord \nblood relative to bone marrow.\n  First, it can be very difficult to find a suitable bone marrow donor. \nAccording to a General Accounting Office (GAO) report, of the 15,231 \nindividuals needing bone marrow transplants between 1997 and 2000 who \nconducted a preliminary search of the National Bone Marrow Donor \nRegistry (NBMDR), only 4,056 received a transplant--a 27 percent \nsuccess rate. This number is even lower for minorities. Cord blood \nwould not only produce an additional source of donation; it also does \nnot require as exact a match as bone marrow.\n  In addition, cord blood is readily available. While it can take \nmonths between finding a bone marrow match and actually receiving a \ntransplant, a unit of cord blood can be utilized in a matter of days or \nweeks. Cord blood also lowers the risk of complications for both the \ndonor and the recipient. The need to extract bone marrow from the donor \nis eliminated, and the risk of infection or rejection by the recipient \nis significantly reduced. Finally, research has suggested that cord \nblood might produce better outcomes than bone marrow in children.\n  Why then, given all of these benefits, has the use of cord blood not \nbecome much more prevalent in the United States? In Japan, where the \nuse of cord blood in clinical setting is more advanced, nearly half of \nall transplants now use cord blood rather than bone marrow.\n  The relatively infrequent use of cord blood in our country is at \nleast partly attributable to the lack of a national infrastructure for \nthe matching and distribution of cord blood units. There are a handful \nof cord blood banks around the country doing excellent work, but there \nis a much more developed infrastructure for bone marrow. This is thanks \nto legislation passed by Congress in 1986 that established a National \nRegistry for bone marrow. By the way, that legislation is due to be \nreauthorized--and I would like to voice my strong support for that \nreauthorization.\n  Our bill would create a similar infrastructure for cord blood. \nSpecifically, it would direct the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices (HHS), acting through the Administrator of the Health \nResources and Services Administration (HRSA), to establish a National \nCord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network, as well as a registry of available \ncord blood units. The network and registry would be required to collect \na minimum of 150,000 units, which should be sufficient to provide a \nsuitable match for 90 percent of the U.S. population.\n  Donor banks would also be required to educate the general public \nabout the potential benefits of cord blood, and encourage an ethnically \ndiverse population of cord blood donors. Given the untapped potential \nof cord blood, at least ten percent of the available units must also be \nmade available for research. Finally, the legislation authorizes an \nappropriation of $15 million for fiscal year 2006, and such sums as may \nbe necessary for fiscal years 2007 through 2010.\n  Before finishing today I would like to make it clear that I strongly \nsupport the continuation of the excellent work done by the National \nMarrow Donor Program (NMDP). Cord blood should act as a complement to--\nnot a replacement for--bone marrow. In many cases, a bone marrow \ntransplant is still the preferred therapy. Physicians should have the \nability to decide on a case by case basis which is best for their \npatient.\n  In the coming weeks, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) will release a \nreport with recommendations about the appropriate structure for a cord \nblood registry. I look forward to reviewing those recommendations and, \nif necessary, making the appropriate changes to our legislation.\n  I firmly believe that the creation of a national infrastructure for \ncord blood will, in time, save the lives of thousands of gravely ill \nAmericans. We have a responsibility to encourage use of cord blood \nwhere appropriate today, and invest in research to fully tap the \npotential of this technology. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD:\n  S. 682. A bill to authorize the establishment of a Social Investment \nand Economic Development Fund for the Americans to provide assistance \nto reduce poverty and foster increased economic opportunity in the \ncountries of the Western Hemisphere, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Social \nInvestment and Economic Development Fund\n\n[[Page S3062]]\n\nfor the Americas Act of 2005. This legislation would authorize critical \nassistance to fight poverty and increase economic opportunity in the \ncountries of the Western Hemisphere.\n  In January, my colleagues Senator Bill Nelson, Senator Lincoln Chafee \nand I visited Venezuela, Paraguay, Argentina, Peru and Ecuador. Our \ntrip and discussions with political and economic leaders throughout the \nregion underscored to me the danger that poverty and economic \ninequality continue to pose to regional stability, the rule of law, and \nto the continuation of market reforms.\n  One third of the population in Latin America currently lives in \npoverty. 128 million people survive on less than two dollars a day, and \n50 million people on less than one dollar a day. In Haiti, the poorest \ncountry in the Western Hemisphere, 65 percent of the population lives \nbelow the poverty line. Despite economic growth throughout the 1990s, \nmoreover, unemployment in Latin America actually increased. And as we \nall know such factors have the potential to increase instability and \nundermine democratic reforms and the rule of law. Indeed, individuals \nliving in poverty are often forced by circumstances to engage in \nillicit activity, including narco-trafficking and even supporting \nterrorist related activities.\n  But there is not only tremendous poverty. Income inequality in Latin \nAmerica is the highest in the world. To illustrate that fact, consider \nthat the richest one-tenth of all Latin Americans earn 48 percent of \nthe total national income, whereas the bottom one tenth earns only 1.6 \npercent. By contrast, in developed countries, the top ten percent earns \n29.1 percent, and the bottom 10 percent earns 2.5 percent. Is it any \nwonder that economic inequality in Uruguay, the most equal country in \nLatin America, is still greater than in the most unequal country in \nEastern Europe?\n  Poverty and inequality are not simply social injustices. They \nthreaten the political stability of Latin America and the national \ninterests of the United States. Indeed, according to a 2004 report by \nthe United Nations Development Program, progress in extending elective \ndemocracy across Latin America is threatened by ongoing social and \neconomic turmoil. Most troubling, the report suggests that over 50 \npercent of the population of Latin America would be willing to \nsacrifice democratic government for real progress on the economic and \nsocial fronts. That is a frightening statistic. And it should make \ncrystal clear the urgency of this situation. Two decades of progress in \nour hemisphere is at risk.\n  The Social Investment and Economic Development Fund for the Americas \nAct of 2005 would seek to address these issues by investing in the \npeoples of the Americas. This important legislation would make it \nUnited States policy to promote market-based principles, economic \nintegration, social development, and inter-American trade. To that end, \nit would authorize $250 million annually in bilateral economic \nassistance to the hemisphere through fiscal year 2010. It would also \nauthorize multilateral assistance, directed through the Inter-American \nDevelopment Bank, of no more than $250 million per year and $1.25 \nbillion in total.\n\n  Certainly, strong trade relations remain a key to creating healthy \neconomies both here in the United States and throughout the region. But \ntrade alone cannot address the myriad challenges facing Latin America, \nwhen millions of citizens in the hemisphere remain marginalized by \neconomic insecurity and social dislocation. That is another reason why \nthis bill is so critical.\n  To confront these challenges, we have to start at the grass roots. We \nhave to start with the people. And the Social Investment and Economic \nDevelopment Fund for the Americas would do that by supporting public-\nprivate partnerships and micro-enterprise developments. It would give \nhonest, hardworking families the chance to become entrepreneurial and \nto create a broad based ownership society in their countries. We \npromote these values here at home, and we should do so abroad.\n  Investing in people also means investing in human capital. And there \nis clearly a need. According to the World Bank large portions of the \npopulation do not receive adequate services such as education and \nhealth care. Education, in particular, is identified as critical to \ndevelopment. Yet the quality of education varies significantly based on \nsocial status and income distribution. In Mexico, for example, the \naverage individual in the bottom 20 percent income bracket has only 3.5 \nyears of schooling, whereas an individual in the top 20 percent income \nbracket has 11.6 years. My legislation would address these inequities \nby targeting assistance at projects which would invest in education. It \nwould also build human capital by investing in basic needs such as \nhealth care, disease prevention, nutrition, and housing.\n  To move forward, we also have to help the people invest in good \ngovernance. Public corruption remains an especially persistent and \npernicious problem in this hemisphere. Both Transparency International \nand the World Economic Forum report high levels of corruption \nthroughout the region. Moreover, while full citizen participation in \ngovernment is a key to strengthening democracy and ensuring that civil \nservices work, many Latin American citizens do not express confidence \nin their political institutions. This Act would attempt to overcome \nthese barriers to progress by enhancing efficiency and transparency in \ngovernment services as well as increasing civil society participation \nin government.\n  Lastly, marginalized populations, including indigenous groups, people \nof African descent, women, and people with disabilities, are \nparticularly affected by problems of poverty and income inequality. \nThis act would target funds to reduce poverty and decrease social \ndislocation among these populations.\n  The funds authorized by this act would be distributed on the basis of \ncompetitive bidding and inter-American cooperation. To do so, this \nlegislation would establish technical review committees which will \npartner with consultative committees in each country to make \ndeterminations on funding requests.\n  Finally, the historic Summits of the Americas made it clear that \neconomic and social integration are the responsibilities of all nations \nin the Western Hemisphere. Through this act, the United States would \nsend a strong signal to others in the region that we take these \nresponsibilities seriously. And it will challenge the other countries \nin the hemisphere to collectively match our efforts.\n  We stand today at a moment of great opportunity and great risk in \nthis hemisphere. The past two decades have witnessed the rise of \ndemocratic governments in nations that long languished under \ndictatorship. Yet this progress is endangered. Economic and social \nconditions for millions of men and women continue to lag dangerously \nfar behind. It is in our moral and strategic interests to provide the \nnecessary economic assistance to fight the scourges of poverty and \nsocial dislocation in this hemisphere. The Social Investment and \nEconomic Development Fund for the Americas Act of 2005 is a vital first \nstep to achieving this goal. I ask my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this important legislation.\n  I ask unamimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 682\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Social Investment and \n     Economic Development Fund for the Americas Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The historic economic, political, cultural, and \n     geographic relationships among the countries of the Western \n     Hemisphere are unique and of continuing special significance \n     to the United States.\n       (2) The interests of the countries of the Western \n     Hemisphere are more interrelated today than ever before. \n     Consequently, sound economic, social, and democratic progress \n     in each of the countries continues to benefit other \n     countries, and lack of it in any country may have serious \n     repercussions in others.\n       (3) Following the historic Summits of the Americas, the \n     1994 Summit in Miami, the\n\n[[Page S3063]]\n\n     1998 Summit in Santiago, Chile, the 2001 Summit in Quebec \n     City, Canada, and the 2004 Special Summit in Monterrey, \n     Mexico, the heads of state of the countries of the Western \n     Hemisphere accepted the formidable challenge of economic and \n     social integration in and between their respective countries.\n       (4) To make progress toward economic and social \n     integration, there is a compelling need to focus on the \n     social development of the people of the Americas which, in \n     turn, will promote the economic and political development of \n     the region.\n       (5) Investment in social development in the Americas, \n     including investment in human and social capital, \n     specifically in education, health, housing, and labor markets \n     with the goal of combating social exclusion and social ills, \n     will consolidate political democracy and the rule of law and \n     promote regional economic integration and trade in the \n     region.\n       (6) The challenge of achieving economic integration between \n     one of the world's most developed economies and some of the \n     poorest and most vulnerable countries requires a special \n     effort to promote social equality, develop skills, and \n     modernize the infrastructure in poorer countries that will \n     enable the people of these countries to maximize the amount \n     of benefits accrued from economic integration.\n       (7) The particular challenge facing social and economic \n     development in Latin America is the historic and persistent \n     highly unequal distribution of wealth. Latin America suffers \n     from the most unequal distribution of wealth in the world \n     with huge inequities in the distribution of assets including \n     education, land, and credit.\n       (8) Latin America also confronts the challenge of an \n     increasing number of poor people. As of today, approximately \n     one-third of the population lives in poverty and increasing \n     numbers live in extreme poverty. Poverty exists in all Latin \n     American countries but 70 percent of the region's poor live \n     in the five largest middle-income countries.\n       (9) Marginalized groups, including indigenous populations, \n     people of African descent, women, people with disabilities, \n     and rural populations, are socially excluded and suffer from \n     poverty, stigma, and discrimination.\n       (10) Democratic values are dominant throughout the \n     Americas, and nearly all governments in the region have come \n     to power through democratic elections.\n       (11) Nonetheless, existing democratic governments and their \n     constituent institutions remain fragile and face critical \n     challenges including effective democratic civilian authority \n     over these institutions, including the military, the \n     consolidation or establishment of independent judicial \n     institutions and the rule of law, and the elimination of \n     corruption.\n       (12) The prosperity, security, and well-being of the United \n     States is linked directly to peace, prosperity, and democracy \n     in the Americas.

A bill to amend the Natural Gas Act to provide additional \nrequirements for the siting, construction, or operation of liquefied \nnatural gas import facilities; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I introduce the Liquefied Natural Gas \nSafety and Security Act of 2005.\n  The siting of liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminals is an \nissue that has taken on critical importance for me and for the people \nof Rhode Island in recent months, as the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission (FERC) is now considering proposals by KeySpan Energy and \nWeaver's Cove Energy to establish LNG marine terminals in Providence, \nRI and Fall River, MA, respectively.\n  I recognize that natural gas is an important and growing component of \nNew\n\n[[Page S3065]]\n\nEngland's and the Nation's energy supply, and that imported LNG offers \na promising new supply source to complement our domestic natural gas \nsupplies. In a post-September 11 world, however, we must consider the \nsubstantial safety and security risks associated with siting LNG marine \nterminals in urban communities and requiring LNG tankers to pass within \nclose proximity to miles of densely populated coastline.\n  The LNG Safety and Security Act would address these concerns by \nimproving FERC's siting process, requiring closer collaboration between \nFERC and the Coast Guard, and protecting States' permitting rights \nunder Federal and State law.\n  First, the bill would improve FERC's approval process for LNG \nterminals. Instead of reviewing proposed LNG projects on a first come-\nfirst served basis, the bill would require FERC to work with states and \nthe Coast Guard to pursue a regional approach to LNG terminal siting, \nincluding a review of offshore and remote sites and a determination of \nhow many LNG terminals a region needs. To address the substantial new \ncosts faced by state and local agencies responsible for security and \nsafety at the LNG terminal and along shipping routes, the bill would \nrequire the developer to create a cost-sharing plan describing direct \ncost reimbursements to these agencies. To make sure that FERC addresses \nall relevant safety and security issues in its Final Environmental \nImpact Statement (EIS) for an LNG terminal--and that the public has \naccess to this information before FERC makes a final decision--the bill \nrequires FERC to await the completion of an Incident Action Plan by the \nCoast Guard before issuing a Final EIS. It would require FERC to \nincorporate the non-security sensitive components of the Incident \nAction Plan into the Final EIS, including all safety and security \nresource requirements identified by the Coast Guard.\n  Second, to ensure that States continue to have the authority to \nestablish meaningful safety and security standards and to protect their \nfragile coastal environments, the bill requires FERC to comply with \nFederal laws that may be enforced by States, including the National \nHistoric Preservation Act, the Coastal Zone Management Act, the Clean \nWater Act, and the Clean Air Act; clarifies the right of a State to \nreview an application to site an LNG facility under any of these laws; \nand establishes that FERC has no authority to preempt a State \npermitting determination under federal or state law.\n  Third, to ensure that the Department of Transportation's safety \nstandards for LNG terminals truly encourage remote siting as Congress \nintended, the bill requires the Secretary of Transportation to issue \nnew regulations establishing standards to promote the remote siting of \nLNG terminals.\n  Finally, to protect coastal communities along LNG shipping routes, \nthe bill requires the Coast Guard to issue regulations establishing \nthermal and vapor exclusion zones for vessels transporting LNG, based \non existing DOT regulations for LNG terminals on land.\n  I again want to emphasize that I recognize LNG's important role in \nthe energy infrastructure of Rhode Island and the Nation, and I look \nforward to working with my colleagues to ensure reliable supplies of \nnatural gas to our homes and businesses without siting LNG import \nterminals in densely populated urban areas. I am confident that we can \nachieve this goal by requiring FERC and other federal agencies to \nexplore a broad list of alternatives--including offshore LNG \nfacilities--to bring more natural gas to our communities while \nminimizing the risk to our citizens.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 684\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title IV of the Employee Retirement Income \nSecurity Act of 1974 to require the Pension Benefit Guaranty \nCorporation, in the case of airline pilots who are required by \nregulation to retire at age 60, to compute the actuarial value of \nmonthly benefits in the form of a life annuity commencing at age 60; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, last year, the Pension Benefit Guaranty \nCorporation, PBGC, announced that it was moving to assume \nresponsibility for the pensions of more than 14,000 active and retired \npilots at United Airlines. Today, the Air Line Pilots Association, \nwhich represents 6,400 active United pilots, is trying to negotiate an \nalternative to such a takeover.\n  Mr. President, one of the reasons I am here today talking about \nUnited's pilots is that they are at risk of losing a significant amount \nof their pension, not just because the PBGC may be taking over their \npension, but because of the age that they are mandated to retire. While \nI believe that Congress needs to address the issue of underfunded \npension plans, I believe that it is also important for us to address an \ninequity with airline pilots that are mandated to retire at age 60.\n  The bill that I introduced in the 108th Congress, and am \nreintroducing today, will ensure the fair treatment of commercial \nairline pilot retirees. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation Pilots \nEquitable Treatment Act will lower the age requirement to receive the \nmaximum pension benefits allowed by Pension Benefit Guaranty \nCorporation to age 60 for pilots, who are mandated by the Federal \nAviation Administration, FAA, to retire before age 65.\n  Again, with the airline industry experiencing severe financial \ndistress, we need to enact this legislation to assist pilots whose \ncompanies have been or will be unable to continue their defined benefit \npension plans. My bill will slightly alter Title IV ofthe Employee \nRetirement Income Security Act of 1974 to require the Pension Benefit \nGuaranty Corporation to take into account the fact that pilots are \nrequired to retire at the age of 60, when calculating their benefits.\n  The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation was established to ensure \nthat workers with defined benefit pension plans are able to receive \nsome portion of their retirement income in cases where the employer \ndoes not have enough money to pay for all of the benefits owed. After \nthe employer proves to the PBGC that the business is financially unable \nto support the plan, the PBGC takes over the plan as a trustee and \nensures that the current and future retirees receive their pension \nbenefits within the legal limits. Four of the ten largest claims in \nPBGC's history have been for airline pension plans. Although airline \nemployees account for only two percent of participants historically \ncovered by the PBGC, they have constituted approximately 17 percent of \nclaims. For example, Eastern Airlines, Pan American, Trans World \nAirlines, and US Airways have terminated their pension plans and their \nretirees rely on the PBGC for their basic pension benefits.\n  The FAA requires commercial aviation pilots to retire when they reach \nthe age of 60. Pilots are therefore denied the maximum pension benefit \nadministered by the PBGC because they are required to retire before the \nage of 65. Herein lies the problem. Mr. President, if pilots want to \nwork beyond the age 60, they have to request a waiver from the FAA. It \nis my understanding that the FAA does not grant many of these waivers, \nand I have even heard from some pilots that the FAA has never granted \nthese waivers. Therefore, most of the pilots, if not all, do not \nreceive the maximum pension guarantee because they are forced to retire \nat age 60. \n  The maximum guaranteed pension at the age of 65 for plans that \nterminate in 2003 is $43,977.24. However, the maximum pension guarantee \nfor a retiree is decreased to $28,585.20 if a participant retires at \nthe age of 60. This significant reduction in benefits puts pilots in a \ndifficult position. With drastically reduced pensions and a prohibition \non reentering the piloting profession because of age, many pilots are \nsubjected to undue hardship. While it is my sincere hope that existing \nairlines will be able to maintain their pension programs and that the \nchange this bill makes will not be needed for any additional airline \npension programs, I believe that my legislation is necessary to ensure \nthat, at the minimum, airline pilots are not unfairly penalized for \ntheir employer's ability to maintain a pension plan. My legislation \nensures that pilots can obtain the maximum PBGC benefit without being \nunfairly penalized for having to retire at 60, if their pension plan is \nterminated.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I ask that the text of my \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 685\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Pension Benefit Guaranty \n     Corporation Pilots Equitable Treatment Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \ndesignating July 23, 2005, and July 26, 2006, as ``National Day of the \nAmerican Cowboy.''\n  Although cowboys are typically characterized as young, single men, \nthose of us who come from the West know that cowboys come in any age, \nrace, marital status, and gender. One 19th-century definition described \n``cowboy'' as ``anybody with guts and a horse.'' I personally believe \ntrying to define a cowboy is like trying to rope the wind, but you \ncertainly recognize one when you see them.\n  The Cowboy played a significant role in American history, \nspecifically in establishing the American West. After the Civil War, \nthere was an acute shortage of beef in the northern States. Western \nranchers were burdened with an abundance of cattle and no railroads on \nwhich to ship them to market. Realizing the immense profit to be made, \nthese cattlemen looked for the nearest railheads. Thus, began the era \nof the long cattle drive and the Cowboy.\n  As a result of these drives, cow towns sprung up at cattle shipping \npoints. These areas began to grow and thrive as western communities. \nEven after the cattle drive era passed, many cow towns remained solid \nbusiness and farming communities. Many remain so to this day.\n  The Cowboy continues to impact America through our economy and \nculture. Currently, there are approximately 800,000 ranchers conducting \nbusiness in every State. These folks contribute to the economic well \nbeing of nearly every county in the Nation. Every 1 dollar in cattle \nsales generates about 5 dollars in additional U.S. business activity. \nOutside of business, cowboys also contribute significantly to \nhumanitarian causes. The Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association's \nactivities alone raise millions of dollars for local and national \ncharities each year.\n  Culturally, Americans have always idolized cowboys and their way of \nlife. Most of us have fond memories of playing cowboys and outlaws, \nhearing stories of Buffalo Bill Cody's famous Wild West Show, or \nwatching cowboy icons such as Roy Rogers, Dale Evans, Gene Autry and \nJohn Wayne. Western publications, music, television shows, movies and \nsporting events remain as abundant and popular as ever. In fact, rodeo, \na sport which developed from the skills cowboys needed in their daily \nroutine, is the sixth most watched sport in America.\n  Our country looks to cowboys as role models because we admire their \nesteemed and enduring code of conduct. Gene Autry's Cowboy Code does a \nnice job of illustrating the way a cowboy chooses to live. Cowboys are \nhonest; they do not go back on their word. They have integrity and \ncourage in the face of danger. Cowboys respect others, defend those who \ncannot defend themselves and hold their families dear. They are good \nstewards of the land and all its creatures, possess a strong work \nethic, and are loyal to their country. The Cowboy lives his or her life \nin a way most cannot help but admire.\n  In my State, you do not have to go to the movie theater or a rodeo to \nsee a cowboy. You see them every day on the street, in the grocery \nstore, or driving into town from their ranches. Many of the Wyoming \ncowboys you see today are decedents of the cowboys that braved the \nfrontier before Wyoming was a State. Like those before them, these \nfolks still enjoy Wyoming's open spaces, know the satisfying feeling at \nthe end of a good, hard day at work, and appreciate a smile or tip of \nthe hat from a friendly neighbor. These westerners feel at home in \nWyoming because they know it was, is and always will be cowboy country.\n  I know my State would not be the same without the contributions of \ncowboys, past and present, and I am sure many of my colleagues feel the \nsame way. It is time for the American Cowboy to be recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/17/senate-section/article/S3067-2", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3067-S3069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 86--DESIGNATING AUGUST 16, 2005, AS ``NATIONAL \n                             AIRBORNE DAY''\n\n  Mr. HAGEL (for himself, Mr. Bingaman, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Burns, Mr. \nInouye, Mr. Johnson, Mrs. Dole, Mrs. Boxer, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. \nAlexander, Ms. Snowe, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Reid, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Gregg, \nMr. Burr, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Hatch, and Mr. Reed) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                               S.

of inserting \n     United States ground combat forces behind the battle line by \n     means of a parachute;\n       Whereas the United States experiment of airborne infantry \n     attack began on June 25, 1940, when the Army Parachute Test \n     Platoon was first authorized by the United States Department \n     of War, and was launched when 48 volunteers began training in \n     July of 1940;\n       Whereas the Parachute Test Platoon performed the first \n     official Army parachute jump on August 16, 1940;\n       Whereas the success of the Parachute Test Platoon in the \n

 Whereas the achievements of the airborne forces during \n     World War II provided a basis of evolution into a diversified \n     force of parachute and air assault units that, over the \n     years, have fought in Korea, Vietnam, Grenada, Panama, the \n     Persian Gulf Region, and Somalia, and have engaged in \n     peacekeeping operations in Lebanon, the Sinai Peninsula, the \n     Dominican Republic, Haiti, Bosnia, and Kosovo;\n       Whereas the modern-day airborne force that has evolved from \n     those World War II beginnings is an agile, powerful force \n     that, in large part, is composed of the 82nd Airborne \n     Division, the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), and the \n     75th Ranger Regiment which, together with other units, \n     comprise the quick reaction force of the Army's XVIII \n     Airborne Corps when not operating separately under a regional \n     combatant commander;\n       Whereas that modern-day airborne force also includes other

to observe ``National Airborne \n     Day'' with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, on behalf of Senators Bingaman, Cantwell, \nBurns, Inouye, Johnson, Dole, Boxer, Landrieu, Alexander, Snowe, \nClinton, Reid, Cochran, Burr, Isakson, Hatch and Reed, I am proud to \nsubmit this Senate Resolution which designates August 16, 2005 as \n``National Airborne Day.'' This date marks the 65th anniversary of the \nfirst official jump by the Army Parachute Test Platoon.\n  On June 25, 1940, the War Department authorized the Parachute Test \nPlatoon to experiment with the potential use of airborne troops. The \nParachute Test Platoon, which was composed of 48 volunteers, performed \nthe first official Army parachute jump on August 16, 1940.\n  The success of the Platoon led to the formation of a large and \nsuccessful airborne contingent that has served from World War II until \nthe present. The 11th, 13th, 17th, 82nd, and 101st Airborne Divisions \nand numerous other regimental and battalion size airborne units were \nalso organized following the success of the Parachute Test Platoon.\n  In the last 65 years, these airborne forces have performed in \nimportant military and peace-keeping operations all over the world, \nincluding Operation Iraqi Freedom, and it is only appropriate that we \ndesignate a day to salute the contributions they have made to our \nNation.\n  Through passage of ``National Airborne Day,'' the Senate will \nreaffirm our support for the members of the airborne community.\n  I would like to thank Airborne veterans and Airborne units for their \ntireless commitment to our Nation's defense and for the ideals of duty, \nhonor, country they embody. Airborne!\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \ndesignating April 2005, as Financial Literacy Month. As in previous \nyears, this is a bipartisan effort, and I thank several of my \ncolleagues for standing with me in advancing financial and economic \nliteracy for our citizens.\n  We must raise public awareness about the importance of financial \neducation in the U.S. and the serious consequences that may be \nassociated with a lack of understanding about personal finances. \nEfforts to combat financial illiteracy are taking place in our school \nsystems, across communities, in the business and banking sectors, and \nin Federal, State, and local government agencies, and I commend \neveryone in those areas for what they are doing.\n  For example, the School District of Philadelphia, PA, has implemented \na financial literacy and financial independence curriculum for all \ngrades. Hundreds of high school seniors in South Dakota will be getting \na course in credit cards before they head off to college or start their \nfirst job. The National Black Caucus of States Institute recently \nlaunched a new financial literacy campaign to promote savings within \nthe African American community in support of the expansion of financial \neducation for African Americans. In my home State, the Hawaii Council \non Economic Education continues to accomplish much in increasing the \nawareness of economic and financial literacy and pooling resources to \ncombat economic and financial illiteracy. Entities like the HCEE are \nbeing assisted in their efforts for K through 12 education by funding \nthrough the Excellence in Economic Education Act. At the Federal \nGovernment level, I continue to work closely with the Financial \nLiteracy and Education Commission, and Office of Financial Education in \nthe Department of the Treasury, as they continue to develop a national \nstrategy and work to improve and expand economic and financial literacy \ntools and resources to people in this country.\n  Furthermore in education, a 2004 survey of States by the National \nCouncil on Economic Education found that 49 States include economics, \nand 38 States include personal finance, in their elementary and \nsecondary education standards. This is an increase from 48 States and \n31 States, respectively, in 2002. In addition, a 2004 study by the \nJump$tart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy found an increase \nsince 1997 in high school seniors' scores on an exam about credit \ncards, retirement funds, insurance, and other personal finance basics. \nWhile progress needs to be recognized, much more needs to be done. \nAlthough the NCEE survey found that more States have standards in \nplace, only 26 States measure progress in economic education and 9 \nStates in personal finance education through testing. And for the \nJump$tart study, 65 percent of students still earned failing grades. \nThese figures do not bode well for the first National Assessment of \nEducational Progress in economics, which will have several questions \nbased in personal finance and will be conducted in 2006.\n  There are other signs that we can do even more in economic and \nfinancial literacy. Credit is readily and abundantly available in the \nform of many different products with a multitude of features. Marketing \ncampaigns by financial institutions, finance companies, and other \ncredit extending businesses are aggressively pursuing consumers and \nmarketing available credit as the answer to instant gratification, to \ntake that dream vacation, to buy that plasma television, or satisfy \nsome other indulgence, without fully understanding the financial \nramifications of their actions. These successful marketing initiatives \nhave led to unprecedented levels of borrowing. In addition,\n\n[[Page S3069]]\n\nmarketing campaigns are in place to promote the use of credit cards for \nsmall ticket, everyday items. Last year, Americans charged more than \n$35 billion in purchases of less than $10, up from $23.7 billion in \n2003. Credit or debit card sales of transactions of $5 or less grew \nfrom $10.8 billion in 2003 to $13.5 billion in 2004. According to the \nFederal Reserve, consumer debt levels have more than doubled in the \nlast 10 years. A U.S. Public Interest Research Group and Consumer \nFederation of America analysis of Federal Reserve data indicates that \nthe average household with debt carries approximately $10,000 to \n$12,000 in total revolving debt. Debt payments eat up more and more \ndisposable income, while certain members of the financial industry \nencourage the use of more and more debt. Through financial literacy \nefforts, consumers are becoming aware of the pitfalls associated with \nexcessive leverage and enter into debt relationships understanding the \nimpact of additional debt on their current and future financial \nposition. However, we must do more to enhance our efforts in this area.\n\n  Current statistics confirm that consumer debt remains more popular \nthan ever. The present level of consumer debt, coupled with the lack of \nconsumer savings, is indicative of the need to continue to support \nfinancial literacy in this country in an effort to get people to better \nunderstand the ramifications of their financial decisions. Part of the \nproblem is that many people do not understand fully how consumer debt \ncan overtake them. According to the Federal Reserve, as of year end \n2004, there was over $2.1 trillion in consumer credit and $10.1 \ntrillion in mortgage debt outstanding. Consumer credit increased 4.5 \npercent from its 2003 level. Of the total outstanding consumer debt, \napproximately $791 billion is revolving debt. Meanwhile, consumers paid \nout $24 billion in credit card fees last year, an 18 percent increase \nfrom 2003.\n  Compounding the debt pressures consumers are facing is the fact that \nthey have cashed out an estimated $480 billion in home equity during \nthe refinancing boom of 2001-2004. According to Freddie Mac, in hard-\ndollar terms, American homeowners converted $41 billion in real estate \nequity into spendable cash in the third quarter of 2004 alone. \nAccording to the Federal Reserve, as of June 30, 2004, Americans owed \n$766.2 billion on home equity loans and lines of credit, more than \ntwice as much as in 1998. Lenders have reduced settlement fees and \nstreamlined the closing process for loans dramatically, increasing the \nconsumer friendliness and speed at which loans are originated. The days \nof using your home as a nest egg for life changing events, such as job \nloss, medical emergencies or divorce, are over. The home has become a \ncatch all financing option, while increasing individual consumers' debt \nburdens. Meanwhile, consumer savings is at one of the lowest levels in \nhistory, 0.2 percent.\n  The combination of increasing debt burdens and marginal savings in \nAmerica has created a catalyst for bankruptcy. Through November 2004, \nnearly 1.9 million individuals filed for bankruptcy in the U.S., \nmodestly below last year's record level, but at a level that continues \nto merit concern. In considering that statistic, it is important to \nremember that this number consists of affected individuals. When you \nadd in non-filing spouses and children, the number of people impacted \nby bankruptcy can more than double. In reviewing these numbers, I \nbelieve it is readily apparent that increased financial literacy is \nneeded to offset unchecked consumer exuberance and aggressive marketing \npractices.\n\n  Beyond the statistics I just quoted, financial illiteracy is creating \nroadblocks to achieving part of the American dream, home ownership. \nFannie Mae's 2003 National Housing Survey found that a significant \nroadblock to home ownership is lacking accurate information about the \nhomebuying process. For the unhoused to become housed, a banking or \nfinancial relationship is part of the process. However, for the nation \nas a whole, approximately 10 percent of individual households remain \n``unbanked.'' The unbanked are those who forego a relationship with a \nfinancial institution. By not participating in the financial \nmainstream, the unbanked miss out on the convenience, security, \nefficiency, and wealth-building opportunities that financial \ninstitutions offer. I think we can all agree that wealth-building and \nsaving for the future are vital to the future economic success of the \nU.S. Extending financial literacy initiatives to all, from the \nunbanked, to students, to debt-burdened adults, is in all of our best \ninterests.\n  We must be committed to providing people of all ages with the \nfinancial skills and insight to help them achieve financial \nindependence and to make good choices when spending money and taking on \nadditional debt. Prevention remains key, and education lies at the \nheart of prevention. I think my colleagues would agree that as society \nmoves more and more toward an ``ownership society'' with the advent of \nhealth savings accounts and private accounts as currently proposed in \nthe President's Social Security reform plan, the need for improving the \nfinancial literacy of this country is now, and the delivery and content \nof these literacy and economic programs needs to broaden and expand to \nall Americans, no matter the age.\n  I encourage my colleagues in the Senate to join me in commemorating \nefforts to forward financial and economic literacy in this country by \nrecognizing April 2005 as Financial Literacy Month. But more than that, \nI hope that each of my colleagues becomes a champion of economic and \nfinancial literacy education so that all citizens in this country are \nprepared to contribute and participate in our evolving asset ownership \nsociety. I once again thank my colleagues from both sides of the aisle \nfor cosponsoring this resolution, and I urge the support of our other \ncolleagues as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/17/senate-section/article/S3069-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3069-S3070]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 87--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE \n                  RESUMPTION OF BEEF EXPORTS TO JAPAN\n\n  Mr. THUNE (for himself, Mr. Craig, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Bond, Mr. \nDomenici, Mr. Talent, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Johnson, and Mr. \nRoberts) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the \nCommittee on Finance:\n\n                               S.

European Community) imposed an arms embargo on the \n     People's Republic of China in response to the Government of \n     China's brutal repression of protestors calling for \n     democratic and political reform;\n       Whereas the European Council, in adopting that embargo, \n     ``strongly condemn[ed] the brutal repression taking place in \n     China'' and ``solemnly request[ed] the Chinese authorities to \n     put an end to the repressive actions against those who \n     legitimately claim their democratic rights'';\n       Whereas the poor human rights conditions that precipitated \n     the decisions of the United States and the European Union to \n     impose and maintain their respective embargoes have not \n     improved;\n       Whereas the Department of State 2004 Country Reports on \n     Human Rights Practices states that, during 2004, ``[t]he \n     [Chinese] Government's human rights record remained poor, and \n     the Government continued to commit numerous and serious \n     abuses'';\n       Whereas, according to the same Department of State report, \n     credible sources estimated that hundreds of persons remained \n     in prison in the People's Republic of China for their \n     activities during the June 1989 Tiananmen demonstrations;\n       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     continues to maintain that its crackdown on democracy \n     activists in Tiananmen Square was warranted and remains \n     unapologetic for its brutal actions, as demonstrated by that \n     Government's handling of the recent death of former Premier \n     and Communist Party General Secretary, Zhao Ziyang, who had \n     been under house arrest for 15 years because of his objection \n     to the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown;\n       Whereas, since December 2003, the European Parliament, the \n     legislative arm of the European Union, has rejected in five \n     separate resolutions the lifting of the European Union arms \n     embargo on the People's Republic of China because of \n     continuing human rights concerns in China;\n       Whereas the February 24, 2005, resolution passed by the \n     European Parliament stated that the Parliament ``believes \n     that unless and until there is a significant improvement in \n     the human rights situation in China, it would be wrong for \n     the EU to envisage any lifting [of] its embargo on arms sales \n     to China, imposed in 1989'' and that it ``requests that the \n     Commission formally oppose such a move when it is discussed \n     in the [European] Council'';\n       Whereas the governments of a number of European Union \n     member states have individually expressed concern about \n     lifting the European Union arms embargo on the People's \n     Republic of China, and several have passed resolutions of \n     opposition in their national parliaments;\n       Whereas the European Union Code of Conduct on Arms Exports, \n     as a non-binding set of principles, is insufficient to \n     control European arms exports to the People's Republic of \n     China;\n       Whereas public statements by some major defense firms in \n     Europe and other indicators suggest that such firms intend to \n     increase military sales to the People's Republic of China if \n     the European Union lifts its arms embargo on that country;\n       Whereas the Department of Defense fiscal year 2004 Annual \n     Report on the Military Power of the People's Republic of \n     China found that ``[e]fforts underway to lift the European \n     Union (EU) embargo on China will provide additional \n     opportunities to acquire specific technologies from Western \n     suppliers'';\n       Whereas the same Department of Defense report noted that \n     the military modernization and build-up of the People's \n     Republic of China is aimed at increasing the options of the \n     Government of the People's Republic of China to intimidate or \n     attack democratic Taiwan, as well as preventing or disrupting \n     third-party intervention, namely by the United States, in a \n     cross-strait military crisis;\n       Whereas the June 2004, report to Congress of the \n     congressionally-mandated, bipartisan United States-China \n     Economic and Security Review Commission concluded that \n     ``there has been a dramatic change in the military balance \n     between China and Taiwan,'' and that ``[i]n the past few \n     years, China has increasingly developed a quantitative and \n     qualitative advantage over Taiwan'';\n       Whereas the Taiwan Relations Act (22 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.) \n     codifies in United States law the basis for continued \n     relations between the United States and Taiwan, affirmed that \n     the decision of the United States to establish diplomatic \n     relations with the People's Republic of China was based on \n     the expectation that the future of Taiwan would be determined \n     by peaceful means;\n       Whereas the balance of power in the Taiwan Straits and, \n     specifically, the military capabilities of the People's \n     Republic of China, directly affect peace and security in the \n     East Asia and Pacific region;\n       Whereas the Foreign Minister of Japan, Nobutaka Machimura, \n     recently stated that Japan is opposed to the European Union \n     lifting its embargo against the People's Republic of China \n     and that ``[i]t is extremely worrying as this issue concerns \n     peace and security environments not only in Japan but also in \n     East Asia as a whole'';\n       Whereas the United States has numerous security interests \n     in the East Asia and Pacific region, and the United States \n     Armed Forces, which are deployed throughout the region, would \n     be adversely affected by any Chinese military aggression;\n       Whereas the lifting of the European Union arms embargo on \n     the People's Republic of China would increase the risk that \n     United States troops could face military equipment and \n     technology of Western or United States origin in a cross-\n     strait military conflict;\n       Whereas this risk would necessitate a reevaluation by the \n     United States Government of procedures for licensing arms and \n     dual-use exports to member states of the European Union in \n     order to attempt to prevent the reexport or retransfer of \n     United States exports from such countries to the People's \n     Republic of China;\n       Whereas the report of the United States-China Economic and \n     Security Review Commission on the Symposia on Transatlantic \n     Perspectives on Economic and Security Relations with China, \n     held in Brussels, Belgium and Prague, Czech Republic from \n     November 29, 2004, through December 3, 2004, recommended that \n     the United States Government continue to press the European \n     Union to maintain the arms embargo on the People's Republic \n     of China and strengthen its arms export control system, as \n     well as place limitations on United States public and private \n     sector defense cooperation with foreign firms that sell \n     sensitive military technology to China;\n       Whereas the lax export control practices of the People's \n     Republic of China and the continuing proliferation of \n     technology related to weapons of mass destruction and \n     ballistic missiles by state-sponsored entities in China \n     remain a serious concern of the Government of the United \n     States;\n       Whereas the People's Republic of China remains a primary \n     supplier of weapons to countries such as Burma and Sudan \n     where, according to the United States Commission on \n     International Religious Freedom, the military has played a \n     key role in the oppression of religious and ethnic \n     minorities;\n       Whereas the most recent Central Intelligence Agency \n     Unclassified Report to Congress on the Acquisition of \n     Technology Relating to Weapons of Mass Destruction and \n     Advanced Conventional Munitions, 1 July Through 31 December \n     2003, found that ``Chinese entities continued to work with \n     Pakistan and Iran on ballistic missile-related projects \n     during the second half of 2003,'' and that ``[d]uring 2003, \n     China remained a primary supplier of advanced conventional \n     weapons to Pakistan, Sudan, and Iran'';\n       Whereas, as recently as December 27, 2004, the Government \n     of the United States determined that seven entities or \n     persons in the People's Republic of China, including several \n     state-owned companies involved in China's military-industrial \n     complex, are subject to sanctions under the Iran \n     Nonproliferation Act of 2000 (Public Law 106-178; 50 U.S.C. \n     1701 note) for sales to Iran of prohibited equipment or \n     technology;\n       Whereas the authority under the Iran Nonproliferation Act \n     of 2000 to impose sanctions on Chinese persons or entities \n     was used 23 times in 2004; and\n       Whereas the assistance provided by these entities to Iran \n     works directly counter to the efforts of the United States \n     Government and several European governments to curb illicit \n     weapons activities in Iran: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) strongly supports the United States embargo on the \n     People's Republic of China;\n       (2) strongly urges the European Union to continue its ban \n     on all arms exports to the People's Republic of China;\n       (3) requests that the President raise United States \n     objections to the potential lifting of the European Union \n     arms embargo against the People's Republic of China in any \n     upcoming meetings with European officials;\n       (4) encourages the Government of the United States to make \n     clear in discussions with representatives of the national \n     governments of European Union member states that a lifting of \n     the European Union embargo on arms sales to the People's \n     Republic of China would potentially adversely affect \n     transatlantic defense cooperation, including future transfers \n     of United States military technology, services, and equipment \n     to European Union countries;\n       (5) urges the European Union--\n       (A) to strengthen, enforce, and maintain its arms embargo \n     on the People's Republic of China and in its Code of Conduct \n     on Arms Exports;\n       (B) to make its Code of Conduct on Arms Exports legally \n     binding and enforceable in all European Union member states;\n       (C) to more carefully regulate and monitor the end-use of \n     exports of sensitive military and dual-use technology; and\n       (D) to increase transparency in its arms and dual-use \n     export control regimes;\n       (6) deplores the ongoing human rights abuses in the \n     People's Republic of China; and\n       (7) urges the United States Government and the European \n     Union to cooperatively develop a common strategy to seek--\n       (A) improvement in the human rights conditions in the \n     People's Republic of China;\n\n[[Page S3072]]\n\n       (B) an end to the military build-up of the People's \n     Republic of China aimed at Taiwan;\n       (C) a permanent and verifiable end to the ongoing \n     proliferation by state and non-state owned entities and \n

    have played a role in the perpetration of violations of human \n     rights and of humanitarian law against members of ethnic and \n     religious minorities;\n       (D) improvement in the administration and enforcement of \n     export controls in the People's Republic of China; and\n       (E) an end to the ongoing proliferation by state and non-\n     state owned entities and

Con. Res. 21\n\n       Whereas on December 9. 2003, President George W. Bush \n     stated it is the policy of the United States to `oppose any \n     unilateral decision, by either China or Taiwan, to change the \n     status quo';\n       Whereas in the past few years, the Government of the United \n     States has urged both Taiwan and the People's Republic of \n     China to maintain restraint;\n       Whereas the National People's Congress of People's Republic \n     of China passed its anti-secession law on March 14, 2005, \n     which constitutes a unilateral change to the status quo in \n     the Taiwan Strait;\n       Whereas the passage of China's anti-secession law escalates \n     tensions between Taiwan and the People's Republic of China \n     and is an impediment to cross-strait dialogue;\n       Whereas the purpose of China's anti-secession law is to \n     create a legal framework for possible use of force against \n     Taiwan and mandates Chinese military action under certain \n     circumstances, including when `possibilities for a peaceful \n     reunification should be completely exhausted';\n       Whereas the Department of Defense's Report on the Military \n     Power of the People's Republic of China for Fiscal Year 2004 \n     documents that, as of 2003, the Government of the People's \n     Republic of China had deployed approximately 500 short-range \n     ballistic missiles against Taiwan;\n       Whereas the escalating arms buildup of missiles and other \n     offensive weapons by the People's Republic of China in areas \n     adjacent to the Taiwan Strait is a threat to the peace and \n     security of the Western Pacific area;\n       Whereas given the recent positive developments in cross-\n     strait relations, including the Lunar New Year charter \n     flights and new proposals for cross-strait exchanges, it is \n     particularly unfortunate that the National People's Congress \n     adopted this legislation;\n       Whereas since its enactment in 1979, the Taiwan Relations \n     Act (22 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.), which codified in law the basis \n     for continued commercial, cultural, and other relations \n     between the people of the United States and the people of \n     Taiwan, has been instrumental in maintaining peace, security, \n     and stability in the Taiwan Strait;\n       Whereas section 2(b)(2) of the Taiwan Relations Act \n     declares the `peace and stability in the area are in the \n     political, security, and economic interests of the United \n     States, and are matters of international concern' ;\n       Whereas, at the time the Taiwan Relations Act was enacted \n     into law, section 2(b)(3) of such Act made clear that the \n     United States decision to establish diplomatic relations with \n     the People's Republic of China rested upon the expectation \n     that the future of Taiwan would be determined by peaceful \n     means;\n       Whereas section 2(b)(4) of the Taiwan Relations Act \n     declares it the policy of the United States to consider any \n     effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than \n     peaceful means, including by boycotts or embargoes, a threat \n     to the peace and security of the Western Pacific area and of \n     grave concern to the United States;\n       Whereas section 2(b)(6) of the Taiwan Relations Act \n     declares it the policy of the United States `to maintain the \n     capacity of the United States to resist any resort to force \n     or other forms of coercion that would jeopardize the \n     security, or the social or economic system, of the people on \n     Taiwan' ; and\n       Whereas any attempt to determine Taiwan's future by other \n     than peaceful means and other than with the express consent \n     of the people of Taiwan would be considered of grave concern \n     to the United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, the House of Representatives \n     concurring, That it is the sense of the Congress that--\n       (1) the anti-secession law of the People's Republic of \n     China provides a legal justification for the use of force \n     against Taiwan, altering the status quo in the region, and \n     thus is of grave concern to the United States;\n       (2) the President of the United States should direct all \n     appropriate officials of the United States Government to \n     reflect the grave concern with which the United States views \n     the passage of China's anti-secession law in particular, and \n     the growing Chinese military threats to Taiwan in general, to \n     their counterpart officials in the Government of the People's \n     Republic of China;\n       (3) the Government of the United States should reaffirm its \n     policy that the future of Taiwan should be resolved by \n     peaceful means and with the consent of the people of Taiwan; \n     and\n       (4) the Government of the United States should continue to \n     encourage dialogue between Taiwan and the People's Republic \n     of China.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/17/senate-section/article/S3072-3", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3072-S3073]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 22--CONGRATULATING BODE MILLER FOR WINNING \n         THE 2004-2005 WORLD CUP OVERALL TITLE IN ALPINE SKIING\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU (for himself and Mr. Gregg) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution;

Mr. GREGG (for Mr. Frist) submitted an amendment to the \nconcurrent resolution S. Con. Res. 18, setting forth the congressional \nbudget for the United States Government for fiscal year 2006 and \nincluding the appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal years 2005 and \n2007 through 2010; as follows:\n\n       Beginning on page 58, strike line 11 and all that follows \n     through page 61, line 24, and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 504. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING MEDICAID \n                   RECONCILIATION LEGISLATION CONSISTENT WITH \n                   RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH \n                   AND HUMAN SERVICES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Medicaid program provides essential health care and \n     long-term care services to more than 50,000,000 low-income \n     children, pregnant women, parents, individuals with \n     disabilities, and senior citizens. It is a Federal guarantee \n     that ensures the most vulnerable will have access to needed \n     medical services.\n       (2) The Medicaid program will spend $189,000,000,000 in \n     fiscal year 2006.\n       (3) During the period from fiscal year 2006 through fiscal \n     year 2010, the Medicaid program will spend \n     $1,100,000,000,000.\n       (4) Over the same period, spending for the Medicaid program \n     will increase by 40 percent.\n       (5) Medicaid provides critical access to long-term care and \n     other services for the elderly and individuals living with \n     disabilities, and is the single largest provider of long-term \n     care services. Medicaid also pays for personal care and other \n     supportive services that are typically not provided by \n     private health insurance or Medicare, but are necessary to \n     enable individuals with spinal cord injuries, developmental \n     disabilities, neurological degenerative diseases, serious and \n     persistent mental illnesses, HIV/AIDS, and other chronic \n     conditions to remain in the community, to work, and to \n     maintain independence.\n       (6) Medicaid supplements the Medicare program for more than \n     6,000,000 low-income elderly or disabled Medicare \n     beneficiaries, assisting them with their Medicare premiums \n     and co-insurance, wrap-around benefits, and the costs of \n     nursing home care that Medicare does not cover. The Medicaid \n     program spent nearly $40,000,000,000 on uncovered Medicare \n     services in 2002.\n       (7) This resolution assumes $163,000,000 in spending to \n     extend Medicare cost-sharing under the Medicaid program for \n     the Medicare part B premium for qualifying individuals \n     through 2006.\n       (8) Medicaid provides health insurance for more than \\1/4\\ \n     of America's children and is the largest purchaser of \n     maternity care, paying for more than \\1/3\\ of all the births \n     in the United States each year. Medicaid also provides \n     critical access to care for children with disabilities, \n     covering more than 70 percent of poor children with \n     disabilities.\n       (9) More than 16,000,000 women depend on Medicaid for their \n     health care. Women comprise the majority of seniors (71 \n     percent) on Medicaid. Half of nonelderly women with permanent \n     mental or physical disabilities have health coverage through \n     Medicaid. Medicaid provides treatment for low-income women \n     diagnosed with breast or cervical cancer in every State.\n       (10) Medicaid is the Nation's largest source of payment for \n     mental health services, HIV/AIDS care, and care for children \n     with special needs. Much of this care is either not covered \n     by private insurance or limited in scope or duration. \n     Medicaid is also a critical source of funding for health care \n     for children in foster care and for health services in \n     schools.\n       (11) Medicaid funds help ensure access to care for all \n     Americans. Medicaid is the single largest source of revenue \n     for the Nation's safety net hospitals, health centers, and \n     nursing homes, and is critical to the ability of these \n     providers to adequately serve all Americans.\n       (12) Medicaid serves a major role in ensuring that the \n     number of Americans without health insurance, approximately \n     45,000,000 in 2003, is not substantially higher. The system \n     of Federal matching for State Medicaid expenditures ensures \n     that Federal funds will grow as State spending increases in \n     response to unmet needs, enabling Medicaid to help buffer the \n     drop in private coverage during recessions.

COPS provides resources that reflect our \n     national priority of terrorism prevention.'';\n       (4) on February 26, 2002, the Attorney General stated, \n     ``The COPS program has been a miraculous sort of success. \n     It's one of those things that Congress hopes will happen when \n     it sets up a program.'';\n       (5) the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Assistant \n     Director for the Office of Law Enforcement Coordination has \n     stated, ``The FBI fully understands that our success in the \n     fight against terrorism is directly related to the strength \n     of our relationship with our State and local partners.'';\n       (6) a 2003 study of the 44 largest metropolitan police \n     departments found that 27 of them have reduced force levels;\n       (7) shortages of officers and increased homeland security \n     duties has forced many local police agencies to rely on \n     overtime and abandon effective, preventative policing \n     practices. And, as a result police chiefs from around the \n     nation are reporting increased gang activity and other \n     troubling crime indicators;\n       (8) several studies have concluded that the implementation \n     of community policing as a law enforcement strategy is an \n     important factor in the reduction of crime in our \n     communities;\n       (9) In addition, experts at the Brookings Institute have \n     concluded that community policing programs are critical to \n     our success in the war against terrorism.\n       (10) the continuation and full funding of the COPS program \n     through fiscal year 2010 is\n\n[[Page S3078]]\n\n     supported by several major law enforcement organizations, \n     including--\n       (A) the International Association of Chiefs of Police;\n       (B) the International Brotherhood of Police Officers;\n       (C) the Fraternal Order of Police;\n       (D) the National Sheriffs' Association;\n       (E) the National Troopers Coalition;\n       (F) the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association;\n       (G) the National Association of Police Organizations;\n       (H) the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement \n     Executives;\n       (I) the Police Executive Research Forum; and\n       (J) the Major Cities Chiefs;\n       (11) Congress appropriated $928,912,000 for the COPS \n     program for fiscal year 2003, $756,283,000 for fiscal year \n     2004, and $499,364,000 for fiscal year 2005, and\n       (12) the President requested $117,781,000 for the COPS \n     program for fiscal year 2006, $381,583,000 less than the \n     amount appropriated for fiscal year 2004.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that an increase of \n     $1,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2006 for the Department of \n     Justice's community oriented policing program will be \n     provided without reduction and consistent with previous \n     appropriated and authorized levels.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 240.

SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING PREVENTIVE HEALTH \n                   CARE SERVICES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     included family planning in its published list of the Ten \n     Great Public Health Achievements in the 20th Century, the \n     United States still has one of the highest rates of \n     unintended pregnancies among industrialized nations.\n       (2) Increasing access to family planning services will \n     improve women's health and reduce the rates of unintended \n     pregnancy, abortion, and infection with sexually transmitted \n     infections.\n       (3) Contraceptive use saves public health dollars. Every \n     dollar spent on providing family planning services saves an \n     estimated $3 in expenditures for pregnancy-related and \n     newborn care for Medicaid alone.\n       (4) Each year, 3,000,000 pregnancies, nearly half of all \n     pregnancies, in the United States are unintended, and nearly \n     half of unintended pregnancies end in abortion.\n       (5) In 2002, 34,000,000 women--half of all women of \n     reproductive age were in need of contraceptive services and \n     supplies to help prevent unintended pregnancy, and half of \n     those were in need of public support for such care.\n       (6) The United States also has the highest rate of \n     infection with sexually transmitted infections of any \n     industrialized country. In 2003 there were approximately \n     19,000,000 new cases of sexually transmitted infections. \n     According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     (November 2004), these sexually transmitted infections impose \n     a tremendous economic burden with direct medical costs as \n     high as $15,500,000,000 per year.\n       (7) The child born from an unintended pregnancy is at \n     greater risk of low birth weight, dying in the first year of \n     life, being abused, and not receiving sufficient resources \n     for healthy development.\n       (8) Each year, services under title X of the Public Health \n     Service Act enable Americans to prevent approximately \n     1,000,000 unintended pregnancies, and one in three women of \n     reproductive age who obtains testing or treatment for \n     sexually transmitted infections does so at a title X-funded \n     clinic. In 2003, title X-funded clinics provided 2,800,000 \n     Pap tests, 5,100,000 sexually transmitted infection tests, \n     and 526,000 HIV tests.\n       (9) The increasing number of uninsured individuals, \n     stagnant funding, health care inflation, new and expensive \n     contraceptive technologies, and improved but expensive \n     screening and treatment for cervical cancer and sexually \n     transmitted infections, have diminished the ability of \n     clinics funded under title X of the Public Health Service Act \n     to adequately serve all those in need. Taking medical \n     inflation into account, funding for the program under such \n     title X declined by 59 percent between 1980 and 2004.\n       (10) Although employer-sponsored health plans have improved \n     coverage of contraceptive services and supplies, largely in \n     response to State contraceptive coverage laws, there is still \n     significant room for improvement. Half of the 45,000,000 \n     women of reproductive age currently live in the 29 States \n     without contraceptive coverage policies. These women may \n     still find the most effective forms of contraceptives beyond \n     their financial reach due to a lack of coverage.\n       (11) Including contraceptive coverage in private health \n     care plans saves employers money. Not covering contraceptives \n     in employee health plans costs employers 15 to 17 percent \n     more than providing such coverage.\n       (12) Approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration, \n     emergency contraception is a safe and effective way to \n     prevent unintended pregnancy after unprotected sex. It is \n     estimated that the use of emergency contraception could cut \n     the number of unintended pregnancies in half, thereby \n     reducing the need for abortion. New research confirms that \n     easier access to emergency contraceptives does not increase \n     sexual risk-taking or sexually transmitted infections.\n       (13) In 2000, 51,000 abortions were prevented by the use of \n     emergency contraception. Increased use of emergency \n     contraception accounted for up to 43 percent of the total \n     decline in abortions between 1994 and 2000.\n       (14) Thirteen percent of all teens give birth before age \n     20. Eighty-eight percent of births to teens age 17 or younger \n     were unintended. Twenty-four percent of Hispanic females gave \n     birth before the age of 20. (Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, December 2004).\n       (15) Children born to teen moms begin life with the odds \n     against them. They are less likely to be ready for \n     kindergarten, more likely to be of low-birth weight, 50 \n     percent more likely to repeat a grade, more likely to live in \n     poverty, and significantly more likely to be victims of abuse \n     and neglect.\n       (16) Research shows that a range of initiatives, including \n     sex education, youth development and service learning \n     programs, can encourage teens to behave responsibly by \n     delaying sexual activity and pregnancy.

SENSE OF THE SENATE SUPPORTING FUNDING FOR HIDTAS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) \n     program encompasses 28 strategic regions, 355 task forces, 53 \n     intelligence centers, 4,428 Federal personnel, and 8,459 \n     State and local personnel.\n       (2) The purposes of the HIDTA program  are to reduce drug \n     trafficking and drug production in designated areas in the \n     United States by--\n       (A) facilitating cooperation among Federal, State, and \n     local law enforcement agencies to share information and \n     implement coordinated enforcement activities;\n       (B) enhancing intelligence sharing among Federal, State, \n     and local law enforcement agencies;\n       (C) providing reliable intelligence to law enforcement \n     agencies needed to design effective enforcement strategies \n     and operations; and\n       (D) supporting coordinated law enforcement strategies which \n     maximize use of available resources to reduce the supply of \n     drugs in HIDTA designated areas.\n       (3) In 2004, HIDTA efforts resulted in disrupting or \n     dismantling over 509 international, 711 multi-State, and \n     1,110 local drug trafficking organizations.\n       (4) In 2004, HIDTA instructors trained 21,893 students in \n     cutting-edge practices to limit drug trafficking and \n     manufacturing within their areas.\n       (5) The HIDTAs are the only drug enforcement coalitions \n     that include equal partnership between Federal, State, and \n     local law enforcement leaders executing a regional approach \n     to achieving regional goals while pursuing a national \n     mission.\n       (6) The proposed budget of $100,000,000 for the HIDTA \n     program is inadequate to effectively maintain all of the \n     operations currently being supported.\n       (7) The proposed budget of $100,000,000 for the HIDTA \n     program would undermine the viability of this program and the \n     efforts of law enforcement around the country to combat \n     illegal drugs, particularly methamphetamine.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the spending level of budget function 750 \n     (Administration of Justice) is assumed to include \n     $227,000,000 for the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas; \n     and\n       (2) unless new legislation is enacted, it is assumed that \n     the HIDTA program will remain with the Office of National \n     Drug Control Policy, where Congress last authorized it to \n     reside.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 254.

however, 65 percent of students still \n     failed the exam;\n       Whereas a 2004 survey of States by the National Council on \n     Economic Education found that 49 States include economics, \n     and 38 States include personal finance, in their elementary \n     and secondary education standards, up from 48 States and 31 \n     States, respectively, in 2002;\n       Whereas personal financial management skills and life-long \n     habits develop during childhood;\n       Whereas personal financial education is essential to ensure \n     that individuals are prepared to manage money, credit, and \n     debt, and become responsible workers, heads of households, \n     investors, entrepreneurs, business leaders, and citizens; and\n       Whereas Congress found it important enough to ensure \n     coordination of Federal financial literacy efforts and \n     formulate a national strategy that it established the \n     Financial Literacy and Education Commission in 2003 and \n     designated the Office of Financial Education of the \n     Department of the Treasury to provide support for the \n     Commission: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates April 2005 as ``Financial Literacy Month'' \n     to raise public awareness about the importance of financial \n     education in the United States and the serious consequences \n     that may be associated with a lack of understanding about \n     personal finances; and\n       (2) calls on the Federal Government, States, localities, \n     schools, nonprofit organizations, businesses, and the people \n     of the United States to observe the month with appropriate \n     programs and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/17/senate-section/article/S3087-3", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3087-S3088]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         CONGRATULATING THE MONTANA FFA ON ITS 75TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, this year marks the 75th anniversary of the \nMontana FFA, an organization near and dear to my heart. As a former \nblue jacket myself, I know firsthand how much this organization \ncontributes to the development of leadership skills. A number of my \nstaff, including my chief of staff, are former Montana FFA officers. I \ncouldn't be prouder to introduce today, along with my colleague, \nSenator Baucus, a resolution congratulating the Montana FFA on its 75th \nanniversary.\n  With over 2,500 current members from 75 chapters, the Montana FFA \nprovides outstanding career and technical education to students across \nthe State. Over 40,000 Montanans have participated in FFA programs.\n  As this resolution states, the mission of the FFA, a federally \nchartered national organization, is to make a positive difference in \nthe lives of students by developing their potential for premier \nleadership, personal growth, and career success through agriculture \neducation. In Montana, that mission is achieved every day. Whether \nfocusing on public speaking skills, or developing business expertise, \nor learning about horticulture at the new greenhouse at Park High in \nLivingston, FFA ensures that our students are ready to embrace all the \nopportunities the future holds for them.\n  When the national FFA began in 1928, it did so with just 33 members. \nToday, it has blossomed into a powerful force for career education, \nwith over 475,000 members. Each year, the halls of Congress are filled \nwith the familiar blue-and-gold jackets, as FFA students from across \nthe nation come to share their thoughts and concerns with us.\n  The contributions of both the Montana FFA and the national FFA are \nnumerous, and I am pleased to have the opportunity to honor this great \norganization today. I know this program will continue to flourish and \noffer our youngsters skills in leadership, personal growth, and career \noptions in the agricultural community as it has done every day since \nits inception back in Kansas City.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 89) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                               S. Res. 89\n\n       Whereas in 2005, the Montana FFA, chartered in 1930, \n     celebrates its 75th anniversary as a premier student \n     development organization where members gain life and \n     leadership skills;\n       Whereas more than 40,000 Montanans have been FFA members;\n       Whereas Montana FFA alumni provide outstanding leadership \n     to agriculture and agribusiness at the local, State, and \n     Federal levels;\n       Whereas the Montana FFA Association is the largest career \n     and technical student organization in the State, with over \n     2,550 members from 75 chapters;\n       Whereas the mission of the FFA is to make a positive \n     difference in the lives of students by developing their \n     potential for premier leadership, personal growth, and career \n     success through agriculture education;\n       Whereas FFA is an integral component of agriculture \n     education in the public school system; and\n       Whereas the National FFA Organization is a federally-\n     chartered organization:\n       Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) congratulates the Montana FFA on its 75th anniversary; \n     and\n       (2) directs the Secretary of the Senate to transmit to the \n     Montana FFA an enrolled copy of this resolution for \n     appropriate display.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/17/senate-section/article/S3088-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3088]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HOLOCAUST COMMEMORATION WEEK\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Res. 90\n\n       Whereas the year 2005 marks the 60th anniversary of the end \n     of the Holocaust, which was ruthlessly and tragically carried \n     out by Nazi Germany under the leadership of Adolf Hitler and \n     his collaborators;\n       Whereas the Holocaust involved the murder of millions of \n     innocent Jewish men, women, and children along with millions \n     of others, and an enormity of suffering inflicted on the many \n     survivors through mistreatment, brutalization, violence, \n     torture, slave labor, involuntary medical experimentation, \n     death marches, and numerous other acts of cruelty that have \n     come to be known as ``genocide'' and ``crimes against \n     humanity''; and\n       Whereas in the past 60 years, the Holocaust has provided \n     the peoples of the world with an object lesson in the \n     importance of compassion, caring, and kindness; an awareness \n     of the dangers inherent in bigotry, racism, intolerance, and \n     prejudice; and an understanding of the importance of an \n     appreciation of the sensitivity to diversity: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week of May 1, 2005, as ``Holocaust \n     Commemoration Week'';\n       (2) commemorates the occasion of the 60th anniversary of \n     the end of World War II and the liberation of the \n     concentration camps; and\n       (3) encourages all Americans to commemorate the occasion \n     through reflection, acts of compassionate caring, and \n     learning about the terrible consequences and lessons of the \n     Holocaust.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/17/senate-section/article/S3088-2", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3088-S3090]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        EUROPEAN ARMS EMBARGO ON THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 91 submitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 91) urging the European Union to \n     maintain its arms export embargo on the People's Republic of \n     China.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to support an updated version \nof S. Res. 59, which I submitted on February 17 that calls on the \nEuropean Union to maintain its arms embargo against the People's \nRepublic of China.\n  I am pleased that all of the original cosponsors of S. Res. 59 are \njoining me in submitting this revised legislation. This resolution \nstates our strong support of the United States arms embargo on China \nand urges the European Union to strengthen, enforce, and maintain its \nembargo as well. It encourages the EU to examine its current arms \ncontrol policies, close any loopholes, and examine their trade with \nChina inn light of serious human rights concerns.\n  The human rights abuses at Tiananmen Square in 1989 led the United \nStates and the EU to impose this embargo. Now is not the time to lift \nit. If the EU proceeds down this road, there will be negative \nconsequences to our relationship--an outcome their officials claim they \ndo not want. This resolution expresses the Senate's view that \nmaintaining the embargo is in our mutual security interests.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table en bloc, and that any statements relating to the \nresolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 91) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                               S. Res. 91\n\n       Whereas, on June 4, 1989, the Communist Government of the \n     People's Republic of China ordered the People's Liberation \n     Army to carry out an unprovoked, brutal assault on thousands \n     of peaceful and unarmed demonstrators in Tiananmen Square, \n     resulting\n\n[[Page S3089]]\n\n     in hundreds of deaths and thousands of injuries;\n       Whereas, on June 5, 1989, President George H. W. Bush \n     condemned these actions of the Government of the People's \n     Republic of China, and the United States took several \n     concrete steps to respond to the military assault, including \n     suspending all exports of items on the United States \n     Munitions List to the People's Republic of China;\n       Whereas, on June 27, 1989, the European Union (then called \n     the European Community) imposed an arms embargo on the \n     People's Republic of China in response to the Government of \n     China's brutal repression of protestors calling for \n     democratic and political reform;\n       Whereas the European Council, in adopting that embargo, \n     ``strongly condemn[ed] the brutal repression taking place in \n     China'' and ``solemnly request[ed] the Chinese authorities. . \n     . to put an end to the repressive actions against those who \n     legitimately claim their democratic rights'';\n       Whereas the poor human rights conditions that precipitated \n     the decisions of the United States and the European Union to \n     impose and maintain their respective embargoes have not \n     improved;\n       Whereas the Department of State 2004 Country Reports on \n     Human Rights Practices states that, during 2004, ``[t]he \n     [Chinese] Government's human rights record remained poor, and \n     the Government continued to commit numerous and serious \n     abuses'';\n       Whereas, according to the same Department of State report, \n     credible sources estimated that hundreds of persons remained \n     in prison in the People's Republic of China for their \n     activities during the June 1989 Tiananmen demonstrations;\n       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     continues to maintain that its crackdown on democracy \n     activists in Tiananmen Square was warranted and remains \n     unapologetic for its brutal actions, as demonstrated by that \n     Government's handling of the recent death of former Premier \n     and Communist Party General Secretary, Zhao Ziyang, who had \n     been under house arrest for 15 years because of his objection \n     to the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown;\n       Whereas, since December 2003, the European Parliament, the \n     legislative arm of the European Union, has rejected in five \n     separate resolutions the lifting of the European Union arms \n     embargo on the People's Republic of China because of \n     continuing human rights concerns in China;\n       Whereas the February 24, 2005, resolution passed by the \n     European Parliament stated that the Parliament ``believes \n     that unless and until there is a significant improvement in \n     the human rights situation in China, it would be wrong for \n     the EU to envisage any lifting [of] its embargo on arms sales \n     to China, imposed in 1989'' and that it ``requests that the \n     Commission formally oppose such a move when it is discussed \n     in the [European] Council'';\n       Whereas the governments of a number of European Union \n     member states have individually expressed concern about \n     lifting the European Union arms embargo on the People's \n     Republic of China, and several have passed resolutions of \n     opposition in their national parliaments;\n       Whereas the European Union Code of Conduct on Arms Exports, \n     as a non-binding set of principles, is insufficient to \n     control European arms exports to the People's Republic of \n     China;\n       Whereas public statements by some major defense firms in \n     Europe and other indicators suggest that such firms intend to \n     increase military sales to the People's Republic of China if \n     the European Union lifts its arms embargo on that country;\n       Whereas the Department of Defense fiscal year 2004 Annual \n     Report on the Military Power of the People's Republic of \n     China found that ``[e]fforts underway to lift the European \n     Union (EU) embargo on China will provide additional \n     opportunities to acquire specific technologies from Western \n     suppliers'';\n       Whereas the same Department of Defense report noted that \n     the military modernization and build-up of the People's \n     Republic of China is aimed at increasing the options of the \n     Government of the People's Republic of China to intimidate or \n     attack democratic Taiwan, as well as preventing or disrupting \n     third-party intervention, namely by the United States, in a \n     cross-strait military crisis;\n       Whereas the June 2004, report to Congress of the \n     congressionally-mandated, bipartisan United States-China \n     Economic and Security Review Commission concluded that \n     ``there has been a dramatic change in the military balance \n     between China and Taiwan,'' and that ``[i]n the past few \n     years, China has increasingly developed a quantitative and \n     qualitative advantage over Taiwan'';\n       Whereas the Taiwan Relations Act (22 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.) \n     codifies in United States law the basis for continued \n     relations between the United States and Taiwan, affirmed that \n     the decision of the United States to establish diplomatic \n     relations with the People's Republic of China was based on \n     the expectation that the future of Taiwan would be determined \n     by peaceful means;\n       Whereas the balance of power in the Taiwan Straits and, \n     specifically, the military capabilities of the People's \n     Republic of China, directly affect peace and security in the \n     East Asia and Pacific region;\n       Whereas the Foreign Minister of Japan, Nobutaka Machimura, \n     recently stated that Japan is opposed to the European Union \n     lifting its embargo against the People's Republic of China \n     and that ``[i]t is extremely worrying as this issue concerns \n     peace and security environments not only in Japan but also in \n     East Asia as a whole'';\n       Whereas the United States has numerous security interests \n     in the East Asia and Pacific region, and the United States \n     Armed Forces, which are deployed throughout the region, would \n     be adversely affected by any Chinese military aggression;\n       Whereas the lifting of the European Union arms embargo on \n     the People's Republic of China would increase the risk that \n     United States troops could face military equipment and \n     technology of Western or United States origin in a cross-\n     strait military conflict;\n       Whereas this risk would necessitate a reevaluation by the \n     United States Government of procedures for licensing arms and \n     dual-use exports to member states of the European Union in \n     order to attempt to prevent the reexport or retransfer of \n     United States exports from such countries to the People's \n     Republic of China;\n       Whereas the report of the United States-China Economic and \n     Security Review Commission on the Symposia on Transatlantic \n     Perspectives on Economic and Security Relations with China, \n     held in Brussels, Belgium and Prague, Czech Republic from \n     November 29, 2004, through December 3, 2004, recommended that \n     the United States Government continue to press the European \n     Union to maintain the arms embargo on the People's Republic \n     of China and strengthen its arms export control system, as \n     well as place limitations on United States public and private \n     sector defense cooperation with foreign firms that sell \n     sensitive military technology to China;\n       Whereas the lax export control practices of the People's \n     Republic of China and the continuing proliferation of \n     technology related to weapons of mass destruction and \n     ballistic missiles by state-sponsored entities in China \n     remain a serious concern of the Government of the United \n     States;\n       Whereas the People's Republic of China remains a primary \n     supplier of weapons to countries such as Burma and Sudan \n     where, according to the United States Commission on \n     International Religious Freedom, the military has played a \n     key role in the oppression of religious and ethnic \n     minorities;\n       Whereas the most recent Central Intelligence Agency \n     Unclassified Report to Congress on the Acquisition of \n     Technology Relating to Weapons of Mass Destruction and \n     Advanced Conventional Munitions, 1 July Through 31 December \n     2003, found that ``Chinese entities continued to work with \n     Pakistan and Iran on ballistic missile-related projects \n     during the second half of 2003,'' and that ``[d]uring 2003, \n     China remained a primary supplier of advanced conventional \n     weapons to Pakistan, Sudan, and Iran'';\n       Whereas, as recently as December 27, 2004, the Government \n     of the United States determined that seven entities or \n     persons in the People's Republic of China, including several \n     state-owned companies involved in China's military-industrial \n     complex, are subject to sanctions under the Iran \n     Nonproliferation Act of 2000 (Public Law 106-178; 50 U.S.C. \n     1701 note) for sales to Iran of prohibited equipment or \n     technology;\n       Whereas the authority under the Iran Nonproliferation Act \n     of 2000 to impose sanctions on Chinese persons or entities \n     was used 23 times in 2004; and\n       Whereas the assistance provided by these entities to Iran \n     works directly counter to the efforts of the United States \n     Government and several European governments to curb illicit \n     weapons activities in Iran: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) strongly supports the United States embargo on the \n     People's Republic of China;\n       (2) strongly urges the European Union to continue its ban \n     on all arms exports to the People's Republic of China;\n       (3) requests that the President raise United States \n     objections to the potential lifting of the European Union \n     arms embargo against the People's Republic of China in any \n     upcoming meetings with European officials;\n       (4) encourages the Government of the United States to make \n     clear in discussions with representatives of the national \n     governments of European Union member states that a lifting of \n     the European Union embargo on arms sales to the People's \n     Republic of China would potentially adversely affect \n     transatlantic defense cooperation, including future transfers \n     of United States military technology, services, and equipment \n     to European Union countries;\n       (5) urges the European Union--\n       (A) to strengthen, enforce, and maintain its arms embargo \n     on the People's Republic of China and in its Code of Conduct \n     on Arms Exports;\n       (B) to make its Code of Conduct on Arms Exports legally \n     binding and enforceable in all European Union member states;\n       (C) to more

Mr. President, in closing tonight, I will take a few final \nmoments to speak on an issue that I opened with early this morning, \nabout 14 hours ago, an issue which Senators Martinez and Santorum were \non the floor speaking to about 45 minutes ago. It has to do with the \nTerri Schiavo case in Florida.\n  I close this evening speaking more as a physician than as a U.S. \nSenator and speak to my involvement as a physician and as a Senator and \nas leader in the Senate in what has been a fascinating course of events \nfor us over the last 48 hours, a saga which has not ended but one which \nwe took major steps toward tonight in seeing that this woman is not \nstarved to death tomorrow beginning at 1 o'clock, about 13 hours from \nnow.\n  When I first heard about the situation facing Terri Schiavo, I \nimmediately wanted to know more about the case from a medical \nstandpoint. I asked myself, just looking at the newspaper reports, is \nTerri clearly in this diagnosis called persistent vegetative state. I \nwas interested in it in part because it is a very difficult diagnosis \nto make and I have been in a situation such as this many, many times \nbefore as a transplant surgeon.\n  When we do heart transplants and lung transplants--and they are done \nroutinely and were done routinely at the transplant center that I \ndirected at Vanderbilt--in each and every case when you do a heart \ntransplant or a lung transplant or a heart-lung transplant, the \ntransplanted organs come from someone who is brain dead and death is \nclearly defined with a series of standardized clinical exams over a \nperiod of time, as well as diagnostic tests.\n  Even brain death is a difficult diagnosis to make, and short of brain \ndeath, there are stages of incapacitation that go from coma to this \npersistent vegetative state to a minimally conscious state. They are \ntough diagnoses to make. You can make brain death with certainty, but \nshort of that it is a difficult diagnosis and one that takes a series \nof evaluations over a period of time because of fluctuating \nconsciousness.\n  So I was a little bit surprised to hear a decision had been made to \nstarve to death a woman based on a clinical exam that took place over a \nvery short period of time by a neurologist who was called in to make \nthe diagnosis rather than over a longer period of time. It is almost \nunheard of. So that raised the first question in my mind.\n  I asked myself, does Terri clearly have no hope of being \nrehabilitated or improved in any way? If you are in a true persistent \nvegetative state, that may be the case. But, again, it is a very tough \ndiagnosis to make and only by putting forth that rehabilitative therapy \nand following over time do you know if somebody is going to improve. At \nleast from the reporting, that has not been the case.\n  Then I asked myself, because we have living wills now and we have \nwritten directives which are very commonplace now, but 10 years ago \nthey were not that common and, to be honest with you, a lot of 20- and \n30-year-olds do not think about their own mortality and do not offer \nthose written directives. They did not 10 years ago. Now they do with \nincreasing frequency. I encourage people to do that.\n  So, I asked, did they have a written directive? And the answer was \nno. And did she have a clear-cut oral directive? And the answer was no.\n  So my curiosity piqued as I asked to see all of the court affidavits. \nI received those court affidavits and had the opportunity to read \nthrough those over the last 48 hours. My curiosity was piqued even \nfurther because of what seemed to be unusual about the case, and so I \ncalled one of the neurologists who did evaluate her and evaluated her \nmore extensively than what at least was alleged other neurologists had. \nAnd he told me very directly that she is not in a persistent vegetative \nstate. I said, well, give me a spectrum from this neurologist who \nexamined her. To be fair, he examined her about 2 years ago and, to the \nbest of my knowledge, no neurologist has been able to examine her. I am \nnot positive about that, but that is what I have been told in recent \ntimes. But at that exam, clearly she was not in a persistent vegetative \nstate, and of 100 patients this neurologist would take care of, she was \nnot at the far end of being an extreme patient in terms of her \ndisability. He described it as if there were 100 patients, she might \nhave been the 70th but not the 80th or 90th or 100th.\n  So I was really curious that a neurologist who has spent time with \nher says she is not in a persistent vegetative state but they will \nbegin starving her to death tomorrow at 1 o'clock because of what \nanother neurologist said.\n  I met with her family and her son. Her son says she has a severe \ndisability. A lot of people have severe disabilities, such as cerebral \npalsy and receptive aphasia, but her brother said that she responds to \nher parents and to him. That is not somebody in persistent vegetative \nstate.\n  I then met in person with the chairman of the Judiciary Committee 2 \ndays ago in Florida to discuss the case. He told me that they had \nexhausted all options in the State of Florida to reverse what was going \nto be inevitable tomorrow, Friday, the 18th of March; and that is, that \nfeedings and hydration were going to stop, that everything had been \nexhausted.\n\n  He said the courts have been exhausted, and that all of the court \ndecisions and the court cases had not been based on the facts because \nthe facts were very limited and were the conclusions of one judge and \ntwo neurologists, and that was it, and that there were, in terms of the \naffidavits--I will get the exact number that I read--there were \nsomething like 34 affidavits from other doctors, who said that she \ncould be improved with rehabilitation.\n  So then it came to, what do you do? Here is the U.S. Senate that \nnormally does not and should not get involved in all of these private-\naction cases. It is not our primary responsibility here in the U.S. \nSenate. But with an exhaustion of a State legislature, an exhaustion of \nthe court system in a State--yet all of this is based on what one judge \nhad decided on what, at least initially, to me, looks like wrong data, \nincomplete data. But somebody is being condemned to death--somebody who \nis alive; there is no question she is alive--is being condemned to \ndeath.\n  It takes an action to pull out a feeding tube. It takes an action to \nstop feeding. The inaction of feeding becomes an action. And thus, as I \nstarted talking about it this morning, the question was, what do we do? \nBills had been put forth broadly on the floor, and Senator Martinez had \nvery effective legislation, but it had to do with the habeas corpus, a \nvery large issue that we have not had hearings on and debated.\n  So what we decided to do was to fashion a bill that was very narrow, \naimed\n\n[[Page S3091]]\n\nspecifically at this case that would say she is not going to be starved \nto death tomorrow, but let's go and collect more information, have \nneurologists come in and obtain a body of facts before such a decision \nwould be made.\n  That is what we have done. As Senator Martinez said, and Senator \nSantorum said, we are not there yet. We have three different tracks \ngoing on that will be going on over the course of tonight. In my \noffice, right now, letters are being written and being sent out, and we \nwill not give up, and we have not given up. We passed the bill here \ntonight. The House has a bill. And I am confident if we continue \nworking, and we are going to stay in session--we are not staying in \nsession tonight but we are going to stay in session until we complete \naction.\n  Let me just comment a little bit about the Terri Schiavo case because \nwhat I said is how we got involved. What I am about to say is a little \nbit more information than we have been able to talk about on the floor \ntoday because of the focus on the Budget Committee, although when we \nwere just off the floor in the cloakroom behind us and in my office, we \nhave been going nonstop on this all day long--all day long.\n  Terri Schiavo is right now in a Florida hospice. She is breathing on \nher own. So she does not have a ventilator keeping her lungs expanding. \nShe is breathing on her own. She is not a terminal case. She is, as I \nsaid, disabled. Under court order, this feeding tube was to be removed \ntomorrow, in about 14 hours from now. When her feeding tube is removed, \nshe does not receive food; she starves to death. She has no hydration \nand she becomes dehydrated, has cardiovascular collapse, her heart and \nlungs would work overtime, and, of course, she would die.\n  Her parents, Bob and Mary Schindler, have been fighting for over 10 \nyears to prevent her death. Imagine, if you and your spouse had a \ndaughter, and you said: Don't let her die. We will take care of her. We \nwill financially take care of her. How in the world can you have \nsomebody come in and remove a feeding tube? That is what they have been \nsaying for 10 years. They love her. They say that she responds to them. \nThey would welcome the chance--welcome the chance--to be her guardian.\n  As I understand it, Terri's husband will not divorce Terri and will \nnot allow her parents to take care of her. Terri's husband, who I have \nnot met, does have a girlfriend he lives with, and they have children \nof their own.\n  A single Florida judge ruled that Terri is in this persistent \nvegetative state. And this is the same judge who has denied new \ntesting, new examinations of Terri by independent and qualified medical \nprofessionals. They have not been allowed.\n  As I mentioned, the attorneys for Terri's parents have submitted 33 \naffidavits from doctors and other medical professionals, all of whom \nsay that Terri should be re-evaluated. About 15--I read through the \naffidavits--and about 14 or 15 of these affidavits are from board \ncertified neurologists. Some of these doctors, very specifically, say \nthey believe, on the data they had seen, that Terri could benefit from \ntherapy.\n  There have been many comments that her legal guardian, that is \nTerri's husband, has not--it ranges. It is either that he has not been \naggressive in rehabilitation, to other reports saying that he has \nthwarted rehabilitation since 1992. I can only report what I have read \nthere because I have not met him.\n\n  Persistent vegetative state, which is what the court has ruled, I say \nthat I question it, and I question it based on a review of the video \nfootage which I spent an hour or so looking at last night in my office \nhere in the Capitol. And that footage, to me, depicted something very \ndifferent than persistent vegetative state.\n  One of the classic textbooks we use in medicine today is called \n``Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine.'' And in the 16th \nedition, which was published just this year, 2005, on page 1625, it \nreads:\n\n     . . . the vegetative state signifies an awake but \n     unresponsive state. These patients have emerged from coma \n     after a period of days or weeks to an unresponsive state in \n     which the eyelids are open, giving the appearance of \n     wakefulness.\n\n  This is from ``Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine.''\n  This ``unresponsive state in which the eyelids are open''--I quote \nthat only because on the video footage, which is the actual exam by the \nneurologist, when the neurologist said, ``Look up,'' there is no \nquestion in the video that she actually looks up. That would not be an \n``unresponsive state in which the eyelids are open.''\n  Skipping on down to what the Harrison's textbook says about \n``vegetative state,'' I quote:\n\n       There are always accompanying signs that indicate extensive \n     damage in both cerebral hemisphere, e.g. decerebrate or \n     decorticate limb posturing and absent responses to visual \n     stimuli.\n\n  And then, let me just comment, because it says: ``absent responses to \nvisual stimuli.'' Once again, in the video footage--which you can \nactually see on the Web site today--she certainly seems to respond to \nvisual stimuli that the neurologist puts forth.\n  And lastly--I will stop quoting from the classic internal medicine \ntextbook--one other sentence:\n\n       In the closely related minimally conscious state the \n     patient may make intermittent rudimentary vocal or motor \n     responses.\n\n  I would simply ask, maybe she is not in this vegetative state and she \nis in this minimally conscious state, in which case the diagnosis upon \nwhich this whole case has been based would be incorrect.\n  Fifteen neurologists have signed affidavits that Terri should have \nadditional testing by unbiased, independent neurologists. I am told \nthat Terri never had an MRI or a PET scan of her head, and that \ndisturbs me only because it suggests she hasn't been fully evaluated by \ntoday's standards. You don't have to have an MRI or PET scan to make a \ndiagnosis of persistent vegetative state, but if you are going to allow \nsomebody to die, starve them to death, I would think you would want to \ncomplete a neurological exam. She has not had an MRI or a PET scan, \nwhich suggests she has not had a full neurological exam.\n  I should also note that the court sided with the testimony of Dr. \nRonald Cranford, who is an outspoken advocate of physician-assisted \nsuicide.\n  A 1996 British Medical Journal study conducted in England's Royal \nHospital for Neurodisability concluded there was a 43 percent error \nrate in the diagnosis of PVS. It takes a lot of time, as I mentioned \nearlier, to make this diagnosis with a very high error rate. If you are \ngoing to be causing somebody to die with purposeful action, like \nwithdrawal of the feeding tube, you are not going to want to make a \nmistake in terms of the diagnosis.\n  I mentioned that Terri's brother told me Terri laughs, smiles, and \ntries to speak. That doesn't sound like a women in a persistent \nvegetative state. So the Senate has acted tonight and the House of \nRepresentatives acted last night. The approaches are different, and \nover the course of tonight and tomorrow, I hope we can resolve those \ndifferences. It is clear to me that Congress has a responsibility, \nsince other aspects of government at the State level had failed to \naddress this issue, that we do have a responsibility given the \nuncertainties that I have outlined over the last few minutes.\n  Remember, she has family members--her parents and brother--who say \nthey love her, they will take care of her, they will be responsible for \nher, and they will support her. There seems to be insufficient \ninformation to conclude that Terry Schiavo is in a persistent \nvegetative state. Securing the facts, I believe, is the first and \nproper step at this juncture. Whoever spends time making the diagnosis \nwith Terri needs to spend enough time to make an appropriate diagnosis.\n  At this juncture, I don't see any justification in removing hydration \nand nutrition. Prudence and caution and respect for the dignity of life \nmust be the undergirding principles in this case.\n  I will close with an e-mail a friend sent me once they saw that we in \nthis body were involved in this case. It reads:\n\n       I know you are dealing with so many major issues, but I \n     believe this one threatens to send us down another shameful \n     path we may never recover from.\n       I don't think I ever had an occasion to tell you that I \n     have a severely brain damaged adult daughter that I cared for \n     in my home for 20 years. Sasha's functioning level is far \n     below Terri's, but she has been such a blessing in my life. \n     Dietrich Bonhoffer said, ``Not\n\n[[Page S3092]]\n\n     only do the weak need the strong, but the strong need the \n     weak.'' It's hard to explain that in a day and age where \n     physical perfection is so highly valued, but I know it to be \n     true.\n       Senator Frist, as you fight this battle today, hold fast. \n     If ever the weak needed a champion, it is now.\n       on behalf of my sweet Sasha . . .\n\n  Then the e-mail is signed.\n  I close tonight with those powerful words.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/17/senate-section/article/S3092-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3092]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR MONDAY, MARCH 21, 2005\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
