Mr. President, I will address my leader comments this \nmorning to the bill S. 256, the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and \nConsumer Protection Act of 2005. This legislation was passed with \nbipartisan support in the Judiciary Committee on the 17th. Over the \nlast 7 years, it has repeatedly passed this Senate and the House with \nbipartisan majorities. Yet we still do not have a bill as law. That is \nthe goal in this Congress.\n  Both sides of the aisle recognize the current system is calling out \nfor reform. Personal bankruptcies are skyrocketing and, at the same \ntime, wealthy debtors are walking away from debts that they have the \nability to repay. This abuse does not just hurt the creditor they owe, \nbut it hurts all who end up paying higher fees and higher prices as a \nresult of the system that is out of control.\n  It is fitting that a Senator from Tennessee is talking about this \nissue. As it happens, a city in my home State of Tennessee, Memphis, \nhas come to be known as the bankruptcy capital of America. Memphis \nranks No. 1 in personal bankruptcy filings if you compare Memphis to \n331 metropolitan areas. The total bankruptcy filing rate in Memphis in \n2004 was roughly 26 people for every 1,000 residents. That is well over \nthree times the national average.\n  Bankruptcy has become so common that it has lost the stigma it had \neven a short generation ago. Today it is just another method for \ngetting out of debt, a tool just to get out of debt. Some folks have \neven been known to plan their bankruptcy. They buy a house or they buy \na car or furniture or whatever else they need and then file a \nbankruptcy form. They figure they can get the big ticket items upfront, \nand for everything else they will use cash.\n  It is not altogether an accident that the Memphis bankruptcy system \nis what one attorney calls a ``well-oiled''\n\n[[Page S1814]]\n\nmachine. It was Memphis's very own U.S. Representative, Walter \nChandler, who established a chapter of bankruptcy law with the 1938 \nChandler Act. His motivation was simple. America was going through the \nGreat Depression. Times were tough for everyone. Debtors wanted to pay \nback what they owed, and local businesses needed to stay afloat. \nCongressman Chandler reformed the system to help those in dire \nfinancial trouble go to the courts and work out, appropriately, a \npayment plan.\n  Congress has passed, and the courts have upheld, Federal bankruptcy \nlaws for over 100 years. The Constitution gives Congress the express \npower to ``establish uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies \nthroughout the United States.''\n  And the Supreme Court has stated:\n\n       One of the primary purposes of the Bankruptcy Act is to \n     give debtors a new opportunity in life in a clear field for \n     future effort, unhampered by the pressure and discouragement \n     of preexisting debt.\n\n  Unfortunately, however, we veered away from this original positive, \nconstructive, good intent. Bankruptcy filings were low during the early \npart of the 20th century. They were generally tied to whatever the \nbusiness cycle might have been. In the past two decades, the number of \nbankruptcies have skyrocketed, actually accelerating during the \neconomic boom, speeding up during the boom of the 1980s and the 1990s. \nThe total number of bankruptcies more than doubled during the 1980s and \nthen doubled, once again, from 1990 to 2003.\n  For too many people, bankruptcy is no longer a last resort. It has \nbecome a first stop. Opportunistic debtors who have the means to repay \nuse the law to evade personal responsibility.\n  Unlike in Memphis, where filers typically use chapter 13, the \noverwhelming number of filers nationally--over 70 percent--opt for \nchapter 7 so they can walk away from their debt.\n  Where does all this leave us? It leaves us at an historic high of \nover 1.6 million filings per year. Personal bankruptcies outnumber \nbusiness bankruptcies by a multiple of more than 45 to 1. Among those \nfilings, we see an increasing number which are fraudulent. In fact, the \nFBI estimates at least 10 percent of all filings involve fraud of some \ntype. In most of the fraud cases that are identified, the filer in some \nway hides or pushes their assets over to the side. For example, a \ndebtor would file chapter 7, claiming to have no assets of any kind, \nbut they still drive a luxury sedan, may have a boat in the driveway, \nand even sport expensive jewelry and clothing.\n  The result is pretty clear. Every bill you pay, I pay, that the \nAmerican people pay includes what is a ``bankruptcy tax'' that amounts \nto about $400 a year for every man, woman, and child in this country--\nan unnecessary bankruptcy tax of $400 for every man, woman, and child \nin this country.\n  That is what we are addressing on the floor of the Senate this week. \nFor that bankruptcy tax, people say: How do you pay that tax? I was \nmeeting with some Tennesseans earlier this morning. They asked: What do \nyou mean? How do you pay that tax?\n  The tax is a hidden tax, but you pay it. It is in every electric \nbill, every phone bill, every mortgage payment you pay, every purchase \nof furniture, every car loan you obtain--$400 a year. Interest rates \nare higher, downpayment requirements are larger, grace periods become \nshorter, and late-payment penalties are astronomical, all because some \npeople are shirking their debt obligations. The people who are hurt \nmost by all of this are the low-income earners.\n  Say, for example, you have a dishwasher and the dishwasher breaks. \nThe owner would go to the neighborhood store. But because of the high \nrate of personal bankruptcies, they could not get credit. The store \nwould no longer give credit. The owner, who has this broken dishwasher, \ncannot afford to pay for it with cash but is denied that opportunity to \npurchase because credit cannot be issued. The store cannot make the \nsale. It is those low-income earners who are disproportionately \naffected by a system that is out of balance.\n  Without credit, saving up enough money to buy a couch or to even pay \nfor school clothes can become a real hardship. And high interest rates \ncan make using a credit card, as we all know, risky.\n  Ultimately, bankruptcy abuse by wealthy debtors disproportionately \nharms those who can least afford it. That is why the Bankruptcy Reform \nAct enjoys strong bipartisan support, strong support from both sides of \nthe aisle.\n  It establishes a means test that is based on a fair principle, a \nsimple principle, and that is this, that those who have the means \nshould repay their debts. A simple principle: Those who have the means \nshould repay their debts.\n  It specifically exempts anyone who earns less than the median income \nin their State. It also allows every consumer to show special \ncircumstances, if they exist, if they cannot handle a repayment plan. \nWe know the No. 1 reason people file for bankruptcy is because of an \nunexpected health emergency. If you look at all these filings, that \nends up being No. 1. Consequently, in the legislation that is on the \nfloor, we allow every filer to deduct 100 percent of their medical \ncosts.\n\n  We also know education is a big outlay for many families. Under \nbankruptcy reform, parents can deduct private school tuition to protect \ntheir children's educational opportunities.\n  The bill does much more. The bankruptcy bill strengthens protections \nfor child support and alimony payments. It protects patient privacy and \ncare during bankruptcy proceedings that involve health care facilities. \nIt protects consumers from deceptive credit practices that can lead to \nfinancial distress, and it protects the system that allows America to \nbe one of the most generous countries when it comes to bankruptcy.\n  We all know sometimes a person simply gets in over their head or they \nget socked with an unexpected setback. They are overwhelmed by the \nbills, and for every step forward there are two or three steps back. \nMost people in this difficult situation want to do the right thing. It \nis in their heart to do the right thing. They want to pay their \ndebtors, they want to meet their obligations, but they cannot. What \nthey need is a fresh start.\n  The legislation before us is thoughtful. It is well considered. It is \nfamily centered. It closes unfair loopholes so that the system and the \npeople it is designed to help can get that fresh start and get back on \ntrack.\n  I look forward to the debate today, which I know will be robust. We \nwill be debating amendments and voting on the amendments over the \ncourse of the day--indeed, over the week. I am hopeful that by working \ntogether in a bipartisan way on a bill we know will be to the benefit \nof the American people, we will make huge progress today, tomorrow, and \nthe next day, so we can soon have a bill on the floor that will receive \noverwhelming bipartisan support.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, the bankruptcy bill which will shortly be on \nthe floor is a very important piece of legislation. It embodies a \nprinciple I agree with: Those who have the means to repay their debts \nshould be required to do so. I believe--I am old-fashioned--that people \nwho borrow money should pay it back.\n  I supported the bill before, most recently in 2001. I hope to be able \nto support it again. But a lot has happened in the 4 years since the \nhearings were held on this bill in addition to the one hearing that was \nheld 2 or 3 weeks ago.\n\n[[Page S1815]]\n\nThere is new evidence--a lot of evidence--about who declares \nbankruptcy. Medical catastrophes: About half the people who file for \nbankruptcy file them because of medical emergencies. Also, extended \nmilitary duty has caused havoc for people who are in the Guard and \nReserve, in the State of Nevada especially.\n  Then, of course, we have the corporate bankruptcies of 2002 and 2003. \nWe still have one of the criminal trials going on with Enron today. The \nchief executive officer of that company is testifying for the second \nday. WorldCom was another corporate bankruptcy that created a lot of \nattention. I believe it should change how we look at bankruptcy.\n  There are things that have occurred since we last took this piece of \nlegislation up when it passed the Senate overwhelmingly, as I recall \nwith 82 votes. Again, there have been medical emergencies, extended \nmilitary duty, and corporate bankruptcies. These corporate bankruptcies \nhave left employees without pensions.\n\n  Finally, we need to address the ongoing problem of violence. People \nare trying to say this is an abortion amendment. It is not an abortion \namendment. It is about holding individuals who believe they are above \nthe law accountable for their actions when they break the law in a \nnumber of instances. I invite everyone to read the amendment. For \nexample, if people commit illegal acts in protest of a clinic that is \nengaged in lawful research on animals, then they need to be held \naccountable for their actions. They cannot simply discharge their debts \nthrough bankruptcy proceedings because they disagree with the law that \nthey violated. The same holds true for individuals terrorizing \nreproductive health care clinics and doctors by engaging in violence. \nAll we are saying is these people who commit these acts and break the \nlaw should not be able to discharge these debts in bankruptcy.\n  This amendment is not about abortion. It deals with a number of \ndifferent scenarios where individuals who have broken the law try to \ndischarge their debts through bankruptcy proceedings because they \ndisagree with the law. So I hope people will look at these amendments \non the merits of the amendments. People have tried to say this is an \nabortion amendment. It is not. I would hope people would look favorably \non some of the amendments we offer dealing with corporate bankruptcies, \ndealing with pensions, dealing with medical catastrophes, and extended \nmilitary duty.\n  We have the opportunity to have a good, sound, firm debate and send a \nbill to the House that takes into consideration the new matters that \nhave appeared since we last passed this bill.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise this morning to talk about the \ngreat leadership our President is providing in the area of Social \nSecurity.\n  When Social Security was created in 1935, the average lifespan of an \nAmerican was about 64, and 54 percent of the workers in our country \nwere expected to live to collect Social Security. So the system was \nsound and, of course, the actuarial table was sound.\n  So much has changed--all for the good--in our country. In fact, today \nour life expectancy is 79 plus for a woman and 74 plus for a man. Yet \nwe know that is going to get better. People are going to live even \nlonger than that and, furthermore, they are going to be healthy. They \nare going to be able to collect more than they invested in their Social \nSecurity.\n  Our President is looking at the facts. Our President is looking at \nthe statements from the previous administration, President Clinton, who \nsaid: There is a red flag here and we better look at Social Security if \nwe are going to start the process of determining what is the right \nthing to keep Social Security stable.\n  But it was before that that our President started seeing this looming \ncrisis on the horizon. Today we know from the testimony of the Chairman \nof the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, that in 2008, the baby boomers \nare going to start coming into the Social Security system. In 13 years, \n2018, the Government will begin for the first time to pay out more than \nit is collecting. That means we are going to start seeing more \nencroachment on the deficit. By 2042, the fact is there will be an \nabsolute bankruptcy.\n  By law today, what happens when that occurs, when bankruptcy is \ndeclared, benefits will automatically be cut without any further action \nof Congress or the President--drastic cuts, probably 25-percent cuts. \nSo if we are going to keep our promise to the people in the system \ntoday, to the people in the system 10 years from now, we are going to \nhave to take action to preserve those benefits in a fiscally \nresponsible way. If we are going to keep the promise to people who are \n20, 25, 30, 35, we are going to have to do something that is innovative \nand creative, something that has been tried in other countries, and it \nhas worked, and that is to allow our young people to set aside 2 or 3 \npercent of their 12 percent in a personal account that they can own \nthemselves and control with investments that would be certified \ninvestments. What would be certified is something like a 401(k) \noffering, something like a total market index and a total bond index or \na 50/50 total market/total bond index, something very conservative and \nproven through all the cycles of the stock market to be much better in \nreturn than anything someone could get in Social Security.\n  Young people overwhelmingly favor this option because they know they \nwill be able to build up and get bigger checks, with less government \nresponsibility, and they will be able to pass to their children what is \nleft over in their accounts when they die so their children will have a \nnest egg to grow.\n  This is something the President wants Congress to do, and I am going \nto help him because I believe it is the right thing to do for our \ncountry, for the young people coming into our system, to make sure they \nhave something better if they choose that option.\n  The important thing that has been missed in much of this debate is \nthat personal accounts are an option. If someone wants to stay in the \nsystem exactly as it is now, they have that option. But if they want to \ngo into the new system, which would allow them to take some part of \ntheir present tax and have a little more control and absolute \nownership, they have it as an option. People 55, 60 will probably not \ndo it, but a lot of people who are 50 and certainly people below 50 are \ngoing to look at that, and we will have a huge influx into that new \noption that will then allow a better future and an ownership that has \nnever been allowed before.\n  Our President is taking the lead. We have a duty, as Congress, \nRepublicans and Democrats together, to sit down with the President to \ndiscuss different plans. Maybe we can take something from this plan and \nsomething from that plan. Personally, I will not support raising taxes. \nI don't think we need to do it if we plan ahead. I will not support \nraising the limit on the salaries that are now taxed. That is \nunnecessary if we take steps now to start a transition process that \nwill eventually take more of the burden off Government and make the \nSocial Security system sound. But that is my opinion.\n\n  There are others on the other side of the aisle and on our side of \nthe aisle who may have a different view. Some may favor a part of what \nthe President\n\n[[Page S1816]]\n\nfavors. Some may not. The important thing is that we recognize our \nPresident's leadership, that he is not saying: I am going to walk away \nfrom this. He is saying: I am going to do the right thing. And he is \nasking Congress to sit down with him. We owe him that because he is \ntrying to do the right thing.\n  Secondly, it is irresponsible for any sitting Member of the Senate or \nthe House of Representatives not to come to the table. Certainly we \nhave disagreements, but all of us have the same goal. The goal is to \nsave Social Security for future generations and to do it in the least \nexpensive, most efficient, least obtrusive way we possibly can.\n  I am proud of the President's leadership. I am proud to support him \nin saying: Yes, we are going to do what is necessary now when it is \nless painful and less expensive.\n  I will now turn the rest of our time over to the distinguished \nSenator from Kansas. I note that he has just returned from Iraq. I \nthink he just returned last night. I appreciate so much his coming to \nthe Senate floor when I am sure he has jet lag. I know he has been \nthrough a trying time because like myself and others--we have been to \nIraq. We know that it is a tough trip but certainly something worth \ndoing for every sitting Member of Congress. You do learn so much about \nwhat our troops need, what they are facing. You want to pat them on the \nback and let them know how much America appreciates the efforts they \nare making.\n  I appreciate Senator Brownback being here this morning. I appreciate \nvery much his willingness to come to the floor and speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/01/senate-section/article/S1816-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Texas for her \nkind comments. I ran into a number of great troops from Texas, from Ft. \nHood, TX, and individuals from Texas who are doing a fabulous job, \nputting their lives on the line and showing the definition of courage \nand honor. Those guys go right into the face of the fire, and when the \nfire fight comes when the bullets are flying, they are running towards \nthe fire. It was really a beautiful modern-day story of courage under \nfire and of doing the right thing.\n  That right thing is now yielding, in the last week, multiparty \nelections in Egypt. Mubarak has not stood for elections in 25, 30 \nyears. It is going to do that. With a protest now taking place, the \nLebanese Government has withdrawn and is asking Syria to withdraw and \nto allow democracy to flourish in Lebanon. Saudi Arabia had flawed \nlocal elections, but they at least had somewhat of an election.\n  I met with officials in Iraq who are now discussing how to maintain a \nbalance of power and an open society. The policies in Iraq are yielding \nenormous fruit--still difficult, still very fragile, but those soldiers \nwho have put so much on the line are really changing the world. I thank \nmy colleague from Texas for her support in that effort. What we are \nseeing taking place in that region is amazing.\n  Our troops are in harm's way. We continue to see the number of \nimprovised explosive devices about the same as they have in the past, \nalthough our number of wounded troops has gone down in the last 2 weeks \nabout 40 percent, which is encouraging. That also means, apparently, \nthat more of the attacks are directed at the Iraqis. We saw yesterday \nthe horrific tragedy, over 100 Iraqis killed in a massive car bomb, \nthat clearly the insurgency, much of it commanded and controlled out of \nother countries--and Syria has complicity of allowing some of this \noperation to take place--has to be pressured against that. But we have \nto get at that command and control structure of the insurgency and \nbreak that to be able to stop some of this incredible carnage that is \ntaking place, people being killed in a country that just seeks to be \nfree, seeks to be an open, fair society. It is difficult. In the early \nstages of democracy there will be flaws and missteps, but it is really \nchanging the face of the region.\n\n  I met with Prime Minister Allawi. I met with the head of the Kurdish \ngroup, and Shias, Dr. Joffee. Each is talking about bringing in the \nSunnis, working together, creating an open society. I am concerned \nabout the issue of the role of Islam in the constitution. That is \nclearly one of the key issues being negotiated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/01/senate-section/article/S1816-2", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1816-S1818]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 SUDAN\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I want to use most of my time to show \nsome very graphic pictures of the face of genocide that is taking place \nin Darfur, Sudan. I wish I didn't need to do this. I wish the \ninternational community, particularly the United Nations, was acting so \nthat something would take place to prevent this manmade genocide. But \nthis genocide is occurring. It occurs while we are here today. It \noccurs in large numbers. Eric Reeves is probably the best documenter of \nSmith College. He estimates between 300,000 and 400,000 Darfurians have \nbeen killed in this genocide. I have been there. A number of Members \nhave been there. Villages are being burned out by the Arab militia \ncalled Jingaweit. The African Union has not been in power to put in a \nsufficient number of troops or with enough authority to act to be able \nto stop this horror.\n  What I am going to show on the floor are African Union monitors' \npictures taken of people who have been killed and brutalized in western \nSudan. They are graphic pictures. They are pictures of people who have \nbeen brutally killed in this genocide. My hope in showing this is that \npeople will see the face of genocide and action will occur, \nspecifically that the United Nations will take credible action. They \nhave not. They have not taken credible economic action, political \naction, and they certainly haven't taken anything in the way of \ncredible military action to stop this from occurring.\n  These pictures come courtesy of Nichol Kristof of the New York Times, \nwho wrote a February 23 article in which some of these pictures \nappeared titled ``The Secret Genocide Archive.'' In it, Kristof says: \n``These are just four pictures in a secret archive of thousands of \nphotos and reports that document the genocide currently underway in \nDarfur. The materials were gathered by African Union monitors, who are \nabout the only people able to travel widely in that part of the \nSudan.'' He goes on to say, ``The archive also includes an \nextraordinary document seized from a janjaweed official that apparently \noutlines genocidal policies. Dated last August, the document calls for \nthe `execution of all directives from the president of the republic' \nand is directed to regional commanders and security officials. `Change \nthe demography of Darfur and make it void of African tribes,' the \ndocument urges.'' I have yet to determine if that document has been \nverified, but understand that the State Department is analyzing it for \nauthenticity, and certainly the actions taking place in Darfur today \nreflect those words.\n\n  Finally, Mr. Kristof writes, ``I'm sorry for inflicting these \nhorrific photos on you.'' Mr. Kristof, with all due respect, you need \nnot apologize. It is the world community that needs to apologize for \ntheir complete inaction and indifference to this modern genocide.\n  Over 6 months ago the U.S. Congress declared genocide, followed \nshortly thereafter with a similar declaration by former Secretary of \nState Colin Powell. Failure to deem this genocide by the international \ncommunity, which would force action, has led to death beyond measure \nand the threat of famine and disease that could wipe out many more \nthousands. Eric Reeves of Smith College reports, ``evidence strongly \nsuggests that total mortality in the Darfur region of western Sudan now \nexceeds 400,000 human beings since the outbreak of sustained conflict \nin February 2003.'' The widely reported official number of deaths, \nrecorded only since last March, is 70,000 and nearly 2 million \ndisplaced.\n  To give you a frame of reference, the tsunami's death toll has been \nplaced at around 200,000. We are talking here about 400,000 deaths in a \nmanmade catastrophe--genocide--in Sudan.\n  I ask my colleagues, and particularly the international community and \nthe U.N.--and Kofi Annan in particular--how many more thousands of \ndeaths does it take?\n  Nichol Kristof provided me with additional pictures of the genocide \nin Sudan. I have these pictures for my colleagues to see, but due to \ntheir\n\n[[Page S1817]]\n\ngraphic nature, will not show all of them on television. I will \ndescribe each picture for my colleagues though, and would invite them \nto come and view these pictures in the cloakroom or in my office. The \nimages tell a dark story of tragedy that continues to strike the \nvillages of Darfur.\n  The first picture shows a child who had his face beaten in, \npresumably with a rifle butt, in a massacre in Hamada in January.\n  The next graphic photograph is of a man who was castrated and then \nshot in the head. This is a common fate of male prisoners taken captive \nby the janjaweed.\n  Skeletons litter the ground of Darfur near the sites of massacres. \nThe next photograph is from a massacre in Adwa in December, 2004. It's \ndifficult to determine if this individual was burned or if the corpse's \ncondition is a result of severe decay. It does appear as though this \nperson's last moments were spent fleeing the attack.\n  The next image is of a man who was one of 107 black Africans killed \nby Arabs in Hamada in the January massacre.\n  These photographs, taken by African Union officials on the ground in \nDarfur, were slipped to Nichol Kristof of the New York Times.\n  The next photograph is of a girl who was also killed in Hamada in \nJanuary. The killers do not discriminate between male or female, \nchildren or adults.\n  Another photo is of a more fortunate victim of the attack on Hamada \nin January. As she displays her injured arm, I can only help but think \nwhat kind of traumatic experience she endured and what psychological \nafter-effects she will have to deal with for her entire life.\n  Another young man did not make it out alive of the attack on Hamada. \nHis blue flip-flops lay nearby.\n  Finally, a skeleton, from an attack in Adwa in December, still has \nits wrists bound in this photo. The clothes were pulled down, \nsuggesting that the person had been sexually abused before being \nkilled. If it was a woman, she was likely raped; if it was a man, he \nwas likely castrated.\n  This is the face of genocide in the World today.\n  The African Union troops and monitors on the ground have seen these \natrocities with their own eyes. I am proud to say that the United \nStates has supported the African Union's peacekeeping efforts on \nvarious fronts. To date, the U.S. has contributed over $40 million to \nthe African Union. We have done so with hopes of securing an immediate \nend to the genocide and humanitarian crisis. Allowing the pictures and \ndocuments to remain buried away in a secret file will lend no immediate \nhelp to ending this crisis. However, we do believe that if these \ndocuments and photographs are made available to international actors \nincluding the United States, and other United Nations Security Council \nmember states, we would see immediate action that could end the crisis \nand foster accountability. I urge the leaders of the African Union to \nrelease these documents and photos immediately and for the Government \nof Sudan to allow complete unimpeded access to the region in \ndiscussion. The last public report the African Union posted on their \nwebsite was dated January 31, 2005. I have heard reports of rape and \npillage since that time.\n\n  The world community has watched as there have been numerous \nviolations of last year's cease-fire agreement, including attacks aimed \nat killing innocent civilians and destroying villages. Unfortunately, \naid groups have withdrawn from the region, and each day we run the risk \nof watching the current chaos spin out of control beyond imagination.\n  Despite numerous bills and resolutions passed in the House and the \nSenate and several U.N. Resolutions, the international community has \nfailed to act efficiently and effectively to end the crisis. On July \n30, 2004, United Nations Security Council passed a resolution in 1556 \ncalling on the government of Sudan to disarm the janjaweed militia and \nto provide unfettered access for humanitarian relief agencies. The \nresolution also imposed an arms embargo on ``nongovernmental entities \nand individuals'' in Darfur. Essentially, this arms embargo only \nembargoed the rebels and not the janjaweed who were receiving arms from \nthe government of Sudan.\n  In September, the Council passed Resolution 1564, calling on the \ngovernment of Sudan to cooperate with an expanded AU force and \nthreatened sanctions if the government failed to meet the Council's \ndemands. We have seen no sanctions.\n  Despite all of these actions, the Government of Sudan has not acted \nto end the violence against civilians, nor have they disarmed the \njanjaweed, or abided by cease-fire violations, including use of air \npower against civilians. In addition, reports indicate that the United \nNations was undermining the cease-fire through agreements they were \nmaking with the Government of Sudan, including authorizing police \nforces and security forces to patrol IDP areas without approval from \nthe AU Commission. Several weeks ago with my colleague Congressman \nFrank Wolf, I called on Kofi Annan to ``lead or leave.'' In other \nwords, he should lead the Security Council to pass a strong, meaningful \nresolution, or he should resign in protest at the complacency of the \nworld.\n  The Commission of Inquiry began its three-month mandate on October \n25, 2004. The report, which was leaked by the government of Sudan \ndespite agreements with the U.N., has clearly been jaded by inside \npolitics. I fear that we will continue to see lip-service without \nmeaningful action. Somehow, the report has spawned a political debate \nover where to try the criminals and not on how to effectively and \nimmediately provide security and end the crisis. We are simply buying \ntime for the murderers in Sudan.\n  The Report of the Commission of Inquiry makes clear the need for \nappropriate U.N. Security Council action. So it is in the best interest \nof all, especially the people of Darfur, to avoid protracted debate as \nto where the trial is taking place. The key is to stop the killing that \nis taking place in Sudan.\n  The deployment of African Union peacekeeping troops must be \naccelerated and expanded immediately. With only 2,000 troops currently \nin Darfur, and plans for 3,300 total, we must provide the appropriate \ntechnical assistance to see that the numbers needed to effectively \npatrol Darfur are on the ground immediately.\n  I believe that the United Nations should vote to immediately levy \nhefty and serious economic and diplomatic sanctions against the \ngovernment of Sudan, the government-sponsored janjaweed, and any \nbusinesses or companies complicit through their government connections. \nWe must insist upon an arms embargo against the Government of Sudan, \ntravel restrictions of Sudanese government officials, and a freeze on \nthe assets of companies controlled by the ruling party that do business \nabroad. Twenty months after the conflict in Darfur began, not one \npunitive measure has been imposed on the government of Sudan. It is \ntime to act.\n  As the United States, European Union, African Union, and others begin \ndeciding what steps are next, my colleague Senator Corzine and I have \ndecided to introduce a bill called the Darfur Accountability Act. This \nbill reiterates that the atrocities taking place in Darfur are \ngenocide, it calls for sanctions in the UN Security Council. It also \ncalls for accelerated assistance to the African Union force in Darfur, \nfor the establishment of a military no-fly zone in Darfur, for an \nextension of the multilateral arms embargo to include the Government of \nSudan, and it freezes the assets and property of criminals and denies \nvisas and entry to them while also calling for a multilateral effort to \ndo the same. In addition, it calls for a Special Presidential Envoy for \nSudan, and states that the United States supports accountability \nthrough a competent international court of justice, and requires that \nthe administration report to Congress on such efforts.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join us in moving this bill through \nCongress. We do not have days and weeks to spare when millions of lives \nare in jeopardy. We cannot grant the Government of Sudan and the \njanjaweed more time to execute the African tribes in Darfur. I look \nforward to working with Senator Corzine and others to see passage of \nthis bill.\n  I hope these pictures will serve as a reminder to my colleagues that \nwe must act to end this genocide. Members of this body have traveled to\n\n[[Page S1818]]\n\nRwanda and to Auschwitz to commemorate genocides of the past. We are \ndoing no victims of genocide a favor by turning a blind eye to the \natrocities in Sudan. Let these pictures and stories serve as a reminder \nof our responsibility to uphold dignity and human rights around the \nworld. We need to act now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that 30 minutes is \nallotted to the Democratic side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will indicate that if Senator Specter from the \nJudiciary Committee comes to the floor to lay down the bankruptcy bill, \nI will ask unanimous consent that he be given an opportunity and that \nour time be preserved in morning business, even though he is given that \nchance to lay down the bill.\n  Before my colleague from Kansas leaves--I know he is off to a \ncommittee meeting--I thank the Senator for his statement. It is \ncritically important that all of us on both sides of the aisle, \nDemocrat and Republican, make it clear every single day about this \nsenseless killing that is going on in the Darfur region of Sudan.\n  We had the gentleman who is the subject of ``Hotel Rwanda'' in \nChicago a week ago, Paul Rusesabagina. He saved 1,200 people in Rwanda \nfrom genocide. He did not come to brag; he came to beg that we do \nsomething about Sudan. He touched my heart. I said I will come back and \ndo everything I can, and every day I will get up and speak, if I have a \nchance, to remind people that we have to do something as a nation.\n  I thank the Senator from Kansas for his statement. It was very \neloquent. Although I may not agree on every single thing he said, I \ncertainly agree this is a matter of great urgency and immediacy. I \nthank him for his leadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/01/senate-section/article/S1818-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1818-S1820]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           BANKRUPTCY REFORM\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, when Senator Specter comes to the floor, \nsoon he will lay down this bill, S. 256. It is about 500 pages. It is a \nrecurring theme on the floor of the Senate. In the 9 years I have \nserved in the Senate, I think a bankruptcy bill has been on the floor \nalmost every year. I know this because when I first came to the Senate, \nto the Senate Judiciary Committee, I was the ranking Democrat on the \nsubcommittee that wrote the bill. Senator Chuck Grassley and I came \ntogether and crafted what I thought to be a very fair and balanced \nbill. We were approached by people who said there are a lot of abuses \nin bankruptcy. There are people filing for bankruptcy who can really \npay their debts. So let's try to tighten the process. Those who were \nirresponsible in their conduct, those who incurred debt and turned to \nthe bankruptcy court and tried to be absolved from their financial \nresponsibilities should be held accountable.\n  Senator Grassley and I agreed on that. We crafted a bill that was \nvery balanced. The bill passed the Senate 97 to 1. Sadly, it did not go \nforward. The House had a different idea. After the House got its hands \non it, it did not look anything like the bill we originally introduced. \nThe bill kept disappearing, reappearing, disappearing, and reappearing, \nand here it is again, S. 256. Unfortunately, this version of S. 256 is \na far cry from the original balanced approach. This bill is not \nbalanced.\n  Who wants this bill? That is the most important question to ask about \nany legislation that comes to the floor. The people who want this bill \nare the credit card companies and major financial institutions.\n  Why do they want it? Here is the circumstance. Imagine, if you will, \nthat you and your family are so deeply in debt that there is no way \nout. It could be because of medical bills you did not anticipate. It \nmight be because somebody lost a job and could not find one. It could \nbe because of a divorce or some other extraordinary situation. Maybe it \nis a personally owned family business that just fails.\n\n  Then you say: What am I going to do? I never dreamed I would reach \nthis point. The law says there is a way out. It is bankruptcy. The law \nputs you through some pretty tough requirements if you want to file for \nbankruptcy. You have to go into court and really bear your soul, tell \nthat judge and all of your creditors what you own, and they come in and \nsay: Here is what you owe. Now how much can we collect from what you \nown?\n  It is a tough process. For many people it is a sad and embarrassing \nprocess. What we find is that many people have no choice; they have \nreached a point where they cannot pay the debt. There is no way they \nwill be able to pay it off. They are being hammered by bill collectors \ncalling their homes at all hours of the night and day, harassing their \nchildren, harassing them, trying to get some money paid on their debt, \nand they finally say: I cannot take it anymore. I am going to file for \nbankruptcy. It happens. It happens in families that never dreamed it \nwould happen to them because of circumstances beyond their control.\n  What is this bankruptcy reform bill all about? The purpose of this \nbill is to make certain for many people that if you go into court to \nfile for bankruptcy, the slate will not be wiped clean. You will not \nwalk out of that bankruptcy court at the end of the day with no debt. \nYou will end up in a circumstance where you will carry many of these \ndebts to the grave. What kind of debts are we talking about? Credit \ncard debt, other debts you have incurred that will stay with you for a \nlifetime. No matter what you do under the law, you cannot escape them.\n  Naturally, the credit card industry and big banks want this bill. \nThey believe if they can hang on forever and will not be discharged in \nbankruptcy, they will get something back in the process. They believe \nthis bill will discourage people from filing bankruptcy, and people \nwill just labor under this debt they never paid off longer and longer. \nThat is why we are considering this bill. This bill is all about \ncreditors ending up with more money at the end of a bankruptcy.\n  It is interesting. We had one hearing on this 500-page bill. It has \nbeen 4 years since we had a hearing. We had one hearing. The hearing \nlasted 2 hours and 15 minutes on a 500-page bill. One would think the \nlead witness at that hearing would be someone from the credit card \nindustry. They want it. They are pushing this bill. Or some banking \ninstitution. But when you looked at this array of people at the table \nbefore the Senate Judiciary Committee, they were nowhere to be found. \nThey would not come in and sign a witness slip and testify in favor of \nthe bill they created. I am going to explain why they did not. But if \nyou looked in the back of the hearing room beyond the glare of the \nlights and the cameras, there they sat, row after row of lobbyists for \nthe credit card companies and banks. They may have created this little \nchild, sent it to the floor of the Senate, but they did not want to be \nassociated with it when it came to answering questions. Boy, that tells \nme a lot. If this is such an innocent bill and such a good bill, why is \nit that the major credit card companies would not come and testify and \nexplain why they wanted this bill? I think it speaks volumes.\n  They know what is going on. This is a bill which is going to hurt a \nlot of ordinary people, folks who, through no fault of their own, end \nup head over heels in debt and are desperate to start over. Credit card \ncompanies and banks want to make it tougher for them, and they will \nduring the course of offering this bill.\n  This bill will radically alter America's bankruptcy laws, not for the \nbetter. If it becomes law, millions of hard-working Americans who have \nbeen devastated financially, through no fault of their own, are going \nto end up in a new sort of debtor's prison from which they may never \nescape.\n  We are not talking about people who go to the casino and get wild \nabout their gambling and run their credit card or ATM card to the \nlimit. We are not talking about people who go on a shopping spree for \nluxury cars. We are talking about ordinary people facing the ordinary \ndemands of life who are swept away by debt they never anticipated. \nSadly, this bill makes no distinction between the irresponsible who are \nin debt and those who have done everything humanly possible and end up \nin debt.\n\n  We had one hearing on this bill on February 10, 2 hours and 15 \nminutes. As I looked around that room, I thought\n\n[[Page S1819]]\n\nto myself: There is a reason why the credit card companies will not \ncome forward and speak about this. The reasons are fairly obvious. The \nbill is not a fair bill.\n  I would have asked the credit card industry demanding this bill, how \nare you doing, how is your industry doing, making a profit? If they \nwould have answered me honestly, here is what they would have said: In \nthe year 2003, credit card companies in America enjoyed a $30 billion \nprofit, their highest profit in 15 years. It makes one wonder, does it \nnot, why we are rushing to pass a bill so that people who end up head \nover heels in credit card debt cannot get out from under it, even in \nthe bankruptcy court. These companies are not hurting. Why are we in \nsuch a hurry to give them a pass with this new expanded power to \nsqueeze a few last dollars out of families who have been devastated \nfinancially?\n  You know something else, the majority of people who go to bankruptcy \ncourt go there because of medical bills. That is right, medical bills. \nI will talk about that in a moment.\n  Supporters of this bill say you are either with them or with the bad \nguys, the chiselers, the cheaters, the grafters, the drifters, the \npeople they say are trying to game the system of bankruptcy by running \nup huge credit card debts with no intention of ever repaying.\n  The truth is, real life is not that black and white. There are people \nwho abuse the bankruptcy laws. I will tell you about a couple of them \nin a minute. They try to skip out of debts they can afford to pay and, \nfrom my point of view, the law ought to hold them responsible, no ifs, \nands, or butts.\n  I support a balanced bankruptcy bill, such as the one Senator \nGrassley and I put together several years ago. This bill is not \nbalanced. In this bill, in 500 pages, there is not one line, not one \nword curbing the abuse and deceptive practices of credit card companies \nand other lenders.\n  The supporters of this bill condemn people who file for bankruptcy \nand say they are morally deficient; they do not understand the moral \nresponsibility of paying their debts. What about the moral \nresponsibility of the credit card companies? They flood our mailboxes \nin America every year with 5 billion preapproved credit card offers, an \naverage of $350,000 in preapproved credit for every family in America. \nYou know it. Go home tonight and look in your mailbox. More likely than \nnot, there will be another solicitation for another credit card.\n  What about the credit card companies that continue to make high-\ninterest loans to families even when they are obviously teetering on \nthe edge of financial collapse? A couple weeks ago, a member of my \nstaff told me he had taken his family on a flight and signed his son up \nfor frequent flier miles, a pretty smart thing to do. Within a few \nweeks, his son received a solicitation for a credit card. I told him he \nought to be honored. It meant that Tyler, at the age of 3\\1/2\\ years, \nwas obviously on the flight path for success. The credit card industry \ncould not wait to give him a credit card at age 3\\1/2\\. And we joked \nabout it, until the weekend when I told the same story back in Illinois \nand a fellow said: I have him beat. My 9-month-old daughter was \nsolicited for a credit card.\n  Is that responsible? Is that responsible by the credit card industry? \nIs that moral, now that we are talking about moral values? Certainly no \n9-month-old or 3\\1/2\\-year-old is going to end up with a credit card. \nWhat about 16-year-olds, 17-year-olds, 18-year-olds, college students? \nThat is another issue altogether. Many of them, unprepared to deal with \ndebt, are trying to deal with credit cards.\n\n  Supporters of this bill rail against irresponsible consumers. What \nabout irresponsible lenders? In the entire bill, there is nothing that \ntells the credit card companies, if you are really worried about your \nlosses, exercise better judgment about to whom you lend money.\n  If I went home tonight to Illinois and told someone Congress is \nworking on a bankruptcy reform bill, they would say: Thank goodness; it \nis long overdue. It is time we went after those Enron cheaters. It is \nnatural they would say that. In the last few years, America has seen \nthis parade of corporate bankruptcy--Enron, WorldCom, Adelphia, United \nAirlines, USAir, TWA, LTV Steel, Kmart, Polaroid, Global Crossing, KB \nToys--the list goes on and on. Many of the companies that have gone \ninto bankruptcy are associated with scandal. In some cases, the CEOs, \nmany of whom are on trial, and their top officers were paid \nmultimillion-dollar bonuses even as the companies were being run into \nthe ground. Then the companies filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy \nprotection and asked a judge to throw out worker contracts and cancel \npension plans and health benefits, leaving thousands of families \ndevastated.\n  Wouldn't one think in a bankruptcy bill we would go after some of \nthese corporate bankrupt cheaters? Wouldn't one think we would go after \nthese CEOs and officers who got hundreds of millions of dollars from \nthese corporations they never paid back? Wouldn't one think we would \nhold them accountable because their irresponsible conduct meant the \ncorporation would go bankrupt, could not pay its stockholders, could \nnot pay its employees, could not pay its retirees? Wouldn't that be \nfair, and wouldn't it be timely? It would. You will not find one word \nabout it in this bill. That is corporations. We are talking about \nindividuals and families. We are going to make it tough on them. There \nis not a word here about the corporate crooks who are milking these \ncorporations at the expense of employees and retirees.\n  Want to talk about moral values for a couple minutes? I think exhibit \nA is some of these corporations, what their officers have done to poor \nunsuspecting people who worked a lifetime for that corporation, 25, 30, \n35 years, showed up to work every day, punching a clock even when they \nfelt sick, thinking: I am doing the right thing for my family. I am \nsaving money for my future, and thank goodness this corporate pension \nis going to be there for me. Then they retire, and what happens? After \nthese corporate bums milk the corporations dry, they end up canceling \nthe health care and pension of their employees.\n  Boy, sounds like the subject of a bill which Congress might one day \nconsider, but, no, it will not be today. We do not talk about those \npeople. We are talking about the woman who went in diagnosed with \nbreast cancer, who did not have health insurance and ended up with tens \nof thousands of dollars of medical bills and found out she could not \npay them and in desperation filed for bankruptcy. We are going after \nher. She is the one who is the target of this legislation, not the \ncorporate officers. We are not going after the insiders. We are going \nafter the ordinary people.\n  I will give a couple examples of how people game the bankruptcy \nsystem, examples that, frankly, when this bill is finished will not \neven be addressed. Bowie Kuhn, former baseball commissioner, abused the \nbankruptcy laws. He took advantage of a Florida law which says one's \nhome is exempt from bankruptcy. In other words, if one files bankruptcy \nthey can keep their home.\n  What did Mr. Kuhn do? He went to Florida and bought a multimillion \ndollar home with every penny he owned and then filed bankruptcy. So \neverything he ever had in life was protected. He knew where to go and \nwhat to do and he could qualify for this loan.\n  Burt Reynolds, the actor I used to laugh at in the movies--here is a \ngood laugh: He did the same thing. He bought himself a ranch to protect \nhis assets and then he filed for bankruptcy.\n  Does this bill go after those millionaires who use the bankruptcy \nlaws the way I described? Nope. Unfortunately, it does not. We are more \ninterested in that woman diagnosed with breast cancer, with medical \nbills she cannot pay.\n  The credit card companies are right on one point; we have seen an \nalarming increase in consumer debt and consumer bankruptcy since they \nfirst started pushing for this bill years ago. But we are not talking \nabout economic conditions that have created the household debt crisis \nin America, the millions of jobs that have been downsized and \noutsourced and sent overseas, restructured out of existence, the fact \nthat real wages are declining for workers across America. People are \nworking harder and falling further behind.\n  I see my colleague from the Judiciary Committee. If he is here on \nbehalf of Senator Specter to lay down the bill, I yield the floor \npursuant to my earlier unanimous consent request to\n\n[[Page S1820]]\n\nallow Senator Sessions to lay down the bill and make a statement if he \nwishes, and then I will reclaim my morning business time, if there is \nno objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu).

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 256, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 256) to amend title 11 of the United States \n     Code, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \ncommittee amendments be agreed to and be considered as original text \nfor the purposes of further amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am pleased we are able now to move \nforward with this bankruptcy bill. We have been at it 8 years. It has \npassed this Senate 3 different times, one time with over 90 votes, and \nthe last time was 83 to 15. It represents many years of steadfast \ndebate and discussion.\n  I see my colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin, has been very \nactive in all of this debate. As a matter of fact, at one time he was \nsponsoring the bill. He has continued to offer amendments that he \nbelieves improve it. Some have been accepted and made a part of the \nbill, some have not.\n  I think his evaluation of the legislation is far too negative in \nterms of the impact it would have on poor people. I believe it is going \nto benefit poor people. It is going to benefit families. It is going to \nbenefit mothers with children. Clearly, it will do that and it will \ncrack down on abuses.\n  Are there additional abuses we would like to deal with, one in \nparticular he just mentioned, the homestead exemption? I would like to \nhave gone further. It is in the constitution of quite a number of \nStates that homesteading is so much and Senators have dug in their \nheels and said this overrides the Florida constitution, the Kansas \nconstitution, the Texas constitution, or I cannot agree to do that on \nthe floor, I will fight this bill and object to it if anyone tries to \ndo that.\n  So we made some improvements in the abuses on homestead. I think that \nwas the right direction. I wish we could have gone further. Senator \nHerb Kohl and I would have offered the amendment that could have \nchanged it even more significantly, but perfect is not always \nachievable. I wish we could do more, but I think we made some real \nprogress. We delineate those steps that tighten it up and make it much \nmore difficult to abuse the homestead exemption. One has to actually \nlive in a house for 2 years in that State or they cannot take advantage \nof it. That is a step forward and will stop these people from buying a \nhouse on the eve of filing bankruptcy. So there are some good things.\n  With regard to health care, let us talk frankly about health care. \nYes, it is a factor in quite a number of bankruptcies. It is not the \nNo. 1 factor. In my view, over half the bankruptcies are clearly not \ndriven by health care, but a large number of them are impacted by \nhealth care bills.\n  The question is this: Will it change the situation for poor people \nwho have health care bills? Will they not be able to take advantage of \nbankruptcy and wipe those debts out today, just like they would? Well, \nif they make below the median income--and we think about 80 percent of \nthe filers in bankruptcy make below median income--the law is not going \nto change. They will still be able to wipe out any debts they have for \nmedical or other reasons.\n\n  Then what about if one has a continuing health care debt, and they \nmake above median income but they have a serious medical cost which is \nrecurring regularly, what can they do about that? They will have a \nharder time going into chapter 13 and paying back some portion of the \ndebts that they owe, people argue, and they are correct, but under this \nbill the bankruptcy judge can calculate that extra recurring health \ncare debt as part of the expenses and those people would still be able \nto file under chapter 7, wiping out all of their debts, if that is what \nthey chose to do. If they make above the median income and are able to \npay off some of their debts to their doctor and their hospital, why \nshouldn't they? You mean they have no obligation to pay a hospital that \nmay have spent a lot of money helping them get well or a physician who \ntook care of them and provided medical care to them? If they are making \n$80,000 a year and in bankruptcy under chapter 13 the judge finds that \na person could pay back 25 percent, why should they not pay 25 percent? \nThe judge will not order it unless he believes based on the person's \nincome level they have the ability to repay.\n  When a person in America undertakes an obligation to pay someone, \nthey ought to pay them, and in any country that is so. We are drifting \na bit to suggest there is no real obligation to pay the debts we incur. \nIf we get to that point, then we have eroded some very important \nfundamental moral principles about commerce in America.\n  I know Senator Durbin has an amendment he would like to offer, and I \nwill not delay him from doing that. I have some other things to say in \ngeneral about the bill, and I can say those later. I believe this is a \nrational bill. That is why it has such broad support. I believe this \nbill says plainly and clearly, if one can pay back some of their debts, \nthey ought to do so. There is no reason why somebody making $100,000 \nwho can pay back 20 percent of the debts he owes to the person who \nfixed his car or the doctor who helped him get well should not pay that \nback. Why should they wipe out all of those debts?\n  For the vast majority of people who file, they will be able to file \nunder chapter 7 and wipe out all of their debts if that is what they \nchoose.\n  I will say one thing further about chapter 13. That is the category \nof bankruptcy a person would be put into if they were required to pay \nsome of their debts back. Chapter 13 has been a part of bankruptcy law \nfor quite a long time. In my home State of Alabama, over half the \nbankruptcies are filed under chapter 13. People want to pay their \ndebts. They are behind in their debts. People are bugging them, the \nphones are ringing, lawsuits are being filed, and they are overwhelmed. \nThey cannot pay all of their debts at once and they file under the \nbankruptcy law. They say, I want to pay back a percentage of my debts, \nJudge, and if you will set out a schedule, if you will get these \ncreditors off my back and have them quit calling me, quit suing me, \nquit sending me demand letters, you set up the schedule, I will pay \nthis one so much a month and this one so much a month. That is a \nhealthy, good thing. We ought to do more of that.\n\n  In some States, under 5 percent of the debtors go into chapter 13. \nThat number ought to come up because a lot of those people in some of \nthese States that are so few in choosing chapter 13 should be in \nchapter 13 for their own self-interest.\n  One may ask, well, what about these people in Alabama? Are they \nmaking them go into chapter 13? No, they have chosen to go into chapter \n13 because they want to pay back a portion of their debts. They want to \nstop the lawsuits from going on. There are other advantages to it, such \nas being able to keep an automobile and the apartment or the house that \none owns in ways that one would otherwise not do.\n  There are some real advantages of going into chapter 13 rather than \nchapter 7. Many people choose it and in\n\n[[Page S1821]]\n\nsome areas of the country it is very much underutilized. This will \ncapture only about the top 20 percent. One expert at our committee \nhearing said about 7 of those will have extra continuing debts that \nwill take them out of it, so it will probably not be much over 10 \npercent of the filers who will be impacted. But some of those are the \nbiggest offenders. Some of those are the people with the highest \nincome. As a matter of fact, all of them will be people with incomes \nabove the median income. They ought to pay some of their debts back. \nThis bill will say that they must do that.\n  I think it will help us in many ways to have more integrity in the \nbankruptcy system. That is why we have such strong support for it. I am \nsure we will have a full and open debate as we go forward the rest of \nthis week. I hope we will have a vote, and I suspect we will have \nanother strong vote for final passage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, for clarity I would like to yield back all \ntime in morning business and go to the bill at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is on the bill now.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 16\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I will go to this amendment in a moment, \nand it is one I hope all Members will listen to carefully because it is \nan effort to protect our military from the provisions of this bill, \nparticularly in light of the\n\n[[Page S1822]]\n\nactivation of Guard and Reserve units across America and the financial \nhardship it has created. I will speak to that amendment after I address \nthis bill a few moments more.\n  I thank my colleague from Alabama. We see this issue differently, but \nthere are some things on which we agree. I think my colleague from \nAlabama is doing the right thing on the homestead exemption because if \nyou could walk into bankruptcy court having just bought a multimillion-\ndollar mansion in Florida and then say, I don't want to be held \nresponsible for my debts, and then the court says, Of course, your home \nyou can keep, your home is your castle, and that home is worth millions \nof dollars, you have just defrauded the system, as far as I am \nconcerned. Here you are with a multimillion-dollar home and these debts \nand you do not pay your debts, and the States of Florida, Texas, \nKansas, and a few others say whatever your home is worth, it is exempt.\n  It is a loophole in the law. If we are talking about just and right \nconduct in this situation, then clearly we would change the homestead \nlaw. I salute my colleague from Alabama because he has been a leader on \nthis issue. It is unfortunate that we have been unable to reach a \nbetter agreement as we go forward on this bill.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield for a brief question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield for a question without yielding the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I don't think the Senator would deny that this new \nbankruptcy reform bill makes it more difficult than current law to \nabuse the homestead exemption.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes. I would not.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. We didn't go as far as we would like to go, but we did \nmake some progress.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I think the Senator from Alabama is correct. The bill \nmakes an improvement, but it doesn't reflect the combined wisdom of the \nSenator from Wisconsin and the Senator from Alabama, an amendment I was \nmore than happy to support.\n  So here is this bankruptcy bill, and we are talking about ordinary \nAmericans going into bankruptcy court. We did a survey. We took a look \nat 1,900 bankruptcies across the United States and said: What brought \nyou to court? Why did you finally have to file for bankruptcy?\n  More than half of them said medical bills. Three-fourths of the \npeople who filed for bankruptcy because the medical bills had swamped \nthem, three-fourths of those people had health insurance when they were \ndiagnosed but they didn't have enough. It did not cover enough. Or they \nlost their job and then they couldn't keep up with it.\n  Is there one of us--I guess there are some, but is there one of us \nwho believes that we are invulnerable when it comes to medical debt? \nYou know better. You go to the doctor's office thinking everything is \njust fine and you are diagnosed with a serious illness which results in \nsurgeries, chemotherapy, and long hospital stays. Who among us can say, \nI'll just write a check; I will cover the difference in my health \ninsurance? Not many. Maybe a handful of people but not many.\n  So what happens? You go to the hospital. You get treated. When all is \nsaid and done you try to get well and go back to work, and there is \nthis huge shadow over your life. They call and they say: We want you to \npay.\n  You pay some, but you can't pay enough and the next thing you know \nyou are consumed with paying this debt, but you just can't do it; it is \nway beyond your means. What do you do? You do what you can legally do \nin America today. You go to a court and say: I have to file bankruptcy. \nI don't have enough assets. I will never be able to pay off this debt.\n  The court may decide you will never be able to pay off this debt. If \nthey think you can, they may put you on a schedule to make certain \npayments for a period of time. But say you are a waitress at a diner. \nYou went through breast cancer, surgery, and treatment. You have \n$50,000 in debt, and what are your assets, $20,000? This will never \nwork. You will never get out from under this debt so you can file for \nbankruptcy. You can clean the slate. You can start over.\n  That is the law. It is embarrassing. People don't like to go through \nit, but they are forced into it.\n  What this bill says, for those people who get in those circumstances, \nis we are going to make it tougher for you. Let me give you one little \nillustration of how they make it tougher.\n  Imagine you have this huge medical debt hanging over your head. The \ncreditors are not only calling you at home, they are calling your kids \nat home. The kids are crying, saying: How many more phone calls do we \nhave to take, Mom?\n  You get to go to bankruptcy court, but you just discovered something. \nYou don't have enough money on hand. You have barely enough to get from \npaycheck to paycheck, and the attorney says: I will represent you, but \nthere is a $209 filing fee to go into bankruptcy court, and I am going \nto need at least $500 to start this proceeding as your attorney.\n  What am I going to do? I have a credit card. I am going to go ahead \nand take cash out of my credit card to pay the filing fee and to get \n$500 for the lawyer so I can go to court. If I do that within 70 days \nof filing bankruptcy, they declare this as a fraudulent transaction \nthat cannot be discharged in bankruptcy. That credit card debt for \n$740-plus within 70 days of filing is with me forever. The credit card \ncompany has me forever until I pay it off.\n  Some people will say: We have to hold these people to a high moral \nstandard: Pay back your debts, be responsible.\n  I agree with that. But the law has said for decades that there are \nsome people who can't do that. They reach a point where they cannot \nphysically do it. They are not making enough money and they never will. \nSo you know what I did in the Judiciary Committee? I said to my \ncolleagues in the Judiciary Committee, if this is about your moral \nresponsibilities, let's talk about some of the corporate CEOs that we \nhave heard so much about recently and their moral responsibilities. I \nused as an illustration Kenneth Lay, CEO of Enron. Mr. Lay took $81 \nmillion in loan advances from Enron before the company declared \nbankruptcy. Do you remember what happened when it declared bankruptcy? \nNot only did the shareholders lose, the employees lost, the retirees at \nEnron lost, and retirees across America who had investments in Enron \nlost, too.\n  So I said to my friends on the Judiciary Committee: If we are going \nto hold this woman with her medical bills, who just took a cash advance \nof $740, to high moral standards, shouldn't we hold Mr. Lay to high \nmoral standards? Shouldn't we look back and see what his corporate \nactivity was?\n  They said: No. We are just interested in the woman with breast \ncancer. We don't want to talk about Kenneth Lay.\n  How about Dennis Koslowski, Tyco chief executive? Do you remember his \nsituation? He had Tyco pay for a $30,000 shower curtain; $30,000 paid \nby the corporation, and he took a total of $135 million out of the \ncorporation in loans and company payments for his personal use and then \nwent right into bankruptcy. I said to my friends on the Judiciary \nCommittee: How about that? Here is a situation, this corporate \nexecutive fleeced his company, pushed them into bankruptcy, hurting \nmillions of people, shouldn't we look back and hold him accountable?\n  No, we are not interested in Dennis Koslowski, nor WorldCom CEO \nBernie Ebbers, who took $408 million. We are interested in the woman, \nsingle mother with two kids, who is a waitress, who can't pay her bills \nfor breast cancer. That is who we are interested in.\n  That tells you what this bill is all about. This bill is all about \nthe bankruptcies of ordinary Americans, ordinary Americans who are \nseeing their jobs outsourced, ordinary Americans who are seeing their \nhealth insurance downsized if they are lucky enough to have it, \ndownsized every year, ordinary Americans who have seen their real wages \ndecline, ordinary Americans who are not even being paid a minimum wage \nthat reflects the cost of getting by in America, ordinary workers who \nare losing overtime pay because this administration is restricting the \nrules for eligibility on overtime. These are the people we are after. \nWe are not after those corporate CEOs. We will save them for another \nday. Right. Don't hold your breath.\n  Isn't it interesting at a time when health care in America is so hard \nto come by and so expensive, when the Government is talking about \ncutting\n\n[[Page S1823]]\n\nback on Medicaid, when we have no proposals to help people with their \nhealth care insurance, when we know it is driving people deeper and \ndeeper into debt and more vulnerability, that we come up with a bill \nthat is going to make it tougher for those who cannot pay their medical \nbills? It tells you about this Congress and its priorities.\n  This is our second bill. This is our second highest priority in this \nsession: Do something about that woman with breast cancer. She is going \nto that bankruptcy court, and it is not morally right.\n  The credit card industry is pushing this bill big time. I told you \nearlier in the year 2003 the credit card industry had $30 billion in \nprofit. They don't acknowledge the obvious. If there are abuses in the \nbankruptcy system there are sections to cover it; 707(b) allows the \nbankruptcy court to deal with substantial abuses of the rules. That is \nalready in the law. If a bankruptcy judge suspects a person is going to \nwalk on the debts he can pay, the judge orders a trustee to \ninvestigate, and if the trustee says the person is hiding assets, the \njudge can tell the person: I will not discharge your debts.\n  That is already in the law, and that is the way it should be.\n  Last year, they investigated over 3,000 cases where they suspected \nsomebody was cheating the bankruptcy system, and it ordered the \npetitioners to pay their debts in over 95 percent of them.\n  The system is working. The credit card companies don't need new laws \nto catch deadbeats. The credit card companies want this law so they can \nsqueeze every last dollar out of decent, hard-working, play-by-the-\nrules people who have already been devastated economically by traumatic \nevents such as job loss, divorce, and, increasingly, medical problems.\n  We had a hearing on this bill: 2 hours and 15 minutes. Senator Hatch \nsaid, at one point, if this hearing went any longer, it would have cost \nhim his sanity. I won't comment on that. But I think we could have \ntaken a few more minutes on this bill, even invited or subpoenaed the \ncredit card companies to come up and explain why they need this so \ndesperately.\n  I think we understand what is going on here. The Harvard law and \nmedical schools did a study, the first indepth study of the medical \ncauses of bankruptcy. It is an indepth examination of the records in \n1,900 bankruptcy cases filed in five different bankruptcy courts across \nAmerica, including one in Illinois. It showed that half of the \nbankruptcies in this country are because of high medical bills.\n  Listen to these statistics. Two million Americans each year are \ndriven into bankruptcy by medical debt. Three-quarters of them had \nhealth insurance when they first got sick. Most of them lost their \ninsurance when they got fired because they were too sick to work \nanymore, or they were bankrupted by out-of-pocket expenses that \npolicies didn't cover. Are these morally flawed people? Are these \nirresponsible people who got sick? They are good people who had the \nmisfortune of illness.\n  Harvard law professor Elizabeth Warren, one of the authors of the \nstudy, said:\n\n       These are hard-working, ``play by the rules'' people who \n     have health insurance and have discovered that they were just \n     one bad diagnosis away from financial disaster. I think \n     that's the real heart of the story. This is about people who \n     thought they were all safe. Accountants, lawyers, teachers, \n     police officers, airline mechanics, members of the National \n     Guard who get sent to Iraq for a year, the family next-door--\n     that is who is going bankrupt in America, families who spend \n     nearly every dollar they earn, not on luxuries but on \n     necessities and basics: childcare, health care, a decent \n     home, and a safe neighborhood. They have very little savings. \n     They are not doing that well. They dip into their savings \n     when they have to. They may even try to take their money out \n     of their 401(k). Maybe they take out a second mortgage. When \n     that money is gone, they turn to credit cards for basics such \n     as food, gas, and doctors' bills. They have done their level \n     best to raise their kids right and honor their obligations. \n     According to Professor Warren, the average American filing \n     for bankruptcy spends more than a year struggling with debts \n     before filing. This is not an impulsive thing. Four out of \n     ten people she interviewed said they had their phones shut \n     off in the 2 years before they filed. More than half skipped \n     doctor or dental appointments because of the cost. More than \n     40 percent had failed to fill a prescription, and more than \n     one in five had gone without food--without food--because of \n     the cost. By the time they finally gave up and went to \n     bankruptcy court, the average family owed more than a year's \n     salary in debt, other than their mortgage. Getting the last \n     pound of flesh from these families, that is what the bill is \n     all about.\n\n  What is the incidence of abuse? We can almost agree on it.\n  The American Bankruptcy Institute is a nonpartisan research and \neducation organization that says 3 percent of the people who file for \nbankruptcy could afford to repay--3 percent. This is about 1.1 million \nwho file each year. The rest don't have two nickels to rub together. \nThe credit card industry says it is 10 percent. Even if you accept \ntheir own figure, that means 90 percent of the people who file for \nbankruptcy are flat broke. They should be left alone.\n  Under current law, these 90 or 97 percent of bankruptcy petitioners \nshow a bankrupt judge how much they owe and how much they earn. It is a \nsimple process. You could fit the paperwork on a single sheet of paper \nand have room left over.\n  If the judge agrees the person cannot afford to pay all of his or her \ndebts, the petitioner can file for chapter 7 bankruptcy, and the credit \ncard debt, medical bills, and other unsecured debts can be discharged, \nwiped away. Bankruptcy is still financially and emotionally draining, \nbut at least the person can stop at zero.\n  The bill we are considering assumes that the majority of people are \nout to cheat the system. Despite the fact that even the credit card \nindustry says 90 percent of the people are not, this bill assumes they \nare.\n  We create a means test--a means test that adds complication to the \nprocess, greater legal bills, and greater legal costs for the person in \nbankruptcy who is trying to get out from under the problem with the \nmeans test.\n  The way the law works now, bankruptcy judges have the authority and \ndiscretion to look at how much debt a person has and how they acquired \nthe debt. Then the judge decides: Is this someone who is trying to game \nthe system? Is this someone who has been dealt some hard blows in life? \nIs this debt brought on by buying a plasma screen television, or taking \nthat cruise, or is it a desperate effort to pay doctors' bills and buy \ngroceries and not see the house foreclosed on?\n  The means test in this bill wipes out the judge's discretion. The \njudge can't look at a real person. The judge looks at numbers on paper. \nThe means test isn't really meant to screen out cheaters. There is \nalready a provision in the law for that. It is designed to trip people \nup, add legal expenses, and force more families into chapter 13.\n  This isn't a balanced bill. Unfortunately, the scandals I have talked \nabout at Enron, Tyco, and WorldCom are the subject of a good bankruptcy \nbill. We are not going to consider that. We don't deal with corporate \nbankruptcies here, that is over the line. We deal with the bankruptcies \nof ordinary individuals.\n  Let me tell you about the amendment I am offering because the people \nI am offering it on behalf of are far from ordinary. They are mothers, \nfathers, Americans in our country today. These are the men and women in \nuniform. I have seen them and you have, too. You have seen them on the \nnews--risking their lives in Iraq, Afghanistan, Korea, and around the \nworld. I have seen them in Illinois, as we send our troops to go serve \noverseas--in Litchfield, IL, about a month ago. There was not a dry eye \nin the house. About 100 of them were infantry, activated, standing at \nattention in the Litchfield High School gymnasium. There we sat with \nthe stands filled with families praying for their safe return. We \nwatched them file by and we shook hands with every one of them, saying: \nGodspeed. We are on your side. We won't forget you. You are in our \nthoughts and prayers.\n  Here comes this bankruptcy bill. Do you know what happens? You end up \nwith men and women in uniform--activated Guard and Reserve, and other \nactive military--sent to battle, sent to combat, where every day their \nlife is at stake, and meanwhile many of them are facing extraordinary \nhardships at home. They and their families have lost their life's \nsavings which they cannot deal with because they are defending \nour country.\n\n  Military service always involves sacrifice. In times of war, those \nsacrifices\n\n[[Page S1824]]\n\nmultiply. Extended deployment means long difficult separations. \nMilitary service means extraordinary financial hardships.\n  I asked the GAO to look into issues affecting the economic security \nof our troops; in other words, what is happening to families' finances \nwhen they serve our country and go overseas. There isn't a lot of data. \nThey went back to the 1999 Defense Department survey. In that survey, \nthey found 16,000 Active-Duty members of the military had filed for \nbankruptcy in the preceding 12 months. That was 1999, 6 years ago.\n  We know the economic stress on military families has increased \ndramatically since then. We are at war with 150,000-plus in Iraq and \nthousands in Afghanistan.\n  Since September 11, 2001, more than 469,000 National Guard members \nand Reserves from the Army, Marines, Navy, and Air Force have been \ncalled up for combat in Iraq and Afghanistan--the largest deployment of \nU.S. Guard and Reserve forces in 50 years. Reservists' tours of duty \ncan last up to 24 months today. The Pentagon is considering extending \nthat time limit.\n  I have a pie chart I would like to show you which demonstrates some \nof the problems facing the military.\n  In 2002, the Department of Defense conducted a survey of military \nspouses. Here is what they found.\n  Thirty percent--almost one-third--of all military families reported a \nloss of family income when the spouse was deployed; almost one out of \nthree.\n  Part-time military--National Guard and Reserve members--were \nespecially hard hit; 41 percent of Guard and Reserve families lost \nincome when a spouse was deployed--41 percent.\n  Let me just say parenthetically my salute to all of the companies, \nall of the units of government that have stood behind the men and women \nin uniform and have said: We will protect your pay while you are gone. \nWe will make sure you don't get penalized. How embarrassing it is to \nstand here today and tell you that our Federal Government does not \nstand behind the men and women in the Federal workforce who are \nactivated. We don't make up the difference.\n  So 41 percent of those Guard and Reserve activated who have lost \nincome include a lot of Federal employees. The average income varied by \nbranch, ranging from an average of $600 lost for Air National Guard \nmembers, to $3,800 for Marine Corps reservists.\n  Senior officers lost an average of $5,000 in lost income and $700 per \nenlisted member.\n  Reservists who own their own businesses are especially hard hit. \nFifty-five percent of self-employed reservists lost money when they \nwere activated. The average income loss for these families is $6,500.\n  For reservists with specialized degrees and training, the income loss \nwas even greater. Doctors and registered nurses who are mobilized \nreport an average loss of $9,000. Doctors in private practice lose an \naverage of $25,000. The list goes on.\n  Many of these families manage to scrape by using their savings and \nrelying on relatives and friends. Some families do all of these things, \nbut their financial problems still become so severe that they have no \nchoice but to file for bankruptcy.\n  They are the people we are talking about in this bankruptcy bill. We \nare not talking about someone in a distant State in a circumstance we \ncan't understand. We are talking about an activated member of the Guard \nand Reserve deployed for a year or 2 years who loses his business and \nhas to file for bankruptcy. The law we are going to pass is going to \nmake it more difficult for that person to file for bankruptcy.\n  Senator Evan Bayh is one Member who supports this amendment. He calls \nit the ``patriot penalty.'' We are penalizing those serving our country \nby making it tough for them when they become bankrupt because they have \nlost all of their income serving America.\n  Let me give you an example.\n  Ray Korizon is from Schaumburg, IL. Before the Persian Gulf war in \n1991, he owned a construction company that employed 26 employees. He \nlost his business when his Reserve unit was deployed for 6 months. \nToday, he works for the Federal Government.\n  Some of the self-employed reservists who have been called to duty in \nthis war are facing similar financial hardships. Army Reserve SGT \nPatrick Kuberry is one of them. He and a business partner--an Army \nReserve colonel--used to own two small restaurants in Denver. Like most \nowners of small restaurants in Denver, CO, they both worked long hours. \nThey didn't make a lot of money, but they made enough to support their \nfamilies. Then came 9/11 and the economic downturn. They had to close \none of the restaurants. In April 2003, his partner was called up and \nsent to Afghanistan. In June 2003, Sergeant Kuberry's unit was called \nup. He spent 11 months in Africa. That was the last blow. Without \neither man home to work, the remaining restaurant went under. Sergeant \nKuberry and his partner were forced to file for personal bankruptcy.\n  Another story: Rick Parsons and Dave Young are both Army Reserve \nmajors from Rochester, NY. In civilian life, Rick Parsons is a \nveterinarian in private practice and Dave Young is an accountant. They \nwere shipped out with their unit to Afghanistan for a year. They were \nnearly wiped out financially. Rick Parsons couldn't find another vet on \nshort notice to run his practice. He earned $70,000 during his year in \nAfghanistan, but he had to take out a loan for the same amount to save \nhis practice. He figures he was within a month of having to go file for \nbankruptcy when he got home. Dave Young's wife and father were able to \nkeep the small accounting firm going during the year he was in \nAfghanistan.\n  The other units were not so lucky. Another ended up with a mountain \nof medical bills after developing malaria.\n  Let me tell you about another person filing for bankruptcy. Kathy \nCruz is a bankruptcy attorney in Hot Springs, AR. The State is home to \nthe 39th Infantry Division of the Arkansas National Guard. In October \n2003, the division shipped out for 18 months, including 12 months in \nIraq. Six months later, the division deployed, the first Guard families \nbegan showing up at Kathy Cruz's office desperate for a way to hold on \nto their homes and avoid bankruptcy. One of her clients, a family with \nfour teenagers, owned a combination gas station and convenience store. \nThe father was a reservist medic. With him in Iraq, there was literally \nno one to mind the store. So they closed the store. When they got into \nserious financial trouble, they gave their home back to the mortgage \ncompany so it wouldn't be repossessed. Then things got worse.\n  Is this irresponsible conduct of these people activated to serve \nAmerica, to risk their lives in combat? While they are risking their \nlives, everything they own is at risk.\n  Things got so much worse, the soldier's parents had cosigned the loan \nfor the business, trying to save it. While this soldier was overseas \nserving America, they had to declare bankruptcy or they would lose \ntheir home and the whole family would be on the street. The grandfather \nis disabled. The grandmother has gone back to work to try to keep the \nfamily afloat financially. The whole family recently came to Ms. Cruz \nin her office in Hot Springs. This is how she described the visit of \nthis family.\n\n       You've got three generations sitting in front of you, \n     scared out of their wits.\n\n  Ms. Cruz says she expects to see more such families in the future. In \nher words, ``This is the tip of the iceberg.''\n  Most families try to desperately avoid bankruptcy because of the \nstigma, the connotation of personal failure and their own moral code \nthat says you pay back what you owe. Many military members and families \ntry doubly hard to avoid it because of the mistaken belief that \nbankruptcy alone can be grounds for a dishonorable discharge. They are \nencouraged to believe that, in many cases, by payday lenders that \ncluster around military bases and communities who are going to let \npeople know inside the base if the soldiers don't pay off.\n\n  Let me tell you about loan sharks. Payday lenders are legal loan \nsharks that offer small, short-term loans at interest rates of 100, \n500, even 1,000 percent. When the borrower can't pay back the loan, the \npayday lender offers them another loan, and then another loan. In fact, \na recent study in Iowa found that customers typically roll over \ninterest.\n\n[[Page S1825]]\n\n  Payday lenders specifically target military members because they know \nthey have a steady source of income, many are young and inexperienced, \nthey have family obligations, they are strapped for cash, and they are \neasy to find. And, most offensive, payday lenders target military \nmembers because they know these are people who are hard working and \nhonest and who believe in personal responsibility and integrity.\n  Operations like these and others employ former military personnel to \nsolicit soldiers. They use gimmicky, misleading names such as Force One \nLending, Armed Forces Loans, Military Financial, and American Military \nDebt Management Services.\n  Let me show you this chart of payday lenders in the State of Georgia.\n  Military loan: Here is an example of one of them. This is what you \nsee on highways and roads leading into many military bases and \ncommunities: Store-front pawn dealers, payday loan shops, and ``debt \nconsolidation'' operations, all trying to lure military members and \ntheir families with the promise of fast, easy money which they can \nnever pay off.\n  This is a store-front payday loan store in King's Bay, GA, just \nacross the State line from a military base in Florida. Note the name of \nthis operation, ``Pioneer Military Loans.''\n  Here is another operation on the same highway, ``T Pawn.'' Isn't it \nappropriate that right next door is a unit known as Fleet Cleaners. You \nget to go to the cleaners in both places.\n  Retired Navy veteran Peter Kahre made the mistake of taking out a \nloan with a business like this more than a decade ago when he was \nstationed at Jacksonville Naval Air Station. He is still haunted by it. \nWhen Kahre was deployed in 1996, the ``basic sustenance'' portion of \nhis military pay was cut by $197 a month because his food was now being \nprepared onboard. That pay cut, plus the arrival of a new baby, put his \nfamily in a bind. So Kahre borrowed $100 from a payday lender.\n  When he could not repay that loan, he took out another, and another, \nuntil he had loans with 10 different payday lenders. He estimates he \npaid back $20,000 on loans for which he received a total of not more \nthan $3,000, before he was finally forced to file for bankruptcy.\n  Let me show you some of the ads from the payday lenders in the Army \nTimes to give you an idea what these folks are after. This one is for \nour men and women in uniform: ``INSTANT CASH.'' ``Advanced Pay Loans.'' \n``How we beat the competition:'' ``Bankruptcies OK.'' They cannot wait \nto lure the men and women in uniform into these outrageous loans. \n``Bankruptcy no problem!'' In other words: We will lend you money even \nthough we know you probably cannot afford to pay it back.\n  There is another kind of predatory lender that clusters around \nmilitary communities. They lend money in exchange--listen to this--for \nmilitary members and veterans signing over their pension benefits. \nImagine, if you will--I have read the case that was reported in the \nnews--a sergeant had married a young woman in the Philippines. He could \nnot afford to bring her to the United States. He went in and pledged \nhis military retirement as collateral for one of these loans.\n  ``Cash now!'' Look at this one: ``Lump sum paid for pensions, VA \ndisability, VSIs. Credit problems OK!'' These are the people we talk \nabout who end up getting snared into these outrageous, usurious loans \nthey will never be able to pay back.\n  The National Consumer Law Center released an excellent report in May \n2003. Every Member of the Senate ought to read it. In it you will find \nstory after story of military members and veterans who have suffered \nserious financial problems because of predatory lenders.\n  Now let me tell you about the amendment I am offering. Whether the \nperson is career military or Guard or Reserve, the men and women of our \nArmed Forces make extraordinary sacrifices to defend our Nation. They \nput their lives on the line, their comfort, their freedom, their time \nwith their families. They sacrifice their health, even their lives. \nMany of them make major financial sacrifices.\n  Today, I am offering an amendment that will give military members who \nhave been forced into bankruptcy because of income loss connected to \ntheir service the hope of a second chance.\n  My amendment does not grant military members any favors. It is not a \n``get out of debt free'' card. The members of the military I have met \nwould not want that kind of special treatment. They are men and women \nof integrity who want to pay their debts and honor their obligations. \nThis amendment simply protects the people who protect us from the \npossibility of spending the rest of their lives in a figurative \ndebtor's prison.\n  Let me show you a chart in reference to the amendment. It has four \nbasic elements. My amendment protects three groups of people: service \nmembers, military veterans, and spouses of service members who die in \nmilitary service.\n  We protect them in bankruptcy with four provisions.\n  First, we prevent unscrupulous payday lenders from using bankruptcy \ncourts to fleece military members, veterans, and spouses of service \nmembers who die in military service. Any claims based on debt they owe \nthat require payment of interest, fees, or other charges in excess of \n36 percent would not be collectible in bankruptcy proceedings.\n  Second, my amendment exempts members of the armed services, veterans, \nand spouses of service members who die while in military service from \nthe onerous means test provisions of this bill. Again, this is not a \n``get out of debt free'' card. It simply allows the bankruptcy judge--\nnot an arbitrary and inflexible formula--to determine whether a \nmilitary member, a veteran, or a surviving spouse of a service member \nwho dies while serving America deserves the protection of chapter 7. It \nis left to the judge's discretion in these cases when it comes to the \nmilitary.\n\n  Men and women who volunteer to go to war should not have to wage war \nagainst the mountain of paperwork this bill creates.\n  Third, service members face a problem that most other bankruptcy \npetitioners do not. They do not choose where they live. They are sent \non assignment by the military. That can have major economic \nconsequences.\n  I have a chart that shows some of the homestead exemptions. In other \nwords, when you go to bankruptcy, you can usually protect your home, \nbut every State is different. So if you are assigned, for example, to a \nbase in Florida, there is unlimited protection for your home, if you \nfile bankruptcy while you are in the military. In Ohio, it is $5,000. \nThat is all that is protecting your home. In Nevada, it is $200,000. In \nIllinois, it is $7,500. If you are stationed in New Jersey, there is no \nprotection at all, no homestead exemption.\n  So what we have done is to establish a basic homestead exemption. It \nwould say that the members of the military are going to be allowed a \n$75,000 homestead exemption, or they can choose the exemption in the \nState in which they file.\n  There is another portion of this amendment which relates to the \npersonal property that someone could exempt from bankruptcy. That \nexemption is different from State to State. For my State of Illinois, I \nremember from when I dealt with bankruptcy law, you can exempt your \ntools from being taken from you in bankruptcy--a reasonable idea. But \nfor those sorts of things, every State is different.\n  So what happens to the member of the military who files and happens \nto be stationed in the State where they file for bankruptcy? We \nestablish a Federal personal property exemption. I think it is \nreasonable so that the individual serving in the military has that \nprotection.\n  Let me conclude. I know several Members are here to speak. We say all \nthe time that we owe the men and women who defend our Nation a debt of \ngratitude we can never repay. That is true. But we can show that we \nhonor their service by protecting them from spending the rest of their \nlives in a debtor's prison if their service obligations or serious \nillness or a string of bad breaks forces them to have to file for \nbankruptcy.\n  The credit card industry may argue my amendment is not needed because \nfew military members and their families seek bankruptcy protection. No \none knows that for sure. But if it is a\n\n[[Page S1826]]\n\nsmall number, the protections of my amendment will not hurt this \nmultibillion dollar industry.\n  Some may say that military members and their families do not deserve \nthe protections of my amendment because they are somehow morally \ndeficient--I cannot wait to hear that argument on the floor--the same \ncharge supporters of the underlying bill make about all people seeking \nbankruptcy. Well, if opponents of my amendment think members of the \nU.S. military are lacking in moral fiber, they need to spend a couple \nafternoons with troops, maybe visit some of our injured soldiers, or go \nto the veterans hospitals across America. Talk to some of these \nsoldiers struggling to learn to walk on new legs, begging to go back \ninto battle with their units. Tell me they need a lesson in personal \nresponsibility.\n  This amendment is about the men and women who protect us getting \nprotection from the possibility of a lifetime of debt. It is about \ngiving to those who risk their lives so our children can grow up in \nfreedom the possibility of a second chance for their own lives. We \ncannot repay the debt we owe these men and women, but we can protect \nthem from having to spend the rest of their lives in debt. That is what \nmy amendment would do. I urge my colleagues--and I hope on a bipartisan \nbasis--to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I share Senator Durbin's respect for our \nmen and women in uniform. I served over 10 years in the Army Reserve. I \nhave made three trips to Iraq as a member of the Armed Services \nCommittee. We work on those issues on a daily basis.\n  The last time I was in Iraq we were meeting with soldiers, and I had \none tell me his business had been hurt by him being there. He lost \nincome, and he was worried about it. We discussed that with the \nsoldiers there.\n  Then later he came up to me and said: I want you to know, Senator, \none hour from now I am signing up for another 7 years.\n  It made me proud to know that we have that kind of service personnel \nwho are serving their country well. How we ought to compensate them, \nhow we ought to benefit them is something all of us need to consider. \nWe are having increased compensation plans, increased bonuses for \nreenlistment, and other increasing benefits for our personnel because \nwe love them. We respect them. We want to affirm them. We want to carry \nour part of the burden that they are carrying as they serve us in \ndangerous areas of the globe today.\n  I want to point out, though, and bring ourselves back to where we \nare, this is not a bill that deals with American health insurance. It \nis not a bill that deals with compensation for the military. It is not \nlegislation that should set bank lending rates. That is a Banking \nCommittee issue, and it has been raised against this bill on a number \nof occasions. We have some credit card changes here, consumer-oriented \ncredit card amendments that I know Senator Durbin and others have asked \nfor and have been cleared by the Banking Committee. But this is not the \nplace to set banking regulations in a bankruptcy bill.\n  This legislation is designed to analyze what is occurring in Federal \nbankruptcy courts every day, to see what is happening there. What we \nhave learned is that over the last 30 years, people have learned to \nmanipulate this system in ways that are not good for the economy. \nLawyers, particularly, have advised their clients on ways they can \nabsolutely maximize their benefits under the bankruptcy law. And \nsometimes we have found that has not been healthy. As a result, these \nadvertisements--and they are on television, in the newspapers, in the \nfree things at the checkout counter where it tells you where you can \nbuy things on sale--tell you how to file for bankruptcy. That is all \nright. It is a free country. But those of us who set policy and set the \nrules for the bankruptcy system need to analyze how it is actually \nworking in bankruptcy court. We need to ask ourselves what we should do \nto make it better. And we need to do some things that help debtors such \nas single moms, who have bankruptcies filed against their child support \nand things of that nature, to put them higher up on the list of people \nwho get compensated. We do that.\n  The testimony is unequivocal that with regard to family breakup, \nalimony and child support, this bill is a huge step forward for \nchildren and their parents who receive those benefits.\n  There is a lot in here that benefits people on a routine basis who \nhave to go into bankruptcy court. Remember, if you make below median \nincome in America and you file for bankruptcy, you can wipe out, as an \nabsolute right, every debt you owe, no matter how you incurred it, for \nany reason.\n  I know Elizabeth Warren. She has been an activist against bankruptcy \nreform for years. And one thing she puts in her definition of debts \narising from health care is gambling debts, for example. I believe \nthose numbers that have been promoted at a recent hearing by her are at \nbest a bit too high. They are really less. Are health care debts a part \nof this? Yes. Are there people with insurance who still don't have \nenough money to pay their health care debts? Yes. Do people who don't \nhave insurance have health care debts that help cause them to be unable \nto pay their debts and go into bankruptcy? Yes. But what if you make \n$100,000 and you have $75,000 in debt? Under current law, you can go \ninto bankruptcy court and wipe out every one of them. It can be your \ndoctor, your local hospital, your local automobile dealership, your \nfriendly mechanic, anyone you owe in the community--just wipe out those \ndebts. You don't have to pay them.\n  Lawyers will tell them that. They are advertising how to do that. \nBeat your landlord. Don't have to pay your rent. Come on down. We will \nkeep you in your house another 6 months by filing bankruptcy, which \nwill stay eviction. And then, when you finally lose that, which you \ninevitably will lose that contest of eviction, then you wipe out all \nyour debts and rents, and you don't owe anybody anything.\n  Let me say, there are problems in bankruptcy that this bill has \ncarefully set about to deal with and tried to fix. I am rather proud of \nit. We have made a lot of progress on dealing with a number of the \nabuses that exist. But we are not in the business of dealing with \nhealth insurance, health care reform. We can't deal with the issue on \nhow we ought to compensate reservists and guardsmen who have been \nactivated.\n  I will say this with regard to the military issues. My staff has been \nreviewing the fundamental protections provided to the service men and \nwomen under the Soldiers and Sailors Relief Act, originally passed in \n1940. It is a tremendous piece of legislation to protect service \npersonnel who are called to active duty from being harassed, abused, or \ntaken advantage of in court.\n  It remains the law of the land today. It has been strengthened over \nthe past years. When I was in the Army Reserve, I was a U.S. attorney, \nand sometimes there is a basic officer in the unit, and sometimes in my \nduties as a jack officer it fell in my lot to brief the personnel on \nthe benefits of it and to represent people who would be abused under \nthe Soldiers and Sailors Relief Act. It has some very good and powerful \nthings in it.\n  Let me show you how many of the concerns that the Senator has are \ncovered by that act. In 2003, we passed the Service Members Civil \nRelief Act, which added even more protections. The goal was to \nfinancially protect Active-Duty military members, reservists in active \nFederal service, and National Guard members. The act allows military \nmembers to suspend or postpone civil financial obligations during their \nperiod of military service. Oftentimes, this can enable them to avoid \nhaving to file a bankruptcy.\n  The information brochure on the Soldiers and Sailors Civil Relief \nAct, by the Department of Defense, states that it provides an umbrella \nof protection, and it does. The umbrella of protection created by the \nact includes these provisions: an interest rate cap of 6 percent on all \ndebts incurred before or during commencement of Active-Duty service. So \nif you are called to active duty and you entered into a debt that \ncarries a 25-percent interest rate, you can reduce that. It applies to \nmortgage payments, credit card payments, and car loans. The act \nprovides protection from eviction. It would delay all civil court \nproceedings, including bankruptcy, until\n\n[[Page S1827]]\n\nyou get back--an automatic delay. If the lawyer says the serviceman is \nin Iraq--``He has been activated, Your Honor''--this case is stayed. \nThat is what is done immediately. There is no dispute. Foreclosure \nproceedings are delayed. Divorce proceedings against a service member \nare stayed.\n  There is a prohibition on entering of default judgments against \nActive-Duty military members and the ability to reopen default \njudgments. In other words, sometimes when the service member is gone, \nhe does not know he has been sued and failed to respond effectively \nbecause he is on active duty. The judge is prohibited from taking a \ndefault. But if the judge, by mistake or otherwise, enters a default \njudgment, then that Active-Duty member can have it set aside when he \ncomes back. It is not binding.\n  The ability to terminate property, residential and automobile leases \nat will is provided for in this act. In other words, if you enter into \na solemn lease agreement for a residence or an automobile and you are \ncalled up, all you have to do is write them and say: I have been \nactivated, so I am no longer bound by this lease agreement. It includes \nthe continuation of life insurance of at least $250,000, without \nrequiring premiums to be paid.\n  The tolling of statutes of limitation--in other words, if you have a \nlawsuit and you are thinking about filing it and the time for you to \nfile it is about to run and you get called to active duty, that time is \nextended until you return, and you have time after you return to file \nany lawsuit because the statute of limitations is tolled. There is \ntemporary relief from mortgage payments, and credit rating protections. \nIn other words, if you are somehow found to be poorly responsive to \nyour debts because you have been activated, you can clear up your \ncredit rating.\n  There are penalties for landlords and creditors who violate the act \nand fines of up to $100,000 or imprisonment if they harass a service \nmember contrary to this act while they are serving their country in \nsome distant land. The Supreme Court has even added to the act the \nability to help military members in times of financial need by ruling \nthat the act must be read with an eye friendly to those who drop their \naffairs to answer their country's call. This has been a strong act that \nprovides great protection for our men and women. We all ought to be \nproud that America has understood this.\n  Now, let's talk about some of the specific ideas that are in Senator \nDurbin's bill. He said it somewhat differently than what he offered in \ncommittee. I have not seen amendments until this morning, and I briefly \nheard his comments and have not had a chance to study it in detail. But \nhe would exempt service members, military Active-Duty members, \nveterans, and spouses from means tests contained in the bankruptcy bill \nbecause a means test will not reflect their real income or real ability \nto pay debts back. But I don't think that is true.\n  The bill contains a rebuttal to the means test application when a \ncourt finds special circumstances. These are the ones I think we are \ndiscussing. A special circumstance that a military member could assert \nunder this bill as it now exists--this bankruptcy bill--would include \nthe fact that their income dropped in recent months due to a call to \nactive duty or there have been excessive expenses arising as a result \nof being called to active duty. That assertion would keep the means \ntest from applying to the military debt. No special exemption, it would \nappear, would be necessary for military members on this basis because a \ncall to active duty that causes a drop in income, to me, would be \nclearly a special circumstance. The bill currently contemplates that, \nalthough I think, frankly, we could explicitly state that as a \nmandatory circumstance.\n  Second, he asserts that this amendment is necessary to protect \nmilitary members' homesteads. His amendment would apply to the Federal \ncap of $125,000 contained in the bill to all service members or allow \nthe service members to choose the exemption level permitted by the \nState he resided in before becoming a service member. It opens up the \nhomestead compromise we have battled so hard on and dealt with. I don't \nthink it would affect many service members. Many of them live in \nhousing provided by the military. Because the bankruptcy bill requires \n2 years of residency in a State before the State homestead exemption \ncan apply, it is highly unlikely that military members will be often \ncovered by it. They move frequently.\n  The Senator also argues his amendment is necessary to protect service \nmembers from predatory loans and high-interest loans. I believe that \nthis concern is well covered by current law. The Soldiers and Sailors \nRelief Act prevents interest charges greater than 6 percent from being \ncollected on any type of debt owed by an Active-Duty service member. \nEven debts the service member made before being called to active duty \nare covered by this interest cap. We have dealt with this issue before. \nThe House had a full debate on it. It was voted down there.\n  The floor debate on the bankruptcy bill previously, S. 1920, which \nexempted veterans and others from the means test, was offered by \nCongresswoman Schakowsky in opposing the amendment. Chairman \nSensenbrenner pointed out that the means-based test only applies to \npeople with incomes above the median State average. I will repeat that. \nAnybody who is making above the median income could be impacted by the \nmeans test and, therefore, could be ordered to pay back some of the \ndebt they have lawfully incurred. If they are unlawfully incurred, they \ncannot be made to pay them back. The court won't make them pay it back.\n  But they could be made to pay back some of those based on how much \ntheir income is above median income. If they are making $200,000 a \nyear, the judge may say they have to pay them all back. If they are \nmaking $50,000 and they owe $100,000 in debts, the court may conclude \nthey only can pay back $15,000. That is how this will work out in \nreality.\n  He points out that factor and notes that anyone who is below the \nState median income does not qualify on the means-based test and their \nbankruptcy petition cannot be tossed out of chapter 7 and put into \nchapter 13 where some debts are paid back.\n  Chairman Sensenbrenner also agrees with my analysis that the issues \nhave been taken care of in the most part since 1940 under the Soldiers \nand Sailors Relief Act which allows for the staying of legal \nproceedings against anybody on active duty.\n  I think he points that out. We have some ideas. He makes another \npoint I will not go into at length. I will say this: I am very \nconcerned about our men and women in uniform. I want to make sure there \nare no loopholes or gaps in the Soldiers and Sailors Relief Act. I want \nto make sure this bankruptcy act in no way makes it more difficult for \nour soldiers than what they have today. I will be glad to look at this \namendment and study it more carefully and perhaps offer an alternative \nthat would be more constrained and would deal more directly with the \nproblems. A veteran could be someone who has been in the country, off \nactive duty, for quite a long time. I am not sure that adding all \nveterans to this exemption would be a good idea particularly. I have \nsome real doubts about that.\n  Mr. President, I state my opposition to the Durbin amendment. I look \nforward to analyzing it further, and if there are areas in which we can \nreach accord, I will be pleased to support that. If there are other \nneeds of our service personnel that could be impacted positively by a \nbankruptcy reform bill, I am prepared to look at that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 16, As Modified\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alabama for \noffering to work with me. It would be my wish and hope that we could \nfind a bipartisan agreement on this issue. Either he or someone who is \ndistributing information on the floor has raised I think a very valid \nissue about our reference to the term ``veteran'' in my amendment. What \nwe were thinking of was a situation where some of our active-duty \nsoldiers who are seriously wounded and transferred to hospitals, such \nas Walter Reed, find themselves needing to be discharged quickly so \nthey can go into the veterans health system. So we included the term \n``veteran'' so it would apply to them as well.\n\n[[Page S1828]]\n\n  But someone has observed, correctly, by using the term ``veterans'' \nwe have opened this up very broadly. So I send a modification to my \namendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. The amendment is \nso modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To protect servicemembers and veterans from means testing in \n  bankruptcy, to disallow certain claims by lenders charging usurious \ninterest rates to servicemembers, and to allow servicemembers to exempt \n property based on the law of the State of their premilitary residence)\n\n        On page 13, between lines 13 and 14, insert the following:\n       ``(D) Subparagraphs (A) through (C) shall not apply, and \n     the court may not dismiss or convert a case based on any form \n     of means testing, if--\n       ``(i) the debtor or the debtor's spouse is a servicemember \n     (as defined in section 101 of the Servicemembers Civil Relief \n     Act (50 App. U.S.C. 511(1)));\n       ``(ii) the debtor or the debtor's spouse is a veteran (as \n     defined in section 101(2) of title 38, United States Code) \n     and the indebtedness occurred in whole or in part while they \n     were on active military duty; or\n       ``(iii) the debtor's spouse dies while in military service \n     (as defined in section 101(2) of the Servicemembers Civil \n     Relief Act (50 App. U.S.C. 511(2))).\n       On page 67, between lines 18 and 19, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 206.

Mr. President, I want to explain briefly so the Senator \nfrom Alabama understands. We amended the term ``veteran'' in the \namendment so it only applies to the situation where the veteran's \nindebtedness in whole or in part occurred during active duty. We were \nreferring to veterans in general, and one person said: What if you were \na veteran of World War II many years ago and your indebtedness had \nnothing to do with it? We have clarified it with this modification that \nit would be veterans whose indebtedness was incurred in whole or in \npart during their term of active duty.\n  I might also say to my colleague from Alabama, we have a legitimate \ndispute about the Servicemembers' Civil Relief Act. I would like to \njoin with him to find out which one of us is correct because we have \nbeen told that this Civil Relief Act does not apply to debts incurred \nafter military service begins. The most significant limitation is that \nits primary protections apply only to obligations entered into before a \nperson is called to active duty.\n  So, ironically, it does not protect military families when they need \nit the most when additional debt is incurred to help make ends meet \nduring active duty. Rather than belabor this point, I would like to \njoin the Senator from Alabama and get to the bottom of it and find out \nwho is right. It is an important point.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n[[Page S1829]]\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be temporarily set aside to allow Senator Feingold to offer a \nfirst-degree amendment. Before the Chair rules, I indicate that it is \nmy expectation to offer a second-degree amendment to the Durbin \namendment or work out an agreement for two side-by-side first-degree \namendments. While we are working out that agreement, we are prepared to \ngo forward with the discussion on the Feingold amendment, with the \nunderstanding that we would then return and debate the Sessions \namendment and the Durbin amendment and dispose of those matters first.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object, and I do not plan to \nobject, it is my understanding that my amendment is pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So that any amendment filed subsequently would follow it \nfor consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Feingold amendment is offered, it will \nbe pending, but the understanding of the Chair of what is in the \nunanimous consent request is that the amendment of the Senator from \nIllinois would be considered when the Senator from Alabama is ready to \nsecond-degree that amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President. I withdraw my reservation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have an amendment that I send to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 17.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n        (Purpose: To provide a homestead floor for the elderly)\n\n       On page 191, between lines 11 and 12, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 322A. EXEMPTION FOR THE ELDERLY.\n\n       Section 522 of title 11, United States Code, as amended by \n     sections 224, 308, and 322, is amended by adding at the end \n     the following:\n       ``(r) For a debtor whose age is 62 or older on the date of \n     the filing of the petition, if the debtor elects to exempt \n     property--\n       ``(1) under subsection (b)(2), then in lieu of the \n     exemption provided under subsection (d)(1), the debtor may \n     elect to exempt the debtor's aggregate interest, not to \n     exceed $75,000 in value, in real property or personal \n     property that the debtor or a dependent of the debtor uses as \n     a residence, in a cooperative that owns property that the \n     debtor or a dependent of the debtor uses as a residence, or \n     in a burial plot for the debtor or a dependent of the debtor; \n     or\n       ``(2) under subsection (b)(3), then if the exemption \n     provided under applicable law that may be applied to such \n     property is for less than $75,000 in value, the debtor may \n     elect in lieu of such exemption to exempt the debtor's \n     aggregate interest, not to exceed $75,000 in value, in any \n     such real or personal property, cooperative, or burial \n     plot.''.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am very concerned about the impact of \nthis bankruptcy bill on our senior citizens. Older Americans, far more \nthan the rest of us, often face crushing debt burdens because of the \nhigh cost of prescription drugs and other medical expenses, and they \nneed the safety net of bankruptcy relief to deal with their resulting \nfinancial troubles. In fact, Americans over 65 are now the fastest \ngrowing age group filing for bankruptcy protection.\n  Older Americans, far more than the rest of us, are often homeowners \nwho have paid off their mortgages over decades of hard work. Their home \nequity often represents nearly their entire life savings, and their \nhome is often their only significant asset. It is critical we ensure \nthese older Americans are not forced to give up their hard-earned \nhomes--the homes where they have raised their children and planned to \nspend their retirement--in order to seek the benefit of our bankruptcy \nsystem. These are not just pieces of real estate to these people; these \nare their havens, their sanctuaries, their life's work. Yet the \nbankruptcy law in its current form does not adequately protect older \nAmericans from a horrible dilemma.\n  For older homeowners, the homestead exemption in the bankruptcy laws \nis what should protect them from having to make the horrible decision \nto give up their homes in order to seek bankruptcy relief. This \nexemption legally protects the homestead--a personal residence--or some \nportion of its value from the claims of most creditors. It should mean \nthat senior citizens faced with bankruptcy because they cannot pay off \ntheir massive medical expenses are allowed to keep their homes.\n  In too many cases, this homestead exemption is woefully inadequate. \nThe value of this exemption varies widely from State to State. While \nFederal law currently creates an alternative homestead exemption of \njust under $20,000, that low amount is just that, an alternative. Each \nState gets to decide whether it will allow its debtors to rely on this \nFederal alternative, and many do not. As a result, some States allow a \nmuch higher exemption, but many have a much lower exemption.\n  In States such as Florida and Texas, there is a homestead exemption \nwith an unlimited dollar value, meaning that any money invested in a \nhome cannot be obtained by creditors. I should note, of course, that \nthis creates other problems, which I will address in a few minutes. But \nother States allow a very limited value homestead exemption. In many \nStates, the amount of equity a homeowner can protect in bankruptcy has \nlagged far behind the dramatic rise in home values in recent years. For \nexample, in the State of Ohio, the homestead exemption is only $5,000, \nand in the Presiding Officer's State of North Carolina, the homestead \nexemption is $10,000. In this day and age, those paltry exemptions will \ndo no good. We obviously have a problem, and it is hitting our older \nfriends and family members the hardest.\n  Think about it: In these low homestead exemption States, even \nindigent elderly homeowners who own a home free and clear worth only \n$30,000 or $40,000 cannot file for chapter 7 bankruptcy without losing \ntheir home. And they may not be able to file a chapter 13 case because \nthey cannot afford to pay creditors the value of their home equity that \nis not exempt, as required by that chapter. Many elderly homeowners \nlive solely on Social Security benefits, often no more than $800 to \n$1,000 per month. This is enough to subsist in their paid-off homes, \nwhile still paying taxes, utilities and other basic living expenses. \nBut if they lose their homes, they will not be able to rent a decent \nplace to live. Effectively, this means these older homeowners have no \nbankruptcy relief available to them at all. We have to address this \ngross inequity before we pass this bill. My amendment would create a \nuniform federal floor for homestead exemptions of $75,000, applicable \nonly to bankruptcy debtors over the age of 62, protecting the lower- \nand middle-class senior citizens who need it most.\n\n  I will give an example that illustrates why it is so important that \nwe fix this problem and fix it now. Let me tell my colleagues about \nMary Bobbit. Mary Bobbit is a 70-year-old widow who lives in North \nCarolina, where the homestead exemption is only $10,000. According to a \nlocal news story, she recently lost her husband to cancer, a battle \nthat left her with more than $175,000 in unpaid medical bills. Her only \nremaining asset is the home that her family built themselves 26 years \nago, a home that she paid off just last year. And now she is faced with \na horrible dilemma, because if she files for bankruptcy in North \nCarolina, she will lose the home that she and her husband worked so \nhard to build and pay for.\n  As Mary Bobbit's story shows, this is not a hypothetical problem. \nDespite the fact that older Americans tend to own their own homes and \nhave greater financial experience compared to the rest of us, they are \nthe fastest growing age group in bankruptcy. In the 1990s, the number \nof Americans 65 and older filing for bankruptcy tripled. Why is that?\n  Well, older Americans simply do not have the same resources for their \nretirement years that they used to. They live on fixed incomes that are \nnot keeping up with rising costs. Fewer and fewer Americans have \npensions, and many Americans who are just hitting retirement age lost \nmuch of their retirement savings when the stock market bubble burst a \nfew years ago.\n\n[[Page S1830]]\n\n  But one of the biggest reasons that older Americans go into \nbankruptcy is the inability to pay medical expenses. Between \nprescription drug costs and the costs of hospitalization, medical \nexpenses can add up quickly for someone on a fixed income. Medicare \nsimply is not providing the help that many of them need. In fact, \nmedical expenses are the cause of more than half of all bankruptcies \nfiled by debtors over the age of 50.\n  Another big factor in the rising bankruptcy rate of older Americans \nis job loss. People who are nearing retirement age and lose their jobs \ndue to mergers and down-sizing can find it very difficult to find a new \njob. If you are in your late 50s and lose a job, just try to find \nsomeone to hire you at the same wages you were making before. It is not \neasy, and the results can be devastating.\n  Job loss is also a problem for the increasing percentage of older \nAmericans who are finding that they have to return to work after \nretirement in order to make ends meet, giving up the American dream of \nsecurity and leisure in retirement. In fact, nearly half of seniors say \nthey plan to continue working during retirement because they cannot \nsurvive financially otherwise. Senior citizens are reporting that if \nthey lose even a low-paying, part-time job at places like McDonald's or \nWal-Mart, they may no longer be able to afford their basic living \nexpenses.\n  Yet another disturbing trend is that the credit card debt of \nAmericans over age 65 increased dramatically in the 1990s, in part \nthanks to the fact that they can now charge many prescription drug and \nother medical expenses. I am very disturbed by the idea that seniors \nwould end up having to pay credit card interest rates of even 20 \npercent in order to pay for the medical treatment they need.\n  Older Americans are increasingly the victims of unscrupulous \npredatory lenders. According to the AARP, elderly Americans are three \ntimes more likely to be targeted. In fact, according to a Harvard \nstudy, nearly one in five older Americans in bankruptcy filed their \npetition at least in part to avoid constant, harassing, 24-hour-a-day \ncollection calls or other actions.\n  All of this rather sad picture makes one thing very clear. We are not \ntalking about people who were reckless with their spending and think \nthey can use or manipulate the bankruptcy laws to get out of it. We are \ntalking about responsible people who have worked toward retirement \ntheir whole lives, yet whether because of devastating medical costs, \njob loss, or some other tragedy, find themselves in a financial \nemergency and are unable to pay their debts. These people turn to the \nbankruptcy system only as a last resort. They should not also be forced \nto give up their homes for doing so.\n  We cannot allow this to continue. We have to fix this problem.\n  I believe my amendment offers a solution to help them. Federal law \nshould protect the elderly in States where the homestead exemption is \nvery low. The optional Federal bankruptcy exemptions allow a homeowner \nto protect only a little under $20,000, and even then States can simply \nignore that Federal alternative and require their debtors to use the \nState exemptions, which are often much lower. My amendment would create \na uniform Federal floor for homestead exemptions of $75,000, applicable \nonly to bankruptcy debtors over the age of 62. States could no longer \nimpose lower exemptions on their seniors. This would permit senior \nhomeowners to file for bankruptcy without losing what is usually the \nonly significant asset they have: their homes. And if my amendment were \nadopted, the U.S. Congress would not be the first to acknowledge that \nthis is a problem for the elderly. Both California and Maine have \nrecognized that elderly debtors deserve increased homestead protection. \nCalifornia recently raised the exemption for the elderly to $150,000, \nand Maine has an exemption for debtors over 60 of $70,000. It is about \ntime we caught up with these forward-thinking State legislators and \ngave our seniors the protection they need.\n  I do want to briefly address the very serious problem that I alluded \nto earlier, which is that some wealthy Americans have exploited the \nunlimited homestead exemption available in certain States. This \ncertainly is not a new issue; we have had years of debate over the \nunlimited homestead exemptions in some states that permit wealthy \npeople to file bankruptcy and retain their mansions. One frequently \ncited example of abuse is Bowie Kuhn, the former baseball commissioner \nwhose law firm went into bankruptcy. After creditors seized his home in \nthe Hamptons and were about to attach his mansion in New Jersey, Mr. \nKuhn acquired a multi-million dollar home in Florida and protected it \nfrom his creditors. Florida, of course, is one of the States with an \nunlimited homestead exemption. Section 322 of the bankruptcy bill \nattempts to address this problem, but does so only for a relatively \nsmall number of people. It treats the poor and middle class harshly \nwhile still letting some wealthy debtors, who are clearly abusing the \nsystem, shelter millions of dollars. I agree with my senior colleague \nfrom Wisconsin, Senator Kohl, and the distinguished Senator from \nAlabama that this loophole must be addressed. Unfortunately, I do not \nthink the homestead exemption limitation in this bill does the job as \nwell as it could, but I am afraid we will have to turn to that issue on \nanother day.\n\n  My amendment addresses the flip side of the homestead issue. It has \nno effect whatsoever on the homestead provision agreed to by Senator \nKohl in the 2002 conference, which remains in this new bill. Rather \nthan being concerned with the relatively small number of high-profile \nwealthy abusers of the system, my amendment is aimed at the thousands \nupon thousands of elderly homeowners who are being squeezed by medical \nbills and rising home prices into an untenable position.\n  Let's be honest. Despite all the investment opportunities available \nto many in this country, for a very large number of seniors, the only \nretirement plan they have is this: pay off your house, and live on \nSocial Security. People in that situation can survive, but not if they \nget hit with a financial emergency, usually a severe medical problem, \nand live in a State that has a low homestead exemption. We need to help \nthem, and we need to do it now.\n  The bankruptcy system should provide a safety net for families truly \nin need of relief. This senior homeowner protection amendment is a \nreasonable solution to a growing problem. I strongly urge my colleagues \nto support this amendment, and I ask unanimous consent that a letter of \nsupport for this amendment from the AARP be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                         AARP,\n\n                                                    March 1, 2005.\n     Hon. Russell D. Feingold,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feingold: Debate on S. 256, the ``Bankruptcy \n     Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005'', has \n     begun on the floor of the Senate and we understand that you \n     are prepared to offer an amendment to S. 256 that creates a \n     uniform federal floor for homestead exemptions of $75,000 \n     that is applicable only to bankruptcy debtors over the age of \n     62. AARP supports this amendment, and urges the Senate to \n     adopt it as part of the legislation to help safeguard older \n     Americans from losing their homes when they find it necessary \n     to file for bankruptcy.\n       Individuals and families that are near or of retirement \n     age, and confronted with the unavoidable choice of filing for \n     bankruptcy, very often find themselves in an ever tightening \n     vice: at the end of their working careers, with little or no \n     time or opportunity to recover financially, and with very few \n     assets. Experts cite the financial problems of older \n     Americans as being based on an array of factors, among them: \n     job loss, medical expenses, death of a spouse, divorce, \n     financial support for children and grandchildren and less \n     retirement income. But it is job loss and medical expenses \n     that top the list of reasons for indebtedness and bankruptcy.\n       For millions of older persons, their homes represent their \n     principal financial asset and their personal independence. \n     Today, the federal bankruptcy exemptions allow a homeowner to \n     protect only a little under $20,000 in home equity, and many \n     states allow even less. The dramatic increases in home prices \n     over recent years have caused a special problem for older \n     homeowners who need bankruptcy relief from overwhelming debt \n     that is often due to large medical expenses. The amount of \n     equity a homeowner can protect in bankruptcy has not kept up \n     with the rise in home prices, so that even an indigent \n     elderly homeowner who owns a home worth only $30,000 or \n     $40,000 cannot file a chapter 7 bankruptcy without losing \n     that home and cannot file a chapter 13 case because he cannot \n     afford to pay creditors the value of the equity that is not \n     exempt, as required by that chapter.\n\n[[Page S1831]]\n\n       The irony of the situation is that under existing law \n     affluent debtors in a number of states are allowed to keep \n     homes of unlimited value. Should we punish the remaining \n     older Americans twice--for having to file for personal \n     bankruptcy under either Chapter 7 or 13, and to lose what \n     often is their only remaining retirement asset?\n       We urge Members of the Senate to provide this modest \n     bankruptcy relief for older Americans. If you have any \n     questions, please do not hesitate to contact me, or call Roy \n     Green of our Federal Affairs staff at 202-434-3800.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    David Certner,\n                                        Director, Federal Affairs.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, Senator Feingold has been very alert to \nthe issues of this bill, and he has contributed to this legislation. We \nhave agreed some and disagreed some. We have had a lot of fun \ndiscussing the issues, and I know I have learned a good bit from it.\n  Let me say, frankly, where we are on homestead. That has been an \nintensely debated matter for 8 years. We have reached a compromise on \nhow to handle homestead, and rather than cracking down on the abuses of \nthose people who move to States with unlimited homesteads, we basically \nhave agreed as a Senate that the States get to decide how much should \nbe exempted under the bankruptcy law. In other words, each State gets \nto decide.\n  States need to begin to think about what their limits are and whether \nthey need to change them. The Senator noted that California has raised \nits exemption for a home. Others will probably do the same, and some \nhave already done so.\n  It threatens this legislation in a fundamental way if we now go in \nand say we are going to override the State laws about what the \nhomestead exemption should be. I do not think we should do that. I \nthink it could help kill this bill. I know Senator Feingold is not a \nfan of it, and I do not think we should do this.\n  With regard to the abuses in the homestead legislation, we did put in \nlanguage that cracked down on the ability of someone to move to a State \nthat has a more favorable law and place an unlimited amount of equity \ninto a very expensive home and file bankruptcy and be able to keep that \nequity which they could then reconvert to cash.\n  I think that is a problem. I would like to have seen this go farther, \nbut we didn't make that, we didn't reach that bridge. It was a bridge \ntoo far. We failed to do that. It is one item in the bill I think we \ncould have done better with, frankly.\n  I will say this. The exemption, fundamentally, should apply to \neveryone, 62 above or below, as far as I can see. A young family, I \ndon't know why they would not need the same protections a senior would. \nRight now they all get the same. It is whatever the State decides.\n  So I would have to rise in objection to the Feingold amendment on the \nbasis that it is contrary to the State prerogatives in this area, the \nState deference that we have given repeatedly over the years. It is \ncontrary to that. It would be a Federal imposition of a homestead floor \nand it is contrary to a very fragile agreement we have reached in this \nbody over what the homestead exemption should be. It could, in fact, \njeopardize the successful passage of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Let me thank the Senator from Alabama, not only for his \nwillingness to engage on the merits of this amendment, but for his \nwillingness to engage on a number of difficult subjects, whether it be \nthe homestead exemption or landlord-tenant issues. When the Senate \ntakes up legislation, we typically start with a good discussion in \ncommittee, make some progress toward agreement, and then come to the \nfloor. And when we go to the conference committee between the Houses, \nwe also sometimes manage to come up with an agreement.\n  It is regrettable, through no fault of the Senator from Alabama, that \nin this case we are starting this process on the floor. I think had \nthese amendments been taken seriously in committee, we could have found \nsome common ground and not had to take up the time of the whole body, \nbut this is where we are.\n  I do believe this amendment is a reasonable extension of something in \nwhich the Senator from Alabama is already involved. His principal \nconcern about this amendment is apparently that we would be overriding \nState law in the area of homestead exemptions. But the Senator, as he \nhas indicated, has been a party to an agreement that would do exactly \nthat when it comes to the high end of homestead exemptions. It is not \nas if I picked a new area where I am suggesting that State laws are \ninadequate. What I am arguing is that if we are going to be dealing \nwith some of these outrageous abuses of the bankruptcy system \nperpetrated by the very wealthy, let's also take the opportunity to \nmake sure that the average senior citizen in this country, who \ndesperately wants to protect their home and has to go into bankruptcy, \nhas some minimum protection.\n  To me, this is not an extreme proposal. We only pass these bankruptcy \nbills once in a great while. As I understand it, the last one was \npassed in 1978. There clearly is a trend across the country in places \nlike Maine and California, where legislators are recognizing that there \nis a special, severe problem for many of our seniors. I agree with the \nSenator from Alabama, it would be terrific if we could extend this \nprotection to everybody. Perhaps that is something we should consider. \nBut there is a particular problem when it comes to seniors, who have no \nway of making money anymore, and who are beset with unexpected medical \nbills, whether it be prescription medicine or some other bills. They \nare stuck. They don't have any other way to save their home. This \nproblem just cries out for a minimum Federal standard of the kind this \namendment proposes.\n\n  I hope my colleagues consider this amendment. It is offered in good \nfaith. It is not something that should in any way upend the overall \nbill because we have already engaged in a discussion about the changes \nthat need to be made at the high end of the homestead exemption, and \nthe bill already includes such a provision. So I ask my colleagues to \ngive an independent and fresh look at this, given how important it is \nto senior constituents in every State of the Union.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/01/senate-section/article/S1831-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1831]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in 1939, one of the most famous American \nmovies of all time, ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,'' hit the box \noffice. Initially received with a combination of lavish praise and \nangry blasts, the film went on to win numerous awards and to inspire \nmillions around the globe. The director, the legendary Frank Capra, in \nhis autobiography, ``Frank Capra: The Name Above the Title,'' cites \nthis moving review of the film, appearing in the Hollywood Reporter, \nNovember 4, 1942:\n\n       Frank Capra's ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,'' chosen by \n     French Theaters as the final English language film to be \n     shown before the recent Nazi-ordered countrywide ban on \n     American and British films went into effect, was roundly \n     cheered. . . .\n       Storms of spontaneous applause broke out at the sequence \n     when, under the Abraham Lincoln monument in the Capital, the \n     word, ``Liberty,'' appeared on the screen and the Stars and \n     Stripes began fluttering over the head of the great \n     Emancipator in the cause of liberty.\n       Similarly, cheers and acclamation punctuated the famous \n     speech of the young senator on man's rights and dignity. ``It \n     was . . . as though the joys, suffering, love and hatred, the \n     hopes and wishes of an entire people who value freedom above \n     everything, found expression for the last time. . . .''\n\n\n[[Page S1832]]\n\n\n  For those who may not have seen it, ``Mr. Smith'' is the fictional \nstory of one young Senator's crusade against forces of corruption and \nhis lengthy filibuster--his lengthy filibuster--for the values he holds \ndear.\n  My, how things have changed. These days, Mr. Smith would be called an \nobstructionist. Rumor has it that there is a plot afoot to curtail the \nright of extended debate in this hallowed Chamber, not in accordance \nwith its rules, mind you, but by fiat from the Chair--fiat from the \nChair.\n  The so-called nuclear option--hear me--the so-called nuclear option--\nthis morning I asked a man, What does nuclear option mean to you? He \nsaid: Oh, you mean with Iran? I was at the hospital a few days ago with \nmy wife, and I asked a doctor, What does the nuclear option mean to \nyou? He said: Well, that sounds like we're getting ready to drop some \ndevice, some atomic device on North Korea.\n  Well, the so-called nuclear option purports to be directed solely at \nthe Senate's advice and consent prerogatives regarding Federal judges. \nBut the claim that no right exists to filibuster judges aims an arrow \nstraight at the heart of the Senate's long tradition of unlimited \ndebate.\n  The Framers of the Constitution envisioned the Senate as a kind of \nexecutive council, a small body of legislators, featuring longer terms, \ndesigned to insulate Members from the passions of the day.\n  The Senate was to serve as a check on the executive branch, \nparticularly in the areas of appointments and treaties, where, under \nthe Constitution, the Senate passes judgment absent the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  James Madison wanted to grant the Senate the power to select judicial \nappointees with the Executive relegated to the sidelines. But a \ncompromise brought the present arrangement: appointees selected by the \nExecutive, with the advice and consent of the Senate confirmed. Note--\nhear me again--note that nowhere in the Constitution of the United \nStates is a vote on appointments mandated.\n  When it comes to the Senate, numbers can deceive. The Senate was \nnever intended to be a majoritarian body. That was the role of the \nHouse of Representatives, with its membership based on the populations \nof States. The Great Compromise of July 16, 1787, satisfied the need \nfor smaller States to have equal status in one House of Congress, the \nSenate. The Senate, with its two Members per State, regardless of \npopulation, is, then, the forum of the States.\n  Indeed, in the last Congress--get this--in the last Congress 52 \nMembers, a majority, representing the 26 smallest States, accounted for \njust 17.06 percent of the U.S. population. Let me say that again. \nFifty-two Members, a majority, representing the 26 smallest States--two \nSenators per State--accounted for just 17.06 percent of the U.S. \npopulation. In other words, a majority in the Senate does not \nnecessarily represent a majority of the population of the United \nStates.\n  The Senate is intended for deliberation. The Senate is intended for \ndeliberation, not point scoring. The Senate is a place designed, from \nits inception, as expressive of minority views. Even 60 Senators, the \nnumber required under Senate rule XXII for cloture, would represent \njust 24 percent of the population if they happened to all hail from the \n30 smallest States.\n  So you can see what it means to the smallest States in these United \nStates to be able to stand on this floor and debate, to their utmost, \nuntil their feet will no longer hold them, and their lungs of brass \nwill no longer speak, in behalf of their States, in behalf of a \nminority, in behalf of an issue that affects vitally their \nconstituents.\n  Unfettered debate, the right to be heard at length, is the means by \nwhich we perpetuate the equality of the States. In fact, it was 1917, \nbefore any curtailing of debate was attempted, which means that from \n1789 to 1917, there were 129 years; in other words, it means also that \nfrom 1806 to 1917, some 111 years, the Senate rejected any limits to \ndebate. Democracy flourished along with the filibuster. The first \nactual cloture rule in 1917 was enacted in response to a filibuster by \nthose people who opposed the arming of merchant ships. Some might say \nthey opposed U.S. intervention in World War I, but to narrow it down, \nthey opposed the arming of merchant ships.\n  But even after its enactment, the Senate was slow to embrace cloture, \nunderstanding the pitfalls of muzzling debate. In 1949, the 1917 \ncloture rule was modified to make cloture more difficult to invoke, not \nless, mandating that the number needed to stop debate would be not two-\nthirds of those present and voting but two-thirds of all Senators \nelected and sworn. Indeed, from 1919 to 1962, the Senate voted on \ncloture petitions only 27 times and invoked cloture just 4 times over \nthose 43 years.\n  On January 4, 1957, Senator William Ezra Jenner of Indiana spoke in \nopposition to invoking cloture by majority vote. He stated with great \nconviction:\n\n       We may have a duty to legislate, but we also have a duty to \n     inform and deliberate. In the past quarter century we have \n     seen a phenomenal growth in the power of the executive \n     branch. If this continues at such a fast pace, our system of \n     checks and balances will be destroyed. One of the main \n     bulwarks against this growing power is free debate in the \n     Senate . . . So long as there is free debate, men of courage \n     and understanding will rise to defend against potential \n     dictators . . . The Senate today is one place where, no \n     matter what else may exist, there is still a chance to be \n     heard, an opportunity to speak, the duty to examine, and the \n     obligation to protect. It is one of the few refuges of \n     democracy. Minorities have an illustrious past, full of \n     suffering, torture, smear, and even death. Jesus Christ was \n     killed by a majority; Columbus was smeared; and Christians \n     have been tortured. Had the United States Senate existed \n     during those trying times, I am sure that these people would \n     have found an advocate. Nowhere else can any political, \n     social, or religious group, finding itself under sustained \n     attack, receive a better refuge.\n\n  Senator Jenner was right. The Senate was deliberately conceived to be \nwhat he called ``a better refuge,'' meaning one styled as guardian of \nthe rights of the minority. The Senate is the ``watchdog'' because \nmajorities can be wrong and filibusters can highlight injustices. \nHistory is full of examples.\n  In March 1911, Senator Robert Owen of Oklahoma filibustered the New \nMexico statehood bill, arguing that Arizona should also be allowed to \nbecome a State. President Taft opposed the inclusion of Arizona's \nstatehood in the bill because Arizona' State constitution allowed the \nrecall of judges. Arizona attained statehood a year later, at least in \npart because Senator Owen and the minority took time to make their \npoint the year before.\n  In 1914, a Republican minority led a 10-day filibuster of a bill that \nwould have appropriated more than $50,000,000 for rivers and harbors. \nOn an issue near and dear to the hearts of our current majority, \nRepublican opponents spoke until members of the Commerce Committee \nagreed to cut the appropriations by more than half.\n  Perhaps more directly relevant to our discussion of the ``nuclear \noption'' are the 7 days in 1937, from July 6 to 13 of that year, when \nthe Senate blocked Franklin Roosevelt's Supreme Court-packing plan--one \nof my favorite presidents.\n  Earlier that year, in February 1937, FDR sent the Congress a bill \ndrastically reorganizing the judiciary. The Senate Judiciary Committee \nrejected the bill, calling it ``an invasion of judicial power such as \nhas never before been attempted in this country'' and finding it \n``essential to the continuance of our constitutional democracy that the \njudiciary be completely independent of both the executive and \nlegislative branches of the Government.'' The committee recommended the \nrejection of the court-packing bill, calling it ``a needless, futile, \nand utterly dangerous abandonment of constitutional principle . . . \nwithout precedent and without justification.''\n  What followed was an extended debate on the Senate floor lasting for \n7 days until the majority leader, Joseph T. Robinson of Arkansas, a \nsupporter of the plan, suffered a heart attack and died on July 14. \nEight days later, by a vote of 70 to 20, the Senate sent the judicial \nreform bill back to committee, where FDR's controversial, court-packing \nlanguage was finally stripped. A determined, vocal group of Senators \nproperly prevented a powerful President from corrupting our Nation's \njudiciary.\n  Free and open debate on the Senate floor ensures citizens a say in \ntheir government. The American people are heard, through their Senator, \nbefore their money is spent, before their civil\n\n[[Page S1833]]\n\nliberties are curtailed, or before a judicial nominee is confirmed for \na lifetime appointment. We are the guardians, the stewards, the \nprotectors of the people who send us here. Our voices are their voices.\n  If we restrain debate on judges today, what will be next: the rights \nof the elderly to receive social security; the rights of the \nhandicapped to be treated fairly; the rights of the poor to obtain a \ndecent education? Will all debate soon fall before majority rule?\n  Will the majority someday trample on the rights of lumber companies \nto harvest timber or the rights of mining companies to mine silver, \ncoal, or iron ore? What about the rights of energy companies to drill \nfor new sources of oil and gas? How will the insurance, banking, and \nsecurities industries fare when a majority can move against their \ninterests and prevail by a simple majority vote? What about farmers who \ncan be forced to lose their subsidies, or western Senators who will no \nlonger be able to stop a majority determined to wrest control of \nranchers' precious water or grazing rights? With no right of debate, \nwhat will forestall plain muscle and mob rule?\n  Many times in our history we have taken up arms to protect a minority \nagainst the tyrannical majority in other lands. We, unlike Nazi Germany \nor Mussolini's Italy, have never stopped being a nation of laws, not of \nmen.\n  But witness how men with motives and a majority can manipulate law to \ncruel and unjust ends. Historian Alan Bullock writes that Hitler's \ndictatorship rested on the constitutional foundation of a single law, \nthe Enabling Law. Hitler needed a two-thirds vote to pass that law, and \nhe cajoled his opposition in the Reichstag to support it. Bullock \nwrites that ``Hitler was prepared to promise anything to get his bill \nthrough, with the appearances of legality preserved intact.'' And he \nsucceeded.\n\n       Hitler's originality lay in his realization that effective \n     revolutions, in modern conditions, are carried out with, and \n     not against, the power of the State: the correct order of \n     events was first to secure access to that power and then \n     begin his revolution. Hitler never abandoned the cloak of \n     legality; he recognized the enormous psychological value of \n     having the law on his side. Instead, he turned the law inside \n     out and made illegality legal.\n\n  That is what the nuclear option seeks to do to rule XXII of the \nStanding Rules of the Senate.\n  I said to someone this morning who was shoveling snow in my area: \nWhat does nuclear option mean to you?\n  He answered: Do you mean with Iran?\n  The people generally don't know what this is about. The nuclear \noption seeks to alter the rules by sidestepping the rules, thus making \nthe impermissible the rule, employing the nuclear option, engaging a \npernicious, procedural maneuver to serve immediate partisan goals, \nrisks violating our Nation's core democratic values and poisoning the \nSenate's deliberative process.\n  For the temporary gain of a handful of out-of-the-mainstream judges, \nsome in the Senate are ready to callously incinerate each and every \nSenator's right of extended debate. Note that I said each Senator. Note \nthat I said every Senator. For the damage will devastate not just the \nminority party--believe me, hear me, and remember what I say--the \ndamage will devastate not just the minority party, it will cripple the \nability of each Member, every Member, to do what each Member was sent \nhere to do--namely, represent the people of his or her State. Without \nthe filibuster--it has a bad name, old man filibuster out there. Most \npeople would be happy to say let's do away with him. We ought to get \nrid of that fellow; he has been around too long. But someday that old \nman filibuster is going to help me, you, and every Senator in here at \nsome time or other, when the rights of the people he or she represents \nare being violated or threatened. That Senator is then going to want to \nfilibuster. He or she is going to want to stand on his or her feet as \nlong as their brass lungs will carry their voice.\n  No longer. If the nuclear option is successful here, no longer will \neach Senator have that weapon with which to protect the people who sent \nhim or her here. And the people finally are going to wake up to who did \nit. They are going to wake up to it sooner or later and ask: Who did \nthis to us?\n  Without the filibuster or the threat of extended debate, there exists \nno leverage with which to bargain for the offering of an amendment. All \nforce to effect compromise between the parties will be lost. Demands \nfor hearings will languish. The President can simply rule. The \nPresident of the United States can simply rule by Executive order, if \nhis party controls both Houses of Congress and majority rule reigns \nsupreme. In such a world, the minority will be crushed, the power of \ndissenting views will be diminished, and freedom of speech will be \nattenuated. The uniquely American concept of the independent individual \nasserting his or her own views, proclaiming personal dignity through \nthe courage of free speech will forever have been blighted. This is a \nquestion of freedom of speech. That is what we are talking about--\nfreedom of speech. And the American spirit, that stubborn, feisty, \ncontrarian, and glorious urge to loudly disagree, and proclaim, despite \nall opposition, what is honest, what is true, will be sorely manacled.\n  Yes, we believe in majority rule, but we thrive because the minority \ncan challenge, agitate, and ask questions. We must never become a \nnation cowed by fear, sheeplike in our submission to the power of any \nmajority demanding absolute control.\n  Generations of men and women have lived, fought, and died for the \nright to map their own destiny, think their own thoughts, speak their \nown minds. If we start here, in this Senate, to chip away at that \nessential mark of freedom--here of all places, in a body designed to \nguarantee the power of even a single individual through the device of \nextended debate--we are on the road to refuting the principles upon \nwhich that Constitution rests.\n  In the eloquent, homespun words of that illustrious, obstructionist, \nSenator Smith, in ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'':\n\n       Liberty is too precious to get buried in books. Men ought \n     to hold it up in front of them every day of their lives and \n     say, ``I am free--to think--to speak. My ancestors couldn't. \n     I can. My children will.''\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I compliment my friend and colleague from \nWest Virginia for his excellent comments about the responsibilities of \nthe Senate under the Constitution and the implications of a \nparliamentary maneuver that would effectively undermine the \nconstitutional rights of our Members to speak in accordance with the \nways our Founding Fathers intended.\n  Once again, the Senator from West Virginia has spoken eloquently and \npassionately about this institution and about this Constitution. He is \nin this body the true student of the American Constitution. There is in \nthis body no one who works to preserve the rights and responsibilities \nof this institution the way those rights of individuals in this \ninstitution, within the framework of the Constitution, were so \nintended.\n  We, once again, thank him and urge our colleagues in the Senate to \npay close attention to his well thought out, reasoned, compelling, \nlegitimate, and persuasive arguments.\n  They are enormously important because they reach the heart and soul \nof this institution and the heart and soul of the whole constitutional \nframework that our Founding Fathers drafted when they wrote the \nConstitution. It was an extraordinary contribution to the whole debate \nthat takes place in this body from time to time about the authority and \nthe powers of the institution and the individuals who are elected to \nserve. We all will benefit from reading his comments closely.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as I listened to the distinguished Senator \nfrom West Virginia speak against filibuster reform, I wanted to make a \nfew points that he did not say, at least as far as I could tell. I did \nnot hear every word of his speech, but I did hear enough of it.\n  Number one, he did not say that killing judicial nominations by \nfilibuster is part of Senate tradition, nor could he have said that \nbecause for the first time in history, we have had filibusters of \njudicial nominees. Only President Bush's judicial nominees have been \nfilibustered by our colleagues on the other side, and in every case \nwhere they were filibustered, those nominees had majority support.\n  So filibustering judges is not a part of the tradition of the Senate, \nnor has it ever been.\n\n[[Page S1834]]\n\n  Some have said that the Abe Fortas nomination for Chief Justice was \nfilibustered. Hardly. I thought it was, too, until I was corrected by \nthe man who led the fight against Abe Fortas, Senator Robert Griffin of \nMichigan, who then was the floor leader for the Republican side and, \nfrankly, the Democratic side because the vote against Justice Fortas, \npreventing him from being Chief Justice, was a bipartisan vote, a vote \nwith a hefty number of Democrats voting against him as well. Former \nSenator Griffin told me and our whole caucus that there never was a \nreal filibuster because a majority would have beaten Justice Fortas \noutright. Lyndon Johnson, knowing that Justice Fortas was going to be \nbeaten, withdrew the nomination. So that was not a filibuster. There \nhas never been a tradition of filibustering majority supported judicial \nnominees on the floor of the Senate until President Bush became \nPresident.\n  Number two, if I recall it correctly, the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia did not say ruling such filibusters out of order is \nagainst the rules. I do not believe he said that because it is not \nagainst the rules. At least four times in the past, some of which \noccurred when Senator Byrd, the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia, was the majority leader in the Senate, there have been \nattempts to change the Senate's rules on the filibuster. Admittedly, I \nthink in some of those cases the Senate backed down and changed the \nrules, but the effort was made to change the rules, and in the eyes of \nthe Senator from West Virginia and others they should have and could \nhave been changed by majority vote.\n  Let me say, in fact, all of the examples the Senator from West \nVirginia cited of legislative filibusters would not be affected by the \nconstitutional option. That is a constitutional option that would allow \njudicial nominees an up-or-down vote.\n  That is a very important distinction because never before have \njudicial nominees been filibustered. Never before has one side or the \nother, in an intemperate way, decided to deprive the Senate as a whole \nfrom not just its advice function, but its consent function. We \nconsent, or withhold that consent, when we vote up or down on these \nnominees.\n  Filibustering against the legislative calendar items has been \npermitted since 1917, and with good reason. I, for one, agree that this \nis a very good rule. But those filibusters happen on the legislative \ncalendar. That is the calendar of the Senate; it is our legislative \nresponsibility. The filibuster rule, Rule XXII, is to protect the \nminority. Frankly, I would fight for that rule with everything I have. \nBut executive nominees, filibustering on the executive calendar is an \nentirely different situation. And it is one that was not addressed in \nSenator Byrd's remarks.\n  I myself had never looked at this very carefully until this onslaught \nof filibusters against 11 appellate court judges took place on this \nfloor. Then I started to look at it, and others have, too, and we now \nrealize there is a real disregard of a constitutional principle by \nthese unwarranted and, I think, unjustified and unconstitutional \nfilibusters. In these particular cases, every one of those people--\nevery one--had a bipartisan majority waiting to vote on the floor. This \ndistinction is ultimately the critical one. Should a minority be able \nto permanently prevent a vote on a majority supported judicial nominee? \nI think the answer is clearly no, and there is nothing in the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia's remarks that contradict that \nconclusion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/01/senate-section/article/S1834-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1834-S1857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    BANKRUPTCY ABUSE PREVENTION AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT OF 2005\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 15\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to speak on amendment No. 15, which \nI will offer to S. 256.\n  I thank Senators Durbin, Leahy, and Sarbanes for working with me on \nthis legislation, the Credit Card Minimum Payment Warning Act, and for \ncosponsoring the amendment.\n  Mr. President, during all of 1980, only 287,570 consumers filed for \nbankruptcy. As consumer debt burdens have ballooned, the number of \nbankruptcies have increased significantly. From January through \nSeptember of 2004, approximately 1.2 million consumers filed for \nbankruptcy, keeping pace with last year's record level. The growth in \nuse of credit cards can partially explain this surge. Revolving debt, \nmostly compromised of credit card debt, has risen from $54 billion in \nJanuary 1980 to more than $780 billion in November 2004. A U.S. Public \nInterest Research Group and Consumer Federation of America analysis of \nFederal Reserve data indicates that the average household with debt \ncarries approximately $10,000 to $12,000 in total revolving debt.\n  We must make consumers more aware of the long-term effects of their \nfinancial decisions, particularly in managing their credit card debt, \nso that they can avoid financial pitfalls that may lead to bankruptcy.\n  While it is relatively easy to obtain credit, not enough is done to \nensure that credit is properly managed. Currently, credit card \nstatements fail to include vital information that would allow \nindividuals to make fully informed financial decisions. Additional \ndisclosure is needed to ensure that individuals completely understand \nthe implications of their credit card use and the costs of only making \nthe minimum payments as required by credit card companies.\n  S. 256 includes a requirement that credit card issuers provide \nadditional information about the consequences of making minimum \npayments. However, this provision fails to provide the detailed \ninformation for consumers on their billing statement that our amendment \nwould provide. Section 1301 of the bankruptcy bill would allow credit \ncard issuers a choice of disclosures that they must provide on the \nmonthly billing statement.\n  The first option included in the bankruptcy bill would require a \n``Minimum Payment Warning'' stating that it would take 88 months to pay \noff a balance of $1,000 for bank card holders or 24 months to pay off a \nbalance of $300 for retail card holders. It would require a toll-free \nnumber to be established that would provide an estimate of the time it \nwould take to pay off the customer's balance. The Federal Reserve Board \nwould be required to establish a table that would estimate approximate \nnumber of months it would take to pay off a variety of account \nbalances.\n  There is a second option that the legislation permits. The credit \ncard issuer could provide a general minimum payment warning and provide \na toll-free number that consumers could call for the actual number of \nmonths to repay the balance.\n  Both of these options are inadequate. They do not require the issuers \nto provide their customers with the total amount they would pay in \ninterest and principal if they chose to pay off their balance at the \nminimum payment rate. The minimum payment warning included in the first \noption underestimates the costs of paying a balance off at the minimum \npayment. Since the average household with debt carries a balance has \napproximately $10,000 to $12,000 in total revolving debt, a warning \nbased on a much smaller balance, $1,000 or under in this case, will not \nbe helpful. If a family has a credit card debt of $10,000, and the \ninterest rate is a modest 12.4 percent, it would take more than 10\\1/2\\ \nyears to pay off the balance while making minimum monthly payments of 4 \npercent.\n  As we make it more difficult for consumers to discharge their debts \nin bankruptcy, we have a responsibility to provide additional \ninformation so that consumers can make better informed decisions. Our \namendment will make it very clear what costs consumers will incur if \nthey make only the minimum payments on their credit cards. If this \namendment is adopted, the personalized information they will receive \nfor each of their accounts will help them to make informed choices \nabout the payments that they choose to make towards reducing their \noutstanding debt.\n  This amendment requires a minimum payment warning notification on \nmonthly statements stating that making the minimum payment will \nincrease the amount of interest that will be paid and extend the amount \nof time it will take to repay the outstanding balance. The amendment \nalso requires companies to inform consumers of how many years and \nmonths it will take to repay their entire balance if they make\n\n[[Page S1835]]\n\nonly the minimum payments. In addition, the total cost in interest and \nprincipal, if the consumer pays only the minimum payment, would have to \nbe disclosed. These provisions will make individuals much more aware of \nthe true costs of their credit card debts. The amendment also requires \nthat credit card companies provide useful information so that people \ncan develop strategies to free themselves of credit card debt. \nConsumers would have to be provided with the amount they need to pay to \neliminate their outstanding balance within 36 months.\n  Finally, our amendment would require that creditors establish a toll-\nfree number so that consumers can access trustworthy credit counselors. \nIn order to ensure that consumers are referred from the toll-free \nnumber to only trustworthy organizations, the agencies for referral \nwould have to be approved by the Federal Trade Commission and the \nFederal Reserve Board as having met comprehensive quality standards. \nThese standards are necessary because certain credit counseling \nagencies have abused their nonprofit, tax-exempt status and have taken \nadvantage of people seeking assistance in managing their debts. Many \npeople believe, sometimes mistakenly, that they can place blind trust \nin nonprofit organizations and that their fees will be lower than those \nof other credit counseling organizations. Too many individuals may not \nrealize that the credit counseling industry does not deserve the trust \nthat consumers often place in it.\n  Our credit card minimum payment warning legislation has been endorsed \nby the Consumer Federation of America, Consumers Union, U.S. Public \nInterest Research Group, and Consumer Action.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment that will empower \nconsumers by providing them with detailed personalized information to \nassist them in making better informed choices about their credit card \nuse and repayment. This amendment makes clear the adverse consequences \nof uninformed choices, such as making only minimum payments, and \nprovides opportunities to locate assistance to better manage their \ncredit card debts.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nset aside, and I call up amendment No. 15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Akaka], for himself, Mr. \n     Durbin, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. Sarbanes, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 15.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA.

The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we have a lot of urgent problems pressing \nthe Nation and this Congress. We have urgent problems with joblessness. \nWe have urgent problems with the coverage of health care and the costs \nof health care. We have urgent problems with education. We have urgent \nproblems dealing with poverty. We have problems that go to the heart of \nfairness and opportunity in this Nation. These are real problems of \nreal people, and they test whether our commitment to America's core \nvalues is as important to us as we say it is. But we are not spending \nthis month on any of those issues. We are spending most of the time \nbetween now and the March recess on a bill that does nothing about any \nof these problems, that does nothing for Americans facing job problems,\n\n[[Page S1836]]\n\nhealth problems, and education challenges. We are spending our time on \na bill that was written by the credit card industry for the benefit of \nthe credit card industry. We are spending our time on changes in the \nbankruptcy law which were opposed by the two distinguished national \ncommissions which studied those laws during the 1970s and 1990s.\n  This is a bill which is opposed by a long list of organizations \nrepresenting many millions of real people, organizations representing \nworkers, retired Americans, consumers, women's organizations, civil \nrights organizations, a large group of distinguished law professors and \nbankruptcy judges, 1,700 prominent doctors around the country, and even \nsome financial service organizations that are truly responsible lenders \nand care about their customers. I am talking about people such as the \nCEO of ING Direct, the sixth largest thrift institution in the Nation; \npeople like the CEO of the second largest credit union in the U.S., the \nNorth Carolina State Employees' Credit Union.\n  This is what the CEO of ING Direct told the committee about the bill:\n\n       The one-sided provisions of this bankruptcy legislation are \n     bad news for consumers, but they are also bad news for the \n     financial service industry. Consumers are our customers. By \n     creating a form of debt imprisonment, this bill will hobble \n     the most important player in the world economy, the American \n     consumer.\n\n  Jim Blaine, the CEO of the North Carolina State Employees' Credit \nUnion, had this to say about the bill:\n\n       This bird is a turkey.\n\n  So why are we here? Why are we spending our time on this supposed \nresolution to a nonexistent problem rather than addressing the real \nproblems the Nation faces? It cannot be because the credit card \nindustry needs help. The credit card industry is doing just fine, thank \nyou. The profits of the credit card industry rose from $6.4 billion in \n1990 to $20 billion in 2000. By last year, those profits had increased \nanother 50 percent to over $30 billion. Let me say that again. Credit \ncard company profits have gone from $6.4 billion in 1990 to $30.2 \nbillion last year. Why are we spending our time on legislation designed \nto further enrich what is already one of the most profitable industries \nin America at the expense of middle-income Americans in financial \ndistress, in most cases through no fault of their own?\n  This is supposed to be a bill about spendthrifts, about people who \nabuse the credit system and abuse the bankruptcy system. If that were \nreally what this bill was about, maybe there would be some reason for \nus to be here. If this were a bill that dealt with the truly incredible \nabuses of the bankruptcy system that we have seen in the Enron case, in \nthe WorldCom case, in the Adelphia case, and the Polaroid case in my \nown State, then maybe there would be reason to be spending our time \nworking on this bill.\n\n  Look at the Polaroid case in my home State of Massachusetts. Polaroid \nfiled for bankruptcy in 2001. In the months leading up to the company's \nfiling, the corporation made $1.7 million in incentive payments to its \nchief executive Gary DiCamillo on top of his $840,000 base salary. The \ncompany also received bankruptcy court approval to make $1.5 million in \npayments to senior managers to keep them on board. These managers \ncollectively received an additional $3 million when the company's \nassets were sold off.\n  By contrast, just days before Polaroid filed for bankruptcy, it \ncanceled health and life insurance for more than 6,000 retirees and \ncanceled health insurance coverage for workers on long-term disability. \nIt also stopped certain benefits for thousands of workers who were \nrecently laid off. Polaroid workers had been required to pay 8 percent \nof their pay in the company's employee stock ownership plan, the ESOP \nprograms. When the company declined, their retirement savings were \nvirtually wiped out. Now, that is a real abuse of the bankruptcy \nsystem.\n  But this bill is not about consumers who abuse the system. It is not \nabout corporate executives who have exploited the system to line their \nown pockets. This is a bill for which the credit card industry hopes to \nsqueeze a few extra dollars a month out of Americans who are out on \ntheir luck, people who have been hit hard by medical disasters, \nguardsmen and reservists who have suddenly been called to duty to serve \ntheir Nation, forcing them to leave their families and their businesses \nbehind, people who were fired after years of hard work because their \nemployer sent their jobs abroad. This is not what the Senate should be \ndoing. This legislation is not worthy of the Senate. Our time should be \nspent helping, not hurting, the working families most in need.\n  This bill does nothing to protect those hard-working Americans who \ndid everything they could to stave off bankruptcy but were left with no \nother choice after exhausting their own resources. Yet this Republican \nbill actually makes it more difficult for good citizens such as these \nto get the fresh start that the bankruptcy laws are intended to offer.\n  The idea of a fresh start lies at the heart of our bankruptcy law. In \n1833, Supreme Court Justice Joseph Storey, one of the great legal \nscholars in our history, explained why. He said that bankruptcy laws \nwere intended to divide debtors' remaining assets among their creditors \nwhen they could not pay all of their debts, but the purpose was also to \nrelieve unfortunate and honest debtors from perpetual bondage to their \ncreditors. He said that bankruptcy legislation should relieve the \ndebtor from a slavery of mind and body which robs his family of the \nfruits of his labor.\n  One hundred years later, the Supreme Court emphasized Justice Story's \nviews. The Bankruptcy Act, it said, is intended to:\n\n     relieve the honest debtor from the weight of oppressive \n     indebtedness, and permit him to start afresh free from the \n     obligations and responsibilities consequent upon business \n     misfortunes.\n\n  The power to earn a living, the Court said, is a ``personal \nliberty,'' and:\n\n     from the viewpoint of the wage-earner there is little \n     difference between not earning at all and earning wholly for \n     a creditor.\n\n  In short, the same fundamental values which led this Nation to \nabolish debtors' prisons, also led us to offer debtors a fresh start. \nThey would be required to use their available assets to pay as much of \ntheir debt as they could, but no more. They would have full rights to \ntheir own future earnings, so that they would not have to live in \nperpetual bondage to their past debtors.\n  That is the essence of our free enterprise system. We encourage \nentrepreneurs. People can borrow money for a car to go to work, for \nequipment to start a small business, for a tractor to run a farm, for a \nboat to start a fishing business. When decent people run into financial \ntrouble, we don't write them off forever. We help them get back on \ntheir feet so they can provide for their families and contribute to our \neconomy once again. Otherwise, few in America take the risks that our \nfree enterprise depends on. There is a safety net to stop a free fall.\n  Yet this legislation turns its back on that spirit of American \nentrepreneurship. It tells our citizens that they cannot get that fresh \nstart unless they can maneuver through a maze of procedural obstacles \ncreated by the credit card companies and debt collection agencies. It \nimposes paperwork burdens that bankrupt Americans can not afford. It \nforces them to pay for credit counselors, who may be predatory \nthemselves. It forces them to miss work to go to audits of their meager \nassets. It requires them to hire a lawyer to mitigate this maze, but \nthen tells the lawyer that any error will make the lawyer personally \nliable.\n  In short, this bill does everything the mind of the purveyors of \npredatory plastic could think up to make their cardholders pay in full, \nand prevent them from getting the ``fresh start'' that bankruptcy \noffers them. Its purpose is to keep the credit card payments rolling \nin, and prevent that money from being used to feed their children or \npay their hospital bills or make their mortgage payments. It labels \nthem as abusers of the system.\n  Just listen to the words in the summary of the key standard for the \n``means test'' that lies at the heart of this bill. According to this \nsummary, prepared by the Congressional Research Service, you are \npresumed to be an abuser of the system:\n\n     if current monthly income, excluding allowed deductions, \n     secured debt payments, and priority unsecured debt payments, \n     multiplied by 60, would permit a debtor to pay\n\n[[Page S1837]]\n\n     not less than the lesser of (a) 25 percent of nonpriority \n     unsecured debt or $6000 (or $100 a month), whichever is \n     greater, or (b) $10,000.\n\n  Maybe some people can figure that out--most cannot. But that \nconvoluted paragraph determines whether your debts can be discharged in \nbankruptcy, or not.\n  This bill is flawed from top to bottom. That is why, since it was \nfirst presented to Congress by the credit card industry, it has been \nopposed by bankruptcy judges, legal scholars, consumer advocates, labor \nunions, and civil rights groups. They all recognize that its harsh and \nexcessive provisions will have a devastating effect on working \nfamilies.\n  It allows credit card companies to put their profits ahead of the \nwell-being of our troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. Since 9-11 \nabout half a million reservists arid members of the National Guard have \nbeen called to active duty, half a world away from their homes and \nbusinesses. Many of their families are suddenly facing economic \nhardship, and their creditors keep calling. They are serving far away, \nand the small businesses they ran are running into trouble. This bill \ndoes nothing to protect the men and women who are fighting for us.\n  When one reservist left home, his wife had to start leading his \nconstruction company, and the company ran into trouble. Their family \nincome plummeted by 80 percent. They lost their savings, lost their \ncredit, and the business is on the rocks--all because a soldier served \nhis country. The troubles of families like that will be even more \nserious under this bill. Instead of helping to ease the burden, it \ntreats that family like tax evaders or defrauders.\n  This Republican bill also penalizes innocent victims of today's \neconomy. We are stil1 recovering from the 2001 recession. Nearly 8 \nmillion Americans are still unemployed. One in five of those workers \nhas been out of work for more than 6 months. The unemployment insurance \nsafety net they rely on has not been updated to meet today's demands. \nJobs in health care, financial services, and information technology are \nbeing shipped overseas.\n  Workers who lose their jobs today have great difficulty finding a new \njob with comparable wages, benefits, hours, and overall quality. Part-\ntime jobs don't begin to provide the same financial stability--yet \ntoday's companies are relying more and more on part-time workers to cut \ncosts. The average part-time worker earns $4 an hour less than a \nregular full-time worker. Few part-time workers have a health insurance \nplan or a pension plan.\n  Huge numbers of working families are being squeezed hard by the \ncurrent economy. Their ability to live the American dream is \nincreasingly out of reach with each passing year. They find it harder \nand harder to earn a living--to pay the mortgage, pay the rent, pay \ntheir medical bill, pay their food bill, pay their gasoline bill, pay \nthe college bill. Yet the cost of getting by continues to rise faster \nthan family income.\n  Healthcare costs are out of reach. Health insurance premiums have \nsoared 59 percent in the past 4 years. Drug costs have soared 65 \npercent.\n  Housing costs rose 33 percent in the last 4 years. Child care can \noften cost up to $10,000 a year for one child--more than the cost of \ntuition at a public college. College costs are rising at double-digit \nrates. Tuition at public colleges has risen 35 percent in the last 4 \nyears.\n  Today, hardworking families are balancing on a precarious tower of \nbills that keep piling. Inevitably, many topple over. They go into debt \njust to get by. The average family now spends 13 percent of its income \nto pay debts--the highest percentage since 1986. The average household \nnow has more than $8,000 in credit card debt. More than half of all \nAmericans acknowledge they have too much debt. Three-quarters of that \ndebt is a major reason it's harder to achieve the American dream today. \nIt is no wonder so many families face bankruptcy.\n  This year, more people will end up in bankruptcy than suffer a heart \nattack. More people will file for bankruptcy than graduate from \ncollege. More children will grow up in families facing bankruptcy than \nin families facing divorce.\n  Many of us feel the Bush administration is bankrupt in more ways than \none. Its reckless policies are bankrupting the economy and literally \nbankrupting millions of families. Bankruptcy is up 33 percent since \nPresident Bush took office. An American now goes bankrupt every 19 \nseconds. In Massachusetts, there is a bankruptcy every half hour.\n  One of the greatest weaknesses of this bill is its failure to address \nthe issue of bankruptcies caused by serious illness or injury. Illness \nis bankrupting millions of Americans who have done everything right. \nThey have worked hard, played by the rules, earned a good salary, saved \ntheir money, even purchased health insurance--only to find all that is \nnot enough.\n  More than half of all families facing bankruptcy today are facing it \nbecause of overwhelming medical costs. They are not irresponsible \nspendthrifts who bought too much at the mall, or were enticed to go in \nover their heads in debt by a credit card solicitation they couldn't \nsay no to. They are facing bankruptcy because of a sudden serious \nillness or a severe injury that caused a mountain of debt they couldn't \nafford.\n\n  The average American facing a serious illness is burdened with more \nthan $13,000 of out-of-pocket expenses, even though they have health \ninsurance. If you have cancer, it is $35,000. That is money you have to \npay out of your own pocket for expenses not covered by your health \ninsurance.\n  If the bill before us passes, those fellow citizens will be penalized \ntwice--once by the failure of the health care system and a second time \nby the failure of the bankruptcy laws. This bill will only make the \nsecond failure even worse.\n  We need to make sure that bankruptcy continues to be available as a \nsafety net for those Americans--men and women who have spent down their \nsavings on a serious injury or illness, who face huge doctor and \nhospital bills their insurance didn't cover, who are unable to go back \nto work after suffering serious medical problems.\n  They are people such as April Wetherell, a 50-year-old woman from \nToms River, NJ, who went back to school after raising her children and \nreceived her master's degree in social work. She was serving as a \nvisiting nurse 2 years ago, when she suffered a stroke while recovering \nfrom knee surgery. The stroke left her unable to speak, work, or care \nfor her own needs. At the time, April still owed $25,000 in student \nloans. She had been making payments faithfully on her student loans \nuntil her illness left her unable to return to her job. Her health \ninsurance did not cover all her medical costs, and she was left with \nmore than $20,000 in unpaid medical bills. At the time of her stroke, \nshe had about $7,000 in credit card debt, which she had been paying off \non time. Even though she had done all the right things, she was forced \ninto bankruptcy because of her serious, incapacitating illness.\n\n  Walton Pinkney of Frederick, MD, has been an electrician for more \nthan 10 years. He changed jobs in 2000, and his new employer did not \nprovide health benefits for the first 90 days of employment. Sadly, \nWalton suffered heart failure during his first month on his new job. \nHis new health plan had not yet taken effect, and he was responsible \nfor more than $45,000 in medical expenses for his heart condition. He \ntried to return to work, but his employer said his health was too \nuncertain for him to return. Faced with large medical bills he could \nnot pay after he lost his job, he had to file for bankruptcy in 2003.\n  Zoraya Marrero is a single mother with three children from \nWoodbridge, VA. Her oldest child suffers from spina bifida. She \nreceived State disability benefits and medical coverage for her child \ndue to the illness. After moving to another State 5 years ago, she no \nlonger qualified for new benefits, and she also had to pay back $60,000 \nfor benefits she had already received. She has been fighting the \n$60,000 claim and paying her own medical expenses while working in a \ndoctor's office. She cannot afford private insurance, and cannot afford \nto pay for her son's costly medical care. Overwhelmed by debt, she \nfiled for bankruptcy.\n  These people had no intention of seeking relief in bankruptcy. They \nwere not ``gaming'' the system to avoid their responsibilities. They \nand millions of other Americans in similar circumstances filed for \nbankruptcy, but\n\n[[Page S1838]]\n\nonly after they had exhausted all the other options--not because they \nwanted to but because they had to.\n  In fact, before declaring bankruptcy, they had spent at least 2 \nyears, on average, making very real sacrifices in a futile effort to \npay for their health care and make ends meet. One in five went without \nfood. Almost one-third had their electricity shut off.\n  I am talking about individuals who went into bankruptcy as a result \nof medical expenses, even though about 65 percent of them had health \ninsurance before they actually went into bankruptcy. That is what they \ndid, according to the Elizabeth Warren report from the Harvard Law \nSchool.\n  One in five went without food, almost a third had their electricity \nshut off, almost half lost their phone service, many went without \nneeded medical care, and some even moved their elderly parents to less \ncomfortable nursing homes.\n  As this chart indicates, here is what has happened to the lavish \nlifestyle of our fellow citizens. These are half of all the \nbankruptcies at the present time. How did they live, and what did they \ndo for 2 years before filing for bankruptcy? They went without needed \nmedical care, 61 percent; without doctors, 50 percent; utilities turned \noff, 30 percent; without food, 22 percent; and 70 percent moved their \nelderly parents to cheaper care facilities.\n  These are our fellow Americans whom we want to punish with this \nbankruptcy bill? If you want to go after the spendthrifts, let us do \nthat. But do you think we are going after corporate America in this \nbankruptcy bill? Read today's newspaper. Here it is: Former WorldCom \nchief executive, once hailed as one of the most brilliant \ntelecommunications executives, told the packed courtroom, ``I don't \nknow about technology; I don't know about finance; also, I don't know \nabout accounting.''\n  There it is. The corporate CEOs will be able to escape.\n  But do you think these hard-working Americans are going to be able to \nescape anything with this bill at all to deal with WorldCom, Enron, \nPolaroid? There is absolutely nothing in here. Yet there is the result \nof what this legislation does.\n  Generally around here, we have legislation that is reasonably \nbalanced. Not this piece of legislation. The most profitable industry \nin the country, 100-percent profits in the last 5 years, and they are \nout there trying to squeeze some additional money ought of these hard-\nworking Americans. I would have thought at least a majority who were \ngoing to write this legislation here in the Senate would have tried to \ndo something about corporate bankruptcies. But, no, no. They are \nletting those individuals alone, and most of those--we come back a \nlittle later to discuss how they profited--a number of them even \nprofited after they went into bankruptcy. There is even one individual \nwho profited after he was convicted of larceny. But we are not dealing \nwith those particular issues.\n  We often talk in America about safety nets. Social Security is a \nsafety net to guarantee financial security for senior citizens. Poverty \nprograms are safety nets for children and families. Our bankruptcy laws \nare a safety net for millions of families, too.\n  Americans who live responsibly, do everything right, and still \nsuddenly fall on hard times deserve a second chance, and the bankruptcy \nlaws give them that chance. They can make a fresh start and pull \nthemselves back up. They have renewed hope for the future.\n  Unexpected financial setbacks for families should not mean the end of \ntheir American dream. They should not lose all hope for themselves and \ntheir children. It's the old ``cowboy up'' philosophy--when you fall \noff your horse, you pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and start all \nover again.\n  When disaster strikes, when storms buffet a community, Americans \nrespond. We see the images on television and immediately we send a \ndonation to help out. That's the American spirit.\n  But when financial disaster strikes a family--when a business \ncollapses, when medical bills pile up, when a reservist is called up \nfor extended active duty, when workers lose their jobs because of a \nplant closing or outsourcing--the economic catastrophes can be hidden \nfrom view. That is where our bankruptcy laws come in. We got rid of \ndebtors' prisons almost two centuries ago for a reason. It is the \nAmerican spirit to help these families through financial disasters.\n  But this bill will destroy that financial safety net for many, many \ncitizens who deserve help.\n  This legislation is a bonanza for banks and credit card companies, \nand a nightmare for millions of average Americans. It rewrites the \nbankruptcy laws in a way that kicks average families while they're \ndown, in order to pad the already high profits of the credit card \nindustry and other lenders. It is greed, pure and simple.\n  Predatory credit card companies are doing all they can to urge \nunsuspecting citizens to pile up huge debts on their credit cards. They \nespecially target the elderly, college students, and the working poor. \nThey advertise nationwide. They send out billions of solicitations \nevery year to entice more people to sign up for their cards. The bold \ntype talks about the minimum monthly payments--but you have to read the \nfine print to see the exorbitant interest payments that inevitably \nresult.\n  You cannot go to any college campus, any sporting event, or your \nmailbox without being solicited for another credit card, no matter how \nmany you already have. Young students, still in their teens, are \ngreeted with a deluge of offers from credit card companies. Before they \nbuy books and find the cafeteria, they see credit card offers with \ncredit lin1its in the thousands of dollars.\n  So, in many cases, the very same companies that have been trying to \nget a bill like this passed for decades and had their lobbyists write \nthis bill for them in 1997, are the ones who caused the indebtedness \nthat they now complain about.\n  Does this bill do anything abut that? Absolutely not.\n  A lot has changed since the Senate last looked at this bill 4 years \nago. Health costs are way up, health insurance protection is less \nobtainable and less affordable, hundreds of thousands of families have \nsuffered economically from military callups, unemployment insurance has \nnot been updated.\n  The economy is still working its way out of a serious downturn. \nCorporate mismanagement and fraud have become a way of life in the \nhighest echelons of corporate America.\n  So I say to each of our colleagues, please consider who wrote this \nbill and why. Please think about your hard-working constituents who \nwill be dealt a double whammy by this bill if they fall on hard times. \nPlease think about what has happened since we last considered the bill. \nPlease keep an open mind as we discuss the serious problems with this \nbill and the need for many substantial revisions and additions before \nit is ready to even be considered for adoption by this body.\n  We do not work for the credit card companies; we work for our \nconstituents. We can do better than this bill for our constituents, and \nwe must do better than this bill for those we represent.\n  Mr. President, I will unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nsome of the letters opposing the bill. I will not include all of the \nletters, but I am going to quote from some of them at this time.\n  First of all, I refer to a letter from ING Direct to the American \nBankers Association urging them to reconsider their support for the \nbill:\n\n       As a member of the American Bankers Association, ING Direct \n     urges you to reconsider your wholesale support for the \n     Bankruptcy Reform Bill currently before the United States \n     Senate. . . . Yet this legislation has not received a \n     thorough review in the last 4 years. It has simply been \n     reproposed without careful thought. . . . It actually \n     encourages further bad lending decisions by removing an \n     important market discipline--the possibility of a clean \n     bankruptcy. Without important changes, millions of consumers, \n     who might otherwise be encouraged into debt by aggressive \n     credit card companies and other lending. They will be unable \n     to clear their names, even if they fall into debt because of \n     an illness or an economic downturn that costs them their \n     employment.\n       We at ING Direct believe this country is still willing to \n     give working Americans--the engine of our economy, a second \n     chance when debt overwhelms them. This bill seriously limits \n     that second chance. The one-sided provisions of this \n     bankruptcy legislation are bad news for most Americans. But \n     they are also bad news for the financial services industry. \n     By creating a form of debt imprisonment, this bill will \n     hobble the most important player in the world economy--the\n\n[[Page S1839]]\n\n     American working family. For all these reasons, we ask you to \n     reconsider the ABA's support of this bill in its current \n     incarnation.\n\n  This is written by Arkadi Kuhlmann who is the president of the \ncompany. It is the sixth largest thrift savings company in the country.\n  The second letter is from the Consumers Union:\n\n       Much evidence suggests that rising consumer bankruptcies \n     are tied to abusive lending practices by creditors. Yet this \n     bill does nothing to address this fundamental problem. \n     Instead, the bill protects predatory lenders who offer \n     credit, with abusive repayment terms, to high-risk consumers. \n     It also provides creditors with additional opportunities to \n     employ strong-arm collection tactics, threatening debtors \n     with new, costly litigation.\n\n  Furthermore, the bill protects credit card companies who fail to \ndisclose the true cost of credit they provide to college students and \nothers, who may quickly find themselves trapped in serious debt, \nruining their credit ratings for years to come.\n  This is what they are pointing out.\n  Furthermore, the bill protects credit card companies who fail to \ndisclose the true cost of credit they provide to college students and \nothers who may quickly find themselves trapped in serious debt, ruining \ntheir credit rating for years to come.\n  I will include those sections. The list goes on. I have a number of \nletters and communications from consumer groups, from women's groups, \nchildren's groups, and from the doctors association that has been \nformed to bring focus and attention to the impact of this legislation \nand medical bills on families. I will also include in the Record a \nletter from one of the largest credit unions in the country from North \nCarolina. I ask unanimous consent that several of these letters be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  National Women's Law Center,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 23, 2005.\n     Re: Oppose S. 256, The Bankruptcy Act of 2005\n\n       Dear Senator: The National Women's Law Center is writing to \n     urge you to oppose S. 256, a bankruptcy bill that is harsh on \n     economically vulnerable women and their families, but that \n     fails to address serious abuses of the bankruptcy system by \n     perpetrators of violence against patients and health care \n     professionals at women's health care clinics.\n       This bill would inflict additional hardship on over one \n     million economically vulnerable women and families who are \n     affected by the bankruptcy system each year: those forced \n     into bankruptcy because of job loss, medical emergency, or \n     family breakup--factors which account for nine out of ten \n     filings--and women who are owed child or spousal support by \n     men who file for bankruptcy. Contrary to the claims of some \n     proponents of the bill, low- and moderate-income filers--who \n     are disproportionately women--are not protected from most of \n     its harsh provisions, and mothers owed child or spousal \n     support are not protected from increased competition from \n     credit card companies and other commercial creditors during \n     and after bankruptcy that will make it harder for them to \n     collect support.\n       The bill would make it more difficult for women facing \n     financial crises to regain their economic stability through \n     the bankruptcy process. S. 256 would make it harder for women \n     to access the bankruptcy system, because the means test \n     requires additional paperwork of even the poorest filers; \n     harder for women to save their homes, cars, and essential \n     household items through the bankruptcy process; and harder \n     for women to meet their children's needs after bankruptcy \n     because many more debts would survive.\n       The bill also would put women owed child or spousal support \n     who are bankruptcy creditors at a disadvantage. By increasing \n     the rights of many other creditors, including credit card \n     companies, finance companies, auto lenders and others, the \n     bill would set up an intensified competition for scarce \n     resources between mothers and children owed support and these \n     commercial creditors during and after bankruptcy. The \n     domestic support provisions in the bill may have been \n     intended to protect the interests of mothers and children; \n     unfortunately, they fail to do so.\n       Moving child support to first priority among unsecured \n     creditors in Chapter 7 sounds good, but is virtually \n     meaningless; even today, with no means test limiting access \n     to Chapter 7, fewer than four percent of Chapter 7 debtors \n     have anything to distribute to unsecured creditors. In \n     Chapter 13, the bill would require that larger payments be \n     made to many commercial creditors; as a result, payments of \n     past-due child support would have to be made in smaller \n     amounts and over a longer period of time, increasing the risk \n     that child support debts will not be paid in full. And, when \n     the bankruptcy process is over, women and children owed \n     support would face increased competition from commercial \n     creditors. Under current law, child and spousal support are \n     among the few debts that survive bankruptcy; under this bill, \n     many additional debts would survive. But once the bankruptcy \n     process is over, the priorities that apply during bankruptcy \n     have no meaning or effect. Women and children owed support \n     would be in direct competition with the sophisticated \n     collection departments of commercial creditors whose \n     surviving claims would be increased.\n       At the same time, the bill fails to address real abuses of \n     the bankruptcy system. Perpetrators of violence against \n     patients and health care professionals at women's health \n     clinics have engaged in concerted efforts to use the \n     bankruptcy system to evade responsibility for their illegal \n     actions. This bill does nothing to curb this abuse.\n       The bill is profoundly unfair and unbalanced. Unless there \n     are major changes to S. 256, we urge you to oppose it.\n           Very truly yours,\n     Nancy Duff Campbell,\n       Co-President.\n     Marcia Greenberger,\n       Co-President.\n     Joan Entmacher,\n       Vice President and Director, Family Economic Security.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            National Consumer Law Center Inc.,\n\n                                    Boston, MA, February 28, 2005.\n       Dear Senator: The National Consumer Law Center, on behalf \n     of its low income clients, writes to express our strong \n     opposition to S. 256, the ``Bankruptcy Abuse and Consumer \n     Protection Act of 2005.'' This bill would hurt many Americans \n     who are facing financial problems due to job loss, transition \n     to lower paying jobs, divorce, child-rearing, lack of medical \n     insurance, or predatory lending practices. Although the \n     economy has improved recently for some American families, \n     there are millions of other families that continue to \n     struggle. In fact, real incomes have declined since 1989 for \n     the lowest 60 percent of the American population--including \n     especially single parent households. S. 256 contains a \n     shocking number of provisions which would have a severe \n     impact on families who desperately need to preserve their \n     homes from foreclosure and their cars from repossession, or \n     to focus their income on reasonable and necessary support for \n     dependent children. Here are just a few things the bill's \n     sponsors have failed to discuss:\n       The key cause of the increase in bankruptcies is surely \n     that more families owe more money. The amount of consumer \n     credit outstanding increased from 789 billion dollars in 1990 \n     to 1.7 trillion dollars in 2001. During this time, there was \n     a steady increase in the amount of debt payments American \n     families made as a percentage of their disposable income. \n     Although the total number of bankruptcies has increased, the \n     number of bankruptcies in relation to the amount of credit \n     outstanding has actually gone down.\n       A big part of the equation is that some segments of the \n     credit industry, such as credit card companies, make huge \n     profits from lending to American families who cannot afford \n     to pay big card balances and who therefore pay interest on \n     those balances at rates of 29 percent or higher. It is not \n     surprising that when the credit industry sends three billion \n     credit card solicitations each year, they reach some \n     significant portion of American families who will ultimately \n     have financial problems.\n       The journal Health Affairs recently published a path-\n     breaking joint study by researchers at Harvard Law School and \n     Harvard Medical School that reveals alarming information \n     about the medical causes of bankruptcy. The researchers found \n     that illness and medical bills contributed to at least 46.2 \n     percent, and as many as 54.5 percent of all bankruptcy \n     filings. Families with children were especially hard hit--\n     about 700,000 children lived in families that declared \n     bankruptcy in the aftermath of serious medical problems.\n       Cutting down the number of bankruptcy filings will not \n     result in savings for the credit industry or for other \n     consumers. The vast majority of debt discharged in bankruptcy \n     would not be paid back in any event, since the debtors \n     involved simply cannot afford to pay. A number of studies \n     have shown that the ``means test'' will raise little in new \n     money for creditors.\n       S. 256 contains a variety of poorly conceived provisions \n     which are discussed in more detail in our paper entitled, \n     ``What's Wrong with S. 256, Let Us Count the Ways . . .'', \n     available at: http://www.nclc.org/. If enacted, S. 256 would:\n       Subject debtors to a ``means test'' that fails to screen \n     for abuse and instead penalizes honest debtors by imposing \n     additional costs and filing burdens.\n       Create a ``safe harbor'' from the means test for low-income \n     debtors, but still subject them to increased costs and filing \n     requirements.\n       Require stricter scrutiny of low-income debtors' expenses \n     in chapter 13 than higher income debtors and make some \n     debtors too rich for chapter 7 and too poor for chapter 13.\n       Erode bankruptcy's fresh start by making more debts \n     nondischargeable in both chapters 7 and 13.\n       Promote predatory lending by encouraging creditors to take \n     liens on household goods of nominal value.\n       Create new creditor opportunities for reaffirmation abuses \n     by weakening current debtor protections and giving creditors \n     safe harbor from liability.\n\n[[Page S1840]]\n\n       Undermine debtors' ability to save homes and cars in \n     chapter 13.\n       Drastically reduce fundamental protections afforded debtors \n     under the automatic stay.\n       Provide vast new opportunities for identity theft and other \n     privacy invasion by making public tax returns and sensitive \n     financial documents of consumers who file bankruptcy.\n       As an organization which represents poor people, the \n     National Consumer Law Center vehemently disputes the credit \n     industry position that S. 256 will not hurt low-income \n     debtors. It is precisely those debtors who would be hurt the \n     most. The myriad new procedural requirements together with \n     the dozens of provisions which give creditors an opportunity \n     to pursue new types of litigation against debtors will raise \n     the cost of bankruptcy for all debtors. Other provisions will \n     take away important rights under current bankruptcy law to \n     save homes from foreclosure and evictions, and to challenge \n     predatory lending practices. Now is not the time to cut back \n     on the availability of a system which provides a second \n     chance to the unfortunate in the form of a fresh financial \n     start.\n           Sincerely,\n     Willard P. Ogburn,\n       Executive Director.\n     John Rao,\n       Attorney.\n                                  ____\n\n         A National Health Program, Selected Massachusetts \n           Physician Co-Signers,\n                                   Chicago, IL, February 14, 2005.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: We write, as physicians, to urge \n     rejection of Senate Bill 256, which would make bankruptcy \n     filing more difficult and punitive for millions of Americans \n     driven to financial ruin by medical problems. As health costs \n     spiral upward and insurance coverage shrinks, more and more \n     of our patients find that illness results in financial \n     catastrophe and bankruptcy. Only universal, comprehensive \n     health insurance coverage under a national health insurance \n     plan can really solve this problem. But pending such \n     solution, many families' only chance for financial recovery \n     lies in the limited protections available through the \n     bankruptcy courts.\n       Last year one million Americans filed for bankruptcy in a \n     last-ditch effort to deal with the fallout from a serious \n     medical problem. Unfortunately, the very week that a Harvard \n     Medical/Law School study documented this fact, legislation \n     was re-filed that would greatly reduce the bankruptcy \n     protections available to the medically bankrupt. S. 256 would \n     drive up costs for every family filing for bankruptcy, \n     regardless of whether the reason is too many trips to the \n     mall or a visit to the emergency room. S. 256 would also \n     narrow bankruptcy protection for all families, increasing the \n     ability of creditors to collect from their debtors after \n     bankruptcy regardless of the reason for bankruptcy, and \n     causing many more families to lose their homes and their cars \n     because of medical problems.\n       We are particularly worried that more punitive bankruptcy \n     laws will further erode access to care for many families \n     under financial duress and result in preventable suffering \n     and even death. Already, families who file for medical \n     bankruptcy suffer severe privations. According to the Harvard \n     study: 61 percent of medical bankrupts didn't seek medical \n     treatments they needed; 50 percent failed to fill a \n     prescription; 22 percent went without food; 7 percent moved \n     their elderly parents to cheaper care facilities.\n       We make a plea for the one million sick and injured people \n     who turned to the bankruptcy system for relief last year. \n     Please reject S. 256.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                     Julius B.

If passed, the bill would effectively close bankruptcy \n     as an option and allow creditors to take the homes, cars and \n     other assets of families who suffer a serious illness or \n     injury.\n       ``It's a sad fact that bankruptcy courts have become the \n     last line of defense for the victims of our broken health \n     system,'' said Dr. David Himmelstein, an Associate Professor \n     of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and lead author of the \n     study. ``For many families affected by a costly illness, the \n     limited protections of bankruptcy are the only chance to get \n     back on their feet.''\n       In the letter to the leaders of the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee, which is currently considering the bill, the \n     doctors expressed concern that the new bankruptcy rules would \n     further restrict the ability of patients suffering from \n     medical costs to get needed care for themselves and their \n     families.\n       ``Medical debtors' access to care is already severely \n     compromised: more than 60 percent go without a needed doctor \n     visit and half don't fill a prescription because of the \n     costs,'' said Dr. Steffie Woolhandler, who is also an \n     Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard and co-author of \n     the study. ``For those unable to seek relief from their \n     debts, the situation will undoubtedly get worse,'' she said.\n       The epidemic of medical bankruptcies, which affect 2 \n     million Americans (including 700,000 children) every year, \n     emphasizes the need for comprehensive health insurance \n     coverage under a national health insurance plan according to \n     the signers, who include former U.S. Surgeon General Julius \n     Richmond.\n       ``Current insurance policies offer paltry protection for \n     the average American,'' said Dr. Quentin Young, National \n     Coordinator of Physicians for a National Health Program. \n     ``Most of those who are bankrupted by medical bills are \n     middle class people who had coverage but were mined by the \n     massive holes in their policies.

William Frist, \n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate.\n\n       Dear Majority Leader Frist and Senator Reid: The \n     undersigned financial institutions and associations write in \n     opposition to S. 256. We believe that S. 256 \n     disproportionately harms vulnerable debtors while rewarding \n     creditors who provide excess credit or who impose unfair \n     terms on borrowers. Further, we are concerned that the \n     changes to the bankruptcy code proposed in S. 256 are likely \n     to make more homeowners vulnerable to abusive lending and \n     fraudulent credit counseling practices.\n       Bankruptcy is first and foremost a means to enable \n     overburdened families to get a fresh start. Nearly all \n     families in the bankruptcy system are there not because they \n     want to evade their obligations, but because they have had a \n     sudden decline in their economic fortunes. More than 90 \n     percent of debtors file for bankruptcy due to unemployment or \n     underemployment, an illness or accident, or divorce. The bulk \n     of the remainder suffered from other legitimate difficulties, \n     including activation for military service, being a victim of \n     crime or natural disasters, or a death in the family.\n       Abusive lending practices, especially by credit card \n     lenders, are a larger problem than debtor abuse of the \n     bankruptcy system. Growth in the bankruptcy filing rate tends \n     to increase with an increase in the ratio of household debt \n     to household disposable income. Given this fact, the \n     unfettered increase in available credit likely has \n     contributed significantly to the rise in bankruptcy filings \n     in recent years. For example, in 2000 the credit card \n     industry offered almost $3 trillion in credit--more than \n     three times the $777 billion of credit offered in 1993. \n     Excessive credit extension by unscrupulous lenders makes it \n     more difficult for responsible lenders to monitor their \n     debtors and preserve healthy lending portfolios.\n       Some creditors seem to want to have it both ways: keep \n     interest rates high and underwriting standards loose, while \n     amending the bankruptcy laws to decrease losses resulting \n     from questionable extensions of credit. S. 256 unnecessarily \n     serves the interests of these credit card lenders--who are \n     experiencing record profits--at the expense of the vast \n     majority of families who declare bankruptcy for legitimate \n     reasons. Credit card lenders already cover losses by charging \n     extremely high interest rates at a time of historically low \n     rates, and they are able, should they choose, to limit losses \n     further by tightening underwriting standards. Irresponsible \n     lenders need to be reined in, not rewarded with \n     legislation that further harms suffering families.\n       S. 256 will effectively deny bankruptcy protection to tens \n     of thousands of innocent lawabiding families who suffer \n     significant setbacks. Many of these families will lose \n     everything they own to creditors while remaining indefinitely \n     subject to their unsecured creditors, unable to ever get back \n     on their feet. Furthermore, by discouraging those who truly \n     need bankruptcy relief from seeking it, S. 256 may increase \n     the number of families that turn instead to unscrupulous \n     lenders and dubious credit counselors who do more harm than \n     good.\n       First, S. 256 inflexibly forces more borrowers to file \n     under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code, notwithstanding the \n     fact that an independent academic study on the subject found \n     that less than four percent of debtors who filed under \n     Chapter 7 (where unsecured debt is discharged) couldn't \n     possibly repay any of their unsecured debt under Chapter 13. \n     Some families need to file under Chapter 7 because they \n     cannot afford to meet their housing, car, and student loan \n     obligations (which they generally have to pay under Chapter \n     7), pay their short-term unsecured debt, and still have money \n     left over for basic household needs. Forcing these people to \n     file under Chapter 13 threatens to exacerbate their suffering \n     without significantly benefiting creditors; you cannot \n     extract blood from a stone. Despite the good-faith\n\n[[Page S1841]]\n\n     repayment efforts of many debtors, historically nearly two-\n     thirds of all Chapter 13 debtors fail to complete their \n     repayment plans even before additional Chapter 7 debtors, who \n     would be even less likely to complete Chapter 13 plans, are \n     forced to enter Chapter 13. Adding insult to injury, S. 256 \n     makes it extremely difficult for borrowers to file a Chapter \n     7 bankruptcy once a Chapter 13 repayment plan fails, leaving \n     these borrowers entirely unprotected.\n       Second, S. 256 creates so many disadvantages to filing \n     bankruptcy that severely strapped borrowers may forego filing \n     altogether and instead try to solve their problems by \n     borrowing money on abusive and unfair terms. For instance, S. \n     256 makes it harder for debtors to save their cars in \n     bankruptcy, makes it easier for creditors to take basic \n     household goods from debtors, and requires additional \n     procedures that delay initiation of a bankruptcy. Desperate \n     borrowers who should be seeking bankruptcy protection may \n     attempt to solve their problems by responding to \n     solicitations from unscrupulous lenders who push abusive home \n     refinance loans, dishonest credit counselors who bilk debtors \n     rather than help them, payday lenders who profit from \n     families caught in a debt trap, or a host of other bad \n     actors.\n       While as financial institutions and associations we are \n     well aware that there are problems with our bankruptcy \n     system, current judicial discretion is far preferable to the \n     unbalanced bill before you. We therefore urge you to oppose \n     S. 256 and to revisit the issue of bankruptcy in a manner \n     that equitably meets the interests both of lenders and of \n     vulnerable borrowers.\n           Sincerely,\n       Martin Eakes, CEO, Self-Help Credit Union.\n       Jim Blaine, State Employees' Credit Union, North Carolina.\n       Terry D.

Mr. President, I want to speak for a few more moments \nabout the excellent amendment that has been offered by my friend and \ncolleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin, which I strongly support. \nYesterday, in Massachusetts, I had an opportunity to have a meeting \nwith a number of veterans. They actually were disabled veterans. We \nhave 34 Massachusetts young men who have been killed primarily in Iraq. \nI think we had two killed in Afghanistan, but primarily Iraq. And we \nhave had a number of wounded veterans.\n  We had a very good meeting about their reentry into the community and \nwhat we can do to help them in terms of education, training, and \nemployment. A number of the large companies in Massachusetts have made \nimportant commitments to employ veterans, and particularly the disabled \nveterans. I will mention one: Home Depot, a national company, employed \n10,000 veterans last year. They expect to exceed that number this year. \nIt is a very impressive record.\n  These young people are looking for how they are going to be able to \nlive and have useful, productive, constructive, valuable lives. There \nis a lot that has to be done, obviously, by the VA and by the various \norganizations in the State and in the private sector, as well as at the \nnational level, to help them in these ways. We can all be extremely \ninvolved and helpful in that endeavor.\n  One of the central concerns they mentioned during the course of the \ndiscussion had to do with the times they heard from a number of their \nfriends and colleagues who were in the Guard and Reserve serving in \nIraq. We have 1,000 at the present time serving from Massachusetts and \nmany more in the regular services. They are in the Guard and Reserve. \nBut they told me of the concern their families have in terms of the \ndangers of bankruptcy and what would happen to these families. I do not \nthink it is enough to say, well, we'll defer this to another day, or \nthe existing laws are going to take care of it. We have a good \nopportunity to address that. And if we are serious about addressing it, \nwe ought to accept the Durbin amendment. We are either going to be \nserious about doing this or we are not. The Durbin amendment is a \nserious effort to address this issue, and it deserves all of our \nsupport.\n  Military families struggle financially for a number of reasons. \nOften, the low pay for newly enlisted men and women is not enough to \nsupport a family. Service men and women are also prey to predatory \nlending schemes that leave their families high and dry. Military \nretirees have been victims of pension schemes that destroy their \nsavings. National Guard and reservists often face a loss of income when \nthey are activated and deployed, and their families are left in serious \nfinancial distress. Veterans are not getting the federally promised \nhealth care benefits they need to stay healthy.\n  The most recent data available show that in 2003, 20,000 active-duty \nmembers filed for bankruptcy. They would be considered active duty, \neven though they are in the Reserve or Guard because they are on active \nduty. That is 20,000 members of the Armed Forces whose service to their \ncountry resulted in financial ruin. Military service should be the \nsource of pride, growth, and opportunity, not a financial crisis.\n  That is why Senator Durbin's amendment is so important. It will \nensure fair and strong bankruptcy protections for military families and \nveterans.\n  The typical family who files for bankruptcy is at or near poverty at \nthe time they file. It is appalling that America's service men and \nwomen, or any veteran, can be plunged into poverty in connection with \ntheir service to the Nation.\n  The base pay for newly enlisted men and women is often between \n$15,000 and $20,000 a year. That is far from enough to support a family \nback home. Yet nearly half of all members of the military have \ndependents who rely on their income. The most recent data shows that \nmore than 6,000 military families are forced to rely on food stamps. Do \nwe hear that? We have 6,000 military families who are forced to rely on \nfood stamps because of low pay. I pay tribute to our friend from \nArizona, Senator McCain, who did so much to reduce that number. I am \nhopeful we can eliminate it during this session of Congress.\n\n  In addition, predatory lenders often prey on service men and women. \nPayday lenders offer high-interest, short-term loans of usually $500 or \nless, and focus on the military, with their financial inexperience and \nregular paychecks. These loans result in huge interest rates and often \nleave the borrower in significant debt that can lead to bankruptcy. The \nDurbin amendment will protect military members against this shameful \npractice.\n  National Guard members and reservists have other types of financial \nburdens. Since 9/11, 469,000 National Guard members and reservists from \nthe Army, Navy, Marines, and Air Force have been called up for combat \ntours in Iraq or Afghanistan. That is virtually half a million. Their \ntours of duty can last for up to 2 years, and the Pentagon is currently \nconsidering broadening even that time limit. These deployments can \ncause extraordinary financial stress for their families.\n  For example, an Army reservist medic with four teenage kids in Hot \nSprings, AR left for Iraq, leaving his family's gas station convenience \nstore with no one to operate it. One month later, the family fell into \nserious financial trouble. They had no choice but to file for \nbankruptcy.\n  After the bankruptcy, they couldn't pay their mortgage and had to \ngive up their house. They moved in with the soldier's parents. But \nbecause the parents had cosigned on the loan for the store, they were \nforced to file for bankruptcy, too, or risk losing their own home. The \ngrandfather is disabled, so the grandmother had to go back to work to \nkeep the family financially afloat.\n  Too many National Guard reservist families face this type of economic \ndistress. Thirty percent of spouses of active reservists report a loss \nof household income after the reservists' mobilization. Forty percent \nof all reservists report loss of income. For those who are self-\nemployed, it's even worse. Half of self-employed reservists lose income \nwhen they are deployed.\n  Of spouses who reported lost income, half had monthly decreases from \n$500 and $2,000 per month, and nearly a quarter lost over $2,000 a \nmonth. That's $24,000 a year in lost income that puts a heavy financial \nsqueeze on these families.\n  With other key expenses rising every year in the Bush administration, \nit's\n\n[[Page S1842]]\n\neven harder for military families to make ends meet. Since 2001, health \ninsurance premiums have soared by 59 percent. Prescription drug costs \nhave risen 65 percent. Housing costs are up 33 percent in the last 4 \nyears.\n  The last thing Congress should do is make it harder for these \nfamilies when they face bankruptcy. I urge my colleagues to support the \nDurbin amendment to protect military families.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I listened with a great deal of interest to \nmy colleague's remarks with regard to the bankruptcy. I will have a few \nthings to say about those remarks in just a few minutes.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the bill, S. 256, the Bankruptcy \nAbuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005. The essence of \nthis bill is simple. This legislation is designed to make our \nbankruptcy system more fair and efficient. As well, this bill would cut \ndown on the ability to abuse the current system.\n  Before I detail some of the abuses of the system that is being \nabused, I want to make some other points. First, as I said yesterday, \nthis bill has been in the making for 8 years. The Senate passed it \nthree times already. Prior to Senate passage, the Judiciary Committee \nheld an extensive set of hearings and several markups on this bill. \nThis bipartisan, bicameral bill is ripe for passage. I am pleased to \nreport that yesterday the White House released the following statement \nof the administration policy on the bill. It is short and to the point \nand it says the following:\n\n       The administration supports Senate passage of S. 256 as \n     reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee. These commonsense \n     reforms to the Nation's bankruptcy laws will help curb abuses \n     of bankruptcy protections, reduce uncertainty in financial \n     markets through improved financial contract netting rules, \n     increase financial education to prevent unnecessary filings \n     and help avoid future credit problems, promote international \n     trade through coordination of cross-border insolvency cases, \n     and provide increased protection for family farmers facing \n     financial distress.\n\n  I am pleased that the administration's SAP stressed some of the pro-\nconsumer aspects of the bill. While we want to see that those people \nwho borrow money pay it back and that the value of personal property \nand responsibility is observed, we also want to help keep citizens out \nof bankruptcy in the first place.\n  When honest people simply get over their heads financially, we want \nto give them a fair chance to have a fresh start. Where there are some \nwho are clearly gaming the present system, there are many who find \nthemselves in unfortunate financial circumstances. Given a chance to \nbegin fresh, they can learn from their experiences and once again \nbecome the prudent, bill-paying consumers all of us are taught to be.\n  The data tell us there is a problem and it is a growing problem. \nBankruptcy filings are way up, and I mean way up.\n  We are fortunate to live in a time of unprecedented economic growth. \nStretching all the way back to the Presidency of Ronald Reagan, we have \ngenerally seen a sustained increase in economic activity. Personal \nassets and net worth have grown, when compared with individual \nliabilities. Yet, precisely at this time, bankruptcy filings have blown \nthrough the roof.\n  These facts might help to put it in perspective. Bankruptcies doubled \nin the 1980s. They doubled again from 1990 to 2003. In 2004 alone, \nthere were 1.6 million more bankruptcies than during the entire Great \nDepression. There will be more bankruptcies filed this year than in the \nentire decade of the Great Depression combined.\n  What explains this dramatic rise in filings? Probably several reasons \nare at play. Certainly, one of the critical reasons behind the rising \ntide of filings under the Bankruptcy Code, as years of study document, \nare the actions of those who flagrantly abuse our generous bankruptcy \nlaws.\n  Many of those opposed to the bill suggest that bankruptcy filings \nwere up because more and more people face economic hardship. To some \nextent, this is no doubt true. But we also know, however, that many \nbankruptcies stem from old-fashioned, outright fraud and abuse.\n  This potential for abusing the system was not fully anticipated when \nCongress created our current Bankruptcy Code in 1978. A key purpose of \nthis bill is to help crack down on the abuses of the system. In its \nsimplest terms, our bankruptcy laws attempt to distinguish between \nthose who can and those who cannot repay their debts. When a case is \nfiled under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, the debtor is required to \nsurrender his assets to a bankruptcy trustee for liquidation and \ndistribution to creditors, except for those assets that are exempt \nunder State or Federal law. Yet under this provision of law, the \ndebtor's future income is protected from creditors.\n  By contrast, those who file for bankruptcy under chapter 13 retain \npossession of their assets, but pay all or a portion of their debts \nthrough plans approved by the bankruptcy court.\n  For some contemplating bankruptcy, this makes for a simple strategy: \nDo everything you can to get into chapter 7. Chapter 7 protects all of \nyour future income from creditors. Once you are protected by chapter 7, \nyou pay off secured creditors--such as your mortgageholder--first.\n  Only then do unsecured creditors get their chance to get paid back.\n  Experts tell us about 70 percent of consumer bankruptcy filings are \nchapter 7 filings, and 95 percent of those make no distribution at all \nto unsecured creditors.\n  Let me repeat those statistics because they are important. About 70 \npercent of consumer bankruptcy filings are chapter 7 filings, and 95 \npercent of those make absolutely no distribution at all to unsecured \ncreditors.\n  If you are listening to this debate and you are a creditor, these \nstatistics mean you have only a small chance to be repaid if you are an \nunsecured creditor.\n  The problem with this is, according to the FBI, about 10 percent of \nthese chapter 7 filings are fraudulent. So what if only 10 percent of \nfilers are abusing the system? This represents $3 billion in costs that \ncan be recovered rather than being passed along to consumers. You and I \nand everybody else pay for these abuses of the system. We all end up \npaying for it. The problem with this is, according to the FBI, about 10 \npercent of these chapter 7 filings are fraudulent. One can understand \nthe financial motive of a debtor running up his or her unsecured credit \ncard debt to pay down his or her secured mortgage just before filing \nchapter 7, even though he or she knows full well the debts will never \nbe paid back.\n  The data suggest to many experts that some relatively high-income \ndebtors truly belong in chapter 13 where they will have to establish a \nplan for repayment for at least some debts. In theory, our bankruptcy \ncourts have the opportunity to defy chapter 7 filing because of \n``substantial abuse.'' Yet with so many bankruptcy filings, our courts \nare often overwhelmed, and in practice few people are bounced out of \nchapter 7, no matter their actual ability to repay their debts. It \nshould come as no surprise, then, that a few bad apples who could \nafford to pay some of their debts actively seek to avoid chapter 13 and \nget into the often less onerous treatment of chapter 7. A key component \nof S. 256 is a means test that will help prevent such gaming of the \nsystem.\n  Some have attempted to criticize this commonsense safeguard as \nsomehow taking away bankruptcy protection. Let me be clear. The means \ntest does no such thing. All it does is identify those who can repay at \nleast some of their debts. It makes certain they enter into a chapter \n13 reorganization and repayment plan rather than let them simply walk \naway from their obligations, no matter how steep or outrageous. Believe \nme, there is strong evidence to support this improvement in the law.\n  The U.S. Trustee Program has been challenging and documenting abuse \nnow for some time. The following examples show why changes are needed \nin the current system. The primary function of the U.S. Trustee Program \nis to identify fraud and abuse in the bankruptcy system. In fiscal year \n2002, there were 1,470,430 bankruptcy case filings. With such a large \nnumber of filers, there will always be those who will try to game the \nsystem.\n  Although some opponents of the bill may minimize the problem of \nabuse, consider these facts: The U.S. Trustee Program successfully \npursued 5,000\n\n[[Page S1843]]\n\nchapter 7 debtors for ``substantial abuse'' of the bankruptcy system. \nThe program prevented the discharge of an estimated $59 million of \nunsecured debt through fraudulent chapter 7 filings. In addition, the \nTrustee Program obtained disgorgement of more than $1.3 million in \nattorney's fees in consumer and business cases and imposed almost \n$534,000 in sanctions against attorneys. This indicates that bankruptcy \nfraud is no small problem and that reforms are in order.\n  The evidence of fraud is so widespread that many believe it is no \nlonger sufficient to rely on watchdogs to police these abuses after \nthey have occurred. We must take proactive steps to prevent them from \nhappening in the first place. That is what S. 256 does. The means test \ncontained in the bill will provide a uniform standard to bankruptcy \njudges to evaluate the ability of bankruptcy filers to repay debts. \nWith some people gaming the current system to avoid paying debts they \nhave taken on, we must make sure that the people who file in chapter 7 \nactually belong in chapter 7. We should not absolve people of their \ndebts when they have the means to pay them back. Bankruptcy law has \nalways meant that.\n  This is no exaggeration. Just consider these examples, if you will.\n  I am told one debtor in California sought to discharge $188,000 in \nunsecured debt. This person had more than $10,000 a month in expenses. \nShe paid $4,500 a month on the mortgage for her house in San Juan \nCapistrano and then paid another $2,500 a month on rent for an \napartment in Silicon Valley. This woman was spending $7,000 a month for \ntwo homes. The simple fact was, however, if the woman got rid of just \none of the homes, she would likely be able to fund a chapter 13 plan \nand repay, rather than ignore her debts. This does not seem to me to be \ntoo much to ask. In fact, it just makes common sense.\n\n  In another instance, a woman in Dallas filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy \nattempting to discharge $122,527 in credit card debt. But this is not \nexactly a hard-luck case, by the way. She was a commercial airline \npilot who earned $11,500 per month and paid $3,100 per month for a \nmortgage on a $385,000 home. Some have cast a skeptical eye on her \ndecision to buy a $50,000 Mercedes just before declaring bankruptcy in \norder to replace the recently repossessed $90,000 Mercedes. If that is \nwhat happened, it just plain is not right.\n  When somebody obtains 36 credit cards, runs up $283,075 in bills, and \nthen tries to discharge that debt through a chapter 7 filing--as I \nunderstand was the case of one gentleman in California--it is not \nenough to sit back and blame aggressive marketing by credit card \ncompanies. We have heard that old saw year after year. Frankly, there \nis a lot of abuse out there.\n  One person in Miami sought to discharge $163,744 in unsecured debt \neven though he had the means to purchase $232 in lottery tickets every \nmonth.\n  Then there is the case of a Tampa couple who had a combined monthly \nincome of $7,000 and a monthly budget of $6,756. Included in that \nbudget was a car payment of $965 a month. In addition to their secured \ndebt, they owed $350,000 in unsecured debt. This consisted of $200,000 \nin credit card debt and $150,000 in personal loans. They attempted a \nchapter 7 filing. This couple was bringing in more than they were \nspending, but they wanted to walk away from it all. Yet a review of \ntheir banking records showed that one spouse withdrew hundreds of \ndollars every month at ATM machines at local casinos. They had money to \nplay blackjack but not pay back there debts. Something, it seems to me, \nis just not right about that.\n  We are a compassionate nation, but we should not be fools. A \ndischarge of debt is serious business, but for sound public policy \nreasons, the United States has decided to allow it in certain \ncircumstances. We want to give our neighbors who get in over their \nheads a chance to get out of their financial troubles.\n  Frankly, I suspect that for a majority of those individuals who file \nfor bankruptcy, it must be their worst nightmare, but for some, as I \njust described, it is a way to avoid responsibility. We do not want to \nencourage bankruptcy for anyone. When a person takes on a debt, that \nperson makes a promise to pay, and they ought to pay it if they have \nthe capacity to do so.\n  There is something inherently unfair in denying full restitution to \ncreditors. That being said, as a matter of longstanding public policy, \nwe have decided to allow some people a fresh start and the opportunity \nto discharge their debts through a chapter 7 liquidation. But many fear \nthat in some instances, our lax policing of those who attempt a chapter \n7 filing actually encourages additional bankruptcies.\n  As a matter of public policy, we must say that those relatively high-\nincome debtors, those capable of paying back their substantial debts, \nshould at least pay something back, and that is all we are requiring \nhere. From now on, those who are capable of financial reorganization, \nrather than outright liquidation, will have to keep their promises or \nat least some of their promises.\n  Some opponents of this legislation minimize these abuses. They deride \nthe means test we devised to solve this problem. The fact is, 80 \npercent of people filing for bankruptcy will be automatically removed \nfrom the means test because their incomes fall below the safe harbor of \nthe median State income. Only 20 percent are asked to answer this \nrather reasonable question: After medical expenses, schooling expenses, \nhealth care premiums, living expenses, and a regular budget, do you \nhave an ability to pay back some of your debt?\n  That is all. Only 10 percent of the people currently filing for \nbankruptcy will be moved into chapter 13 under this test. Contrary to \nthe image of a crippling lifetime commitment to one's debtors, those \nrepayment plans are only between 3 and 5 years.\n  Who passes the means test of this bill? Eighty percent are excluded \nfor falling below the State median income. Another 10 percent are \nexcluded after taking into account school, health, and living expenses. \nSo only 10 percent of bankruptcy filers will ever be moved into \nrepayment plans. I do not think it is too much to ask that these \nrelatively high-income debtors, who can afford to pay their debts, pay \nback some of what they owe.\n  To the extent that our current Bankruptcy Code encourages some \nbankruptcies, I am hopeful that this reform will discourage some of \nthem. The experts and data tell us there are some with high salaries, \nprofligate spending habits, and the ability to pay back their debts. \nOur laws should not be to just allow them to walk away.\n  The fact that this type of misconduct is occasionally prevented does \nnot undo the need for permanent systemic reform of our laws. For every \none person who is discovered in an abuse of the system, it is likely \nthere are many others whose abuses never see the light of day. There is \na culture of abuse in our bankruptcy system that should be addressed.\n  I am told that in Kentucky one debtor filing for chapter 7 protection \nfailed to mention that he had transferred his one-half interest in a \nFlorida house to his son approximately 7 years before filing for \nbankruptcy. How convenient. He also failed to mention his transfer of \nstock to his daughter within 1 year of filing. He was unable to account \nfor the disappearance of $1.125 million in assets, including $300,000 \nin personal property and even $400,000 in race horses. His hope was to \ndischarge almost $1.8 million in unsecured debt and $795,175 in secured \ndebt.\n  While this may be an outlier case, the underlying problem of abuse is \ntoo frequent an occurrence. The point is not that this person is an \naverage filer; the point is that the system is such a mess that someone \nwould even contemplate making this type of a case.\n  Unfortunately, this misconduct is all too often encouraged by a \nbankruptcy bar that ushers people into chapter 7 without ever fully \nconsidering the client's ability to repay.\n  The U.S. trustees had to pursue 653 actions seeking disgorgement of \ndebtors' attorney's fees in fiscal year 2002. At the same time, they \npursued 243 other actions for attorney misconduct that resulted in \n$533,813 in sanctions. Over 75 attorneys were referred to State bar \nassociations or other disciplinary boards.\n  In the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, a U.S. trustee review \ndiscovered that in bankruptcy filings it was common to have boilerplate \ninformation entered without regard to the individual debtor's \ncircumstances, internally inconsistent information, and missing \nfinancial information.\n\n[[Page S1844]]\n\n  These are bankruptcy factories that appear to attempt to get as many \nas possible into chapter 7 without so much as a cursory look at the \nfiler's ability to repay his or her loans or debts.\n  For the most part, I am proud of our bankruptcy laws. When a debtor \ngets in over his or her head, we do not ask why. We do not cast blame. \nInstead, we attempt to help that person pay back the debts. Bankruptcy \nprotection gives Americans the ability to pause, to reorganize, to \nstart over. Bankruptcy offers those with unsustainable debts an \nopportunity for a fresh start. No one here wants to change this \nfundamental guarantee. No one wants to alter this basic framework. Yet \npeople are taking advantage of this system. Abuses are increasingly \nrampant and well documented.\n  When some people game the system to walk away from debts that they \nare perfectly able to repay, an injustice occurs that has ramifications \nfor our entire economy. And guess who has to pay for their dishonesty. \nYou and I and everybody else because we pay an average of $400 a year \nfor this bankruptcy system. This bill will help to bring it into a \nforceful, reasonable purpose.\n\n  It was estimated that in 1997 alone more than $44 billion of debt was \ndischarged through bankruptcy. This amounts to a loss of $110 million \nper day. Someone has to pay for this. The American people, you and I \nand everybody else, end up paying the bill for at least these dishonest \npeople.\n  According to one estimate, as I have said, these losses translate \ninto a $400-a-year tax on every household in the country. That might \nnot seem like a lot to some, but for many families $400 is a mortgage \nor a rent payment.\n  The cost of bankruptcy to taxpayers: $44 billion in debt discharged \nper year, or $110 million every day, a $400 yearly bankruptcy tax on \nevery household in the country.\n  For all the reasons I have laid out, I urge my colleagues to support \nS. 256. This is a good bill. We have been at this legislation too long \nto allow this commonsense reform to fail.\n  By the way, this very same bill, with the Schumer amendment, passed \nwith 83 votes. Without the Schumer amendment, the bill that President \nClinton pocket-vetoed was basically the same as this, and it passed \nwith 70 votes, meaning a bipartisan passage.\n  I will make a few comments on the Durbin amendment that seeks to \naddress some potential problems relating to debt carried by members of \nour military. We all honor our military for their sacrifices, no \nquestion about it. While I am supportive of the intent of the \nunderlying Durbin amendment, the fact is, only about 20 percent of \nthose filing for bankruptcy will ever be subject to a means test. Only \nabout half of those will end up having to repay some of their \nobligations under the means test. That means that only about 10 percent \nof those filing for bankruptcy will ever have to actually pay back some \nof their past debts with future earnings.\n  I suspect the 1 in 10 fraction will be smaller, perhaps much smaller, \nfor those serving in the military. So when my friend from Illinois \ncalls the means test an onerous test, he is overstating the case.\n  The purpose of the means test is simple. We are trying to determine \nwhich debtors can afford to pay a portion of their past debts from \ntheir future earnings. The Durbin amendment has several problems, but \nits goals are well intentioned and I commend him for his efforts. For \nexample, it is my understanding that under the definition of ``service \nmember,'' all of those employed as commissioned officers of the Public \nHealth Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \nwill qualify for this special treatment. There are few, if any, greater \nsupporters of the commission core of the Public Health Service, but I \ndo not understand why a public health service officer, working side by \nside with a career civil servant member at the Department of Health and \nHuman Services, should receive any special consideration during \nbankruptcy proceedings. If a member of the PHS or NOAA is able to pay, \nas determined by this new means test, which is estimated to affect only \n1 in 10 of those filing for bankruptcy today, he or she should pay like \nany other civil servant or member of the public.\n  They are well paid. They do not have to go off and borrow beyond \ntheir means. They do not have to live beyond their means. They should \nnot have any breaks any better than the regular citizens.\n  I think the distinguished minority whip has raised and will continue \nto raise very important points, and I look forward to working with him \nand the entire Senate to address those points.\n  If bad actors are preying on our military personnel through nefarious \npayday loans or other questionable practices, then I encourage Senators \nShelby and Sarbanes, the head of our Banking Committee in the Senate, \nto look into the issue. If there are other social issues that face our \nmilitary personnel, then we as Members of Congress have an obligation \nto examine those issues indepth and find the right fixes.\n  The Durbin amendment also has an additional problem. This involves \nhis creation of a broad exemption to the delicate homestead compromise \nalready so painstakingly embodied in this bill. We have gone over and \nover it and have finally come to this compromise that does not please \neverybody, or anybody for that matter, but it is an important \ncompromise and an important aspect of this bill.\n  We know the Senators from the States of Florida and Texas have made \nit clear that this issue is important to them. This is an area where we \nhave tried to defer wherever possible to the States, even though other \nSenators view some of the States' exemptions with skepticism. We should \nall recognize that opening the door on the homestead provision could \nwork to unravel this bill.\n  This is also the case with Senator Feingold's amendment on the \nhomestead exemption. This issue is not new. We have debated it year \nafter year, and we have come to a plausible compromise that has passed \nyear after year. This question has been debated over and over again. We \nhave achieved a compromise on the homestead exemption that has \ndemonstrated the ability to win overwhelming support in both Chambers. \nBoth the Durbin amendment and the Feingold amendment tend to upset the \nbalance that has been achieved on this important issue.\n  As I look at and examine the Durbin amendment, I have identified a \nfew additional concerns. For example, under the terms of the amendment \nboth ``real or personal property that the debtor or dependent of the \ndebtor uses as a residence,'' what does this language mean? How could \npersonal property be used as a residence?\n\n  The bottom line is this amendment has many ambiguities. In addition, \nseveral of its principal components come into tension with long-settled \nprovisions of this bill such as the homestead and the means test\n  As all of my colleagues know, there is a right way and a wrong way of \ndoing things. Indeed, many Members of the minority and some of the \nmajority have made that very point with regard to how the USA PATRIOT \nAct was put together. Senator Durbin has raised some important issues \nwe must take the time to explore properly, and I believe Senator \nSessions has appropriately and adequately addressed the central concern \nof the Senator from Illinois, which is to allow the facts and \ncircumstances of military personnel to be considered in bankruptcy \nproceedings.\n  I support S. 256, the bankruptcy bill, and I hope others will as \nwell. We have come very far with this bill, after 8 tough years of \nwork, after repeatedly passing it by overwhelming votes, and then \nhaving it shot down because of a killer amendment that gets put on by \nour colleagues who claim they are working in support of it. We should \npass this bill. We should pass it in as clean a form as possible.\n  Let me say with regard to credit card debt, I think it is a nice, \npopulist appeal here, to blame all the credit card companies for the \nproblems everybody has in our society today. Look, we have an \nintelligent society, a highly educated society, and I think everybody \nknows when they take those credit cards and they accrue debt, they are \nsupposed to repay that debt. Frankly, we have far too many people \ntaking advantage of credit cards and not paying their debt.\n  Where there is fraud, we should go after any credit card company that\n\n[[Page S1845]]\n\ncommits fraud or abuse against our fellow citizens. But this bill does \nnot fail to resolve these issues.\n  Could we improve this bill? Yes, I think we could improve it. But if \nwe did, some on the other side would say that is too tough of an \nimprovement. Could others on this side improve it? I suppose so. Could \nsome on that side improve it? I would hope so, but so far we have \naccepted an awful lot of what the other side has wanted. This bill has \nbeen passed by overwhelming votes over the last 8 years, at least four \ntimes, as I recall it. At one time it passed through both Houses of \nCongress and was pocket vetoed by President Clinton.\n  I would like to make one last point. Unfortunately I have to oppose \nthe Feingold amendment on the homestead matter. I think the purported \npurpose of the amendment is well intentioned, but I am concerned that \nit may act to upset the delicate balance and painfully negotiated \nprovisions relating to homestead exemptions. This amendment by Senator \nFeingold is, I know, well intentioned. But this amendment confuses an \nimportant and bipartisan issue, namely the care of the elderly, in a \nway that could sink this important legislation.\n  I have worked tirelessly to make sure there are provisions in this \nbill to protect the elderly, along with women and children, and I think \nevery one of my colleagues who has worked with me on this bill \nrecognizes that fact. The simple truth is this amendment and others \nlike it could kill this bill. The reason has nothing to do with a \nhostility to the elderly or to any other class of persons, but because \nthe homestead provisions have taken years to negotiate and are the \nresult of painful choices and compromises. They are not totally \nsatisfactory to me, either. But the fact of the matter is, it is the \nbest we can do.\n  There are many Members of this body who would like to see the \nhomestead provisions changed in some fashion, but to accommodate them \nany further than what presently exists in this bill would force other \nSenators who are strong supporters of this legislation to oppose it.\n\n  My opposition to this amendment has nothing to do with the elderly \nand I would not object if every State in the Nation passes laws that \nwould put a similar floor or a higher floor under their respective \nhomestead laws, but that choice belongs to the States and not to the \nFederal Government. There is a long history in bankruptcy law of \ndeference to States on this issue. Nearly every State in the country \nhas vehemently defended their homestead laws.\n  I must say I think some States wish to change their laws. If they do, \nthat is their prerogative. The purpose of this bill and the purpose of \nthe current homestead provisions is to curb fraud and abuse. The \ncurrent provisions impose a 10-year look back for fraud. They impose a \n2-year domiciliary requirement that is designed to prevent wealthy \ndebtors from moving from States with low homestead exemptions to States \nwith high or unlimited exemptions and then filing for bankruptcy. These \nprovisions are a compromise, a balance of States rights and Federal \nimperatives under bankruptcy law and we must let the provision stand as \nwritten. I oppose the Feingold amendment and I hope my colleagues on \nthe floor will oppose these amendments as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The Senator from Alabama is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Illinois is here. \nAt this point I ask unanimous consent that immediately following this \nconsent it be in order that I offer a first-degree amendment relating \nto the matter in the Durbin amendment, provided further that there be \n60 minutes for debate equally divided on both amendments concurrently; \nprovided further that at the expiration of that debate the Senate \nproceed to a vote in relation to the Sessions amendment, to be followed \nby a vote in relation to the Durbin amendment, with no second-degree \namendment in order to either amendment prior to the votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if I could, I ask the Senator from Alabama \nif I could make a unanimous consent request. I ask unanimous consent \nthat Senators Bill Nelson, Edward Kennedy, John Kerry, and Hillary \nRodham Clinton be added as cosponsors to my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 16\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the Senator from Illinois has raised \nquestions concerning the position of military personnel in bankruptcy. \nI believe his language is overly broad and I believe the concerns he \nhas do not justify the language of his amendment. I cannot support it. \nI think I will take a minute to discuss his amendment and then discuss \nthe amendment I will offer, which I believe would be more appropriate \nunder the circumstances.\n  The amendment Senator Durbin has proposed would create a gaping hole \nin the means test and in the homestead language--it would exempt \ncertain individuals from those provisions and violate certain \nprinciples that have been part of this bankruptcy legislation. As I \npointed out earlier today, many of the concerns that are raised here \nare covered by the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act which we passed in \n2003 to modify the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act passed in \n1940. The combined acts allow military members to suspend or postpone \ncivil financial obligations during their period in the military \nservice.\n  Specifically, this act provides as follows. There is an interest rate \ncap of 6 percent on all debts incurred before the commencement of \nactive-duty service. In other words, before active duty you have a \ncertain rate of income and if you sign up for a note that carries a 10-\npercent interest, you can have that interest rate reduced to 6 percent \nwhile you are activated, on active duty for the United States of \nAmerica.\n  There are protections from eviction from your home. It provides for a \ndelay of all civil court proceedings, including bankruptcy and \nforeclosures of your home; a prohibition on entering default judgments \nagainst active-duty personnel members, and the ability to reopen a \ndefault judgment if one were to be entered; the ability to terminate \nproperty, residential, and automobile leases at will, if you are \nactivated; the continuation of life insurance of at least $250,000 \nwithout requiring premiums to be paid; and the tolling of statutes of \nlimitation. In other words, if you are activated and you have a cause \nof action against someone and you are interrupted in your ability to \nfile that and the time may have otherwise run, the statute of \nlimitations, the time in which you can file a lawsuit, would have run, \nthen you can extend that while you are on active duty.\n  There is temporary relief for mortgage payments for people on active \nduty, credit rating protection, penalties for landlords and creditors \nwho violate the act involving fines of up to $100,000 and/or \nimprisonment. These are a lot of broad protections that indicate to me \nwe are at a point where it would not be necessary or wise to frustrate \nor undermine or go against the guiding principles that are in this \nbankruptcy bill. We hammered it out. And I have not agreed with all of \nthem that have been set forth. This is not, in my view, a justification \nfor a very significant carve out to the means test and homestead \nprovisions for those on active duty.\n  I would have to oppose this Durbin amendment. I believe, however, \nthat we can be more explicit in the legislation and make sure that \nsoldiers, certain persons with medical conditions, and veterans with \nlow income can qualify under the safe harbor of the bill. I am offering \nan amendment which clarifies that these individuals who may fall under \nthe special circumstances provisions of the bill are explicitly allowed \nto be covered under the special circumstances provisions of the bill to \ngive them certain advantages. It would deal primarily with the concern \nthat some would be required to pay back a portion of their debt, and \nthis would deal with that.\n  My amendment includes protections for the following three categories \nof individuals: those called or ordered to active duty in the Armed \nForces, low-income veterans, and individuals with serious medical \nconditions. These are all situations that we want to make sure the \nbankruptcy bill's special circumstances clause includes. My\n\n[[Page S1846]]\n\namendment does not create a gaping loophole in our legislation. \nInstead, it makes clear that people capable of paying back their debt \nshould do so, at least in part, but those incapable of paying back \ntheir debt due to military service or a serious medical condition may \nnot be required to do so. I hope my colleagues can support this \namendment.\n  I will just say with regard to the homestead exemption included in \nthe Durbin amendment that this would go against a lot of consensus we \nfinally reached on homestead. Senator Hatch referred to it earlier. The \nfact is we have decided as a Senate and after debate three different \ntimes in passing this legislation on this floor by a overwhelming vote \neach time that we were not going to overrule the States' definition of \nhomestead.\n  The State of Florida has a high homestead. In my view, it is too \nhigh, but it is in Florida law, and the Senator from Florida may well \nbelieve that he needs to defend that law. Many of our Senators say: \nThis is our State's law, and I am not going to vote for a bill with an \namendment which overrides my State's law on what the homestead should \nbe. I have a personal belief that it is a necessary provision for us to \ntake, but that has been the consensus, so I have to live with it even \nthough I have been concerned on some of the issues.\n  We have been consistent in not overruling the State definition of \nhomestead. I note that any State legislature could change their \nhomestead any time they want. They can create a separate homestead \nrule. If they choose for the military, they could raise it or lower it, \nthey can cap it or put a floor on it--whatever they choose. We have \ndecided, as this bill has been through the Congress several times now, \nto defer to the States on that issue. I believe it would be \ninappropriate for us to now carve out this exemption to it.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Alabama.\n  Let me make a couple comments.\n  First, his amendment, which I will oppose and urge all of my \ncolleagues to oppose, puts servicemen and servicewomen in the category \nin this bill where they are presumed to be abusers in bankruptcy. That \nis right. The presumption in his amendment is that if you served in the \nmilitary and file for bankruptcy, that you are abusing the bankruptcy \nprocess. He adds language which says that, and, therefore, we want the \njudge to take a look at these presumed abusers of the bankruptcy \nprocess and consider the fact that they happen to be in the military.\n  The Senator's amendment is entirely opposite of what we are trying \nachieve with the Durbin amendment. We are trying to presume the \nobvious. The men and women serving our country overseas who have been \nactivated in the Guard and Reserve, taken away from their families and \ntheir businesses, should be presumed not to be abusive of the process \nbut be presumed to be some of our most important citizens. Why do we \nwant to throw them into the presumption of abusing the bankruptcy \nprocess? What I want to do is exactly the opposite. If you are serving \nour country and you face bankruptcy, we want you to walk into that \ncourtroom and, frankly, get a better shake under the law than you \ncurrently get.\n  First, we don't want you to have to go through the hoops that have \nbeen created by the credit card industry and big banks for people who \nsupposedly abuse bankruptcy. No. You put your life on the line for \nAmerica. You were activated to serve in Iraq, and you risk your life \nevery day for us. You lost your business at home, your family went \nbankrupt, and yet we are giving you a break in the bankruptcy court, \nunlike the Sessions amendment, which presumes you are an abuser of the \nprocess if a serviceman walks into the bankruptcy court.\n  The second thing we say is military servicemen don't get to pick the \nStates they live in; they are transferred by the military to different \nplaces. But while these transfers of their families are going on, they \ncould go bankrupt. If they go bankrupt, why do you have to make this \nsome sort of roulette game as to what laws apply?\n  You are in the military and you file for bankruptcy. Then you ought \nto be able to count on several things:\n  First, the Federal exemptions on personal property. You know you can \nalways turn to that. That means the things that you can keep in your \nfamily, in your household, even if you go through bankruptcy.\n  Second, the homestead exemption. If you happen to be in a State that \nis tough and doesn't allow you to protect any part of your equity in \nyour home and you have been transferred there in the military, why use \nthat against men and women who are serving this country? Why wouldn't \nyou say, as our bill does, that we will protect up to $75,000 of your \nhomestead?\n  Some will say: They may live in a State where it has zero homestead \nexception. That is true. I plead guilty to the charge that I am \nfavoring the men and women in uniform who file for bankruptcy. I am. \nUnlike Senator Sessions' amendment, which presumes them to be abusive \nof bankruptcy, I presume the opposite, that men and women in the \nmilitary don't go into bankruptcy just because it is an interesting \nthing to do. I think they have proven that they are responsible people \nwhen they raise their hand and swear an oath to the United States and \nare willing to risk their lives for our country. That is the \npresumption of responsibility that should be given to the men and women \nin uniform--exactly the opposite of the presumption of Senator \nSessions. His presumption is that they are abusing the process and we \nwill take a second look at it and we will let them come up with more \ndocumentation to prove they are not abusing the process.\n  The last thing my amendment does is to go after the most abusive \ncreditors of the military men and women in America today. I showed the \nillustrations earlier. Can you imagine that a loan company would \nactually say to a sailor, airman, a marine, or soldier, we will loan \nyou the money, but we want you to pledge as collateral for the loan \nyour military retirement pay or your disability pay for your injury \noverseas serving America? They do it. Maybe they are not supposed to. \nThey do it. And they charge these men and women in uniform the most \noutrageous interest rates in America. It ought to make the credit card \ncompanies blush. These pay day lenders charge 100 percent, 200 percent, \n400 percent for these soldiers who are trying to keep their families \ntogether while they are serving America. My bill, quite honestly, says \nwe are not going to give those creditors a day in court. Those \ncreditors who charge over 36 percent a year in terms of loans to the \nmilitary cannot collect them in bankruptcy.\n\n  I think that, frankly, is fair to these families because once you get \ninto this ``juice loan'' racket that these payday loan companies come \nup with, there is no end in sight. You are sunk. Mr. President, $3,000 \nin debt turns into $20,000 before you can blink an eye.\n  Let me tell you a difference between what has been offered by Senator \nSessions and what I am offering on this floor. The fact is, these \ngroups support my amendment: the Military Officers Association of \nAmerica, the Air Force Sergeants Association, the National Consumer Law \nCenter, the National Association for the Uniformed Services, the \nEnlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States, and \nmany other individual leaders in the Guard and Reserve across our \ncountry.\n  They are not supporting the Sessions amendment. I can understand why. \nThey do not think our service men and women should be presumed abusive \nof the process. Let me tell you why we need this amendment.\n  In 1999, 16,000 members of the military in America filed for \nbankruptcy. Since then, there has been a massive activation of troops, \nGuard and Reserve, across America. Now we have men and women serving \nfor long periods of time they did not anticipate, with dramatic losses \nin pay. This cutback in income for these individuals is creating a \ngreat hardship.\n  Thirty percent of all military families report a loss of family \nincome when the spouse is deployed. But listen to the numbers for the \nNational Guard and Reserve. Mr. President, 41 percent of Guard and \nReserve families lost income when a spouse was deployed. How do they \nkeep it together? Some of them\n\n[[Page S1847]]\n\nrely on relatives. Mom and dad step in. They are proud of their son or \ndaughter serving in the military, they say: We will try to keep the \nwife, for example, who stayed home, and the children, together, while \nyou are overseas. Do not worry about us. Just come home safely.\n  They make great sacrifices. Some of them walk away from a business. \nThose are the ones who get hit especially hard, such as reservists who \nown their own business and who are activated.\n  Fifty-five percent of self-employed reservists lost money when they \nwere activated. And the average loss was $6,500. For some people, \n$6,500 may not mean much. But for these families, it may tip them over \nthe edge. You find them making sacrifices for America, and all I am \nasking is, if the worst outcome occurs, if service to our country leads \nto an economic catastrophe for a family, and they have nowhere to turn \nbut to bankruptcy court, for goodness' sake, should not this Senate say \nto these men and women in bankruptcy, We are going to give you a \nhelping hand; you reached out your hand to help America; we are going \nto help you in the bankruptcy court?\n  But, no, not with the Sessions amendment. The Sessions amendment does \nnot give them the helping hand. The Sessions amendment presumes that \nthey abuse bankruptcy and says to the judge: Take that into \nconsideration if you want to let them off the hook and want to let them \ntry again to file for bankruptcy. That is cold comfort, cold comfort to \nthe men and women in uniform, risking their lives for America, who \nknow, back home, the terrible economic circumstances their families are \nfacing.\n  Some people think I am making this up, but I am not. The anecdotal \nevidence that we received from all over the United States, as well as \nthe reports that we have had from the military groups that are \nsupporting my amendment, tell me a lot of families are right on the \nedge. They may not be able to survive this situation. I talked about \nthis gentleman, Mr. Korizon, from Schaumberg, IL, activated for the \nPersian Gulf war, who left behind a construction company with 26 \npeople. After he had been activated for 6 months, he had to file \nbankruptcy. He served his country. He kept his word. He kept his \npromise. He risked his life for America. He lost his business. He filed \nfor bankruptcy. Does he deserve any special consideration in court? The \nother side of the aisle says no. Get in line. Just another one of those \nbankruptcies. I think he does.\n  You take a look at SGT Patrick Kuberry, who owned a restaurant in \nDenver. His partner in the restaurant was also in the military. They \nwere both activated. Before it was over--both of them activated--they \nlost their restaurant and filed for bankruptcy. They served our country \nafter 9/11. They protected us, the Members of the Senate, and our \nfamilies. And they paid a heavy price. They lost the only business they \nhad. Should they get a break in bankruptcy court? Of course they \nshould. I think most Americans would agree they should.\n  The list goes on and on. I think the list tells the story. We have to \nbe sensitive to the fact that this amendment, which I have proposed, is \nan amendment which addresses the most basic and fundamental need here.\n  Let me tell you something else. Senator Hatch of Utah came to the \nfloor earlier. Do you know what he said? He said: I can't understand \nwhy so many more people are filing bankruptcy today. Well, he is \nunlikely to read this book, but I wish he would. It is called ``The \nTwo-Income Trap,'' by Elizabeth Warren and her daughter Amelia Warren \nTyagi. She analyzes why people are filing bankruptcy. And it is not \nbecause they are immoral. People are filing bankruptcy because: Since \nthe 1970s, the number of involuntary job losses is up 150 percent. \nSince the 1970s, wage earners missing work due to illness or disability \nare up 100 percent, divorce is up 40 percent, people losing health \ninsurance is up 49 percent, wage earners missing work to care for a \nsick child or elderly family member is up 1,000 percent-plus.\n  Now, add to these circumstances the possibility that you just \nreceived notice that your Guard unit has been activated, and you have a \nsick parent at home and you wonder: How in the heck am I going to keep \nthis together? I was here working my job, trying to be a good son, a \ngood daughter, trying to take care of my parent. What is going to \nhappen? How am I going to meet this need?\n\n  These are real family circumstances of people who serve in the \nmilitary. All I am asking is to make sure that if the worst thing \nhappens, if they have to go to bankruptcy court, not that they get off \nthe hook--they are not asking for that--but only that they get fair \ntreatment. I knew the credit industry would oppose this amendment. I \nknew they would oppose it because I went after the payday loans and \nthese ``juice loan'' rackets that are taking advantage of the military. \nThey all gather together when you go after one of their own. The \npredators are treated just like those who are supposed to be \nrespectable. And that is a shame.\n  I think the credit industry should sit down and have a balanced bill. \nAnd I think they ought to sit down at night and thank their lucky stars \nthat men and women in this country step forward every single day and \nvolunteer to keep us safe, to protect our homes and protect our Nation. \nIs it too much to ask the credit card industry and this big bank lobby \nthat is behind this bill to give them a break in bankruptcy court if \nthe bottom falls out while they are serving America? I cannot imagine \nit is.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I just want to say how strongly I value \nthe contribution of our men and women in uniform. When I was in the \nArmy Reserve I had the opportunity and the honor to call employers of \nservice men and women whom we believed may have been discriminated \nagainst because they were fulfilling a military obligation. When I was \na U.S. attorney, I filed a lawsuit against a business that terminated \nsomeone I believed, and the jury agreed, had been terminated at least \nin part because of them being a member of the Guard and Reserve.\n  We need to make sure our military men and women are protected and \nthat they cannot be taken advantage of. I was in Iraq in January, and I \nmet with soldiers there. One told me about his house. He was not able \nto keep up the payments. I asked him if he knew about the Soldiers and \nSailors Relief Act, and he said yes, that was protecting him. Under \nthat act his house could not be foreclosed on. And JAG officers, back \nthere, helped him deal with that. But he was sharing with me one of his \nfrustrations. He also told me he planned to re-enlist.\n  But I must react adversely to my colleague's statement that the \namendment I offer, which expands protections and guarantees certain \nprotections for military personnel over the present language in the \nstatute, presumes military people who file bankruptcy to be abusers. \nNow, that is not so.\n  Look. This is the deal. Let's be real frank about it. What he is \nraising fundamentally is simply whether a person ought to be handled \nunder chapter 13 or under chapter 7. If a military person's income \nfalls below that of the median income in America, he can file chapter 7 \nand wipe out every debt he has--zilch, zero, walk away free--just like \nany other American can. And that has not been changed. And as Senator \nHatch has indicated, probably close to 90 percent of American \nindividuals who file for bankruptcy relief will be falling in that \ncategory.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator from Alabama yield for a question on my \ntime?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. All right.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I just want to ask the Senator a question.\n  Is it not true that you have amended page 12, section (B)(I) of S. \n256, which reads in part: ``In any proceeding brought under this \nsubsection, the presumption of abuse may only be rebutted by \ndemonstrating special circumstances'' such as being called to active \nduty in the Armed Forces?\n  So when I say you are presuming that they are abusing bankruptcy, \nthese are the exact words of your amendment.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, look, this is the deal. My amendment does not \npresume abuse. The bill already does that if you file for Chapter 7 and \nyou have above median income. My amendment only\n\n[[Page S1848]]\n\nadds language to give examples of what a ``special circumstance'' could \nbe.\n  This is what we are saying here. The way this statute is written, \nwhat it says is if you make above median income in America and you can \npay back a portion of your debts, you should not be allowed to go under \nchapter 7 and wipe them all out. I don't think most military people \nwant to be treated differently from that. If they have come back from \nactive duty and are making $200,000 a year or $75,000 or $100,000 and \nthey have a small amount of debt that they can pay back--it may be \nsubstantial--but an amount they can pay back, they will be able to go \nunder chapter 13 and during that period of time the court would decide \nhow much of the debt they should pay back based on their income. And if \nthey have extraordinary circumstances, special circumstances as a \nresult of their military duty, the court can exempt them from going \ninto chapter 13, if it feels that is appropriate.\n  But fundamentally, this bill says if you are making a higher income \nand you can pay back part of it, why should you not? Not all of it. It \nis over 5 years. And the way they do it, the money goes to the court. \nCertain debts on a percentage basis are paid. And at the end of a \nmaximum of 5 years you are wiped out. They don't make you pay for any \nmore than 5 years. So you pay back a portion of what you owe over a \nperiod of 5 years.\n  This is not abusing people. These are people who have incurred debts, \nand they can pay some of it back. And they pay it. Most people under \nthis legislation will fall in the other category as exists today, and \nthey will wipe out all of their debts. So this is not abusive \nlegislation. That is important to state.\n  It also specifically protects veterans who are defined by statute \ntoday as low-income veterans. They would be covered by this. There are \npeople with medical expenses. That was defined explicitly as a special \ncircumstance, and active-duty personnel.\n  As one businessman and fellow Senator indicated, we also have to be \ncareful that if we provide too many special protections for service \npersonnel, we could actually drive up their interest rates when they go \nout to borrow money because a lender may feel they are a greater risk \nthan otherwise would be the case.\n  I believe we need to give our servicemen special protections. The \nServicemember Civil Relief Act does that. It provides that you cannot \nforeclose your home while you are on active duty. It provides that your \ninterest rate is reduced if you incurred debts before you go on active \nduty. You can't exceed 6 percent. They can't take a default judgment \nagainst you while you are away. Your statute of limitation is tolled so \nyou can file any action you have that might otherwise be fileable while \nyou are away. You can come back and still have time to do it.\n  I think we ought to continue to look at it. If there are additional \nthings such as loans and other matters that are important for \nprotection of our military, we need to look at it. But credit card, \nbank interest rates, those matters are not to be dealt with on a \nbankruptcy court reform bill. Those pieces of legislation are more \nappropriately and properly under the jurisdiction of the Banking \nCommittee. That is where they need to be decided and debated.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I appreciate the sentiment behind Senator \nDurbin's amendment, but the fact of the matter is that it is not \nneeded. In the first instance, it is simply not the case that the means \ntest in this bill will prevent our men and women in uniform from \nreceiving the full protection of our bankruptcy laws.\n  The means test will not apply to any one in military service under \nthe median income in their State. The median income in Delaware for a \nfamily of four is $72,680. If a staff sergeant at Dover Air Force Base \nin Delaware had to file for bankruptcy, he would automatically be \nexempt, at his pay scale of $34,319. So there is no way, under the \nmeans test in this bill today, that he would be denied the full \nprotection of chapter 7. That is precisely why I insisted on that safe \nharbor in the means test two Congresses ago.\n  So the very assumption behind the amendment, that we need to exempt \nservice men and women from the means test, is wrong. And if a pilot at \nDover, who might well fall above the median income, were to file, he \nwould only be subject to movement to chapter 13 if, and only if, he had \nenough income after deducting all of his normal expenses, to continue \nto pay some of his bills. And under chapter 13, he could keep his house \nand other assets, something filers under chapter 7 cannot do.\n  As Senator Hatch pointed out earlier, and Senator Sessions, too, \nspecial protections exist in current law--the Soldiers and Sailors \nRelief Act--that prevent foreclosure on a house, that cap interest \npayments. The extra protections sought by the Durbin amendment are \nalready in place.\n  On the point of the payday loans, I agree that is an abuse that \nshould be halted. Truly unscrupulous lenders that take advantage of \nanyone, in uniform or not, should be put out of business. But that is \nin fact a matter for banking regulations, not bankruptcy law. This \namendment is closing the barn door after the horse is already gone.\n  Under the bankruptcy reform bill before us, the test to determine a \nfiler's ability to pay specifically allows for the ``special \ncircumstances'' that could reduce their ability to pay. The Sessions \namendment, that we just passed, makes it crystal clear that those \nspecial circumstances include service in the armed forces--if that \nservice puts you into a situation where you are unable to pay your \nlegal debts. That can happen to someone called up in the reserves, and \nit is precisely why that category of special circumstances was put into \nthe bill in the first place.\n  I could not support this bill if I did not belief that it is already \nfundamentally fair. This is a bill that received 82 votes the last time \nthe Senate voted on it. I would never call those Senators callous or \nindifferent to the difficult circumstances our servicemen and women \nface. They are not. The Durbin amendment assumes all 82 of us got it \nwrong last time. I do not agree.\n  With the additional clarification of the Sessions amendment, I am \nconvinced that the concerns raised by Senator Durbin are fully \naddressed.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I stand to voice my support for the \namendment offered by my friend and colleague, Senator Durbin, which \nwill protect our military servicemembers from attempts to penalize them \nby making it tougher for them to file for bankruptcy, even when the \nreason they lost all their income is because they answered the call of \nduty to serve America. I am proud to join my colleague as a cosponsor \nof this amendment.\n  We cannot have a thorough debate on bankruptcy reform without \nconsidering the economic hardships faced by servicemembers and their \nfamilies. Calls to serve their country in Iraq, Afghanistan, or \nelsewhere can cause loss of family income, the closing of a family \nbusiness, or unexpected expenses. Unfortunately, it is not uncommon for \nservicemembers and their families to be forced into filing for \nbankruptcy relief. We need to protect those who are fighting for us.\n  I support Senator Durbin's efforts to protect our soldiers, \nparticularly young recruits and junior officers, from sales of \ninappropriate insurance and investment products on military bases. It \nis crucial that servicemen and women who sacrifice for their country \nnot be exploited or taken advantage of through dishonest business \npractices. It is our duty to ensure that America's military personnel \nare offered first-rate financial products so they can provide for their \nfamilies and invest in their futures.\n  I commend Senator Durbin for his leadership on this issue, and I urge \nmy colleagues to accept his amendment so we can remedy the financial \nhardships faced by servicemembers who serve our nation and their \nfamilies.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 23\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Sessions] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 23.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n[[Page S1849]]\n\n (Purpose: To clarify the safe harbor with respect to debtors who have \nserious medical conditions or who have been called or ordered to active \n           duty in the Armed Forces and low income veterans)\n\n        On page 12, line 10, insert after ``special \n     circumstances'' the following: ``, such as a serious medical \n     condition or a call or order to active duty in the Armed \n     Forces, to the extent such special circumstances''.\n       On page 18, line 4, insert after ``debtor'' the following: \n     ``, including a veteran (as that term is defined in section \n     101 of title 38),''.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama has 15 minutes.\n  (Disturbance in the Visitors' Galleries.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sergeant at Arms will restore order in the \ngallery.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair.\n  I do not believe our service men and women should be insulted or are \nbeing insulted by the amendment I offered to ensure that they have \ncertain special categories of protection under this act. I think they \nwill welcome the amendment. I do not believe, however, that we need to \nchange the overall idea and concept of the legislation, that homestead \nshould be decided by the States and not by this Federal legislation. \nAnd if a serviceman is unable to pay his debts, he will be able to file \nbankruptcy against those. He will be able to wipe out all those debts. \nIf he is able to pay back a portion, like any other citizen, he would \nbe required to pay back that portion under this legislation. I think \nthat is fair.\n  We need to be careful that they are not in any way adversely impacted \nby being overseas defending the interests of this country. I do not \nbelieve they are under this legislation.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alabama. This \nexchange is a rare and a good occurrence. As I said before, it is \ndangerously close to debate which we occasionally have in the Senate. I \nthank the Senator from Alabama for being here, even though we are on \npolar opposite sides of the debate. There should be more conversation \nand dialog on the floor such as this, a competition of ideas.\n  Nothing I said about his amendment reflects on him or his respect for \nthe military. He has served in the military. I have not. I have great \nrespect for him for having done that. But what I am trying to do with \nthis amendment is to show what I think is appropriate respect to the \nmen and women serving in uniform.\n  The point I made earlier was that the section of the underlying bill \nwhere people are presumed to have abused bankruptcy--in other words, \nthey can pay their debts, but they try to get discharged from \nbankruptcy from their debt--that section is what the Senator from \nAlabama amended. So he puts into that section the requirement that the \ncourt take a look at the fact that the person filing bankruptcy may be \nin the military. That is all. That is the only point I am trying to \nmake. I do not question his respect for the military in any way at all.\n  His amendment misses the point completely. Instead of presuming that \nthe men and women who serve our country are abusing the bankruptcy laws \nwhen they go to file bankruptcy, I say stick to the current law. The \ncurrent law allows a bankruptcy judge to make this determination. The \nnew proposal by Senator Sessions, the one we are about to vote on, \nwould require the service man or woman to file copious documents, incur \nadditional legal costs, and then, if they are presumed to be abusing \nbankruptcy, to go through it all over again. What I am trying to do is \nspare them from that, and maybe it is soft on my part. Maybe I am not \ntough enough. I am trying to spare them because they are sparing me the \nworry about the safety of this country. They are serving this country \nin uniform. They are risking their lives. Yes, maybe I am going a \nlittle further than some would. I don't think it is an unreasonable \nleap. We understand the economic hardships that activation in the \nmilitary can lead to.\n  Let me say a word about what used to be known as the Soldiers and \nSailors Relief Act, now the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act.\n  The Senator from Alabama continues to return to it, saying this is \ntheir protection. Well, there is some protection in this law as it \ncurrently exists, but not nearly enough. This law, as currently \nwritten, does not apply to debts incurred after military service \nbegins. So if you are in the military service and have debts that are \nincurred because you are overseas--your family debts that could lead \nyou into bankruptcy--there is no protection from the Servicemembers \nCivil Relief Act. The protections are not automatic. You have to go to \ncourt and fight for them, too. Imagine that, fighting for your country \noverseas and being worried about fighting legal battles back home for \nlien enforcement on autos and other personal property being taken by \nself-help repossession. It doesn't fully protect servicemembers' \nspouses or dependents. These protections are not absolute.\n  If the creditor can show that the proceedings he instituted do not \nmaterially affect the serviceman, they can go forward. This bill, as \nwritten, doesn't stop debt collection harassment. This bill, as \nwritten, is providing protection that is only temporary at best and not \nlong-term solutions to financial problems.\n  A member of my staff is active military and he is on detail to my \noffice. I always go to him and ask him about these ideas, because he \nsees it from the eyes of a serviceman. He sent me a little note about \nSenator Sessions' amendment. He says it keeps the troops subject to the \nmeans test, but would allow a call or order to active duty in the armed \nservices, to the extent that such special circumstances justify \nadditional expenses or adjustments of current monthly income. This puts \nthe service member at the mercy of someone else's opinion as to what \nwas justified, what was reasonable. He gives an example, and a good \none:\n\n       Suppose a soldier decides to keep his family in their home \n     rather than move them in with his parents while he is \n     deployed. You can understand why he might--the comfort of \n     their home, schools the kids are used to. Instead of picking \n     them up and saying I am going overseas and you are moving in \n     with mom and dad, he says stay in the home. Senator Sessions' \n     amendment would force that soldier to justify his decision to \n     keep the family in their home, made under circumstances that \n     few outside the military can appreciate. What may seem like a \n     reasonable alternative--picking up the wife and kids and \n     sending them to mom's and dad's house to live in the \n     basement, or in an extra bedroom, may not be reasonable in \n     that soldier's eyes.\n\n  What I am asking my colleagues in the Senate is, when you look at \nthis Bankruptcy Code, join me in saying if we are going to give special \nconsideration and help to the men and women in uniform--I don't think \nthat is an unreasonable thing to do; I think we owe it to them--they \nought to have a chance to go to court and be spared from this harsh \nmeans test and everything included in this bill to prove up where you \nstand. The judge, the trustee in bankruptcy, and others are going to \nmake the ultimate decision as to whether you receive your bankruptcy.\n  Secondly, moving these soldiers all around the United States--at \nleast if they file for bankruptcy, give them an option to choose an \nexemption under Federal law for personal protections and a $75,000 \nhomestead exemption.\n  Finally, let me say this to these predatory lenders, the payday loan \ncompanies. The argument is if you treat them harshly in bankruptcy \ncourt, they may not be able to offer these 100-percent, 200-percent, \n400-percent interest loans. I hope they go out of business tomorrow, to \nbe honest. A lot of them are snaring these unsuspecting soldiers and \nmarines and sailors into debt they can never get out from under. I \nthink it is horrendous that men and women who serve our country should \nbe subjected to that. I don't think a 36-percent a year annual interest \nrate, which we allow in the Durbin amendment, is unreasonably low. I \nthink it is a reasonable return for a loan in most circumstances. It is \nfar more than people pay for cars or homes today. They may pay that \nmuch on credit cards, if they are not careful. But to say the payday \nloan lenders are not going to have their day in court to exploit the \nmen and women in uniform, I think, is a reasonable conclusion. It is a \nconclusion, frankly, that was joined in by a number of military groups \nthat have endorsed this amendment.\n\n[[Page S1850]]\n\n  For those colleagues following this debate, let me say that, to my \nknowledge, the Sessions amendment has no support from military families \nand support groups. It may have the support of the payday loan \ncompanies and some of the credit card companies and banks. But \nsupporting my legislation are the Military Officers Association of \nAmerica, Air Force Sergeants Association, National Association for the \nUniformed Services, and the Enlisted Association of the National Guard \nof the United States. I will stand with my supporters and ask my \ncolleagues to join me in that effort.\n  Mr. President, at this time I will yield the floor and reserve the \nremainder of my time. We are under a unanimous consent request, and I \nnote that Senator Leahy of Vermont has come to lay down an amendment.\n  If I may get the attention of the Senator from Alabama for a moment. \nSenator Leahy is here to lay down an amendment. I would appreciate it \nif we can amend our unanimous consent request to give the Senator 7 \nminutes and protect and preserve the time we have remaining in debate.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is acceptable to me.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Leahy \nbe allowed to lay down his amendment and to speak for 7 minutes, and \nthat we return to debate and the previous unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 26\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Illinois and the \nSenator from Alabama for their usual courtesies. I ask unanimous \nconsent that it be in order to set aside, under our understanding, the \npending amendment so I might introduce an appropriately referred \namendment for myself, Senator Snowe, and Senator Cantwell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy], for himself, Ms. \n     Snowe, and Ms. Cantwell, proposes an amendment numbered 26.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To restrict access to certain personal information in \n                         bankruptcy documents)\n\n        On page 132, between lines 5 and 6, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 234. PROTECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION.\n\n       (a) Restriction of Public Access to Certain Information \n     Contained in Bankruptcy Case Files.--Section 107 of title 11, \n     United States Code, is amended by striking subsection (b), \n     and inserting the following:\n       ``(b) On request of a party in interest, the bankruptcy \n     court shall, and on the bankruptcy court's own motion, may, \n     protect a person with respect to a trade secret or \n     confidential research, development, or commercial \n     information.\n       ``(c) The bankruptcy court, for cause, may protect an \n     individual, with respect to--\n       ``(1) any means of identification (as defined in section \n     1028(d) of title 18) contained in a paper filed, or to be \n     filed, in a case under this title; or\n       ``(2) information contained in a paper described in \n     paragraph (1) that could cause undue annoyance, \n     embarrassment, oppression, or risk of injury to person or \n     property.''.\n       (b) Security of Social Security Account Number of Debtor in \n     Notice to Creditor.--Section 342(c) of title 11, United \n     States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``last 4 digits of the'' before ``taxpayer \n     identification number''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following: ``If the notice \n     concerns an amendment that adds a creditor to the schedules \n     of assets and liabilities, the debtor shall include the full \n     taxpayer identification number in the notice sent to that \n     creditor, but the debtor shall include only the last 4 digits \n     of the taxpayer identification number in the copy of the \n     notice filed with the court.''.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the reason for this amendment--and I \nrealize we will not vote on it today and we may vote on it tomorrow, \nalthough it may well be accepted--is one of the facts we have today.\n  The bankruptcy process requires the submission of many documents \ncontaining highly personal information. But we must be careful that our \nefforts to require documentation for accuracy and accountability do not \ninadvertently create problems for privacy and security.\n  We are in an age where personal information can be easily digitized \nand shared, and when it falls into the wrong hands, easily abused.\n  Identity theft is one danger. We have only to look to the recent \ndebacle of Choicepoint selling the personal data of 145,000 individuals \nto scam artists. Many of these individuals have already become victims \nof identity theft, and they are not alone. Last year alone, 9.3 million \npeople were victimized by identity theft. Another danger is tracking or \nharassing a former battered spouse. We need to minimize these \npossibilities, while still allowing for accountability.\n  We took an important first step by ensuring privacy protections for \ndatabases of personal information that become assets in bankruptcy. I \nwas pleased to work closely with my colleagues in providing this \nprotection.\n  But our responsibilities didn't end there. We also need to ensure \nreasonable privacy protection for personal information that is \nsubmitted by the debtors. I am submitting an amendment that will do \njust that by enhancing the court's discretion to protect personal \ninformation, and by requiring truncation of social security numbers in \npublicly filed documents. The Judicial Conference supports this \namendment and I will ask unanimous consent that the Judicial Conference \nletter supporting the amendment be printed in the Record.\n  I am pleased that my colleagues Senator Snowe and Senator Cantwell \nhave agreed to co-sponsor this amendment. They have been leaders on \nprivacy issues, and I appreciate their support.\n  First, the amendment addresses court discretion in several ways. It \nallows the court, for cause, to protect personal identifiers, including \nthe debtor's or other person's name, social security account number, \ndate of birth, driver's license number, passport number, employee or \ntaxpayer identification number, and unique biometric data. The personal \nidentifiers protected under this provision are the same ones defined as \n``means of identification'' under the Identity Theft Assumption \nDeterrence Act of 1998. This definition is codified as Section 1028(d) \nof Title 18 of the criminal code.\n  The amendment also allows the court, for cause, to seal or redact \n``information that could cause undue annoyance, embarrassment, \noppression or risk of injury to person or property.'' This standard is \ndrawn from the current civil procedure discovery rules--Fed. Rule of \nCiv. Procedure 26--and would replace the existing standard in \nbankruptcy court, which only protects individuals against ``scandalous \nor defamatory matter.'' This change would allow the court to protect \ninformation, such as the home or employment address of a debtor, \nbecause of a personal security risk, including fear of injury by a \nformer spouse or stalker. It would also allow the court to protect \nother information normally considered private, such as medical \ninformation.\n  The amendment would also provide persons the opportunity to request \nprotection of sensitive information not only after it is filed with the \ncourt, but prior to filing as well. This protection is particularly \nimportant in an electronic filing environment, where information once \nfiled is immediately available to the public.\n  In addition to enhancing court discretion, the amendment also \nprotects social security numbers. Currently, the bankruptcy code \nrequires debtors to include their tax payer identification numbers, \nwhich for individuals is almost uniformly his or her social security \nnumber, on any notice the debtor gives to creditors.\n  Because these notices are also filed with the court, the court's \nfiles routinely include unredacted social security numbers, creating \nthe potential for abuse by those accessing public court records.\n  The amendment would simply allow debtors to limit disclosure to only \na part of his or her social security number in notices that it files \nwith the court. Specifically the notice to the court would include only \nthe last four digits. The amendment still protects creditors where \nnecessary, and specifies that creditors who are on the\n\n[[Page S1851]]\n\nschedule of assets and liabilities should receive the full tax payer \nidentification number in the notices sent specifically to the creditor.\n  The idea of truncation isn't new. Just last year, we passed the Fair \nand Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003, and that Act required \ntruncation of credit card and debit card numbers on receipts given to \ncardholders. Under that law, only the last 5 digits of credit card and \ndebit card numbers can be printed.\n  Requiring truncation for social security numbers is similarly \nreasonable. It provides protection against abuse, but still allows for \nimportant information sharing to take place.\n  The bankruptcy process requires submission of many documents \ncontaining highly personal information. I spoke about this on the floor \nyesterday. We must be careful that our efforts to require documentation \nfor accuracy and accountability do not inadvertently create problems \nfor privacy and security.\n  We are in an age where personal information can be easily digitized \nand shared, and when it falls into the wrong hands, easily abused. We \nknow what happens with identity theft. Look at the totally \nirresponsible, outrageous, unbelievable debacle of Choicepoint, selling \nthe personal data of 145,000 individuals to scam artists. It is hard to \nthink of anything being done more irresponsibly than the executives at \nChoicepoint, unless it is the executives of Bank of America, who ship \nthe data of their customers by commercial airplane--the same kind of \nflight we have all taken, and all of us have lost luggage. I said \nyesterday maybe their executives fly by private planes and they don't \nknow what it is like to fly commercial. The point is their \nirresponsibility.\n  Many of the individuals who have had data stolen become victims of \nidentity theft. There were 145,000 individuals whose data was \ncompromised with Choicepoint that we know of now. Some have already \nbecome victims of identity theft. Last year alone, 9.3 million people \nwere victimized by identity theft. Another danger is tracking or \nharassing a former battered spouse. I want to make sure we keep \naccurate information and that people have to say who they are, but we \ndon't want to allow somebody to go into electronic court files and get \nSocial Security numbers and names and addresses and everything else, \nand then use that information for identity theft or worse. We need to \nminimize these possibilities, while still allowing for accountability.\n  We took an important first step by ensuring privacy protections for \ndatabases of personal information that become assets in bankruptcy. I \nwas please to work with my colleagues in providing this protection. But \nour responsibilities did not end there. We also need to ensure \nreasonable privacy protection for personal information submitted by the \ndebtors. This amendment will do that by enhancing the court's \ndiscretion to protect personal information, and by requiring truncation \nof social security numbers in publicly filed documents.\n  I have a letter from the Judicial Conference of the United States, \nChief Justice Rehnquist presiding, in which they support this \namendment. They strongly support this amendment. These are the courts \nthat are going to have to enforce this.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Judicial Conference letter \nsupporting the amendment be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                               Judicial Conference\n\n\n                                         of the United States,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 25, 2005.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Ranking Democrat, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: I am writing today to express the \n     Judicial Conference's support of two proposed amendments to \n     the ``Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act \n     of 2005'' (S. 256). Both amendments to the bill would amend \n     the Bankruptcy Code to effect the Judicial Conference's \n     privacy policy and protect confidential or sensitive \n     information from public disclosure. Your support of these \n     amendments to pending bankruptcy reform legislation would be \n     greatly appreciated.\n\n\n                   Section 107 of the Bankruptcy Code\n\n       This amendment would implement Judicial Conference policy \n     regarding protection of certain information contained in \n     bankruptcy case files from public disclosure by means of four \n     revisions to section 107 of the Bankruptcy Code. First, the \n     amendment would transform former subsection (b)(1) regarding \n     protection of trade secret or confidential research, \n     development, or commercial information into a new subsection \n     (b). No substantive change would be made to this provision.\n       Second, the amendment would create a new subsection (c) to \n     allow the court for cause to authorize the redaction of \n     personal identifiers to protect a debtor, creditor, or other \n     person from identity theft or other harm. The amendment \n     incorporates by reference section 1028(d)(7) of title 18, \n     United States Code, a provision of the ``Identity Theft and \n     Assumption Deterrence Act of 1998,'' with regard to the types \n     of personal identifiers that may be redacted. These include \n     the debtor's or other person's name, social security account \n     number, date of birth, driver's license number, alien \n     registration number, government passport number, employee or \n     taxpayer identification number, unique biometric data, unique \n     electronic identification number, electronic address or \n     routing code, and telecommunication identifying information \n     or access device. The amendment would also permit the court \n     to exercise its discretion to protect personal identifiers by \n     means other than redaction where appropriate in the \n     circumstances of the case.\n       Third, this provision would allow the protection of \n     information under subsection ( c) ``contained in a paper \n     filed, or to be filed,'' in a bankruptcy case. This provision \n     is intended to provide persons the opportunity to request \n     protection of the information not only after it is filed with \n     the court, but prior to filing as well. This authority would \n     be especially useful in an electronic filing environment, \n     where information once filed is immediately available to the \n     public.\n       Finally, this new subsection (c) would have the effect of \n     striking from the current provision ``scandalous or \n     defamatory matter'' as a basis for protection of a person and \n     instead allow the court for cause to seal or redact \n     ``information that could cause undue annoyance, \n     embarrassment, oppression or risk of injury to person or \n     property.'' This language is drawn from Federal Rule of Civil \n     Procedure 26 regarding the issuance of protective orders in \n     the course of discovery. This new provision would expand the \n     authority of the bankruptcy court to allow the court to \n     protect information, such as the home or employment address \n     of a debtor, because of a personal security risk, including \n     fear of injury by a former spouse or stalker. It would also \n     allow the court to protect other information normally \n     considered private, such as medical information which, if \n     publicly) disclosed, could result in untoward consequences to \n     the debtor or others.\n\n\n                 Section 342(c) of the Bankruptcy Code\n\n       This amendment to the bill would amend section 342(c) of \n     the Bankruptcy Code to implement Judicial Conference policy \n     that social security account numbers be protected from public \n     disclosure in court documents.\n       Section 342(c) of title 11, United States Code, currently \n     requires a debtor to include his or her taxpayer \n     identification number, which for an individual is almost \n     uniformly his or her social security account number, on any \n     notice the debtor gives to his or her creditors. Debtors are \n     required to give such notice in various contexts, including \n     the filing of adversary proceedings, such as a complaint to \n     determine the dischargeability of a debt, or contested \n     matters, such as a motion to avoid a lien impairing an \n     exemption.\n       As a copy of such notice is required to be filed with the \n     court, court files routine include unredacted social security \n     account numbers of debtors. By requiring only the last four \n     digits of a taxpayer identification number to appear an the \n     notice, the debtor's fun social security account number will \n     no longer appear in the court file and thus be protected from \n     public disclosure.\n       The amendment also adds a provision to section 342(c) to \n     require that adequate notice of the bankruptcy filing is \n     given to a creditor who is added to the case after the \n     initial notice of the case has been sent. The taxpayer \n     identification number would be treated in the same manner in \n     the notice to a newly added creditor as the number was \n     treated in the initial notice to the original creditors. The \n     debtor is directed to send to the newly added creditors a \n     notice of the bankruptcy filing containing the debtor's full \n     taxpayer identification number, but to include only the last \n     four digits of the number in the copy of the notice filed \n     with the court.\n       Thank you far your consideration of these proposed \n     amendments. If you have any questions or concerns, please \n     have your staff contact Michael W. Blommer, Assistant \n     Director, at (202) 502-1700.\n                                            Leonidas Ralph Mecham,\n                                                        Secretary.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased my colleague from Maine, \nSenator Snowe, and my colleague from Washington State, Senator \nCantwell, have agreed to cosponsor this amendment. They both have been \nleaders of privacy issues. I appreciate their support.\n  Here is what the amendment does: It addresses court discretion in \nseveral ways. It allows the court for cause to protect personal \nidentifiers, including the debtor's or other person's name,\n\n[[Page S1852]]\n\nSocial Security account number, date of birth, driver's license number, \npassport number, employee or tax identification number, and unique \nbiometric data. The personal identifiers protected under this provision \nare the same ones defined as ``means of identification'' under the \nIdentity Theft Deterrence Act of 1998. This definition is codified in \nSection 1028(d) of Title 18 of the criminal code.\n  The amendment also allows the court, for cause, to seal or redact \n``information that could cause undue annoyance, embarrassment, \noppression or risk of injury to person or property.'' This standard is \ndrawn from the current civil procedure discovery rules. This change \nwould allow the court to protect information, such as the home or \nemployment address of a debtor because of a personal security risk. \nUnfortunately, many times that risk is from a former spouse or a \nstalker. It would also allow the court to protect other information \nnormally considered private, such as medical information.\n  The amendment would provide persons the opportunity to request \nprotection of sensitive information not only after it is filed with the \ncourt, but prior to filing as well. This protection is particularly \nimportant in an electronic filing environment, where information once \nfiled is immediately available to the public.\n  In addition to enhancing court discretion, the amendment also \nprotects Social Security numbers. Currently, the bankruptcy code \nrequires debtors to include their tax payer identification numbers \n(which for individuals is almost uniformly his or her social security \nnumber) on any notice the debtor gives to creditors. Because these \nnotices are also filed with the court, the court's files routinely \ninclude unredacted social security numbers, creating the potential for \nabuse by those accessing public court records.\n  This amendment would simply allow debtors to limit disclosure to only \na part of his or her social security number in notices filed with the \ncourt. Specifically the notice to the court would include only the last \nfour digits.\n  This amendment still protects creditors where necessary, and \nspecifies that creditors who are on the schedule of assets and \nliabilities should receive the full tax payer identification number in \nthe notices sent specifically to the creditor. What it means is \nsomebody cannot get on line, get all this information, sell it, or do \nwhatever they want to.\n  The idea of truncation isn't new. Just last year, we passed the Fair \nand Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003, and the Act required \ntruncation of credit card and debit card numbers on receipts given to \ncardholders. Under that law, only the last 5 digits of credit card and \ndebit card numbers can be printed. Requiring truncation for social \nsecurity numbers is similarly reasonable. It provides protection \nagainst abuse, but still allows for important information sharing to \ntake place.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I note that with regard to, I believe \nthe new name for it is the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, which is \nthe updated Soldiers and Sailors Relief Act, is a good piece of \nlegislation. It provides tremendous protection for our men and women \nwho have been called to active duty and sent around the world to defend \nour interest. It is very important legislation. We updated it not too \nlong ago, in 2003. Maybe it needs to be updated again.\n  A bill structuring the rules of procedure for a bankruptcy in America \nis not the place to enter into debate about the refined procedures that \nmight be necessary to give greater protection than we give today to our \nservice men and women.\n  I suggest very strongly that to those who disagree there are enough \nprotections, let's consider that. Let's look at that and see if we can \ndo a better job of providing relief. The danger we get into is this: If \nwe start amending what homestead is and having a Federal law dominate \nstate homestead laws, which has not been done in our history, is not \nthe current law, and we have rejected time and again in many different \nways, I think we jeopardize the bipartisan consensus we had that led to \na vote that passed this legislation last time without the Sessions \namendment, which I think provides additional benefits for servicemen. \nWe passed it 83 to 15. I think one time it passed with 97 to 1 votes; \nanother time 78 votes. This is legislation that has had four markups in \nthe Judiciary Committee. We debated it there. We have had long debates \non the floor. As a matter of fact, as I recall, we spent 2 weeks on it \nevery time it has been before the Senate, and it is projected we might \ngo 2 weeks again on this legislation.\n  I know my friend from Illinois is concerned about soldiers. I also \nknow he does not support the bill, or at least has not been a supporter \nof it. I expect it would not hurt his feelings if this amendment, which \nwould upset the agreements we reached on homestead, led to the defeat \nof the bill. It would not hurt him at all. We had a Schumer amendment \nlast time on a very discrete issue, a very controversial issue that \nended up blocking final passage of the bill. We do not need to do that \nthis time.\n  I believe there are strong protections for our service men and women. \nI do not think, as a matter of principle, that a serviceman should be \nexempt from the means test. The means test is not harsh. It does not \nmean ``mean;'' it means ``means,'' income, how much is your income, and \nif your income is above the median income in America and you can pay \nback some of those debts, I think anybody ought to do that, if they \ncan. That is the principle of the bill.\n  We proceed at some risk when we start carving out exceptions. Senator \nFeingold wants to change the homestead exemption for those over 62. I \nsee the Chair, a distinguished new Senator with a young family. There \nare a lot of young people out here who bought a house. If we change the \nhomestead law, why just do it for seniors? Why not for everybody? Maybe \na family with two or three kids needs protection more than somebody who \nis 62. I don't know. I am saying, we have dealt with those issues. We \nhave decided we would allow the States to set the homestead limit. That \nwas a good decision, a defensible decision. That is one as a Senate, \neach time it has come forward, that we have reached that agreement, and \nI believe we ought to stay with it.\n  I do not think it reflects any diminishment or lack of respect for \nthe men and women in uniform. I respect them. I care about them. We \nhave done many things for them and I want to do more. I was proud to \nsponsor the legislation that increased the death benefits from $12,000 \nto $100,000 and increased the servicemen group life from $250,000 to \n$400,000. The President has submitted that as part of the supplemental. \nI hope we get that done. We need to do a lot of things for our \nmilitary, but altering the bankruptcy bill under the guise of helping \nour military in a way that could actually jeopardize a bipartisan \nconsensus would be the wrong approach.\n  I am concerned about it. For that reason I have to object to the \nDurbin amendment and suggest the amendment I have offered will do the \nthings he wants to see done or needs to be done without jeopardizing \nour consensus.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining in the debate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes 34 seconds remaining in \ndebate.\n  Mr. DURBIN. On which side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On the Senator's side, and 7\\1/2\\ minutes for \nthe Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If only 2\\1/2\\ minutes remain on our side, if I can get \nthe attention of the Senator from Alabama, if he is prepared to close \nthe debate--I ask the Senator from Alabama, it is my understanding he \nhas 7\\1/2\\ minutes remaining; I have 2\\1/2\\ minutes remaining, and 2\\1/\n2\\ minutes is all I need to close. I do not know if the Senator from \nAlabama wants to use up more of his time and even it out.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. In my litigation experience, the plaintiff gets the \nfinal word. So the Senator should use his time and I will finish. I may \nyield back some of that time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Fine. Let me do that, then. I ask unanimous consent that \nbefore we vote on the Durbin amendment, we have 4 minutes equally \ndivided to explain our positions on the Durbin amendment.\n\n[[Page S1853]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I do not have any objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The first vote for my Senate colleagues will be on the \nSessions amendment. The Sessions amendment changes S. 256, the \nbankruptcy bill, in the section where the bill establishes a \npresumption that people are abusing bankruptcy. In other words, they \nare not entitled to bankruptcy. The Sessions amendment says that the \njudge should consider whether the person who has filed for bankruptcy \nis in the active military service and is therefore a special \ncircumstance. So Senator Sessions leaves the military men and women in \nthe section of this bill where one presumes to be abusing the law. I do \nnot approach it in that way at all, and that is the reason why the \nmilitary groups and families are supporting my amendment and not the \nSessions amendment.\n  As I said earlier, Senator Sessions certainly respects the military, \nbut we can show our respect for the military by saying if they are \nactivated to serve this country, if they are removed from their family, \nremoved from their job, removed from their business, and terrible \nthings happen and the business fails or their family goes into \nbankruptcy and they have to go back to America with their life and \nlimbs intact and file in bankruptcy court, we are going to give them \nspecial consideration. They did something special for America; we are \ngoing to do something special for them. We are not going to make them \njump through all the hoops that have been created by this new \nbankruptcy law that are expensive, time consuming, and loaded with \ndocuments that need to be filed. We are going to protect their home for \n$75,000 worth at least, wherever they happen to be assigned in the \nmilitary. We are going to protect their basic possessions that they can \nhave after the bankruptcy is over, and we are not going to protect \nthose creditors and lenders which abused them by charging interest \nrates which were sky high. We will not give them their day in court.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Illinois has \nexpired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I urge my colleagues to oppose the Sessions amendment and \nsupport the Durbin amendment, which has the endorsement of the military \ngroups and families.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will make a few general points. This \nis not a harsh bill. People who make below median income can use the \nsame bankruptcy procedures they always have. Spouses and children are \ngoing to have a tremendously better position in this bankruptcy bill \nvis-a-vis their alimony and child support payments than we have ever \ngiven them before. There are a lot of good things in this bill.\n  I reject the suggestion that this is a bill written by credit card \ncompanies to meet their special interests. What we have is a bankruptcy \ncourt system that is not working well. It is being abused in a lot of \ndifferent ways.\n  I do not know how we came up with the idea to use the language--and \nthe Senator is correct, it does say abusing the system. It could just \nas well as have said people who make above median income will not be \nguaranteed not to pay back some of their debts because, as a matter of \npolicy, the Congress has decided that if they make above median income \nand can pay some of their debts back over a period of up to 5 years, if \nthe Court so declares, then they ought to pay some of that back. I do \nnot think that is harsh or mean. And all other debts are being wiped \nout. People cannot sue you, creditors cannot call on you. Your phones \ncannot be stopped. People can be fined if they harass you for the \ncollection of those debts. That is not a harsh thing.\n\n  The way it was written, it uses that word ``abusive,'' that we \nconsider it an abuse if you file to wipe out all of your debts when you \nhave a higher income. It might have been better to have said we just do \nnot think you ought to not pay something back if you make above median \nincome. That is the way lawyers write language and that is the way we \nstuck with it, but it should not be taken in any personal way. It is \njust a statement of policy of the Congress about who ought to pay back \ntheir debts.\n  There is talk like it is a credit card company's fault that someone \ntakes their card and goes out and runs up $3,000 or more in debts on \nthat card, and it is their fault if someone does not pay it back, that \nthey deserve what they get and they gave away $3,000. Who pays for \nthat? It is the consumers in the long run who pay for that.\n  It has been said that they send credit cards to children. Under \nAmerican law, if a young person receives a credit card and actually \ngoes out and uses it and it is in his or her name, they do not ever \nhave to pay a dime back. A minor is not bound by such a contract as \nthat. The credit card company would be the total loser in that \narrangement.\n  They are bringing all these issues up about credit cards. They bring \nthe issues up about health care and insurance and people who do not \nhave insurance or do have insurance. They raise the question of the \nmilitary. They raise the question of old people. But I just point out \nthat we have considered all of that. We have considered that for 8 \nyears now in great detail, and we have hammered out a bill that I \nbelieve is fair and just and has received 83 votes in this body last \ntime for final passage. I believe we will see another big vote this \ntime.\n  The amendment I have offered is a fair solution to the concern of our \nmilitary men and women. If it is not, we ought to look at the Soldiers \nand Sailors Relief Act and see if we can make it stronger if that is \nthe right step. Let us keep the bankruptcy law, the court procedures of \nthe Federal bankruptcy system, consistent and harmonious with the \nphilosophy we started with and have carried on with this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nMikulski be added as a cosponsor to my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I believe the Sessions amendment is \nbefore the body. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  Does the Senator from Alabama yield back his remaining time?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 23.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senators were necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Minnesota (Mr. Coleman), the Senator from Texas (Mr. \nCornyn) and the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Warner).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Minnesota (Mr. \nColeman) and the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cornyn) would have voted \n``yea.''\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Minnesota (Mr. Dayton) \nand the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, for the information of Senators, this will \nbe the last rollcall vote tonight. We will be coming in tomorrow at \n9:15. We will have 1 hour of morning business. After that morning \nbusiness, we will have two rollcall votes in all likelihood. So we need \npeople back early in the morning. After that, another amendment will be \nintroduced, and we may well have another vote prior to lunch tomorrow. \nI have talked to the Democratic leader and the managers on both sides, \nand that is agreeable. This will be the last rollcall vote tonight.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 16, As Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 4 minutes evenly divided. Who yields \ntime?\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the Senator from Illinois has suggested \nthat I go first on his amendment. I know he would like to do the \nclosing argument. He is very good at that.\n  The Senator from Illinois suggests that we are accusing military \npersons who file for bankruptcy as abusers if they qualify for the \nmeans test. That is an incorrect statement of what we are about with \nthe amendment we just passed and what the bankruptcy bill is about. \nThis legislation provides that if a bankruptcy filer makes above median \nincome--this explains a lot about the bill--then absent special \ncircumstances, a filer can be required to pay back at least a part of \nthe debts they owe, only if they make above median income. It also \nprovides that if their income falls below median income, they can stay \nin chapter 7 and wipe out all their debts just as they always have. If \na debtor's income is above median income and special circumstances \napply, they still may be eligible to avoid chapter 13, wipe out all \ntheir debts under chapter 7.\n  The amendment I just offered and just passed explicitly states that \nwhen one is called to active military duty in the Armed Forces, that \ncan be a special circumstance that could protect them and provide an \nadditional opportunity to not go into chapter 13.\n  An expert testified at the committee last week that about 80 percent \nof the people who file are below median income and that about 7 percent \nin addition will qualify under the special circumstances. The amendment \nwe just passed protects our servicemen and guarantees they will be \nconsidered under special circumstances.\n  We should vote down this amendment because it also sets a homestead \nlimit in violation of State law and contrary to the philosophy of this \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nCorzine be added as a cosponsor of the Durbin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield 30 seconds to the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. \nKennedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are having a difficult time enough now \nin meeting our goals for the Reserve and the Guard. Unless we pass the \nDurbin amendment, we are going to have a much more difficult time. If \nyou support the Guard and the Reserve and support our troops, you will \nsupport the Durbin amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  How many of us have seen men and women going off to serve our country \nto risk their lives knowing that they are leaving behind families and \ntheir businesses and knowing the economic hardship they will face? Some \nof them are going to be forced into bankruptcy. We have case after case \nwhere it has happened. All the Durbin amendment says is, if you have to \nfile bankruptcy after this new bankruptcy reform bill were to become \nlaw, the bankruptcy system will consider the fact that you have served \nour Nation by exempting you from certain aspects of this new bill. We \nwill not push you into a means test, but we will consider your \nindividual circumstances.\n  We will give you a homestead exemption of $75,000 regardless of where \nyou have been assigned for military duty. We will protect your personal \nassets with the Federal personal exemption regardless of where you have \nbeen assigned to duty and where you have to file bankruptcy.\n  There are those who say this is a special favor for the armed \nservices. It is, and I believe it should be. They risk their lives for \nus. They should not risk their home and their finances as well. We \nought to stand behind them. Yes, you can vote for the Sessions \namendment and for the Durbin amendment as well. They are not \ninconsistent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Durbin \namendment No. 16, as modified.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am glad we are now finally considering \nS. 256, the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2005. Although a few amendments \nwere accepted during the Judiciary Committee markup a couple weeks ago, \nand we did that to accommodate Democratic Members, this bill is \npractically identical to the conference report that both the House and \nSenate conferees signed\n\n[[Page S1855]]\n\nin the 107th Congress, minus the poison pill abortion amendment.\n  Many of my colleagues know I have been working on this bill for quite \nsome time now and that there has always been strong bipartisan support \nfor passing bankruptcy reform. I started working on bankruptcy issues \nin the mid-1990s, and I did that with my colleague, then-former Senator \nHeflin of Alabama. We served together as either chairman or ranking \nmember of the Administrative Oversight Subcommittee for a period of, I \nbelieve, 12 years.\n  During this period of time, we created what became known as the \nNational Bankruptcy Review Commission. We held numerous hearings in the \nsubcommittee on various topics dealing with the subject of bankruptcy \nreform.\n  In the 105th Congress, Senator Durbin and I passed out of the Senate \na bankruptcy bill by a vote of 98 to 1, but it never got to conference.\n  In the 106th Congress, Senator Torricelli and I worked closely and \nnegotiated many compromises. We were able to vote out of the Senate a \nGrassley-Torricelli bill by a vote of 83 to 14. The Senate then \napproved the bankruptcy conference report by a vote of 70 to 28. Mr. \nPresident, 53 Republican Senators and 17 Democratic Senators voted for \nthat conference report, but President Clinton pocket-vetoed the bill, \nand although we had the votes to override it, we were, unfortunately, \nnot to have that opportunity. That is what a pocket veto is all about.\n  In the 107th Congress, I introduced, with Senator Biden, the same \nlanguage of the conference report agreed to by both the House and \nSenate in the previous 106th Congress.\n  We passed the bankruptcy bill by a strong bipartisan vote of 85 to \n13, with further changes made to address concerns of Democratic Party \nmembers. We went to conference with the House and reached an agreement \non a conference report. During that conference committee, numerous \namendments were negotiated with Democrats who opposed the bill. We \nnegotiated in good faith, but the inclusion of what has become known as \nthe Schumer abortion language ultimately proved to be unacceptable to \nthe House and we were not able to get to the finish line.\n  The Senate tried to address the bankruptcy bill in the 108th \nCongress. The House passed the conference report language without the \nabortion provisions, but the Senate never took it up. In addition, the \nHouse amended a Senate bill with a bankruptcy bill and requested a \nconference, but Senate Democrats denied us the ability to have a \nconference on that bill.\n  So after three Congresses, we are here again in the 109th Congress \ntrying to pass bankruptcy reform. My Democratic colleagues, Senator \nCarper and Ben Nelson, have joined me, as well as Senators Hatch, \nSessions, and others, on this bill, S. 256, the Bankruptcy Reform Act \nof 2005. The bill continues in the tried and true spirit and tradition \nof this bill being bipartisan, so we do have that bipartisan support on \nits introduction, and from the votes we have had on amendments today, \nit looks like that bipartisanship is still going to hold. So I hope my \ncolleagues will not be fooled when longstanding opponents to this bill, \neven though they may never number more than 15, vociferously claim that \nthe bankruptcy bill is really controversial and really unnecessary \nbecause those statements, made by the very small number of people in \nthis body who do not think we need to do anything on bankruptcy reform, \neverything they are saying is far from the truth.\n  I note that throughout the years, we really bent over backward in \ntrying to accommodate Democratic Senators' concerns with the bill's \nprocess, even in this Congress. I do not think that it is any surprise \nto anyone that my position is that the bankruptcy bill is still very \nmuch simply unfinished business after all of these compromises \nthroughout now the fourth Congress. This bill has passed both the House \nand the Senate a total of 11 times between these two Houses of \nCongress. It is about time that we get the job done now. Hence, simply \nunfinished business, even though some of my colleagues will try to make \nthis be a totally brand-new debate, just like we were starting over \nwith the purest bill that I would prefer, but because purest bills \nnever get through the Senate, it takes bipartisanship.\n  We are where we are because of compromise and unfinished business, \nand hopefully we will move this bill to the House and to the President, \nsomewhat I hope a repeat of what we did 3 weeks ago with the class \naction tort reform bill. That is why at the beginning of this Congress \nI reintroduced the bipartisan conference report that was arrived at in \nthe 107th Congress with only one change, and that change is to leave \nthe poison pill of the Schumer abortion language out of it.\n  Remember that this compromise that I introduced in this year, the \n107th Congress, minus the Schumer amendment, otherwise is exactly the \nsame language negotiated when the Democrats had a majority. It was two \nCongresses ago when Senator Jeffords changed from being a Republican to \nan Independent, sitting with the Democrats. They took over the \nCongress, and it is that Democratic Senate that negotiated this \nagreement for the Senate. That is the bill we are working on now as the \nunderlying provision.\n  The Schumer abortion language that tanked the bill in the House, in \nthe 107th Congress, is left out. Other than that, the bill was \nbasically the exact same language that Senate Members, both Republican \nand Democrats, have supported.\n  The reason I did this is because we had reached many carefully \ncrafted compromises and had a good bipartisan product. I did not think \nthat we had to go through committee this time because this bill had \nbeen done so many times before, but Majority Leader Frist insisted that \nit go through regular order. The Judiciary Committee held a hearing and \nmarkup on this bill.\n  So my colleagues are clear, the committee accepted five amendments to \nfurther accommodate Democratic members. The committee also defeated a \nnumber of other amendments that were clearly offered to open issues and \nweaken the bill.\n  I would like to make my position crystal clear. We have all \ncooperated and compromised at great length in order to enact this \nlegislation that fixes an unfair bankruptcy regime, provides new \nconsumer protections, helps children in need of child support, and \nmakes other necessary reforms to a system that is often open to abuse. \nI do not believe there is any need to reopen this bill and to disrupt \nthose many compromises we have already reached with our Democratic \ncolleagues, and more importantly with the House of Representatives.\n  I hope this clarification on the history and procedural process of \nthe bill will show that, one, the bill is a bipartisan effort; two, \nthat we have been working on bankruptcy reform for too long and have \ngone over all the fine points of the bill in great detail; and, three, \nthat we have bent over backward to allow a fair process to move forward \nwith this bill.\n\n  I discussed the merits of this bankruptcy reform bill. There is broad \npublic support for reforming our bankruptcy system. The vast majority \nof people believe that individuals who file for bankruptcy protection \nshould be required to pay back some of their debt if they have the \nability to do so, and that is precisely what this bankruptcy bill \nattempts to do.\n  Most people think it should be more difficult for individuals to file \nfor bankruptcy. Most Americans are tired of paying for high rollers who \ngame the current bankruptcy system and its loopholes to get out of \npaying their fair share. Most people recognize that too many people are \nfiling for bankruptcy. Too many people are gaming the system, and the \nnumbers are up in historically high proportions in recent years that \nprove that. Bankruptcy filings were at an alltime high even during the \nboom years of our economy. Opponents to the bill act as if there is \nnothing to worry about, but the fact is we have a bankruptcy crisis on \nour hands.\n  I want to visit with my colleagues about how this bill will change \nthe way bankruptcy is being treated. Simply put, bankruptcy is a court \nproceeding where people get their debts wiped away. Every time a debt \nis wiped away through bankruptcy, somebody loses money. Of course, that \nis common sense, and when somebody who extends credit has their \nobligations wiped away in bankruptcy, they are forced to make a \ndecision. Should this loss simply be\n\n[[Page S1856]]\n\nswallowed as the cost of doing business or are prices raised for other \ncustomers to make up for another's losses?\n  Presently, when individuals file for bankruptcy under chapter 7, a \ncourt proceeding takes place and their debts are simply erased. But \nevery time a debt is wiped away through bankruptcy, someone loses \nmoney. When someone loses money in this way, he or she has to decide to \neither assume that loss as a cost of business or raise the price for \nother customers to make up for that loss.\n  When bankruptcy losses are infrequent, lenders maybe are able to \nswallow that loss. But when they are frequent, lenders need to raise \nprices for other consumers to offset their losses. These higher prices \ntranslate into higher interest rates for future borrowers. The result \nof the bankruptcy crisis is that hard-working, law-abiding Americans \nhave to pay higher prices for goods and services because somebody else \ndid not make good on their obligations to pay. This bill would make it \nharder for individuals who can repay their debt to file for bankruptcy \nunder chapter 7. This would lessen, then, the upward pressure on \ninterest rates and prices. It is only fair to require people who can \nrepay their debts to pull their own weight. But under current \nbankruptcy law, an individual can get full debt cancellation in chapter \n7 with no questions asked.\n  The Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2005 asks the very fundamental question \nof whether repayment is possible by an individual. It is this simple: \nIf repayment is possible, then he or she will be channeled into chapter \n13 of the Bankruptcy Code which requires people to repay a portion of \ntheir debt as a precondition for limited debt cancellation. In other \nwords, people who have the ability to pay will not get off scot-free \nanymore.\n  This bill does this by providing for a means-tested way of steering \npeople who are filers, who can repay a portion of their debts, away \nfrom chapter 7 bankruptcy. This test employs a legal presumption that \nchapter 7 proceedings should be dismissed or converted into chapter 13 \nwhenever the filers earn more than the State median income and can \nrepay at least $6,000 of his or her unsecured debt over a 5-year period \nof time.\n  In calculating a debtor's income, living expenses are deducted as \npermitted under IRS standards for the State and locality where the \ndebtor lives. Legitimate expenses such as food, clothing, medical, \ntransportation, attorney's fees, and charitable contributions are taken \ninto account in this analysis, as provided under Internal Revenue \nService guidelines.\n  Moreover, a debtor may rebut the presumption by demonstrating special \ncircumstances. So the means test takes into account a debtor's income, \na debtor's expenses, and allows a debtor to, even beyond that, show \nspecial circumstances which would justify adjustments to the means \ntest.\n  In this way, the bankruptcy reform bill preserves the principle of a \nfresh start for people who have been overwhelmed by medical debts or \nsudden, unforeseen emergencies. As stated by the Government Accounting \nOffice, the bill allows for the 100-percent deductibility of medical \nexpenses before examining repayment ability. The bill preserves fair \naccess, then, to bankruptcy for those people who are truly in need.\n  So that I am crystal clear, people who do not have the ability to \nrepay their debt can still use the bankruptcy system as they would have \nbefore. This bill clearly provides that people of limited income can \nstill file under chapter 7 and get that fresh start. There is a \nspecific safe harbor built in for these individuals, so their debts can \nbe wiped away, as is done right now.\n  I point this out because so often during this debate it is going to \nbe pointed out to you, inaccurately, that somehow poor people are not \ngetting that opportunity for a fresh start. So I want to repeat: There \nis a safe harbor for poor people. But the free ride is over for people \nwho have higher incomes, and who can repay their debt.\n\n  Personal responsibility has been one of the main themes of the \nbankruptcy reform bill, going back to my first introduction. But even \nbefore that, since 1993, the number of Americans who declared \nbankruptcy has increased, would you believe it, over 100 percent. While \nno one knows all the reasons underlying the bankruptcy crisis, the data \nshows that bankruptcies increased dramatically during the same \ntimeframe when unemployment was low and real wages were at an all-time \nhigh.\n  I believe the bankruptcy crisis is, in fact, a moral crisis. People \nhave to stop looking at bankruptcy as a conventional financial planning \ntool, where honest Americans have to foot the bill for those who do not \npay their honest debt. It is clear to me that our lax bankruptcy system \nmust bear some of the blame for the bankruptcy crisis. A system where \npeople are not even asked whether they can pay off their debts \nobviously contributes to the fraying of the moral fiber of America. Why \nshould people pay their bills when the system allows them to walk away \nwith no questions asked? Why should people honor their obligations when \nthey can take the easy way out through bankruptcy?\n  I think the system needs to be reformed because it is fundamentally \nunfair. This bill will promote personal responsibility among borrowers \nand create a deterrence for those hoping to cheat the system. This bill \ndoes more than provide for a flexible means test that gives judges \ndiscretion to consider the individual circumstances of each debtor in \norder to determine whether they truly belong in chapter 7. It also \ncontains tough new consumer protections. But the opponents of this bill \ndo not seem to realize that. So I want them to pay attention as I \ndescribe new procedures to prevent companies from using threats to \ncoerce debtors into paying debts which could be wiped away once they \nare in bankruptcy.\n  The bill requires the Justice Department to concentrate law \nenforcement resources on enforcing consumer protection laws against \nabusive debt collection practices. It contains significant new \ndisclosures for consumers, mandating that credit card companies provide \nkey information about how much they owe and how long it will take to \npay off their credit card debts by only making the minimum payment. \nThat is a very important consumer education for every one of us.\n  Consumers will also be given a toll-free number to call where they \ncan get information about how long it will take to pay off their own \ncredit card balances if they only pay the minimum payment. This will \neducate consumers and improve consumers' understanding of what their \nfinancial situation is.\n  Credit card companies that offer credit cards over the Internet will \nbe required for the first time ever to fully comply with the Truth In \nLending Act, so claims that this bill is unbalanced are off base.\n  Moreover, the bill makes changes which will help particularly \nvulnerable segments of our society. Child support claimants are given a \nhigher priority status when the assets of a bankruptcy estate are \ndistributed to creditors.\n  Here again, I make crystal clear that the bankruptcy bill makes \nsignificant improvements for child support claimants. This bankruptcy \nbill does not hurt them, as opponents of the bill are trying to claim. \nIn fact, the organization, the very organization that specializes in \ntracking down deadbeat dads, feels this bill will be a tremendous help \nin collecting child support.\n  The people on the front lines say the bankruptcy bill is good for \ncollecting child support. An example: The bill provides that parents \nand State child support enforcement collection agencies are given \nnotice when a debtor who owes child support or alimony files for \nbankruptcy. Bankruptcy trustees are required to notify child support \ncreditors of their right to use child support enforcement agencies to \ncollect outstanding amounts due.\n  In addition, the bill requires creditors to provide the last known \naddress of debtors owing support obligations upon the request of the \ncustodial parent.\n  The bill goes further--requiring that the identity of minor children \nbe protected in bankruptcy proceedings.\n  Concerns expressed by opponents to the bill about this being a flawed \npart of it just don't hold water.\n  The bill also makes great strides in cracking down on very wealthy \nindividuals who abuse the bankruptcy system. If you listen to our \ncritics, you might get the impression that the homestead exemption is a \ngiant loophole that this bill does not deal with, and that we are busy \nprotecting the rich.\n\n[[Page S1857]]\n\n  The GAO looked at the question of how frequently the homestead \nexemption is abused by wealthy people in bankruptcy. The GAO found that \nless than 1 percent of bankruptcies filed in States where there are \nunlimited homestead exemptions involve homesteads over $100,000. That \nmeans 99 percent of bankruptcy filings were not abusive.\n  This is not a loophole at all. In fact, the provision in this bill \nwith respect to homestead is a significant improvement from current \nlaw. There is a Federal cap on homestead exemptions in current law.\n  Under the current bankruptcy law, the debtors living in certain \nStates can shield from their creditors virtually all of the equity in \ntheir home. Consequently, some debtors relocate to these States to take \nadvantage of the mansion loophole provisions that are, in most cases, \nin their constitution. This bill would take a strong stand against this \nabuse by requiring that a person be a resident in a State for 2 years \nbefore he can claim the State's homestead exemption. Current \nrequirements can be as little as 91 days.\n  The bill further reduces the intent for abuse by requiring a debtor \nto own the homestead for at least 40 months before he can use State \nexemption law. Current law doesn't have any such requirement.\n  Furthermore, the bill would prevent individuals who have violated \nsecurity laws or individuals who have engaged in criminal conduct from \nshielding their homestead assets from those whom they have defrauded or \ninjured. Specifically, if a debtor was convicted of a felony, violated \na security law, or committed a criminal act intentionally, or engaged \nin reckless misconduct that caused serious physical injury or debt, the \nbill overrides State homestead exemption laws and caps the debtor's \nhomestead at $125,000 as the amount that would be protected.\n  To the extent that the debtor's homestead exemption was obtained \nthrough the fraudulent conversion of nonexempt assets during the 10-\nyear period preceding the filings of the bankruptcy case, this bill \nrequires such exemption to be reduced by the amount attributable to the \nfraud.\n  These homestead provisions were delicately compromised between those \nwho believe that the homestead should be capped through Federal law--I \nam one of those--or others who are uncomfortable with a uniform Federal \ncap which may violate their own State constitution.\n  So, please, tomorrow when this debate is conducted on changing this \nprovision that has been so carefully worked out over a period of at \nleast two Congresses, don't believe it when people say we have a gaping \nloophole. The homestead provisions in the bankruptcy bill will \nsubstantially cut down on the abuses that might be referred to.\n  I would like to talk about another thing this bankruptcy bill does \nwhich is so important for those of us who represent agricultural \nStates. This bill makes chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code, which gives \nessential protections to family farmers, a permanent chapter in the \nBankruptcy Code. The bill enhances these protections. It makes more \nfarmers eligible for chapter 12. The bill lets farmers in bankruptcy \navoid capital gains tax. This is very important because it will free up \nresources to be invested in farming operations that otherwise would go \ndown the black hole of the Internal Revenue Service. Farmers need this \nchapter 12 safety net.\n  In addition, the bankruptcy bill will for the first time create badly \nneeded protections for patients in bankruptcy hospitals and nursing \nhomes. Let me provide an example of what could happen right now without \nthe patient protections contained in this bill.\n  At a hearing I held on nursing home bankruptcies, I learned about a \nsituation in California where a bankruptcy trustee just showed up at a \nnursing home on a Friday evening and evicted the residents of that \nnursing home. The bankruptcy trustee didn't provide any notice \nwhatsoever that this was going to happen. There was absolutely no \nchance for the nursing home residents to be relocated. The bankruptcy \ntrustee literally put these elderly people out on the street and \nchanged the locks on the doors so that they couldn't get back into the \nnursing home. The bankruptcy bill will prevent this from ever happening \nagain. These are protections that we will be giving these deserving \nsenior citizens for the first time.\n  The truth is that bankruptcies hurt real people. It isn't fair to \npermit people who can repay to skip out on their debts. Yes, we must \npreserve fair access to bankruptcy for those who truly need a fresh \nstart. This bill does not in any way compromise that century-old \nprinciple of our Bankruptcy Code.\n\n  This bankruptcy reform act does that--it guarantees a fresh start. It \nlets those people who can pay their debts live up to their \nresponsibilities as well.\n  Let us restore the balance. Let us pass this bill. This bill is a \nproduct of much negotiation and compromise over three Congresses. It is \nfair, it is balanced, but, more importantly, it is a bill that once got \nto President Clinton and he pocket-vetoed it. This bill that passed by \noverwhelming majorities of both Houses of Congress is long overdue \nlegislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation but, more \nimportantly, help us defeat amendments that are opening all of the \ncarefully crafted compromises that we worked on over the last 3 to 4 \nyears.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               Supreme Court's ruling in Roper v. Simmons\n\n  Mr. President, today, the Supreme Court struck down the death penalty \nfor juvenile persons 17 years old or younger. I commend the Court for \nits wise and courageous decision.\n  Three years ago, the Supreme Court held that the eighth amendment to \nthe Constitution prohibits the execution of the mentally retarded. In \nreaching that decision, the Court emphasized the large number of States \nthat had enacted laws prohibiting executions of the retarded after \n1989, when the Court had earlier declined to hold them \nunconstitutional. As the Court observed in reaching its decision 3 \nyears ago to ban them, ``It is fair to say that a national consensus \nhas developed'' against such executions.\n  The Court cited several factors showing why executing the mentally \nretarded is unconstitutional: Mentally retarded persons lack the \ncapacity to fully appreciate the consequences of their actions; they \nare less able to control their impulses and learn from experience, and \nare therefore less likely to be deterred by the death penalty; they are \nmore likely to give false confessions, and less able to give meaningful \nassistance to their lawyers.\n  Today, the Supreme Court recognized that this logic also applies to \nthe execution of juveniles. The Court cited a number of factors--\nincluding the rejection of the juvenile death penalty in the majority \nof States, the infrequency of its use even where it remains legal, and \nthe consistency of the trend toward abolition of the practice. It \nconcluded that these factors provide ``sufficient evidence that today \nour society views juveniles, in the words used respecting the mentally \nretarded, as `categorically less culpable than the average criminal' ''\n  Today's ruling is a welcome victory for justice and human rights. \nSince the death penalty was reinstated in the United States in 1976, \nthere have been 21 executions of juvenile offenders. In the last 5 \nyears, only the United States, Iran, the Democratic Republic of Congo, \nand China have executed a juvenile offender. It is long past time that \nwe wipe this stain from our Nation's human rights record.\n  Other steps need to be taken as well to reform our system of capital \npunishment.\n  For too long, our courts have tolerated a shamefully low standard for\n\n[[Page S1858]]\n\nlegal representation in death penalty cases. Some judges have even \nrefused to order relief in cases where the defense lawyer slept through \nsubstantial portions of the trial.\n  I am hopeful that the legislation proposed by our colleagues Patrick \nLeahy and Gordon Smith in the Senate, and Bill Delahunt and Ray LaHood \nin the House, and signed into law by the President last year, will \nserve to improve the quality of counsel in capital cases.\n  I am heartened by the strong statement in President Bush's State of \nthe Union Address last month in support of that program. I am also \nencouraged by the President's pledge to dramatically expand the use of \nDNA evidence to prevent wrongful convictions.\n  As we work together to remedy the most flagrant defects in the \napplication of the death penalty, however, we must never lose sight of \nits basic injustice. Experience shows that continued imposition of the \ndeath penalty will inevitably lead to wrongful executions. Many of us \nare concerned about the racial disparities in the imposition of capital \npunishment and the wide disparities in the States in its application. \nThe unequal, unfair, arbitrary and discriminatory use of the death \npenalty is completely contrary to our Nation's commitment to fairness \nand equal justice for all, and we need to do all we can to correct \nthese fundamental flaws.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/01/senate-section/article/S1858-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1858-S1859]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      RULES OF PROCEDURE--PERMANENT SUBCOMMITTEE ON INVESTIGATIONS\n\n  Ms. COLLINS.

No public hearing connected with an investigation may be \n     held without the approval of either the Chairman and the \n     Ranking Minority Member or the approval of a majority of the \n     Members of the Subcommittee. In all cases, notification to \n     all Members of the intent to hold hearings must be given at \n     least 7 days in advance to the date of the hearing. The \n     Ranking Minority Member should be kept fully apprised of \n     preliminary inquiries, investigations, and hearings. \n     Preliminary inquiries may be initiated by the Subcommittee \n     majority staff upon the approval of the Chairman and notice \n     of such approval to the Ranking Minority Member or the \n     minority counsel. Preliminary inquiries may be undertaken by \n     the minority staff upon the approval of the Ranking Minority \n     Member and notice of such approval to the Chairman or Chief \n     Counsel. Investigations may be undertaken upon the approval \n     of the Chairman of the Subcommittee and the Ranking Minority \n     Member with notice of such approval to all members.\n       No public hearing shall be held if the minority Members \n     unanimously object, unless the full Committee on Homeland \n     Security and Governmental Affairs by a majority vote approves \n     of such public hearing.\n       Senate Rules will govern all closed sessions convened by \n     the Subcommittee (Rule XXVI, Sec. 5(b), Standing Rules of the \n     Senate).\n       2. Subpoenas for witnesses, as well as documents and \n     records, may be authorized and issued by the Chairman, or any \n     other Member of the Subcommittee designated by him, with \n     notice to the Ranking Minority Member. A written notice of \n     intent to issue a subpoena shall be provided to the Chairman \n     and Ranking Minority Member of the Committee, or staff \n     officers designated by them, by the Subcommittee Chairman or \n     a staff officer designated by him, immediately upon such \n     authorization, and no subpoena shall issue for at least 48 \n     hours, excluding Saturdays and Sundays, from delivery to the \n     appropriate offices, unless the Chairman and Ranking Minority \n     Member waive the 48 hour waiting period or unless the \n     Subcommittee Chairman certifies in writing to the Chairman \n     and Ranking Minority Member that, in his opinion, it is \n     necessary to issue a subpoena immediately.\n       3. The Chairman shall have the authority to call meetings \n     of the Subcommittee. This authority may be delegated by the \n     Chairman to any other Member of the Subcommittee when \n     necessary.\n       4. If at least three Members of the Subcommittee desire the \n     Chairman to call a special meeting, they may file in the \n     office of the Subcommittee, a written request therefor, \n     addressed to the Chairman. Immediately thereafter, the clerk \n     of the Subcommittee shall notify the Chairman of \n     such request. If, within 3 calendar days after the filing \n     of such request, the Chairman fails to call the requested \n     special meeting, which is to be held within 7 calendar \n     days after the filing of such request, a majority of the \n     Subcommittee Members may file in the office of the \n     Subcommittee their written notice that a special \n     Subcommittee meeting will be held, specifying the date and \n     hour thereof, and the Subcommittee shall meet on that date \n     and hour. Immediately upon the filing of such notice, the \n     Subcommittee clerk shall notify all Subcommittee Members \n     that such special meeting will be held and inform them of \n     its dates and hour. If the Chairman is not present at any \n     regular, additional or special meeting, the ranking \n     majority Member present shall preside.\n       5. For public or executive sessions, one Member of the \n     Subcommittee shall constitute a quorum for the administering \n     of oaths and the taking of testimony in any given case or \n     subject matter.\n       Five (5) Members of the Subcommittee shall constitute a \n     quorum for the transaction of Subcommittee business other \n     than the administering of oaths and the taking of testimony.\n       6. All witnesses at public or executive hearings who \n     testify to matters of fact shall be sworn.\n       7. If, during public or executive sessions, a witness, his \n     counsel, or any spectator conducts himself in such a manner \n     as to prevent, impede, disrupt, obstruct, or interfere with \n     the orderly administration of such hearing, the Chairman or \n     presiding Member of the Subcommittee present during such \n     hearing may request the Sergeant at Arms of the Senate, his \n     representative or any law enforcement official to eject said \n     person from the hearing room.\n       8. Counsel retained by any witness and accompanying such \n     witness shall be permitted to be present during the testimony \n     of such witness at any public or executive hearing, and to \n     advise such witness while he is testifying, of his legal \n     rights, Provided, however, that in the case of any witness \n     who is an officer or employee of the government, or of a \n     corporation or association, the Subcommittee Chairman may \n     rule that representation by counsel from the government, \n     corporation, or association, or by counsel representing other \n     witnesses, creates a conflict of interest, and that the \n     witness may only be represented during interrogation by staff \n     or during testimony before the Subcommittee by personal \n     counsel not from the government, corporation, or association, \n     or by personal counsel not representing other witnesses. This \n     rule shall not be construed to excuse a witness from \n     testifying in the event his counsel is ejected for conducting \n     himself in such a manner so as to prevent, impede, disrupt, \n     obstruct, or interfere with the orderly administration of the \n     hearings; nor shall this rule be construed as authorizing \n     counsel to coach the witness or answer for the witness. The \n     failure of any witness to secure counsel shall not excuse \n     such witness from complying with a subpoena or deposition \n     notice.\n       9. Depositions.\n       9.1  Notice. Notices for the taking of depositions in an \n     investigation authorized by the Subcommittee shall be \n     authorized and issued by the Chairman. The Chairman of the \n     full Committee and the Ranking Minority Member of the \n     Subcommittee shall be kept fully apprised of the \n     authorization for the taking of depositions. Such notices \n     shall specify a time and place of examination, and the \n     name of the Subcommittee Member or Members or staff \n     officer or officers who will take the deposition. The \n     deposition shall be in private. The Subcommittee shall not \n     initiate procedures leading to criminal or civil \n     enforcement proceedings for a witness' failure to appear \n     unless the deposition notice was accompanied by a \n     Subcommittee subpoena.\n       9.2  Counsel. Witnesses may be accompanied at a deposition \n     by counsel to advise them of their legal rights, subject to \n     the provisions of Rule 8.\n       9.3  Procedure. Witnesses shall be examined upon oath \n     administered by an individual authorized by local law to \n     administer oaths. Questions shall be propounded orally by \n     Subcommittee Members or staff. Objections by the witness as \n     to the form of questions shall be noted for the record. If a \n     witness objects to a question and refuses to testify on the \n     basis of relevance or privilege, the Subcommittee Members or \n     staff may proceed with the deposition, or may, at that time \n     or at a subsequent time, seek a ruling by telephone or \n     otherwise on the objection from the Chairman or such \n     Subcommittee Member as designated by him. If the Chairman or \n     designated Member overrules the objection, he may refer the \n     matter to the Subcommittee or he may order and direct the \n     witness to answer the question, but the Subcommittee shall \n     not initiate procedures leading to civil or criminal \n     enforcement unless the witness refuses to testify after he \n     has been ordered and directed to answer by a Member of the \n     Subcommittee.\n\n[[Page S1859]]\n\n       9.4  Filing. The Subcommittee staff shall see that the \n     testimony is transcribed or electronically recorded. If it is \n     transcribed, the witness shall be furnished with a copy for \n     review pursuant to the provisions of Rule 12. The individual \n     administering the oath shall certify on the transcript that \n     the witness was duly sworn in his presence, the transcriber \n     shall certify that the transcript is a true record of the \n     testimony, and the transcript shall then be filed with the \n     Subcommittee clerk. Subcommittee staff may stipulate with the \n     witness to changes in this procedure; deviations from this \n     procedure which do not substantially impair the reliability \n     of the record shall not relieve the witness from his \n     obligation to testify truthfully.\n       10. Any witness desiring to read a prepared or written \n     statement in executive or public hearings shall file a copy \n     of such statement with the Chief Counsel or Chairman of the \n     Subcommittee 48 hours in advance of the hearings at which the \n     statement is to be presented unless the Chairman and the \n     Ranking Minority Member waive this requirement. The \n     Subcommittee shall determine whether such statement may be \n     read or placed in the record of the hearing.\n       11. A witness may request, on grounds of distraction, \n     harassment, personal safety, or physical discomfort, that \n     during the testimony, television, motion picture, and other \n     cameras and lights shall not be directed at him. Such \n     requests shall be ruled on by the Subcommittee Members \n     present at the hearing.\n       12. An accurate stenographic record shall be kept of the \n     testimony of all witnesses in executive and public hearings. \n     The record of his own testimony whether in public or \n     executive session shall be made available for inspection by \n     witness or his counsel under Subcommittee supervision; a copy \n     of any testimony given in public session or that part of the \n     testimony given by the witness in executive session and \n     subsequently quoted or made part of the record in a public \n     session shall be made available to any witness at his expense \n     if he so requests.\n       13. Interrogation of witnesses at Subcommittee hearings \n     shall be conducted on behalf of the Subcommittee by Members \n     and authorized Subcommittee staff personnel only.\n       14. Any person who is the subject of an investigation in \n     public hearings may submit to the Chairman of the \n     Subcommittee questions in writing for the cross-examination \n     of other witnesses called by the Subcommittee. With the \n     consent of a majority of the Members of the Subcommittee \n     present and voting, these questions, or paraphrased versions \n     of them, shall be put to the witness by the Chairman, by a \n     Member of the Subcommittee or by counsel of the Subcommittee.\n       15. Any person whose name is mentioned or who is \n     specifically identified, and who believes that testimony or \n     other evidence presented at a public hearing, or comment made \n     by a Subcommittee Member or counsel, tends to defame him or \n     otherwise adversely affect his reputation, may (a) request to \n     appear personally before the Subcommittee to testify in his \n     own behalf, or, in the alternative, (b) file a sworn \n     statement of facts relevant to the testimony or other \n     evidence or comment complained of. Such request and such \n     statement shall be submitted to the Subcommittee for its \n     consideration and action.\n       If a person requests to appear personally before the \n     Subcommittee pursuant to alternative (a) referred to herein, \n     said request shall be considered untimely if it is not \n     received by the Chairman of the Subcommittee or its counsel \n     in writing on or before thirty (30) days subsequent to the \n     day on which said person's name was mentioned or otherwise \n     specifically identified during a public hearing held before \n     the Subcommittee, unless the Chairman and the Ranking \n     Minority Member waive this requirement.\n       If a person requests the filing of his sworn statement \n     pursuant to alternative (b) referred to herein, the \n     Subcommittee may condition the filing of said sworn statement \n     upon said person agreeing to appear personally before the \n     Subcommittee and to testify concerning the matters contained \n     in his sworn statement, as well as any other matters related \n     to the subject of the investigation before the Subcommittee.\n       16. All testimony taken in executive session shall be kept \n     secret and will not be released for public information \n     without the approval of a majority of the Subcommittee.\n       17. No Subcommittee report shall be released to the public \n     unless approved by a majority of the Subcommittee and after \n     no less than 10 days' notice and opportunity for comment by \n     the Members of the Subcommittee unless the need for such \n     notice and opportunity to comment has been waived in writing \n     by a majority of the minority Members.\n       18. The Ranking Minority Member may select for appointment \n     to the Subcommittee staff a Chief Counsel for the minority \n     and such other professional staff members and clerical \n     assistants as he deems advisable. The total compensation \n     allocated to such minority staff members shall be not less \n     than one-third the total amount allocated for all \n     Subcommittee staff salaries during any given year. The \n     minority staff members shall work under the direction and \n     supervision of the Ranking Minority Member. The Chief Counsel \n     for the minority shall be kept fully informed as to \n     preliminary inquiries, investigations, and hearings, and \n     shall have access to all material in the files of the \n     Subcommittee.\n       19. When it is determined by the Chairman and Ranking \n     Minority Member, or by a majority of the Subcommittee, that \n     there is reasonable cause to believe that a violation of law \n     may have occurred, the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member \n     by letter, or the Subcommittee by resolution, are authorized \n     to report such violation to the proper State, local and/or \n     Federal authorities. Such letter or report may recite the \n     basis for the determination of reasonable cause. This rule is \n     not authority for release of documents or testimony.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/01/senate-section/article/S1859-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1859-S1860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         CELEBRATION OF THE 44TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE PEACE CORPS\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today it is my privilege to recognize \nthe outstanding accomplishments of the Peace Corps as it celebrates its \n44th anniversary this week.\n  Throughout the years, the Peace Corps has endured as one of the most \nimportant forces in our Nation's public diplomacy. At its founding in \n1961, President Kennedy remarked, ``The initial reactions to the Peace \nCorps proposal are convincing proof that we have, in this country, an \nimmense reservoir of such men and women--anxious to sacrifice their \nenergies and time and toil to the cause of world peace and human \nprogress.'' Forty-four years on, the tireless efforts of thousands of \nPeace Corps volunteers have borne out President Kennedy's vision of \nservice to the global community.\n  Today, nearly 8,000 Americans serving in 72 nations around the world \nplay a vital role in the advancement of education, health care, HIV/\nAIDS education, and community and agricultural development. And because \nof its volunteers' ability and willingness to fully integrate into \ntheir host communities, the Peace Corps has become a leader in \nimplementing new strategies for development, such as promoting \ncommunity-based small businesses and microenterprise projects. Aided by \nthese innovations, our volunteers continue to succeed in their mission \nof helping those most in need while promoting goodwill between \nAmericans and the people they serve. In this time of global adversity, \nwe cannot underestimate the contributions of the Peace Corps toward the \ncauses of equality, opportunity, and peace.\n  As the Peace Corps embarks on its next 44 years, it will no doubt \nremain in the forefront of our efforts to expand prosperity and mutual \nunderstanding. I extend my congratulations to the Peace Corps and wish \nit every success in the future.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to commemorate the 44th \nanniversary of the Peace Corps. For decades now, Peace Corps volunteers \nhave generously and honorably served our country by working to build an \nunderstanding between the U.S. and foreign nations, and to create \nbetter lives for people around the world. Peace Corps volunteers \nreflect many of the very best impulses of the American people, and I am \npleased to honor these volunteers of all backgrounds and ages. I am \nespecially proud to commend the 252 sworn-in volunteers from Wisconsin. \nSince the Peace Corps' inception in 1961, the people of the State of \nWisconsin have served as an important foundation for this program. The \nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison provided a training camp for new \nvolunteers during the 1960s and over 2,600 of its alumni have \nparticipated in this program. UW Madison is second in the Nation in the \nnumber of current serving volunteers, 142. Wisconsin has an historic \nlegacy in the Peace Corps, and I commend those who have done Wisconsin \nproud.\n  In 1960, President Kennedy challenged Americans to serve their \ncountry by living and working in developing countries. His vision \ncontinues to inspire generations. Today, over 178,000 Americans have \nanswered his call by joining the Peace Corps. When I have the \nopportunity to travel abroad, I am amazed by the lasting impact that \nthis organization and these eager men and women have had around the \nworld.\n  Serving in 138 countries, Peace Corps volunteers contribute to \ndeveloping countries, as varied as Ecuador, Mauritania, Azerbaijan, \nBangladesh, and Tonga, through a range of talents and skills, from \nserving as teachers to agriculture workers to HIV/AIDS educators. I am \nparticularly impressed that over 3,100 volunteers specifically\n\n[[Page S1860]]\n\nwork to combat global HIV/AIDS. I have traveled to Africa to see up \nclose the devastation this international pandemic has caused, and I \ncontinue to be active on this important and urgent issue. I commend all \nthe men and women volunteers who selflessly work to better communities \naround the world.\n  On March 1, 2005, as the Peace Corps celebrates its 44th anniversary, \nits work is particularly relevant to the challenges before our country \nand our world today. It is so important for Americans to become \ninvolved in world affairs, especially through programs such as the \nPeace Corps. Former Secretary of State Colin Powell and his successor \nCondoleezza Rice both acknowledge that Americans must make a serious \ninvestment in reaching across borders and turning around growing anti-\nAmerican sentiments abroad. I am constantly impressed by Peace Corps \nvolunteers who devote themselves to personally bridging the gap between \npeople of our country and those beyond our borders, proving by their \nwork our country's commitment to positive changes and mutual \nunderstanding. These volunteers amplify the effects of their service \nwhen they share their Peace Corps stories and experiences with people \nback home--with family and friends, in corresponding with classrooms, \nor in recruiting new volunteers to carry the Peace Corps mission \nforward.\n  I congratulate Peace Corps and its volunteers for 44 years of \neffective and admirable service, and I urge all of my colleagues to \ncontinue to work to support this unique and inspiring organization.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/01/senate-section/article/S1860-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO THE TUSKEGEE AIRMEN\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, today, with a great sense of honor and \nrespect, I rise to pay tribute to the Tuskegee Airmen, both for their \nbravery while fighting for our country's freedom in World War II and \nfor their contributions in creating an integrated U.S. Air Force.\n  Like many of the heroes of World War II, these brave men left their \nfamilies at home to fight overseas for the principles of freedom and \ndemocracy. Unlike most of their colleagues, these great airmen also \nfought an enemy of racism and prejudice at home. Thankfully, on both \nfronts, they were victorious. I am proud to stand today to recognize \nthis great accomplishment, honor their service, and thank them for \ntheir dedication to racial equality in the U.S. armed services.\n  For decades, our military denied African Americans the opportunity to \nserve in leadership positions in the armed services. Although willing \nto serve a country that did not yet fully recognize their own civil \nrights, these men were systematically denied the benefit of skilled \ntraining in preparation for war. It was thought that they lacked the \nqualifications for combat duty or the ability to use sophisticated \nequipment. In 1941, under pressure from civil rights organizations, the \nArmy Air Force set up a training program in Alabama to experiment with \ntraining African Americans as military pilots. The training for this \nprogram took place at the Tuskegee Institute in Tuskegee, AL, the \nfamous school founded by Booker T. Washington on July 4, 1881.\n  There was doubt among many in the military that African Americans \nwere up to the task, but the Tuskegee Airmen proved them all wrong. \nFighter pilots, navigators, bombardiers, and maintenance staffs were \nsuccessfully trained to be members of the 332nd Fighter Group. The \nairmen were under the able command of COL Benjamin Davis, Jr., and the \nhighly motivated group flew successful missions over Sicily, the \nMediterranean, and North Africa.\n  By the end of the war, 992 men had graduated from the pilot training \nprograms at Tuskegee, and 450 had seen combat overseas. The Tuskegee \nAirmen were awarded numerous high honors, including Distinguished \nFlying Crosses, Legions of Merit, Silver Stars, Purple Hearts, the \nCroix de Guerre, and the Red Star of Yugoslavia. In all their combat, \nthey never lost a bomber to enemy fighters. A Distinguished Unit \nCitation was awarded to the 332nd Fighter Group for ``outstanding \nperformance and extraordinary heroism'' in 1945. By the end of the war, \nthe Airmen had overcome segregation and racial prejudice to become one \nof the most highly respected fighter groups of World War II.\n  We must never forget the spirit and dedication of these great \npatriots. Today, as our Air Force is playing such an important role in \nthe global war on terrorism, the ideas and principles that the Tuskegee \nAirmen represent remain of the utmost importance. With this in mind, I \nstand today in support of S. Con. Res. 11, a resolution that Mr. Shelby \nand I have submitted to express the sense of Congress that the U.S. Air \nForce should continue to honor and learn from the great example set by \nthe Tuskegee Airmen. I ask my fellow Senators to support this \nresolution, and I urge the U.S. Air Force to continue to take note of \nthis important part of its storied history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/01/senate-section/article/S1860-2", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              CENTRAL INTERCOLLEGIATE ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to recognize the success \nof the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association as they tip off \ntheir 60th Men's Basketball Tournament this week.\n  The Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association, CIAA, is an \nathletic conference consisting of 12 historically African-American \ninstitutions of higher education, including: Bowie State University, \nElizabeth City State University, Fayetteville State University, Johnson \nC. Smith University, Livingstone College, North Carolina Central \nUniversity, St. Augustine's College, St. Paul's College, Shaw \nUniversity, Virginia State University, Virginia Union University and \nWinston-Salem State University.\n  Established in 1912, the CIAA is the Nation's oldest black athletic \nconference, rich in history and heritage. The conference is entering \nits 85th year of athletic competition in which they have reaped \ncontinued success and recognition on the field and the court. The CIAA \nis a premiere member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, \nNCAA, Division II and the reputation of their athletic programs, in \nconjunction with the academic success of their athletes, is a proud \nlegacy for the conference.\n  The CIAA basketball tournament began humbly in Washington, DC in 1946 \nand has grown into one of the largest, most prestigious and long-\ntenured sporting traditions in America, particularly in the South. \nStarted by a group of visionaries led by legendary coach John \nMcClendon, the tournament has come to showcase dynamic basketball that \nhas produced the likes of past NBA stars Earl Monroe, Bobby Dandridge, \nCharles Oakley, Rick Mahorn and current NBA star Ronald Murray of the \nSeattle Supersonics. The weeklong affair draws a host of national \ncelebrities and dignitaries for a variety of activities and events. The \ntournament festivities serve as a sort of homecoming for students, fans \nand alumni of the conference. In 2004, the tournament drew over 100,000 \nfans to Raleigh, NC, making it the third largest basketball tournament \nin the nation, regardless of division.\n  As a former collegiate athlete, I understand the difficulties faced \nby institutions of higher education in planning and supporting athletic \ntournaments. I congratulate the Central Intercollegiate Athletic \nAssociation on its rich and sustained history of superb college \nathletics. The celebration of this 60th Anniversary Basketball \nTournament represents a remarkable achievement for those who have \nworked tirelessly over the past decades to ensure its longevity. I wish \nthe conference and its annual tournament continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/01/senate-section/article/S1860-3", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1860-S1861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            WILLIE McCARTER\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to take a few moments today to \nacknowledge the work and leadership of Willie McCarter who has served \nfor the past 15 years as chairman of the International Fund for \nIreland, IFI.\n  The IFI was conceived by my old friend Tip O'Neill who secured the \noriginal funding in 1986. Willie McCarter became involved with the fund \nin 1989 and became chairman in 1992. Under his tenure, the fund \nflourished and became an integral economic tool that helped bring peace \nand understanding in Northern Ireland.\n\n[[Page S1861]]\n\n  The investments that the IFI made in border counties provided an \neconomic boost to communities that had no hope. In tumultuous times \nwhere communities were divided by religion, the IFI sponsored projects \nthat not only created desperately needed jobs but employment where \nCatholics and Protestants worked side by side.\n  Marcelle and I have become close friends with Willie and his wife \nMary. I know that our friendship will transcend his departure as \nchairman from the IFI. We look forward to visits with both of them here \nand in Ireland for many years to come.\n  The Irish Times interviewed Willie McCarter prior to his stepping \ndown as chairman of the IFI at the end of February. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the entire article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the Irish Times, Feb. 4, 2005]\n\n             Fund Chairman Prepares To Bid a Fond Farewell\n\n       Willie McCarter, who is stepping down as chairman of the \n     International Fund for Ireland, tells Siobhan Creaton, \n     Finance Correspondent, of its many achievements.\n       After 15 years as a key figure at the International Fund \n     for Ireland (IFI), Derry-born businessman Willie McCarter is \n     preparing for departure.\n       At the end of February he will relinquish the chairman's \n     role to Denis Rooney. Mr. Rooney is a chartered quantity \n     surveyor and businessman from Northern Ireland whom the \n     British and Irish governments have hailed as a skilled and \n     able leader for the fund.\n       Mr. McCarter will be sad to say goodbye but says he is \n     proud of the IFI's contribution towards creating a more \n     stable community in Northern Ireland.\n       The fund, which has committed 768 million to 5,500 projects \n     in the North and border counties, was set up by the Irish and \n     British governments in 1986 as a vehicle to promote economic \n     regeneration and reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the \n     six border counties.\n       The late U.S. politician T.P. `Tipp' O'Neill championed the \n     idea after a visit to Donegal and Derry.\n       ``John Hume brought him to see his grandmother's home \n     outside Buncrana in 1985 and later they went to Derry. That \n     was during the dark days of unemployment and Tipp said he \n     would try to do something to create jobs,'' Mr. McCarter \n     says.\n       In Washington, O'Neill's quest to raise financial aid for \n     the region was supported by President Reagan and resulted in \n     the U.S. Government pledging $50 million (EUR 38.4 million) \n     for this purpose.\n       The British and Irish governments, which had concluded the \n     Anglo-Irish Agreement, used the money to start the IFI in \n     1986.\n       It was a controversial vehicle and, having grown out of \n     this agreement, was viewed with deep suspicion by Northern \n     Ireland's Protestant community.\n       Mr. McCarter, a Protestant, recalls the fund's initial \n     difficulties.\n       ``It had very few friends. It got bound up in the political \n     to-ing and fro-ing around the Anglo Irish Agreement.''\n       In 1989, Mr. McCarter, who was chief executive of Fruit of \n     the Loom, the clothing manufacturer that was rapidly \n     expanding in Donegal and Derry, was asked to get involved. \n     The US clothing manufacturer had invested in Mr. McCarter's \n     women's underwear manufacturing plant in Buncrana in 1985 and \n     had agreed to invest GBP 18.5 million (EUR 26.8 million) and \n     to grow its workforce in Donegal and Derry to 3,500.\n       ``I was up to my tonsils running Fruit of the Loom,'' he \n     says. ``I spoke to John Holland his mentor in the US about \n     getting involved in the fund. He said it would be very good \n     for me and for the company.''\n       Mr. Holland ended the conversation saying: ``I am sure you \n     would be able to do that as well as run the company''.\n       In 1992, his involvement with the fund increased when he \n     took over as chairman.\n       ``The fund was a subtle way to bring people from both \n     communities together. Instead of giving them cups of tea and \n     saying `let's get reconciled', it used job creation to give \n     people an economic focus. In a low-key way, the fund brought \n     people from both communities into projects to provide a human \n     dynamic and develop relationships that would not have existed \n     in a divided society.''\n       Some of its flagship undertakings include the re-opening of \n     the Shannon-Erne waterway, while many town centres have been \n     given a face-lift with its support.\n       Mr. McCarter believes the fund's ability to be the first to \n     put its cash on the table to back new projects has been a \n     tremendous asset in terms of providing a kick-start for fresh \n     ideas. Its role in the Shannon-Erne waterway, he says, is a \n     good example of what the fund can do.\n       ``When it was first mentioned, it was regarded as a \n     completely mad project. The fund commissioned a GBP 1 million \n     feasibility study that showed it might work. We later put \n     another GBP 5 million into it and attracted other investment. \n     If the fund hadn't put GBP 1 million down initially, the \n     Shannon-Erne waterway wouldn't have happened,'' he says.\n       The fund claims to have played a central role in bringing \n     about the joint marketing of Ireland as a tourist destination \n     by the authorities in the North and the Republic. It has also \n     fostered closer linkages between Cork, Trinity and Queen's \n     universities in the field of microelectronics.\n       ``A lot of initiatives have worked but the fund's role has \n     been forgotten,'' according to Mr. McCarter. ``I am glad that \n     the fund is seen as a fair and reputable dealer. I have \n     worked with very gifted people on the board and in the \n     communities who have made a great contribution.''\n       While US presidents have played a crucial role in \n     supporting the peace process and the IFI's work, its \n     contribution to the fund has been reduced from $25 million to \n     $18.5 million under the Bush administration due to budgetary \n     pressures.\n       Mr. McCarter says this figure is ``not half bad'' and \n     suggests that the Bush administration has been misjudged in \n     terms of its commitment to Ireland.\n       ``President Bush may not have the same personal interest as \n     President Clinton but the administration has a very tangible \n     interest in Ireland, the peace process and the fund. Support \n     in the Senate and the House of Representatives remains \n     extremely strong. These people are made of stern stuff. They \n     will see things through until there is a stable society,'' he \n     says.\n       While the peace process is currently at an impasse, Mr \n     McCarter believes there is little danger that the enormous \n     strides made, in terms of improving relationships and raising \n     prosperity, will be reversed.\n       ``I don't think it will unravel. Too many people can see \n     the benefits. I have lived in a border area all of my life \n     and can see a tangible change.''\n       Mr McCarter was ousted from Fruit of the Loom in 1997 \n     following differences with its then owner, US corporate \n     raider Bill Farley. The exit of the McCarter family from the \n     business was a blow for the workforce and signalled the end \n     of an era in terms of job security. The workforce has dropped \n     to around 500, with the entire operations to be moved to \n     Morocco over the next three to four years.\n       ``When it goes to Morocco, it will be after 20 years in the \n     north- west. It did a lot of good. Fruit of the Loom led to a \n     lot of people making lives for themselves and was influential \n     in improving the local infrastructure. I will be sorry to see \n     it go. I am very fond of Donegal and Derry, which now need a \n     substantial investment.''\n       In the future, Mr McCarter says his main interest will be \n     in Cooley Distillery, the independent whiskey maker founded \n     by his long-time friend, John Teeling. Mr McCarter is a \n     director and is also on the board of Norish. He is keen to \n     get involved in other businesses.\n       ``I already do quite a lot of work at Cooley and am looking \n     for more non-executive roles,'' he says. ``I would also like \n     to find some way of retaining the many US connections I have \n     made over the years.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/01/senate-section/article/S1861-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1861-S1862]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING PATRICIA R.

In just a few days, Patty will be retiring \nand my office will be losing a truly superb staff member. I cannot \nthink of many people who have contributed as selflessly and as \ncompetently in a wonderfully bipartisan fashion as she has.\n  Prior to joining my staff, Patty served 11 years at the Small \nBusiness Administration and spent 4 years directing the staff of then-\nchair of the Senate Small Business Committee, Senator Dale Bumpers from \nArkansas. During Senator Bumpers' chairmanship, Patty served as his \nmajority counsel and later as his deputy staff director and counsel. In \nher tenure as my staff director and chief counsel on the Senate \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, she has proven to be \nan invaluable asset to me and the committee.\n  Patty joined my staff shortly after I became the chair of the Small \nBusiness Committee in 1997. Whether it has been developing and \nimplementing an effective small business legislative agenda, preparing \nlegislation, ensuring that adequate appropriations are directed to \nsmall business initiatives, preparing hearings, correspondence or \nspeeches, Patty has been an exemplary leader to the staff of the Small \nBusiness Committee. Her ability to craft and negotiate meaningful and \nresponsible legislation affecting SBA's programs and the Nation's small \nbusinesses has been a driving force behind the bipartisanship and \neffectiveness of this committee. Senators on both sides of the aisle \nhave grown to respect her expertise, her commitment to small \nbusinesses, and her unfailing devotion to her work.\n  During her career, Patty Forbes has made a significant impact on the \nlives of millions of entrepreneurs. For 13\n\n[[Page S1862]]\n\nyears, Patty worked in the Senate fighting to provide small businesses \ngreater access to capital, Government contracts, business counseling \nand training opportunities, tax relief and a plethora of other items \nthat help this Nation's economy grow and help individuals reach for the \nAmerican dream. I, along with the entire small business community, have \nbeen truly lucky to have had her service over the years.\n  Patty Forbes is leaving behind a legacy of commitment and capability \nthat has helped many entrepreneurs turn their vision into reality. She \ncan take pride in the work she has done for me, the U.S Senate, and \nthis Nation. Patty Forbes will truly be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/01/senate-section/article/S1862-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1862]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL SPORTSMANSHIP DAY\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today marks the 15th anniversary of \nNational Sportsmanship Day, which is celebrated on the first Tuesday of \neach March. National Sportsmanship Day was the creation of the \nInstitute of International Sport at the University of Rhode Island, and \nit is now the largest initiative of its kind in the world.\n  On March 6, 1990, the Institute celebrated the first National \nSportsmanship Day in approximately 3,000 schools. By promoting \nsportsmanship through this ceremonial day over the ensuing 15 years, \nthe institute has made a positive impact on the lives of hundreds of \nthousands of young student-athletes. The institute has received \nthousands of letters and e-mails commending its leadership in this \narea. National Sportsmanship Day also has spawned many local \nsportsmanship initiatives, led to the creation of an annual essay \ncontest on sportsmanship in USA Today, and inspired the celebration of \nsportsmanship days in foreign countries such as Australia and Bermuda.\n  This year, through the institute's Team Sportsmanship initiative, \ngroups of college athletes will visit their local elementary, middle, \nand high schools to further a dialogue among youth about sportsmanship \nand fair play. As evidenced by media reports on drug scandals and on-\nfield fights, the promotion of sportsmanship among youngsters remains a \nuseful and beneficial endeavor.\n  I applaud this year's participants in National Sportsmanship Day, and \ncongratulate the institute for its ongoing work to instill the best of \nvalues in America's youth.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today, March 1, is National Sportsmanship \nDay. A project of the Institute for International Sport at the \nUniversity of Rhode Island, National Sportsmanship Day is the largest \ninitiative of its kind in the world. Now in its 15th year of promoting \nthe highest ideals of sportsmanship and fair play among America's \nyouth, the day will be observed in over 13,000 schools in all 50 \nStates. The day will involve more than 5 million students, teachers, \nadministrators, coaches, and parents in discussions on the issue of \nsportsmanship.\n  National Sportsmanship Day was first championed by Rhode Island \nSenators Claiborne Pell and the late John Chafee. This year, National \nSportsmanship Day will honor these Senators; USA Today, which conducts \nan annual National Sportsmanship Day essay contest, and its sports \neditor Monte Lorell; the President's Council on Physical Fitness; the \nOld Dominican Athletic Conference, which has reinforced the values of \nsportsmanship among its teams; and Playing for Peace, an international \norganization which uses basketball and sportsmanship to bring young \npeople together from communities such as Belfast, Northern Ireland and \nJohannesburg, South Africa.\n  I am proud Rhode Island is home to the Institute for International \nSport and National Sportsmanship Day, and pleased to see the positive \ninfluence it has had on youngsters across the Nation during its 15 \nyears of promoting the best in athletics.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/01/senate-section/article/S1862-2", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1862]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               VERMONT ADJUTANT GENERAL MARTHA RAINVILLE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Since early November, over 1,000 citizen-soldiers from the \nVermont National Guard have answered the time-honored call to duty. \nThese proud, strong, and intelligent men and women of the 86th Brigade \nwere activated for service in the Middle East. In some of the most \nmoving series of events I have experienced as Senator, these Vermonters \nseparated from loved ones at various sendoff ceremonies all across the \nState. They formed into ranks and marched off for training and, \neventually, for war. In mobilizing for service, they joined almost 200 \nmembers of Vermont's Green Mountain Boys who just returned from their \nyearlong deployment to Iraq. Watching over this moving sendoff and \nstanding as a strong, intelligent, and assuring presence was the \nAdjutant General of the State of Vermont, MG Martha Rainville.\n  Superbly carrying out her responsibilities as Vermont's senior \nmilitary leader, General Rainville has ensured that these units, as \nwell as any deploying Vermont Guard company, squadron, or detachment, \nhave had the best preparation possible. She always tries to make \ncertain that the Vermont National Guard has the resources to carry out \nany mission, whether at home or abroad. At the same time, General \nRainville has a special empathy for her soldiers and airmen, working to \ncomfort them during the inevitable pains of family separation.\n  I am very proud that General Rainville has recently been reelected by \nthe Vermont Legislature to the position of Vermont Adjutant General and \nthat, late last year, she was recognized as Vermonter of the Year by \nthe Burlington Free Press, one of Vermont's largest circulation \nnewspapers. General Rainville is a consummate professional, skilled \nleader, and caring human being. She has had a noticeable effect on the \nreadiness of the 4,000 members of the Vermont National Guard and has \nbecome a critical part of the leadership of the entire National Guard, \none of our Nation's most cherished institutions. These recognitions are \nrepresentative of all the Guard members, families, and employers from \nVermont who are making huge sacrifices for the war efforts.\n  Martha Rainville assumed the position of Adjutant General of the \nState of Vermont in 1997. She gained valuable experience and \nunderstanding of the military from her service as a commander of the \nmaintenance unit of the 158th Fighter Wing of the Vermont Air National \nGuard. When she stood up and said she was ready to take the reigns of \nthe entire Guard, she promised to bring a fresh approach to tackling \nthe Guard's tasks and challenges.\n  From the first day, General Rainville has brought a careful yet \nenergetic approach to her position. She pays close attention to the \nday-to-day operations of the Vermont Guard, yet gives her commanders \nthe flexibility to do the job right. This ability to balance small \ndetails with a sense of the larger picture has enabled the Vermont \nNational Guard to respond so well to its real-world missions after \nSeptember 11. From 24-hour air patrols to increasing security along the \nnorthern border to deploying for the war in Iraq, the Vermont Guard has \nresponded well due in part to General Rainville's leadership.\n  Vermont Adjutant General Martha Rainville is a credit to the National \nGuard, the State of Vermont, and the country as a whole. I am so proud \nto have seen her move through the ranks in Vermont and assume her \ncritically important role. I know she will continue to provide strong \nleadership to our proud citizen-soldiers, and I believe she deserves \nour gratitude, our congratulations, and our thanks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/01/senate-section/article/S1862-3", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1862-S1863]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     IN HONOR OF JUDGE JANE McKEAG\n\n  Mrs. BOXER: Mr. President, it is my honor to speak in recognition of \nJudge Jane McKeag.

ALLAN BROMLEY\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to bring my colleagues' \nattention to the death of Professor D. Allan Bromley, a renowned \nnuclear physicist, a great Connecticut citizen and a friend, on \nFebruary 10 at age 78.\n  Dr. Bromley had an extraordinary life beginning in Westmeath, \nOntario, Canada where he was born. He received a B.S. degree with \nhighest honors in 1948 in the Faculty of Engineering at Queen's \nUniversity in Ontario where he continued his studies receiving a M.S. \ndegree in nuclear physics. In 1952, he earned a Ph.D. degree from the \nUniversity of Rochester and subsequently has been awarded 32 honorary \ndoctorates from universities around the world. In 1960, he moved to \nConnecticut where he joined the Yale faculty as an associate professor \nof physics. He founded and directed the A.W. Wright Nuclear Structure \nLaboratory at Yale from 1963 to 1989 where he carried out pioneering \nstudies on both the structure and dynamics of atomic nuclei, and he was \nconsidered the father of modern heavy ion science. From 1972 to 1993, \nhe held the Henry Ford II Professorship in Physics at Yale and chaired \nthe physics department from 1970 to 1977. He received numerous honors \nand awards, and I would specifically like to recognize that in 1980 he \nreceived the National Medal of Science, the highest scientific honor \nawarded by the U.S. Not only was he an outstanding physicist, clearly \nshown by the 500 published papers and the 20 books he authored or \nedited, but he was an outstanding teacher, and his program at Yale \ngraduated more doctoral students in experimental nuclear physics than \nany other institution in the world. This is truly an admirable \naccomplishment especially given the overall drop in U.S. students \npursuing degrees in the physical sciences.\n  As the president of the American Physical Society and as president of \nthe American Association for the Advancement of Science, he was a \nsignificant, influential leader in the science policy community. He \nserved as a member of the White House Science Council during the Reagan \nadministration and as a member of the National Science Board in 1988 to \n1989, and he was the first person to hold Cabinet-level rank as \nAssistant to the President for Science and Technology, serving the \nfirst President Bush. In this role from 1989 to 1993, he oversaw a five \nfold increase in staff and budget of the White House Office of Science \nand Technology Policy. At OSTP, he established an Industrial Technology \nDirectorate, was the first to name four assistant director Presidential \nappointees, an increase from the one or two appointees made by his \npredecessors, and also within OSTP, was the first to elevate the social \nsciences for full recognition. His strong passion for science was \nclearly evident as he reinvigorated both the Federal Coordinating \nCommittees on Science, Engineering and Technology, now named the \nNational Science and Technology Council NSTC, and the President's \nCouncil of Advisory for Science and Technology PCAST. He established \nthe ``crosscut'' process that helped our science agencies to more \neffectively interact and develop coherent policy. He was responsible \nfor the first formal published statement of U.S. technology policy and \nspecifically played a key role in expanding the cooperation and \npartnership between government and private industry in science and \nresearch and development. His efforts extended beyond the borders of \nthe U.S. as he established an annual Carnegie informal meeting of \nscience advisors from the G7 and G8 countries where international \nscience cooperation was promoted and established. Clearly, he made OSTP \na powerful voice for strong U.S. science during his tenure.\n  Dr. Bromley served the President during a period of intense debate \nover U.S. competitiveness, as we confronted tough competitors in Japan \nand Europe. He helped in the formulation of what became a bipartisan \ncompetitiveness agenda, building on and implementing many of the \nrecommendations of the Young Commission that served President Reagan, \nand the subsequent trade and competitiveness legislation that grew out \nof those proposals. He stood for an activist role for government-\nsupported science and research and development, working in cooperation \nwith the private sector and our universities to build up our innovation \nsystem. While at OSTP, he established a strong collaboration with OMB \nto strengthen American research and development investment, and science \neducation. He well understood that our Nation's growth and well being \nwere directly tied to our technological progress, and worked hard from \nthe White House to expand that understanding. Dr. Bromley was one of \nour most effective Presidential science advisors.\n  Returning to Yale, he worked with President Richard C. Levin on the \nrevival of strong science, especially physical science, at Yale. He \nhelped the university to fashion a billion-dollar reinvestment in \nscience, driven by his understanding that growing innovation capacity \nat Yale will be crucial to the University's and Connecticut's future, \nas well as important to the Nation. I am so glad that he was able to \nsee the fruit of President Levin's and his labor start to unfold at \nYale in the form of new science programs, science buildings, and \nscience talent.\n\n  During these years after he returned to Yale, he remained very active \non national science policy. I had the privilege to work with him, and \nwith our current majority leader, Senator Frist, and former Senator \nPhil Gramm, on legislation to double on a step-by-step basis our \nFederal science investment. While we were never able to persuade the \nHouse to pass our Senate bill, support for science increased \nsignificantly.\n  Additionally, Dr. Bromley was a member of the U.S. National Academy \nof Sciences, the American Academy of\n\n[[Page S1864]]\n\nArts and Sciences, the Brazilian Academy of Sciences, the Royal South \nAfrican Academy of Sciences, and the International Higher Education \nAcademy of Sciences in Moscow. He was a member of the Governing Board \nof the American Institute of Physics and a Benjamin Franklin Fellow of \nthe Royal Society of Arts in London.\n  Dr. Bromley was not a shy and retiring figure, he was a forceful, \n``it must be done'' gentleman, generally attired in fine suits and \nelegant bow ties. He also always had an eye on the big picture. I like \nto think of him in his large corner office in the Old Executive Office \nBuilding while at OSTP, gazing at his stunning view of the White House \nand Blair House. That a scientist wrestled this office out of the hands \nof the Federal bureaucracy speaks about his insistence on the big \npicture. And he definitely had a big picture view of U.S. science. He \nwas a team member and team leader in a great generation of U.S. science \nthat successfully faced a new kind of economic competition over \ninnovation, that brought an information technology revolution to the \nforefront of our society, that pushed for quality in advanced U.S. \nmanufacturing processes, that began to work on the application of \ntechnology to environmental problems, and that made astounding advances \nin fundamental science. He was a direct participant in some of these \ntasks, a supporter in others, but always an insistent, indefatigable \nadvocate for science advance.\n  In the words of President Levin of Yale, ``in three successive \ncareers, he built our physics department, served the nation with \ndistinction, and thoroughly revitalized engineering at Yale.'' Dr. \nBromley may have physically left our world, but his accomplishments and \ninfluences are here with us. I will always remember my friend. My \nthoughts and prayers are with his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/01/senate-section/article/S1864-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING BENJAMIN W. TIMBERMAN\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Benjamin \nW. Timberman, a community leader, educator and humanitarian from New \nJersey.\n  Mr. Timberman's career began as a mathematics teacher at Monroe \nTownship Junior High School in Williamstown, NJ. He served in that \ncapacity for 2 years when he was drafted for a 2-year tour of duty in \nthe U.S. Army. Upon his return, he continued his teaching until 1961 \nwhen he became vice principal. In 1963, Mr. Timberman was appointed as \nelementary supervisor for the Monroe Township School District, where he \nserved for 12 years. In 1975, Mr. Timberman reached the penultimate \nposition when he was appointed superintendent of schools, where he \nserved another dozen years. During his 33 years of service to the \nchildren of Monroe Township, Mr. Timberman was also the first president \nof the Monroe Township Education Association.\n  Mr. Timberman also demonstrated his commitment to his community \nthrough his service as an elected official. Like his education career, \nMr. Timberman's government career began in 1954 when he was elected to \nthe Elmer Borough Council. He served in that capacity for 7 years \nbefore being elected mayor of Elmer in 1963. In 1971, Mr. Timberman was \nelected to the Salem County Board of Chosen Freeholders where he served \nfor 24 years. With his education background, Mr. Timberman used his \nposition on the Freeholder Board to provide educational opportunities \nto Salem County residents. Mr. Timberman championed the passage of the \nbond issue for construction of the Vo-Tech Career Center and advocated \nfor the establishment of the Salem Community College as a degree \ngranting institution.\n  Despite his retirement from education and government, Mr. Timberman \nand his wife Mary Lou continue to work in the community as volunteers \nfor Meals-on-Wheels and on visits to a local nursing home to lead \nresidents in a monthly sing-a-long.\n  It is my honor to recognize Benjamin W. Timberman for his hard work \nand commitment to make his community a better place. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in paying tribute to this wonderful human \nbeing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/01/senate-section/article/S1864-2", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MATTIEBELLE WOODS\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of a \ngreat and proud Milwaukeean, a courageous social pioneer and journalist \nand--above all else--a wonderful person. On February 17, Mattiebelle \nWood's long life ended at the age of 102. Ms. Woods left a remarkable \nlegacy in her field, in her community and in the Nation.\n  Mattiebelle Woods was a tremendous woman, and I am proud to honor her \nlife today. She was born in Louisville, KY, in 1902, and moved to \nMilwaukee when she was just a few years old. In the 1940s, before the \ndays of Martin Luther King and Malcolm X, Ms. Woods was already \nactively involved in the civil rights movement.\n  Ms. Woods has rightly been called the First Lady of the Milwaukee \npress, and as a reporter, her coverage of social events and \ndevelopments contributed to an increased sense of identity and unity in \nthe local black community. By the 1960s, she had written for the \nChicago Defender, the Milwaukee Defender, the Milwaukee Star, and the \nMilwaukee Globe. In 1964, she joined the Milwaukee Courier and \ncontributed to its very first edition.\n  Ms. Woods never stopped writing--her final column was published 1 \nweek before her death.\n  Ms. Woods also energetically participated in politics fighting for \nthe advancement of the African-American community. She became active in \nthe Democratic Party in the late 1940s, and worked persistently to \nensure that elected officials worked just as hard as she did for the \nAfrican-American community.\n  To those who knew her, she will ultimately be remembered for her \nlively, beautiful personality. She instilled confidence and pride in \ncountless young people and helped them build the connections that would \nhelp them succeed later in life. At the age of 102, Mattiebelle Woods \nstill could be found on the dance floor, loving life.\n  That love of life, along with her commitment to social justice, has \nundoubtedly been passed on to all those who knew her.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/01/senate-section/article/S1864-3", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1864-S1865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    DR. HIRAM C. POLK, JR., TRIBUTE\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a \nKentuckian who has dedicated his life to saving the lives of others. \nDr. Hiram C. Polk, Jr., the chairman of the University of Louisville's \nDepartment of Surgery in Louisville, KY, has become a leader in the \nmedical field due to his relentless push for excellence.\n  In his 34 years as chairman of the department, Dr. Polk has trained \nover 200 surgeons who have gone on to become the best in their \nprofession. He is the world's leading authority on surgical wound \ninfections. He developed the now common application of perioperative \nantibiotics--that is when the patient takes antibiotics before surgery, \nso the medication is in the patient's tissue during operation.\n  Under Dr. Polk, the department has provided over $100 million in free \nhealth care to Louisville area indigent patients. The department has \nperformed two successful hand transplants and the world's first \nimplantation of an AbioCor artificial heart. And Dr. Polk is an \nhonorary fellow of the very prestigious Royal College of Surgeons in \nEdinburgh, Scotland, the oldest surgical college in the world.\n  Dr. Polk has also found time to engage in one of Kentucky's greatest \npassions--horse racing. He is an owner and breeder of several \nthoroughbreds, including Mrs. Revere, a four-time stakes winner at the \nracetrack that is home to the Kentucky Derby, Churchill Downs.\n  No wonder, then, that upon Dr. Polk's retirement after such a \npreeminent career, his colleagues have decided to honor him by naming \nthe University of Louisville surgery department the Hiram C. Polk \nDepartment of Surgery. He is a model citizen for all Kentuckians, and \nhas earned this Senate's respect.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record an \narticle from The Louisville Courier-Journal about Dr. Polk's lifesaving \ncareer.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S1865]]\n\n          [From the Louisville Courier-Journal, Feb. 4, 2005]\n\n A Passion for Excellence; U of L Doctor Leaves Enduring Mark Training \n                                Surgeons\n\n                            (By Laura Ungar)\n\n       Part drill sergeant, part modern-day Socrates, Dr. Hiram C. \n     Polk Jr. briskly led medical residents and students through \n     University Hospital on early morning rounds this week.\n       Stopping in front of patients' rooms, Polk called on \n     residents to describe each case, then peppered them with \n     questions.\n       Sometimes he offered a compliment, such as ``Wonderful \n     question'' or ``That's exactly right.'' But more often, he \n     displayed a characteristic toughness, and his trainees \n     usually answered, ``Yes, sir.''\n       ``You're lost,'' he admonished the group outside one \n     patient's room.\n       ``You're not betting your life,'' he said to a resident \n     assessing a patient. ``You're betting his life.''\n       Polk is stepping down today after more than three decades \n     as chairman of the University of Louisville's surgery \n     department, where he has trained a legion of surgeons--about \n     230, which U of L officials say is more than any other \n     current surgical chair in the country.\n       Colleagues say a relentless push for excellence marked \n     Polk's tenure. That has given U of L's program a national \n     reputation as the Marine Corps of surgical residencies and \n     left him with a nickname based on one instance from his early \n     career: ``Hiram Fire-em.''\n       But it also has made him a teacher students always \n     remember, a strict father figure who strives to make them \n     better and leaves them with an internal voice telling them to \n     push themselves.\n       ``Dr. Polk demands excellence from his trainees and will \n     not accept mediocrity. And by demanding it, he often gets \n     it,'' said Dr. Kelly McMasters, a former resident under Polk \n     who is now the Sam and Lolita Weakley Professor of Surgical \n     Oncology and director of U of L's division of surgical \n     oncology.\n       Polk could go a little too far, ``could be too tough,'' \n     said Dr. Frank Miller, a professor of surgery at U of L.\n       But Polk makes no apologies. Surgery ``is a serious, big \n     deal and you need to take that seriously,'' he said. \n     ``Striving to be the best you can be sometimes means telling \n     people, `I think that's stupid.' ''\n       Colleagues say Polk, 68, held himself to those same high \n     standards as he has helped build a nationally renowned \n     surgery department.\n       He has written or co-written hundreds of papers and journal \n     articles, dozens of textbook chapters and numerous books, and \n     served as editor-in-chief of the American Journal of Surgery \n     for 18 years.\n       He pioneered the practice of giving antibiotics within an \n     hour of surgery to stave off infection, which has become \n     commonplace.\n       And McMasters said residents who have risen to Polk's \n     challenge earn his loyalty, and return it. ``Most people are \n     pathologically loyal to Dr. Polk. He stands by his people 100 \n     percent. . . . He's made my career. While he was firm and \n     strict as a teacher, he also has a very benevolent and loving \n     side.''\n\n\n                        Life-changing discussion\n\n       Polk attended Millsaps College in his hometown of Jackson, \n     Miss., at the urging of his father. He graduated at the top \n     of his class, and as a favor to a professor, he said, he \n     applied to Harvard Medical School, only to turn down a chance \n     to attend on scholarship because it was too far away. But \n     Harvard sent a premier physiologist to try to persuade Polk \n     to change his mind--an hourlong discussion that determined \n     the direction of his life.\n       ``He reinforced some of what my father said,'' Polk said. \n     ``He said I ought to go, end of discussion.''\n       Polk hated medical school until he got interested in \n     surgery. As a medical resident in St. Louis and a young \n     doctor and academic in Miami, Polk found mentors to emulate. \n     His reputation grew, and universities began to court him.\n       In 1971, at 35, he became U of L's surgery chairman, lured \n     by the promise of a department with potential, a growing \n     downtown medical community and a closet attraction to the \n     horse-racing scene.\n       One early decision was to not renew the contracts of six of \n     the residents who were there at the time, earning him the \n     ``Fire-em'' nickname--although he said he has let only five \n     more people go since then.\n       Colleagues who knew him during those early years remember \n     how Polk honed his skills in the aging Louisville General \n     Hospital, a relic of an older era with long hallways, an open \n     ward and few of the technological amenities of today. Polk \n     brought residents on bedside rounds there, firing questions \n     at them and demanding good answers, recalled Dr. Gordon \n     Tobin, a U of L professor and director of the division of \n     plastic and reconstructive surgery.\n       ``He fit right in with the other surgeons I met in that \n     era,'' Tobin said. ``The surgical personality is very \n     straightforward and blunt.''\n       Polk's reputation for demanding excellence was a draw for \n     some, said Dr. J. David Richardson, a professor and vice \n     chairman of U of L's surgery department.\n       ``I don't think people have really come here who are really \n     unaware'' how demanding it would be, Richardson said. ``It's \n     not a place to come and rest on your laurels and enjoy a \n     quiet kind of life.''\n       Dr. William H. Mitchell, a retired surgeon in Richmond, \n     Ky., was among Polk's early residents. He said Polk expected \n     him and his peers to be on their game at 7 a.m. ``whether we \n     were bright-eyed and bushy-tailed or not.''\n       ``If you ran out of gas, you'd better get pumped up. You \n     were expected to be cogent, coherent and well thought out,'' \n     Mitchell said.\n       But Polk was mindful of tailoring questions to a trainee's \n     level of understanding, Mitchell said, and would be hardest \n     on senior residents. Also, many doctors-in-training saw \n     something beneath the harshness--intelligence, skill and \n     passion for his work.\n       Mitchell remembers a case presented in a conference in \n     which another resident stabilized the fractured jaw of a \n     motorcycle accident victim without calling for backup, even \n     though he had never seen such a fracture.\n       ``He fried him,'' Mitchell said of Polk's response. ``He \n     said: Don't undertake something you've never done without \n     backup.''\n       ``No question about it,'' Mitchell said, ``he made all of \n     us better doctors because he made us think about what we're \n     doing.''\n\n\n                           Family--and horses\n\n       Nurturing residents and building a department required long \n     hours.\n       ``He was busy and gone a lot,'' said his daughter, Susan \n     Brown, one of two children with his first wife. ``My mom kept \n     everything running for us.''\n       That didn't change her love and admiration for him, said \n     Brown, 44. And she said he has taken an active interest in \n     the lives of her three sons, attending sporting events with \n     them and talking medicine with two who have expressed an \n     interest.\n       Dr. Susan Galandiuk, Polk's 47-year-old second wife, said \n     she understands the long hours and is a workaholic herself. \n     She said Polk routinely gets telephone calls at their East \n     End home from doctors around the country asking for \n     professional and personal advice--and sees this as a \n     compliment, evidence of the relationships he has built over \n     the years.\n       Some of Polk's rare hours outside of work have been focused \n     on his love of horses. He and Richardson together are owner-\n     breeders whose horses have included Mrs. Revere, a four-time \n     stakes winner at Churchill Downs in the mid-1980s for which a \n     stakes race is named.\n       Richardson sees things in common between surgery and the \n     horse business, such as the reminders, every time a horse \n     gets hurt, of the fragility of life and success. Polk sees \n     common points, too, but noted: ``A good horse is better than \n     a good resident. You love them, and they try hard to be the \n     best they can be.''\n       Polk claims to have mellowed over the years, and links it \n     to his divorce, his remarriage, and the death of Mrs. Revere, \n     whose memory still chokes him up.\n       He said he also gained new perspective through four major \n     operations, including one for prostate cancer. And he has had \n     to adjust to changing times in medicine; he has been sued for \n     medical malpractice, usually in an administrative capacity, \n     and has had to work within new national rules limiting \n     residents' working hours to 80 a week.\n       But current trainees and friends haven't noticed a \n     mellowing. Cornelia Poston, a third-year medical student, \n     prepares diligently for rounds by writing questions on note \n     cards, studying the night before and carrying a book called \n     ``Pocket Surgery'' inside her white coat.''\n       You strive for perfection, and he demands that,'' said Dr. \n     Bryce Schuster, chief administrative resident. ``At times it \n     could be intimidating. But fear is a great motivator.''\n       Mitchell agreed. ``The residents still get sweaty palms,'' \n     he said, ``but they still stand and deliver and give a \n     straight answer to a straight question.''\n       To celebrate Polk's career, colleagues, residents and \n     others have launched a $5 million campaign to rename the \n     department in his honor and secure an endowment for clinical, \n     education and research activities.\n       But his true legacy, colleagues say, may be best symbolized \n     by a picture of a tree in his office, with names of the \n     surgeons he has trained near the many branches.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/01/senate-section/article/S1865-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/01/senate-section/article/S1865-2", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/01/senate-section/article/S1865-3", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1865-S1866]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:59 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby\n\n[[Page S1866]]\n\nMs. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the following concurrent resolution, in which it requests the \nconcurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.

A bill to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to include \nIndian tribes among the entities consulted with respect to activities \ncarried out by the Secretary of Homeland Security, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Tribal \nGovernment Amendments to the Homeland Security Act of 2002. Senator \nInouye joins me in sponsoring this measure.\n  It is well known that tribal governments serve as the primary \ninstruments of law enforcement and emergency response for the more than \nfifty million acres of land that comprise Indian country.\n  More than twenty-five Indian tribes have jurisdiction over lands that \nare either adjacent to international borders or are directly accessible \nto an international border by boat. These lands consist of over 260 \nmiles of the 7,400 miles of the international borders the United States \nshares with Canada and Mexico.\n  But it is not only tribes located on or near international borders or \nwaters that have a role to play in protecting the Nation's strategic \nassets. Energy resources located on tribal lands make up a significant \nsnare of the United States' energy resources. Tribal governments hold \ntitle to 30 percent of the coal resources west of the Mississippi \nRiver, 37 percent of potential uranium resources, and three percent of \nknown oil and gas resources in the United States.\n  There is also extensive infrastructure located on or near tribal \nlands that is critical to our Nation's security--including dams, \nhydroelectric facilities, nuclear power generating plants, oil and gas \npipelines, transportation corridors of railroads and highway systems, \nand communications towers.\n  Like other governments, tribal governments need the necessary \nresources to develop their capacities to respond to threats of \nterrorism including access to information and information warning \nsystems, law enforcement data bases, and health alert systems related \nto the possible use of chemical and biological warfare.\n  The Homeland Security Act of 2002 provides the authority for the \nestablishment of the Department of Homeland Security and the various \nduties and responsibilities of the Department and its employees. Many \nprovisions of the Act reference State and local governments, but \nunfortunately, Indian tribal governments were erroneously included in \nthe definition of ``local government'' in the Act as if tribal \ngovernments were political subdivisions of each State.\n  The Federal government has long recognized that Indian tribes are \nseparate, I distinct sovereigns, with which the United States has a \ngovernment-to-government relationship. The U.S. Supreme Court has \nconsistently sustained this status and the United States' relationship \nwith the tribal governments. The United States' policy of tribal self-\ngovernance and self-determination has proven to be the most successful \nfor Indian tribes.\n  The measure that I introduce today would treat Indian tribes as the \nseparate political entities that they are, consistent with the Federal \npolicy of tribal self-governance and self-determination. The bill \namends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 by removing Indian tribes from \nthe definition of ``local government'' and instead including the terms \n``Indian tribe'' and ``tribal government'' in the appropriate\n\n[[Page S1869]]\n\nplaces where the terms ``State'' and ``local governments'' are used.\n  This bill would also explicitly vest the Secretary of the Department \nof Homeland Security with the discretionary authority to provide direct \nfunding to Indian tribal governments. Because Indian tribes are already \neligible for funding by virtue of their inclusion in the definition of \n``local government,'' this bill will not require additional funding nor \nwill it divert any resources away from States or local governments.\n  It is clear that Indian tribal governments have a vital role to play \nin the protection of our Nation's security, and I would urge my \ncolleagues to give their favorable consideration to this measure.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 477\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Tribal Government Amendments \n     to the Homeland Security Act of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to designate the annex to the E. Barrett Prettyman \nFederal Building and United States Courthouse located at 333 \nConstitution Avenue Northwest in the District of Columbia as the \n``William B. Bryant Annex''; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to call attention to the \nextraordinary public service of Judge William B. Bryant. Last July, I \nintroduced S. 2619, a bill that would have designated the new annex to \nthe E. Barrett Prettyman United States Courthouse in Washington, D.C., \nthe ``William B. Bryant Annex.'' It was the Senate companion bill to \nlegislation introduced by Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton of the \nDistrict of Columbia.\n  While the House bill passed by voice vote, the Senate bill was \nstalled by objection. There was concern that a courthouse annex be \nnamed for a judge still serving. This objection was adhered to despite \nthe numerous exceptions to such a rule, including another exception \nenacted last year.\n  It would have been worthy of celebration this last month, during \nBlack History Month, if we could have held such a naming ceremony \ninvolving Judge Bryant. Others prevented that from taking place. I \nbelieve it important that we continue every month to recognize the \nextraordinary contributions of African Americans. Congresswoman Norton \nhas been willing to seek to accommodate those Senators who objected by \nrevising this bill to delay the effective date of the naming until \nafter Judge Bryant steps down from the Court. It is sadly ironic that \nJudge Bryant's continuing historic service is held against honoring \nhim. He continues to perform duties as a senior\n\n[[Page S1871]]\n\nFederal judge at the age of 93. I commend Congresswoman Norton for her \nefforts and determination. I hope that this change will remove the \nfinal impediment and allow the District of Columbia and the Nation to \nhonor Judge Bryant before his 94th birthday this September.\n  The value of Judge Bryant's service has been recognized by his \ncolleagues. Judge Bryant and his lifelong service to the law was \ncelebrated in a September 16, 2004 Washington Post article. The article \ndetails a life spent dedicated to public service.\n  Judge Bryant began his legal career with the belief that lawyers \ncould make a difference in eliminating the widespread racial \nsegregation in the United States. He became a criminal defense lawyer \nin 1948, taking on many pro bono cases and was soon recognized by the \nU.S. Attorney's office for his skills as a defense attorney. The U.S. \nAttorney's office hired him in 1951 and he became the first African \nAmerican to practice in Federal court here in the District.\n  Judge Bryant was nominated by President Johnson to the Federal bench \nin 1965 and became the first African American Chief Judge for the \nUnited States District Court in D.C. Forty years later, Judge Bryant \nstill works at the courthouse four days a week and the Washington Post \nreports that he handled more criminal trials than any other senior \njudge on the court last year. Judge Bryant said in an interview with \nthe Post: ``I feel like I'm part of the woodwork. I have to think hard \nto think of a time when I wasn't in this courthouse.''\n  The Washington Post article mentions that E. Barrett Prettyman, Jr., \nthe son of the judge for whom the Federal courthouse is named, praised \nthe recommendation that the annex be named after Judge Bryant. He said \nthat his father ``admired Judge Bryant tremendously'' and would have \nwanted the annex to be named after him.\n  Before my introduction of this bill last year, Chief Judge Thomas F. \nHogan of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, \nrequested for himself and all the other judges on the court that the \nnewly constructed annex be named after Judge Bryant. They appreciate \nthe historic significance of Judge Bryant's service.\n  I urge the Senate this year to move ahead with this important \ncommendation of Judge Bryant's lifetime of service and dedication to \nthe principles of the Constitution and the law.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article and the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 16, 2004]\n\n  A Lifetime of Faith in the Law; at 93, Senior Judge William Bryant \n             Still Wins Plaudits for Dedication to Justice\n\n                           (By Carol Leonnig)\n\n       A few days after the new U.S. District Courthouse opened on \n     Constitution Avenue in the fall of 1952, Bill Bryant walked \n     in to start work as a recently hired federal prosecutor.\n       More than a half-century has passed, and Bryant's life \n     remains centered on that stately granite building in the \n     shadow of the U.S. Capitol. It's in those halls that he \n     became a groundbreaking criminal defense attorney, a federal \n     judge, and then the court's chief judge--the first African \n     American in that position.\n       Today, at the age of 93, U.S. District Court Senior Judge \n     William Bryant still drives himself to work at the courthouse \n     four days a week and pushes his walker to his courtroom.\n       At a recent birthday party for Bryant hosted by Vernon \n     Jordan, fellow Senior U.S. District Court Judge Louis \n     Oberdorfer remarked that there were ``only two people in the \n     world who really understood the Constitution'' and how it \n     touched the lives of real people.\n       ``That's Hugo Black and Bill Bryant,'' said Oberdorfer. He \n     had clerked for Justice Hugo L. Black, who retired as an \n     associate justice in 1971 after serving on the Supreme Court \n     for 34 years.\n       To honor Bryant's life's work, his fellow judges this past \n     spring unanimously recommended that a nearly completed \n     courthouse annex be named for him. The $110 million, 351,000-\n     square-foot addition will add nine state-of-the-art \n     courtrooms and judges' offices to the courthouse and is \n     designed to meet the court's expansion needs for the next 30 \n     years. It is slated to open next spring.\n       In urging that the building be named for Bryant, his \n     supporters cite his devotion to the Constitution and his \n     belief that the law will produce a just result.\n       During a rare interview in his sixth-floor office in the \n     federal courthouse, Bryant reached out for a pocket version \n     of the Constitution covered in torn green plastic lying on \n     the top of his desk. Holding it aloft in his right hand, he \n     told stories of his struggling former clients and made legal \n     phrases--``due process'' and ``equal protection''--seem like \n     life-saving staples.\n       Though he needs his law clerk's arm to get up the steps to \n     the bench, he is a fairly busy senior jurist. He handled more \n     criminal trials than any other senior judge last year and \n     still surprises new lawyers with his sharp retorts.\n       ``I feel like I'm part of the woodwork,'' Bryant said. ``I \n     have to think hard to think of a time when I wasn't in this \n     courthouse.''\n       He started down his career path inspired by a Howard \n     University law professor who believed that lawyers could make \n     a difference in that time of racial segregation and \n     discrimination. Bryant said he remains convinced today that \n     lawyers can stop injustice whenever it arises.\n       ``Without lawyers, this is just a piece of paper,'' Judge \n     Bryant said, gesturing with the well-worn Constitution. ``If \n     it weren't for lawyers, I'd still be three-fifths of a man. \n     If it weren't for lawyers, we'd still have signs directing \n     people this way and that, based on the color of their skin. \n     If it weren't for lawyers, you still wouldn't be able to \n     vote.\n       ``The most important professions are lawyer and teacher, in \n     my opinion,'' he said.\n       Some lawyers complain that Bryant is so rooted in his \n     criminal defense training that he shows some distrust of the \n     prosecution. And his practice of presiding over trials, but \n     asking other judges to sentence the people convicted, has \n     spurred some curiosity. He won't elaborate on the reason, but \n     his friends say he found the new federal sentencing \n     guidelines inflexible and harsh.\n       A 1993 study found Bryant was reversed 17 percent of the \n     time by appellate judges--the average reversal rate for the \n     trial court.\n       Chief Judge Thomas F. Hogan presented the proposal to name \n     the annex after Bryant to Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton and Sen. \n     Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) earlier this year, and they are now \n     trying to get Congress to approve the naming this fall. One \n     member, Sen. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.), has tried to block \n     it, with his staff pointing to a D.C. policy that buildings \n     not be named after living people.\n       Norton said numerous courts around the country have been \n     named in honor of living judges, and she said she looks \n     forward to meeting with Inhofe in person to convince him of \n     the wisdom of naming this building, designed by renowned \n     architect Michael Graves, after a barrier-breaking judge.\n       ``This is no ordinary naming,'' she said. ``This is a truly \n     great African American judge whose accomplishments are \n     singular. First African American assistant U.S. attorney. \n     First African American chief judge.''\n       E. Barrett Prettyman Jr., the son of the jurist for whom \n     the federal courthouse in Washington is named, also applauds \n     the proposed annex naming. He said his father ``admired Judge \n     Bryant tremendously'' and would have endorsed it, too.\n       ``Whenever it's discussed, people brighten right up and \n     think it's a great idea,'' said Prettyman, himself a former \n     president of the D.C. Bar Association. ``I'm sorry it's hit \n     this snag. . . . If you were going to have an exception, my \n     personal opinion is you could not have a better exception \n     than for Judge Bryant.''\n       William Benson Bryant is hailed as a true product of \n     Washington. Though he was born in a rural town in Alabama, he \n     moved to the city soon after turning 1. His grandfather, \n     fleeing a white lynch mob, relocated the extended family \n     here, including Bryant's father, a railroad porter, and his \n     mother, a housewife. They all made their first home on \n     Benning Road, which was then a dirt path hugging the eastern \n     shore of the Anacostia River.\n       Bryant attended D.C. public schools when the city's black \n     children were taught in separate and grossly substandard \n     facilities. Still he flourished, studying politics at the \n     city's premier black high school, Dunbar, then going on to \n     Howard University. While working at night as an elevator \n     operator, he studied law and met his future wife, Astaire. \n     They were married for 60 years, until her death in 1997.\n       He and his law classmates--the future civil rights \n     movement's intellectual warriors--worked at their dreams in \n     the basement office of their law professor, Charles Houston. \n     Houston promised the group, which included the future Supreme \n     Court Justice Thurgood Marshall and appellate judge \n     Spottswood Robinson, that lawyers armed with quick minds and \n     the Constitution could end segregated schools and unjust \n     convictions of innocent black men.\n       ``I kind of got fascinated by that,'' he said. ``We all \n     did.''\n       But when Bryant graduated first in his class from Howard's \n     law school, there were no jobs for a black lawyer. He became \n     a chief research assistant to Ralph Bunche, an African \n     American diplomat who later was awarded the Nobel Peace \n     Prize, on a landmark study of American race relations; he \n     then fought in World War II and was discharged from the Army \n     as a lieutenant colonel in 1947.\n       His first step was to take the bar exam, then hang out a \n     shingle as a criminal defense lawyer in 1948. His skills soon \n     drew the attention of prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's \n     Office, who liked him even though they kept losing cases to \n     him, and they recommended that their boss hire him. During a \n     job interview, Bryant made a request of George Fay,\n\n[[Page S1872]]\n\n     then the U.S. attorney: ``Mr. Fay, if I cut the mustard in \n     municipal court, can I go over to the big court like the \n     other guys?''\n       No black prosecutor had ever practiced in the federal \n     court--or ``big court,'' as it was called--but Fay agreed. \n     Bryant signed on in 1951 and was handling grand jury \n     indictments in the new federal courthouse the next year.\n       Bryant vividly recalls a case from that time involving an \n     apartment building caretaker who was on trial on charges of \n     raping the babysitter of one tenant's family.\n       ``I went for him as hard as I could,'' Bryant said, \n     squaring his shoulders. ``I didn't like him, and I didn't \n     like what he did to that girl.''\n       So the young prosecutor sought the death penalty, an option \n     then for first-degree murder and rape. He left the courtroom \n     after closing arguments ``feeling pretty good about my case'' \n     and awaited the jury's verdict in his third-floor court \n     office. But when a marshal later called out, ``Bryant, \n     jury's back,'' the judge said, ``I broke out in a sweat.''\n       He peeked anxiously into the court, saw the jury foreman \n     mouth only the word ``guilty.'' Bryant learned seconds later \n     that the jurors had spared the man's life.\n       ``I was so relieved,'' he said. ``When you're young, you \n     don't know anything. . . . Now I think, murder is murder, no \n     matter who is doing it.''\n       He left the prosecutor's office in 1954 and returned to \n     criminal defense with fellow classmate William Gardner in an \n     F Street law office later bulldozed for the MCI Center. They \n     were partners in Houston, Bryant and Gardner, a legendarily \n     powerful African American firm. Ten judges would eventually \n     come from its ranks.\n       In those days, Bryant chuckled, he didn't feel so powerful. \n     Judges who remembered his prosecution work kept appointing \n     him to represent defendants who had no money. That was before \n     the 1963 Supreme Court's Gideon decision requiring that \n     indigent defendants be represented by a lawyer--at public \n     expense, if necessary.\n       ``The judge would say, `Mr. So and So, you say you don't \n     have any money to hire an attorney?' '' Bryant recalled. `` \n     `Well, then, the court appoints Mr. Bryant to represent you.' \n     ''\n       Some paid $25 or $50. Some paid nothing.\n       ``There were weeks we paid the help and split the little \n     bit left over for our groceries,'' he said.\n       Bill Schultz, Bryant's former law clerk, said Bryant took \n     the cases ``out of this sense of obligation to the court and \n     legal system. He was very aware of discrimination, and he \n     always fought for the criminal defendants.''\n       At the time, blacks were barred from the D.C. Bar \n     Association and its law library. Bryant went in anyway, and \n     the black librarian let him.\n       One of his pro bono clients was Andrew Roosevelt Mallory, a \n     19-year-old who confessed to a rape after an eight-hour \n     interrogation in a police station. Mallory was convicted and \n     sent to death row. Defending Mallory's rights, a case Bryant \n     took all the way to the Supreme Court in 1957, made him both \n     nervous and famous.\n       He said he fretted constantly about his client facing the \n     electric chair during the two years the case dragged on. \n     ``You talk about worried,'' he said. ``It's something I can't \n     forget.''\n       But the Supreme Court agreed with Bryant that a man accused \n     of a crime is entitled to be taken promptly before a \n     magistrate to hear the charges against him. The court \n     overturned Mallory's conviction and handed down a landmark \n     decision on defendants' rights.\n       U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman, a longtime fan of \n     Bryant's, said Bryant's legal talents are on display every \n     day in his courtroom, but lawyers are still taken aback by \n     his factual resolve and clear logic when hearing an audiotape \n     recording of his Supreme Court argument in the Mallory case.\n       ``He's clearly a terrific lawyer, but he's mostly a \n     terrific human being,'' Friedman said. ``He sees the best in \n     people, and he really cares about what happens to people.''\n       Bryant remembers that when President Lyndon B. Johnson \n     nominated him to be a judge, he felt elated, confident he had \n     earned his opportunity. But Bryant said a different feeling \n     came over him the day he donned the robes.\n       ``I was sworn in in the morning that day, and Oliver Gasch \n     was sworn in that afternoon,'' Bryant recalled. ``I told \n     Oliver, `You know, I've been a lawyer for many years, but \n     putting on this robe, I don't feel so sure. This is a serious \n     responsibility. ' ''\n       Gasch smiled: ``Bill, I don't think it's going to be that \n     hard for you. You know right from wrong.''\n       Bryant oversaw some famous cases, and he freely shared his \n     thoughts when he thought something was wrong.\n       After presiding over the 1981 trial of Richard Kelly, a \n     Republican congressman caught on videotape taking money from \n     federal agents in a sting operation, Bryant complained that \n     the FBI had set an ``outrageous'' trap for the Florida \n     representative by stuffing cash in his pocket after he'd \n     refused the bribe several times. He set aside Kelly's \n     conviction.\n       ``The investigation . . . has an odor to it that is \n     absolutely repulsive,'' Bryant said then. ``It stinks.''\n       In handling the longest-running case in the court's \n     history, a 25-year-old case about inhumane and filthy \n     conditions in the D.C. jail, the judge chastised city leaders \n     in 1995. He said he had been listening to their broken \n     promises to fix the problems ``since the Big Dipper was a \n     thimble.''\n       In weighing the case of a group of black farmers with \n     similar discrimination complaints against the U.S. Department \n     of Agriculture in 2000, Bryant warned a government lawyer \n     that his argument against a class-action discrimination suit \n     wasn't working: ``Either you're dense or I'm dense,'' he \n     said.\n       Schultz said the judge simply trusted the combination of \n     facts and the law.\n       ``He always said, `Don't fight the facts,' '' Schultz said. \n     ``He thought most of the time the law would end up in the \n     right place.''\n       Bryant acknowledges it's hard sometimes to see lawyers \n     struggle to make their arguments when they have the law and \n     the facts on their side.\n       ``A judge has a stationary gun, and he's looking through \n     the sights,'' he said. ``Unless the lawyer brings the case \n     into the bull's-eye, the judge can't pull the trigger. Good \n     lawyers bring the case into the sights.''\n       Bryant said he was preceded by many great lawyers, which is \n     why the new plan to put his name on a piece of the courthouse \n     gives him conflicting feelings.\n       ``I was flattered, but I thought they shouldn't have done \n     it,'' Bryant said. ``There are so many people who were really \n     giants. I stand on their shoulders.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                 S. 478\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 4 of the United States Code to prohibit \na State from imposing a discriminatory tax on income earned within such \nState by nonresidents of such State; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \ncorrect a tax injustice affecting my home State of Washington, and all \nStates that do not have a State income tax. My bill, the Nonresident \nIncome Tax Freedom Act, would prohibit States from imposing income \ntaxes on individuals that are not residents of that State. I hear about \nthis issue in the areas of my State that border Oregon and Idaho, both \nStates that have income taxes. In fact, wherever I go in Vancouver and \nthroughout Clark County, I hear time and again from constituents about \nthe unfairness of living in Washington State--a State that does not \nhave an income tax--and working in Oregon--a State that does have an \nincome tax and being taxed on their income earned in Oregon.\n  According to the Oregon Department of Revenue, in 2002, there were \n51,991 Clark County residents working in Oregon. Taxed on their income, \nthese nearly 52,000 individuals remitted $104 million to Oregon that \nyear.\n  Representing all of Washington State in Congress, it is not lost on \nme that an additional 30,181 Washington State residents outside of \nClark County were also employed in Oregon in 2002, and these 30,000 \npaid the State of Oregon $49.8 million.\n  Furthermore, there are Washington State residents working in Idaho. \nIn 2002, 19,467 of them owed the State of Idaho $18.9 million in income \ntaxes.\n  While I would like to hope that most Washingtonians could find \nemployment in Washington State, and I am grateful for the job \nopportunities presented to Washingtonians in Oregon, I find it \nantithetical to notions of lifting up the economy of Washington State \nto have the incomes of Washington State residents taxed in Oregon.\n  We have historical roots in this country related to the notion of no \ntaxation without representation. Washington residents being taxed in \nOregon is contrary to this whole premise--a premise upon which American \nindependence rested over 200 years ago.\n  Good tax policy rests on the notion that individual's contribution to \nthe\n\n[[Page S1873]]\n\ngovernment through taxes brings benefits to those individuals--good \nschools, navigable roads, safe communities, clean water, and other \nservices.\n  With incomes taxed in Oregon, Washington residents receive very \nlittle benefit for the contributions made to the State of Oregon. \nGranted, Oregon maintains the infrastructure used by Washingtonians to \nget to work; but there are a number of benefits that Washington \nresidents never realize from the taxes they pay. For example, \nWashington State residents employed in Oregon and paying Oregon income \ntaxes do not receive in-State tuition rates for college.\n  In addition, Washington State residents employed in Oregon and paying \nOregon income taxes do not receive the benefit of paying less for \nfishing licenses. Examples of what this can mean: for 2005, an angling \nlicense for Oregonians is $24.75 for the year; for a Washingtonian who \npays income taxes in Oregon, his/her angling license is $61.50--a 248-\npercent increase. The discrepancy in Idaho is even greater. For 2005, a \ncombined hunting/fishing license for an Idaho resident is $30.50 and \nfor a Washingtonian who is paying Idaho income taxes would be charged \n$181.50 for the same license--a 595-percent increase.\n  And first and foremost, Washington residents employed in Oregon and \npaying income taxes are not afforded voting rights in Oregon, thereby \nbeing taxed without representation.\n  The power for Congress to enact legislation to prohibit one State \nfrom assessing taxes on nonresidents working within that State exists \nin the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution, Article I, Section 8, \nClause 3. And Congress has exercised this authority in the past.\n  The Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940 prohibits States \nfrom taxing the compensation of nonresident military personnel who are \nstationed in that State.\n  In July of 1977, Congress passed, and President Carter signed, \nlegislation prohibiting the States of Virginia and Maryland, or the \nDistrict of Columbia, from imposing an income tax against Members of \nCongress who maintain homes in those jurisdictions.\n  Additionally, with the Amtrak Reauthorization and Improvement Act of \n1990, Congress granted tax immunity to employees of interstate railway, \naviation, and motor carriers from paying State income taxes to any \nState other than an employee's State of residence.\n  It is time for Congress, once again, to utilize its authority under \nthe Commerce Clause to prohibit the imposition of income taxes by \nStates on nonresidents. It is my view that interstate trade in labor is \nimportant commerce that deserves to be treated fairly.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 479\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Nonresident Income Tax \n     Freedom Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON IMPOSITION OF INCOME TAXES BY STATES \n                   ON NONRESIDENTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Chapter 4 of title 4, United States Code, \n     is amended by adding at the end the following new section:\n\n     ``Sec. 127. Prohibition on imposition of income taxes by \n       states on nonresidents\n\n       ``Except to the extent otherwise provided in any voluntary \n     compact between or among States, a State or political \n     subdivision thereof may not impose a tax on income earned \n     within such State or political subdivision by nonresidents of \n     such State.''.\n       (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections for chapter \n     4 of title 4, United States Code, is amended by adding at the \n     end the following new item:\n\n``127. Prohibition on imposition of income taxes by States on \n              nonresidents.''.\n\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years ending after the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n\n           By Mr. CONRAD (for himself and Mr. Dorgan):\n  S. 482. A bill to provide environmental assistance to non-Federal \ninterests in the State of North Dakota; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am introducing the Water Infrastructure \nRevitalization Act, which authorizes $60 million through the U.S. Army \nCorps of Engineers to assist communities in North Dakota with water \nsupply and treatment projects.\n  Imagine if you went to turn on your kitchen faucet one day and no \nwater came out. This scenario became true for thousands in the \ncommunities of Fort Yates, Cannonball, and Porcupine just days before \nThanksgiving in 2003. The loss of drinking water forced the closure of \nschools, the hospital and tribal offices for days. About 170 miles \nupstream, the community of Parshall faces similar water supply \nchallenges as the water level on Lake Sakakawea continues to drop, \nleaving its intake high and dry. These and other communities in the \nState have faced significant expenditures in extending their intakes to \nensure a continued supply of water. In addition, the city of Mandan \nfaces the prospect of constructing a new horizontal well intake because \nchanges in sediment load and flow as a result of the backwater effects \nof the Oahe Reservoir have caused significant siltation problems that \nrestrict flow into the intake. These examples barely scratch the \nsurface of the problems faced by many North Dakota communities in \nmaintaining a safe, reliable water supply.\n  Since 1999, the Corps of Engineers has been authorized to design and \nconstruct water-related infrastructure projects in several different \nStates including Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Montana. The State of North \nDakota confronts water infrastructure challenges that are just as \ndifficult as those in these other States. In fact, many of these \nchallenges are caused directly by the Corps of Engineers' operations of \nthe Missouri River dams. As a result, it is only appropriate that the \nCorps be part of the solution to North Dakota's water needs.\n  The Water Infrastructure Revitalization Act would provide important \nsupplemental funding to assist North Dakota communities with water-\nrelated infrastructure repairs. Under the Act, communities could use \nthe funding for wastewater treatment, water supply facilities, \nenvironmental restoration and surface water resource protection. \nProjects would be cost shared, with 75 percent Federal funding and 25 \npercent non-federal in most instances. However, the bill reduces the \nfinancial burden on local communities if necessary to ensure that water \nrates do not exceed the national affordability criteria developed by \nthe Environmental Protection Agency.\n  This bill is not intended to compete with or take away funds for the \nconstruction of rural water projects under the Dakota Water Resources \nAct. Instead, it is meant to provide important supplemental funding for \ncommunities that are not able to receive funding from the Dakota Water \nResources Act. I am pleased that the North Dakota Rural Water Systems \nAssociation has recognized the need for additional water project \nfunding and endorsed this bill. It is my hope that this authorization \nwill be included as part of the Water Resources Development Act that \nwill be considered this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORNYN:\n  S. 483. A bill to strengthen religious liberty and combat government \nhostility to expressions of faith, by extending the research of The \nEqual Access Act to elementary schools; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to expand \nthe scope of the Equal Access Act, which Congress enacted in 1984 to \nguarantee equal access for religious and other organizations to the \nfacilities of public secondary schools that receive Federal funding.\n  Tomorrow morning, the Supreme Court of the United States will hear \noral argument in two cases involving the right of State and local \ngovernments to erect a public display of the Ten Commandments. One of \nthose cases, Van Orden v. Perry, involves the public display at the \nState capitol grounds of my home State, the great State of Texas. The \nother case, McCreary County v. ACLU, arises out of the State of \nKentucky.\n  These two cases are reminiscent of the Supreme Court's consideration \nlast year of the Pledge of Allegiance--which contains the words ``under \ngod''--in the matter of Elk Grove Unified School District v., Newdow. \nThe\n\n[[Page S1874]]\n\nCourt rejected the challenge to the Pledge of Allegiance in that case, \nbut strictly on procedural grounds. So the Pledge of Allegiance, like \nthe Ten Commandments, remains under attack and under danger of forced \nremoval from our public square by judicial fiat.\n  We examined these issues at a hearing of the Senate Judiciary \nSubcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Property Rights I \nchaired on June 8, 2004. The hearing was entitled ``Beyond the Pledge \nof Allegiance: Hostility to Religious Expression in the Public \nSquare.''\n  That hearing was important, because it reminded us of an even \nbroader, more systemic problem caused by the Supreme Court's previous \nrulings, than just these disturbing attacks on the Pledge of Allegiance \nand the Ten Commandments--an unjustifiable hostility to religious \nexpression in public squares across America.\n  Just as there is bipartisan agreement on the constitutionality of the \nPledge of Allegiance, so should there be bipartisan agreement that \ngovernment should never be hostile to expressions of faith. As \nPresident Ronald Reagan stated in 1983: ``When our founding Fathers \npassed the First Amendment, they sought to protect churches from \ngovernment interference. They never intended to construct a wall of \nhostility between government and the concept of religious belief \nitself.'' And as President Clinton noted in 1995: ``Americans feel that \ninstead of celebrating their love for God in public, they're being \nforced to hide their faith behind closed doors. That's wrong. Americans \nshould never have to hide their faith. but some Americans have been \ndenied the right to express their religion and that has to stop. That \nhas happened and it has to stop.''\n  At the hearing, we heard from citizen witnesses and legal experts \nalike, who recounted example after example after example of government \ndiscrimination against religious expression generally--including both \ndiscrimination against religious versus non-religious expression in \ngovernment speech, as well as discrimination against purely private \nexpressions of faith. Just consider this sample of incidents throughout \nthe Nation--incidents of hostility to religious expression in the \npublic square:\n  A 12-year-old elementary school student was reprimanded by a public \nschool in St. Louis, MO for quietly saying a prayer before lunch in the \nschool cafeteria, according to a federal lawsuit. The case was settled \nafter the St. Louis School Board announced a new policy protecting the \nreligious expression rights of students. St. Louis Post-dispatch, July \n11, 1996.\n  A second grade school girl in Wisconsin was forbidden from \ndistributing valentines during a Valentine's Day Exchange because her \nvalentines happened to contain religious themes. After a Federal \nlawsuit was filed, the school district settled the suit by publishing \nan apology to the student in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinal and issuing \na new policy protecting the religious freedoms of its students. Capital \nTimes, Madison, August 29, 2001.\n  A kindergartener in Dayton, OH was forbidden by her public school \nteacher from distributing bags of jellybeans with an attached prayer to \nher classmates, according to a Federal lawsuit. Associated Press, \nFebruary 8, 2004.\n  Public high school students in Massachusetts started a Bible club and \ntried to hand out candy canes with a Biblical passage attached. The \nschool suspended the students for distributing the candy canes. A \nfederal district court issued a temporary injunction against the \nschool. Westfield High Sch. L.I.F.E. Club v. City of Westfield, 249 F. \nSupp. 2d 98 D. Mass. 2003.\n  A public school sixth grader in Boulder, CO tried to complete her \nbook report assignment by presenting the Bible, but was forbidden from \ndoing so by her teacher. She was also forbidden from bringing the Bible \nto school. Only after a lawsuit was threatened did the school \neventually back down. Denver Post, December 13, 2002.\n  According to a Federal lawsuit, a public school teacher at Lynn Lucas \nMiddle School in Houston, TX, punished two sisters for carrying Bibles, \nconfiscated and threw the Bibles into the trash, and threatened to call \nChild Protective Services, while another teacher forbade a third \nstudent from reading the Bible during free reading time and forced him \nto remove a Ten Commandments book cover from another book. The suit was \nultimately resolved out of court. Houston Chronicle, May 24, 2000.\n  As explained in her Senate testimony, Nashala Hearn, a 12-year-old \ngirl in Muskogee, OK, was suspended for three days by her public middle \nschool for wearing a hijab, a headscarf required by her Islamic faith. \nThe school eventually backed down after intervention by the Justice \nDepartment. Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil \nRights and Property Rights, June 8, 2004.\n  A Texas school district refused to hire a public school teacher for \nthe position of assistant principal, because her children attended a \nprivate Christian school, in violation of the district's policy that \nthe children of all principals and administrators attend public school. \nThe district's policy was upheld by the Federal district court but \nsubsequently rejected on appeal. Barrow V. Greenville Ind. Sch. Dist., \n332 F.3d 844 5th Cir. 2003.\n  A Vietnam veteran and member of an honor guard at a New Jersey \nveterans' cemetery was fired for saying ``God bless you and this \nfamily'' to the family of a deceased veteran, even though the family \nhad consented to the blessing beforehand. Winston-Salem Journal, April \n26, 2003.\n  A public library employee in Logan County, KY, was fired for refusing \nto remove her cross-pendant necklace while at work. A Federal district \ncourt subsequently ruled that the library violated her constitutional \nrights. American Libraries, October 1, 2003.\n  According to another federal lawsuit, an employee of the Minnesota \nState Department of Revenue is barred from parking his car in the \nemployee parking lot, because his car displays religious messages such \nas ``God is a loving and caring God.'' Other employees are allowed to \ndisplay nonreligious messages on their cars. The employee is similarly \nbarred from displaying religious messages in his office cubicle, even \nthough other employees are allowed to display nonreligious messages in \ntheir cubicles. Star-Tribune (Minneapolis), July 2, 2004.\n  As he explained in his Senate testimony, Barney Clark and other \nmembers of the Balch Springs Senior Center in Balch Springs, Texas, \nwere forbidden from singing religious songs and appointing someone to \nbless their food at the city-owned senior center. The city eventually \nbacked down, but only after a federal lawsuit and intervention by the \nJustice Department. Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, \nCivil Rights and Property Rights, June 8, 2004.\n  I'm grateful to the Liberty Legal Institute, which has been an active \nchampion of religious liberty, and which followed up on their testimony \nat the hearing last year by filing a 51-page report with the \nsubcommittee last October. The Institute's report documented additional \ncases of hostility to religion in the public square, and noted the \nexistence of a nationwide campaign to remove religious expressions from \nthe public square--namely, liberal organizations in Washington that \nactively litigate against equal access for religious organizations in \npublic schools, against school choice programs that give needy students \nequal access to parochial and nonsectarian schools alike, and against \nvoluntary, student-led religious expression.\n  Thankfully, and despite the efforts of these organizations, we are \nstarting to win the battle for religious liberty and against hostility \nto religious expression. The Court has upheld equal access for \nreligious organizations on a number of recent occasions--albeit \nfrequently by narrow, 5-4 majorities--including cases like Rosenberger, \nGood News Club, Zelman, and Mitchell. And thankfully, the Equal Access \nAct of 1984 has been affirmed, upheld, and enforced.\n  But the Equal Access Act applies only to postsecondary schools. It is \ntime that equal access be extended to elementary schools as well, and \nthat is why I introduce this legislation today. I know that Senators \nwill be following closely the Supreme Court's consideration of the Ten \nCommandments cases and the people's right to display our nation's most \nrevered documents in public squares across America. Regardless of the \noutcome of those cases. I hope that Senators will also support\n\n[[Page S1875]]\n\nthis effort to extend equal access to all of our nation's public \nschools.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 483\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. EQUAL ACCESS FOR ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS.\n\n       The Equal Access Act (20 U.S.C. 4071 et seq.) is amended--\n       (1) in section 802--\n       (A) in subsection (a), by inserting ``elementary school \n     or'' after ``public''; and\n       (B) in subsection (b), by inserting ``elementary school \n     or'' after ``public''; and\n       (2) in section 803, by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(5) The term `elementary school' means a public school \n     that provides elementary education as determined by State \n     law.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WARNER (for himself and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 484. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nFederal civilian and military retirees to pay health insurance premiums \non a pretax basis and to allow a deduction for TRICARE supplemental \npremiums; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nprovide some relief for our nation's retired Federal employees from the \nsevere increases in Federal Employee Health Benefit Program (FEHBP) \npremiums. This measure extends premium conversion to Federal and \nmilitary retirees, allowing them to pay their health insurance premiums \nwith pre-tax dollars.\n  The increasing cost of health care is a critical issue, especially to \nretirees living on a fixed income. In 2005 premiums are expected to \nrise an average of 7.9 percent for the 8 million Federal employees, \nretirees and their families that are covered under the FEHBP. This \nlegislation will help to ensure that more Federal and military retirees \nare able to continue their healthcare coverage with the FEHBP and \nsupplemental TRICARE health insurance plans as premiums continue to \nrise.\n  In the fall of 2000 premium conversion became available to current \nFederal employees who participate in the Federal Employees Health \nBenefits Program. It is a benefit already available to many private \nsector employees. While premium conversion does not directly affect the \namount of the FEHBP premium, it helps to offset some of the increase by \nreducing an individual's Federal tax liability.\n  Extending this benefit to Federal retirees requires a change in the \ntax law, specifically Section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code. This \nlegislation makes the necessary change in the tax code.\n  Under the legislation, the benefit is concurrently afforded to our \nNation's military retirees as well to assist with increasing health \ncare costs.\n  A number of organizations representing Federal and military retirees \nare strongly behind this initiative, including the National Association \nof Retired Federal Employees, the Military Coalition, the Fleet Reserve \nAssociation, and the Association of the U.S. Army.\n  My support for this legislation spans three Congresses. In the 108th \nCongress, my premium conversion bill received considerable bipartisan \nsupport with 57 cosponsors. It is my sincere hope that this legislation \nwill be passed by Congress this session. I encourage my colleagues to \njoin me in supporting this critical legislation and show their support \nfor our Nation's dedicated Federal civilian and military retirees. I \nask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 484\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require the Secretary of the Navy to procure \nhelicopters under the VH-3D presidential helicopter fleet replacement \nprogram that are wholly manufactured in the United States; to the \nCommittee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwith my colleague Senator Dodd that requires that the helicopter fleet \nbuilt for the President of the United States be made entirely in the \nUnited States by American workers using American parts.\n  This is how it has always been. And this is the way it should stay.\n  Since President Eisenhower first flew in 1957, American Presidents \nhave logged more than a quarter of a million hours in American \nhelicopters designated Marine One with an unblemished record of safety \nand performance.\n  But recently, the Navy chose a new helicopter to replace the current \nPresidential fleet that was designed overseas and will have substantial \nportions built overseas.\n\n[[Page S1876]]\n\n  This model was chosen over another model that would have been wholly \nbuilt in the United States. This decision is a blow to the pride of the \nAmerican aviation industry and blows a hole in the wallet of American \nworkers and taxpayers.\n  Let me make clear that with this bill we are not asking the Navy to \npick a helicopter solely because it is American. The Presidential fleet \nmust be made up of helicopters that offer superb performance and safety \nstandards.\n  But when an American model meets those standards, as was the case \nwith the bids for Marine One, common sense dictates that we ``Buy \nAmerican.''\n  With this contract we are putting the American aviation industry at a \nlong-term competitive disadvantage. The Marine One contract comes with \nmillions of dollars in research money to develop new helicopter \ntechnologies. With the Navy's selection of a foreign competitor, these \nresearch dollars will now go overseas.\n  By subsidizing foreign aviation research--mostly in Europe, which \nalready heavily subsidizes its aviation industry--we will be using \nAmerican taxpayer dollars to make it harder for U.S. companies to stay \ncompetitive and compete in domestic and world markets.\n  With these kinds of disadvantages, we run the risk that we will \nbecome increasingly reliant on overseas suppliers of important military \nequipment, jeopardizing our national security.\n  Insisting that the American President fly in an American-made \nhelicopter is not a unique or unusual consideration for a national \nleader.\n  The Prime Minister of Great Britain doesn't fly in an American \nhelicopter, nor does the Prime Minister of Italy. They both fly in \nEuropean helicopters. That's fine. They are supporting their workers, \nhelping to sustain their industrial base, and sending a clear signal of \nnational pride to their people.\n  We should do no less.\n  Let me stress, I am not seeking to exclude overseas companies from \ncompeting in U.S. markets or to exclude them from all military \ncontracts. The United States has a long history of open markets and \nfree and fair competition, and we should not back away from that.\n  But this is a unique case. We are talking about the most famous \nhelicopter in the world. What message do we send when we outsource such \na visible symbol of national pride to others? We send a message that \n``Built in America'' is second-best.\n  This is just wrong.\n  American workers have been building and maintaining Presidential \nhelicopters for over half a century. Their performance has been \noutstanding. We should not punish this service and dedication by using \ntaxpayer dollars to send their jobs to someone else.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 486\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. VH-3D PRESIDENTIAL HELICOPTER FLEET REPLACEMENT \n                   PROGRAM PROCUREMENT REQUIREMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Navy may not enter \n     into a contract for the procurement of a helicopter under the \n     VH-3D presidential helicopter fleet replacement program \n     unless the contract requires the helicopter to be wholly \n     manufactured in the United States from parts wholly \n     manufactured in the United States.\n       (b) Existing Contracts.--If a contract entered into after \n     December 31, 2004, and before the date of the enactment of \n     this section does not meet the requirements described in \n     subsection (a), the Secretary of the Navy shall terminate \n     such contract.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 488. A bill to establish a commercial truck highway safety \ndemonstration program in the State of Maine, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my colleague \nSenator Collins, to introduce legislation, the Commercial Truck Highway \nSafety Demonstration Program Act, to create a safety pilot program for \ncommercial trucks.\n  This bill would authorize a safety demonstration program in my home \nState of Maine that could be a model for other States. I have been \nworking closely with the Maine Department of Transportation, \ncommunities in my State, and others to address statewide concerns about \nthe existing Federal interstate truck weight limit of 80,000 pounds.\n  I believe that safety must be the No. 1 priority on our roads and \nhighways, and I am very concerned that the existing interstate weight \nlimit has the unintended impact of forcing commercial trucks onto State \nand local secondary roads that were never designed to safely handle \nsuch heavy commercial trucks. We are talking about narrow roads, lanes, \nand rotaries, with frequent pedestrian crossings and school zones.\n  I have been working to address this concern for many years. During \nthe 105th Congress, for example, I authored a provision providing a \nwaiver from Federal weight limits on the Maine Turnpike, the 100-mile \nsection of Maine's interstate in the southern portion of the State, and \nit was signed into law as part of TEA-21. I have also shared my \nconcerns with the Department of Transportation and the Senate \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee to urge them to work with me in \nan effort to address my concern with the safety of my constituents.\n  In addition, the Maine Department of Transportation has nearly \nconcluded a study of the truck weight limit waiver on the Maine \nTurnpike, and I have been working closely with the State in the hopes \nof expanding this study, in order to secure the data necessary to \nensure that commercial trucks operate in the safest possible manner.\n  Federal law attempts to provide uniform truck weight limits, 80,000 \npounds, on the Interstate System, but the fact is there are a myriad of \nexemptions and grandfathering provisions. Furthermore, interstate \nhighways have safety features specifically designed for heavy truck \ntraffic, whereas the narrow, winding State and local roads don't. In \nfact, lower weight limits only encourage more trucks to operate on \nthese very roads, only heightening the wear and tear as well as \nincreasing the potential danger to both drivers and pedestrians.\n  The legislation I am submitting today would simply direct the \nSecretary of Transportation to establish a 3-year pilot program to \nimprove commercial motor vehicle safety in the State of Maine. \nSpecifically, the measure would direct the Secretary, during this \nperiod, to waive Federal vehicle weight limitations on certain \ncommercial vehicles weighing over 80,000 pounds using the Interstate \nSystem within Maine, permitting the State to set the weight limit. In \naddition, it would provide for the waiver to become permanent unless \nthe Secretary determines it has resulted in an adverse impact on \nhighway safety.\n  I believe this is a measured, responsible approach to a very serious \npublic safety issue. I hope to work with all of those with a stake in \nthis issue, safety advocates, truckers, States, and communities, to \naddress this matter in the most effective possible way, and I hope that \nmy colleagues will join me in this effort.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to join with my senior colleague \nfrom Maine in sponsoring the Commercial Truck Highway Safety \nDemonstration Program Act, an important bill that addresses a \nsignificant safety problem in our State.\n  Under current law, trucks weighing 100,000 pounds are allowed to \ntravel on Interstate 95 from Maine's border with New Hampshire to \nAugusta, our capital city. At Augusta, trucks are forced off Interstate \n95, which proceeds north to Houlton. Heavy trucks are forced onto \nsmaller, secondary roads that pass through cities, towns and villages.\n  Trucks weighing up to 100,000 pounds are permitted on interstate \nhighways in New Hampshire, Massachusetts and New York as well as the \nCanadian provinces of New Brunswick and Quebec. The weight limit \ndisparity on various segments of Maine's interstate highway system \nforces trucks traveling to and from destinations in these States and \nprovinces to use Maine's State and local roads, nearly all of which \nhave two lanes, rather than four. Consequently, many Maine communities \nalong the interstate see substantially more truck traffic than would\n\n[[Page S1877]]\n\notherwise be the case if the weight limit were 100,000 pounds for all \nof Maine's interstate highways.\n  The problem Maine faces due to the disparity in truck weight limits \naffects many communities and is clearly evident in the eastern Maine \ncities of Bangor and Brewer. In this region, a 2-mile stretch of \nInterstate 395 connects two major State highways that carry significant \ntruck traffic across Maine. I-395 affords direct and safe access \nbetween these major corridors, but because of the existing Federal \ntruck weight limit, many heavy trucks are prohibited from using this \nmulti-lane, limited access highway.\n  Instead, these trucks, which sometimes carry hazardous materials, are \nrequired to maneuver through the downtown portions of Bangor and Brewer \non two-lane roadways. Truckers are faced with two options; the first is \na 3.5-mile diversion through downtown Bangor that requires several very \ndifficult and dangerous turns. The second route is a 7.5-mile diversion \nthat includes 20 traffic lights and requires travel through portions of \ndowntown Bangor, as well. Congestion is a significant issue and safety \nis seriously compromised as a result of these required diversions.\n  A recent study, conducted by the Maine Department of Transportation, \nfound that the accident rate between 2000 and 2003--per 100 million \nvehicle miles traveled--was more than four times higher on two-lane \nroads than on the Maine Turnpike, which had four lanes at the time of \nthe study. A uniform truck weight limit of 100,000 pounds on Maine's \ninterstate highways would reduce highway miles, as well as the travel \ntimes necessary to transport freight through Maine, resulting in \nsafety, economic, and environmental benefits.\n  Moreover, Maine's extensive network and local roads would be better \npreserved without the wear and tear of heavy truck traffic. Most \nimportant, however, a uniform truck weight limit will keep trucks on \nthe interstate where they belong, rather than on roads and highways \nthat pass through Maine's cities, towns, and neighborhoods.\n  The legislation that Senator Snowe and I are introducing addresses \nthe safety issues we face in Maine because of the disparities in truck \nweight limits. The legislation directs the Secretary of Transportation \nto establish a commercial truck safety pilot program in Maine. Under \nthe pilot program, the truck weight limit on all Maine highways that \nare part of the Interstate Highway System would be set at 100,000 \npounds for 3 years. During the waiver period, the Secretary would study \nthe impact of the pilot program on safety and would receive the input \nof a panel on which State officials, and representatives from safety \norganizations, municipalities, and the commercial trucking industry \nwould serve. The waiver would become permanent if the panel determined \nthat motorists were safer as a result of a uniform truck weight limit \non Maine's interstate highway system.\n  Maine's citizens and motorists are needlessly at risk because too \nmany heavy trucks are forced off the interstate and onto local roads. \nThe legislation Senator Snowe and I are introducing is a commonsense \napproach to a significant safety problem in my State. I hope my \ncolleagues will support passage of this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALEXANDER (for himself, Mr. Kyl, and Mr. Cornyn):\n  S. 489. A bill to amend chapter 111 of title 28, United States Code, \nto limit the duration of Federal consent decrees to which State and \nlocal governments are a party, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text \nof the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 489\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Consent Decree \n     Fairness Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that:\n       (1) Consent decrees are for remedying violations of rights, \n     and they should not be used to advance any policy extraneous \n     to the protection of those rights.\n       (2) Consent decrees are also for protecting the party who \n     faces injury and should not be expanded to apply to parties \n     not involved in the litigation.\n       (3) In structuring consent decrees, courts should take into \n     account the interests of State and local governments in \n     managing their own affairs.\n       (4) Consent decrees should be structured to give due \n     deference to the policy judgments of State and local \n     officials as to how to obey the law.\n       (5) Whenever possible, courts should not impose consent \n     decrees that require technically complex and evolving policy \n     choices, especially in the absence of judicially discoverable \n     and manageable standards.\n       (6) Consent decrees should not be unlimited, but should \n     contain an explicit and realistic strategy for ending court \n     supervision.\n\n     SEC. 3. LIMITATION ON CONSENT DECREES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Chapter 111 of title 28, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``Sec.  1660.
