Let us draw devotional inspiration this \nmorning from the life of Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise, founder of the Hebrew \nUnion College, who led this Senate in prayer 135 years ago to this very \nweek. May one brief moment from the life of this famed American \nclergyman renew in us a commitment to the core of righteous living.\n  For we have been taught that once, when this rabbi took ill amidst a \nclass and was compelled to descend from his teaching platform, a young, \neager student jumped up, grabbed his arm, and said: ``May I help you \ndown, Doctor?''\n  In response to this question, the rabbi uttered words that remind us \nanew of what is good and what God does require of us all: ``Never help \na person down,'' the rabbi told his student. ``Try always to help \npeople up.''\n  In this year, marking 350 years of Jewish life in America, we offer \nup our prayerful and reverential gratitude to the source of life for \nimplanting within our hearts the vision of our noble Republic, ever \nstriving to help people up.\n  O may all who labor in this House--and in every house--be inspired \nanew by the prophet Micah's exhortation, a charge that the father of \nthis Nation deeply cherished and repeatedly cited: Do justly, love \nmercy, and walk humbly with thy God.\n  Fervently we pray that the vision we hallow will animate all of us to \nlive ``with malice toward none, with charity for all . . . [so we can \nfinish] the work we are in.''\n  Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/26/senate-section/article/S5945-3", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE\n\n  The Honorable John E.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume executive session for the consideration of Calendar \nNo. 103, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of John Robert Bolton, of \nMaryland, to be the Representative of the United States of America to \nthe United Nations.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 6 p.m. will be equally divided between the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Foreign Relations Committee, of which 1 hour will be \nreserved under the control of the Senator from Ohio, Mr. Voinovich, and \nwith the exceptions just noted by consent.\n  The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I will yield shortly to distinguished \ncolleagues who have sought an opportunity to speak for the first time \non the nomination of John Bolton. I had the privilege of addressing the \nSenate yesterday for over 50 minutes in which I attempted to outline \nall of the best reasons for John Bolton's confirmation, which I hope \nwill occur today. I believe he will be an outstanding representative of \nour country, a very able diplomat to the United Nations.\n  During the course of my comments--now reflected, because they were \ndelivered yesterday, in the Congressional Record today--we attempted to \ngo through each of the case histories of interviews completed by the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee in response to the questions or \nallegations made about the nominee. Affirmatively, I have tried to \npoint out the tens of very able Americans who have endorsed John \nBolton, including a large number of former Secretaries of State, \nDefense, National Security Directors, and, most importantly, people who \nhave worked with him at the United Nations, at USAID.\n  I ask Members to reference the specifics of my speech yesterday, if \nthere are questions with regard to the work done by the able staff on \nboth sides of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, to make certain \nthat each of the arguments that has been presented has been met and \nfairly argued.\n  During the entirety of the debate yesterday, the arguments that were \nmade were not new ones. They may be important ones, and perhaps they \nwill be reargued today. But I ask Members to think constructively now \nabout the President of the United States, his desire for reform of the \nUnited Nations, and his desire to have John Bolton there at the United \nNations to work in that capacity for reform of an institution that the \nUnited States wishes to see much stronger, more able, and certainly a \nvaluable part of American diplomacy and national security policy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I listen to my distinguished chairman, and \nI wonder who he is actually talking about when he says there is so much \nsupport for John Bolton. There has been an unprecedented outcry of \nRepublicans and Democrats against this nomination.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the votes on U.S. \nambassadors at the United Nations since 1945.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Votes on U.S. Ambassadors to the UN\n\n       Edward R. Stettinius, Jr. (1945-1946): Voice Vote\n       Warren R. Austin (1947-1953): Unanimous Consent\n       Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. (1953-1960): Unanimous Consent\n       James J. Wadsworth (1960-1961): Unanimous Consent\n       Adlai E. Stevenson (1961-1965): Unanimous Consent\n       Arthur J. Goldberg (1965-1968): Unanimous Consent\n       George W. Ball (1968-1968): Unanimous Consent\n       James Russell Wiggins (1968-1969): Unanimous Consent\n       Charles W. Yost (1969-1971): Unanimous Consent\n       George Bush (1971-1973): Unanimous Consent\n       John A. Scali (1973-1975): Unanimous Consent\n       Daniel P. Moynihan (1975-1976): Unanimous Consent\n       William W. Scranton (1976-1977): Unanimous Consent\n       Andrew J. Young (1977-1979) 89-3 :\n       Donald F. McHenry (1979-1981) 83-0 :\n       Jeane J. Kirkpatrick (1981-1985) 81-0 :\n       Vernon A. Walters (1985-1989): Voice Vote\n       Thomas R. Pickering (1989-1992) 99-0 :\n       Edward Joseph Perkins (1992-1993): Unanimous Consent\n       Madeleine K. Albright (1993-1997): Unanimous Consent\n       Bill Richardson 100-0 (1997-1998):\n       Richard Holbrooke (1999-2001) 81-16 :\n       John D. Negroponte (2001-2004): Voice Vote\n       John C. Danforth (2004-2005): Voice Vote\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. What this will show for the record is that starting in \n1945, we have had voice votes and unanimous consent votes on almost all \nof these nominees. There were few exceptions. Andrew Young got the post \n89 to 2; Donald McHenry, 83 to nothing--so they had votes--Jeane \nKirkpatrick, 81 to nothing. The largest ``no'' vote was Richard \nHolbrooke, who had 16 against him. Bill Richardson was 100 to nothing; \nJohn Negroponte, voice vote; Danforth, voice vote.\n  I am putting this in the Record because when you listen to my friends \nwho are supporting John Bolton, you would think that this is just a \nrun-of-the-mill type appointment, that it is usual to have this kind of \nfirestorm. Nothing could be further from the truth. This nomination is \na diversion from the consensus candidates that we have had in the past. \nSince my chairman talked about all the support John Bolton has, I ask \nunanimous consent to print in the Record in a letter dated May 9, 2005.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              Updated May 9, 2005.\n     Hon. Richard G. Lugar,\n     Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Joseph R. Biden,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lugar and Senator Biden: We have noted with \n     appreciation the moves of President Bush at the beginning of \n     his second term to improve U.S. relations with the countries \n     of the European Union and of the United Nations. Maintaining \n     these ties and the willingness of those countries to \n     cooperate with the United States is essential to U.S. \n     security.\n       It is for this reason that we write you to express our \n     concern over the nomination of John R. Bolton to be permanent \n     representative of the United States at the United Nations. We \n     urge you to reject that nomination.\n       By virtue of service in the State Department, USAID and \n     Justice Departments, John Bolton has the professional \n     background needed for this position. But his past activities \n     and statements indicate conclusively that he is the wrong man \n     for this position at a time when the U.N. is entering a \n     critically important phase of modernization, seeking to \n     promote economic development and democratic reforms and \n     searching for ways to cope better with proliferation crises \n     and a spurt of natural disasters and internal conflicts.\n       John Bolton has an exceptional record of opposition to \n     efforts to enhance U.S. security through arms control. He led \n     a campaign against ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear \n     Test Ban Treaty. Today, the administration is pressing for \n     development of new types of nuclear weapons. John Bolton \n     blocked more extensive international agreement to limit sales \n     of small arms, the main killer in internal wars. He led the \n     fight to continue U.S. refusal to participate in the Ottawa \n     Landmine Treaty. Today, the U.S. has joined Russia and China \n     in insisting on the right to continue to deploy antipersonnel \n     landmines. John Bolton crafted the U.S. withdrawal from the \n     joint efforts of 40 countries to formulate a verification \n     system for the Biological Weapons Convention and blocked \n     continuation of these efforts in a period of increasing \n     concern over potential terrorist use of these weapons and of \n     terrorist access to the stocks of countries covertly \n     producing these weapons. John Bolton's unsubstantiated claims \n     that Cuba and Syria\n\n[[Page S5947]]\n\n     are working on biological weapons further discredited the \n     effect of U.S. warnings and U.S. intelligence on weapons of \n     mass destruction.\n       John Bolton led the successful campaign for U.S. withdrawal \n     from the treaty limiting missile defenses (ABM Treaty). The \n     effects of this action included elimination of the sole \n     treaty barrier to the weaponization of space. In the face of \n     decades of votes in the U.N. General Assembly calling for \n     negotiation of a treaty to block deployment of weapons in \n     space, he has blocked negotiation in the Geneva Conference on \n     Disarmament of a treaty on this subject. The administration \n     has repeatedly proposed programs calling for weapon \n     deployment in space.\n       As chief negotiator of the 2002 Moscow Treaty on \n     withdrawing U.S. and Russian nuclear weapons from field \n     deployment, John Bolton structured a treaty without its own \n     verification regime, without required progress reports from \n     both sides, without the requirement to destroy warheads \n     withdrawn from deployment, and without provision for \n     negotiating continued reductions. Under his guidance, the \n     State Department repudiated important consensus agreements \n     reached in the year 2000 Review Conference of the Non-\n     proliferation Treaty and has even blocked the formulation \n     of an agenda for the next review conference to be held in \n     May 2005.\n       Under John Bolton as Under Secretary for Arms Control and \n     International Security, the State Department has continued to \n     fail to resolve the impasse with Russia about the legal \n     liability of U.S. personnel working with Russia on the \n     security of the huge arsenal of nuclear, chemical and \n     biological weapons of the former Soviet Union and has failed \n     to accelerate measures aimed at the safety and security of \n     this huge arsenal from theft, illegal sale and terrorist \n     access.\n       John Bolton's insistence that the U.N. is valuable only \n     when it directly serves the United States, and that the most \n     effective Security Council would be one where the U.S. is the \n     only permanent member, will not help him to negotiate with \n     representatives of the remaining 96 percent of humanity at a \n     time when the U.N. is actively considering enlargement of the \n     Security Council and steps to deal more effectively with \n     failed states and to enhance the U.N.'s peacekeeping \n     capability.\n       John Bolton's work as a paid researcher for Taiwan, his \n     idea that the U.S. should treat Taiwan as a sovereign state, \n     and that it is fantasy to believe that China might respond \n     with armed force to the secession of Taiwan do not attest to \n     the balanced judgment of a possible U.S. permanent \n     representative on the Security Council. China is emerging as \n     a major world power and the Taiwan issue is becoming more \n     acute.\n       At a time when the U.N. is struggling to get an adequate \n     grip on the genocidal killing in Darfur, Sudan, Mr. Bolton's \n     skepticism about U.N. peacekeeping, about paying the U.N. \n     dues that fund peacekeeping, and his leadership of the \n     opposition to the International Criminal Court, originally \n     proposed by the U.S. itself in order to prosecute human \n     rights offenders, will all make it difficult for the U.S. to \n     play an effective leadership role at a time when the U.N. \n     itself and many member states are moving to improve U.N. \n     capacity to deal with international problems.\n       Given these past actions and statements, John R. Bolton \n     cannot be an effective promoter of the U.S. national interest \n     at the U.N. We urge you to oppose his nomination.\n           Sincerely,\n       The Hon. Terrell E. Arnold, Former Deputy Director, Office \n     of Counterterrorism, U.S. Department of State (Reagan), \n     Former U.S. Consul General, Sao Paulo, Brazil (Carter).\n       Ambassador (ret.) Harry G.

Yalowitz, Former U.S. \n     ambassador to Belarus and Georgia (Clinton).\n  Mr. President, this is a letter going to the Honorable Richard Lugar, \nthe Honorable Joseph Biden, our chair and ranking member. It is an \nunprecedented letter:\n\n       We write to express our concern over the nomination of John \n     R. Bolton to be Permanent Representative of the U.S. at the \n     United Nations, and we urge you to reject that nomination.\n\n  This is from 102 very distinguished Americans who have served their \ncountry under both Republican and Democratic Presidents. I am going to \nread off some of the names for the record: The Honorable Terrell \nArnold, who worked under Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter; Ambassador, \nretired, Harry Barnes, who worked under Nixon, Ford, and Reagan; \nAmbassador Robert Barry, who served under Reagan, Clinton, and Carter; \nAmbassador Josiah Beeman, who served under Clinton; Ambassador Maurice \nBernbaum, who served under Eisenhower and Johnson; Ambassador Jack \nBinns, who served Carter and Reagan; Ambassador Richard Bloomfield, who \nserved under Ford, Carter, and Reagan; Ambassador Peter Bridges, who \nserved under Reagan; Ambassador George Bruno, who served under Bill \nClinton; Ambassador Edward Brynn, who served under George H.W. Bush and \nBill Clinton.\n  I could go on and on, but I think placing this in the Record for my \ncolleagues to see will undermine the comments that are made about how \nmuch support this particular nominee has. That is simply glossing over \nthe record. That is what is happening in this debate--glossing over the \nrecord by my friends, who are saying: Oh, what is the problem? So he is \na bully, so he tries to fire people, so we have all these letters--and \nit goes on. Their ultimate point is that he is just what we need at the \nUnited Nations.\n  I come out very differently. This is just what we don't need at the \nUnited Nations. We have a credibility problem in the world right now, \nand we need someone to walk in there, such as John Danforth walked in \nthere, with credibility. I don't think we should be considering the \nnomination today. I made\n\n[[Page S5949]]\n\nthat clear when I put a hold on the nomination. I lifted that hold \nbecause, clearly, colleagues believed they wanted to begin debate and, \nwith due deference, I lifted the hold.\n  The fact is, we don't have the information we have requested from the \nState Department and from the administration. You may think, well, \nmaybe there is so much information out there, what more could there be \non John Bolton? Well, I answer it this way. I have colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle coming up to me and saying: Do you have any more? Do \nyou have a smoking gun on John Bolton? What else is out there? We heard \nwhat is out there. Do you have a smoking gun? The answer I give them is \nwe not only have found several smoking guns but several bodies who were \nthere to tell what happened to them. We found the victims. They are out \nthere. They were saved only because there were folks who served higher \nthan John Bolton, who said to him: You are wrong, you are bullying \npeople, you are twisting their words, you are exerting politics in what \nshould be clearly an independent intelligence function. And because of \nthat, John Bolton was saved from himself. But we have the smoking guns \nand the victims, which we will talk about. But our colleagues want more \ninformation.\n  Well, there are three big pieces of information out that we have not \nreceived. One is of deepest concern to our ranking member, Joe Biden, \nwho has done an excellent job. Frankly, he and his staff and all of our \nstaffs have done an extraordinary job. One piece of information deals \nwith Mr. Bolton's interest in finding out intelligence matters that \nwere revealed on some intercepts. We think it is very important because \nwe don't know who was the target of Mr. Bolton's interest in the 10 \ntimes when he requested to see these intercepts.\n  It is a very important matter because, from what you can tell from \nthe information we have so far, Mr. Bolton had a very clear agenda in \nhis work at the State Department. What that agenda appears to be, from \nwhat we know, is hyping up the threat from various countries. We \nalready know what a hyped-up threat can do. We have lost 1,600-plus of \nour beautiful soldiers in Iraq because of a hyped-up threat. There are \nmore than 12,000 wounded. So when we are discussing John Bolton and his \nproclivity to try to exaggerate and twist intelligence information, \nthis is not some theoretical dispute about whether he has an ideology, \nor whatever. That is not the question. The question is: Could his \naction have resulted in perhaps another conflict, or certainly more \ntension? The fact is, it could have--if he wasn't stopped by the higher \nups. And now we hear that the higher ups are saying to Senators: Don't \nworry, we will control him at the U.N.\n  Mr. President, I don't want someone to have to be controlled at the \nUnited Nations. John Danforth didn't have to be controlled. Mr. \nNegroponte didn't have to be controlled. Jean Kirkpatrick didn't have \nto be controlled. Daniel Patrick Moynihan didn't have to be controlled. \nBill Richardson didn't have to be controlled. They knew what the policy \nof the United States of America was. They respected independent \nintelligence analysts. They never tried to twist information to fit \ntheir preconceived notions of what the world should look like. That is \nwhy this information is important.\n  There are two other areas that we are interested in, also, dealing \nwith a speech that Mr. Bolton prepared on Syria. Somehow we cannot get \nthe draft of that speech. We think that is important. There is another \narea we have asked for, which is that one of Mr. Bolton's assistants \nwho works with him has private clients, and we have asked to see the \nlist of those private clients. We have not been able to get that \neither. So out of due respect for the United States Senate and for each \nof us as Senators, we are not an arm of the executive branch. We are a \nproud independent branch of Government. It gets you back to the whole \nissue of checks and balances.\n  We have every right to see this information. If John Bolton can see \nthese intercepts, why can't Joe Biden see them, who is our ranking \nmember on the Foreign Affairs Committee, and someone whom everybody \nrespects around here as being very cautious and careful? And there is \nnot one scintilla of evidence that Joe Biden ever did something to \nundermine any administration's foreign policy. He bends over backward \nthe other way. So that is a reason we should not be having this vote \nright now. We need to have more time to work on the administration to \nget this information--these intercepts, the speech, and the conflict of \ninterest of the gentleman who now works for Mr. Bolton, Matthew \nFriedman. Mr. Friedman's former clients, as best we can tell, included \nthe Government of Nigeria and also Fernando Marcos. We don't know who \nelse is there. We would like to put an end to the speculation that \nsomeone is working in a top position for Mr. Bolton who has outside \nclients, which could pose conflicts of interest.\n  There was a report in the Washington Post that got our attention on \nthe front page some weeks ago, which said Condi Rice gave a message to \nthe top staff not to cooperate with the Congress. Immediately I wrote \nto her. I got a letter back from her assistant. I wrote her a letter \nand she sent me back a letter from her assistant that said: We are \ncooperating. That report was false. We are going to turn over \neverything.\n  I ask Senators on both sides: Don't you have pride in what you do? \nDon't you feel good about what you do? Don't you believe that being a \nSenator deserves some respect? Don't you believe you deserve to have \ninformation? Well, if you do, you should not vote to proceed with this \nnomination at this time, just based on the fact that we have not gotten \nthe information.\n  I think we are continuing to see the arrogance of power from this \nadministration and a disregard for the checks and balances. We don't \nneed a ruler in the White House; we need a government. We don't need \nsomeone who will rule us; we need someone who will govern with us. That \nis what this is about--a lack of respect for members of the committee.\n  Beyond that, as I said, we do have a lot of smoking guns on this \nnominee, and we do have the victims of his actions. I will spend some \ntime talking about that. It will be repetitive because each colleague \nhas seen the information. You heard the very emotional testimony of \nSenator Voinovich, who feels so strongly about this, and he has laid it \nout in his fashion. Senator Biden has laid it out, as have others. I \nwill lay it out in my fashion.\n  Politicizing intelligence. What does that mean? It means that you \nhave a political agenda, you try to use intelligence by cherry-picking \nit or twisting it to make your point. It is dangerous. It is \nexceedingly dangerous. There was a report in a British newspaper that \nhad documentation from someone in the military in Britain who said, in \nfact, that is what happened in Iraq. We don't know that right now \nbecause we have not had that particular investigation. We only know \nthat we made big mistakes on the intelligence front. But we didn't look \nat it saying: Did people in the office cherry-pick? Did they politicize \nintelligence? We don't know the answer. That is what the British \ndocuments say. We don't know that here. We were supposed to look at it, \nand I hope we will because history deserves an answer and so do the \nfamilies of our soldiers who are dead.\n  Politicizing intelligence is dangerous for our country. And now we \nthink about probably one of the first assignments our U.N. ambassador \nmay well have, which is to convince the U.N. Security Council about the \nthreats posed by other nations, such as Iran and North Korea. I don't \nsee Mr. Bolton having credibility, given his record of politicizing \nintelligence to be able to convince other countries that there is a \nproblem. Maybe Secretary Rice will have to come over there. Maybe the \nPresident will have to speak to the U.N. instead. Would it not be good \nto have someone at the U.N. who had credibility walking in, such as \nSenator Danforth had? Would that not be important? Mr. Bolton won't \nhave the credibility because he has a record of trying to remove \nintelligence analysts who disagreed with him, and he also attempted to \nexaggerate intelligence to fit his views.\n  So this issue of using political pressure and the power of your \nposition to twist the arms of independent intelligence analysts is, I \nbelieve, the most serious issue concerning John Bolton\n\n[[Page S5950]]\n\nbecause we know this could lead to unjustified war, and we should not \npromote someone who has a history of exaggerating threats, or at least \ntrying to exaggerate threats that are not supported by intelligence.\n  When you hear me make this comment, you might say: Well, Senator \nBoxer, you are a strong Democrat. Who else supports this view that \npoliticizing intelligence is what John Bolton did? How about the former \nAssistant Secretary of State for Intelligence and Research, Carl Ford, \nwho testified that Bolton's berating of analyst Christian Westermann \nhad a ``chilling effect''--his words--a chilling effect within that \nagency and that analysts in INR--that is the intelligence research arm \nof the State Department--were very negatively affected by the incident. \nSo we have John Bolton trying to get rid of Christian Westermann, by \neveryone's account a very honorable, bright intelligence officer doing \nhis work, and it negatively affected, according to Carl Ford--by the \nway, Carl Ford describes himself as a conservative Republican. What did \nhe say? He said his hero is Dick Cheney. Here we have a self-described \nconservative Republican, and his hero is Dick Cheney. He says John \nBolton had a chilling effect within the intelligence agency, and John \nBolton negatively affected that whole operation there.\n  Mr. Ford said further the only reason, at the end of the day, that \npolitical pressure did not work on Mr. Westermann was because, \nthankfully, he said, the analyst was strong enough to say no to Bolton.\n  I want to say on the floor of the Senate to Mr. Westermann I have \nnever met him, I do not know him, I do not know his politics--I want to \nsay to him: Thank you for the courage that you displayed in the face of \na bully in such a high-level position.\n  By the way, one of the things Senator Dodd did, and I thought he did \nit brilliantly, was to point out that Bolton reached down, way down to \nMr. Westermann. That was not someone he worked with, that was a peer. \nHe reached down to this individual who had never, in his whole career, \nhad a negative thing said about him, and tried to twist his arm to get \nthe intelligence he wanted, and when he could not do it, tried to get \nhim fired. That is just the first one. So we have the smoking gun with \nthe testimony of Carl Ford, and then we have the victim, Mr. \nWestermann.\n  Mr. Bolton did not stop there. We refer to this gentleman as Mr. \nSmith because he is in the CIA. He is the national intelligence officer \nfor Latin America. Bolton attempted to have him removed from his \nposition because he disagreed with the views that Bolton expressed \nabout Cuba in a speech saying that the views Mr. Bolton wanted to \nexpress in his speech did not reflect the intelligence community's \nassessment. This incident shows how far Mr. Bolton would go to pressure \nthe intelligence community.\n  Mr. Bolton worked in the State Department. He reached way down to get \nMr. Westermann fired. But then he goes to a completely different \nagency, over which he does not even have any influence--or should not \nhave--and he tried to ruin the career of an analyst he had never even \nmet.\n  It is one thing to challenge intelligence analysts to say: You know, \nmy information is thus and so, and you don't seem to reflect it in your \nthinking. Let's talk about it. That is fine. We do that all the time in \ndebate. I know when I am preparing for a talk such as this on the floor \nof the Senate, I will have my staff come in and say: I don't see it \nthat way. Why do you see it that way? And you try to figure out what is \nthe right thing to say, the right thing to do, and the thing on which \nyou will not be challenged. But Mr. Bolton threatens retribution when \nthe intelligence does not conform to his views. That is a disaster to \npromote someone such as that.\n  Robert Hutchings, former chairman of the National Intelligence \nCouncil, describes the risk of politicizing intelligence this way:\n\n       I think every judgment ought to be challenged and \n     questioned. But . . . when it goes beyond that to a search \n     for a pretty clearly defined preformed set of judgments, then \n     it turns into politicization. And . . . even when it is \n     successfully resisted . . . it creates a climate of \n     intimidation and a culture of conformity that is damaging . . \n     .\n\n  What does he mean by that? This is a man who is an expert in \nintelligence. Conformity is dangerous because it means there is no \ndiscussion, no debate about what the truth is, where we are going. We \nneed to have diverse voices. But at the end of the day, people have to \nunderstand that when they are speaking for the United States of \nAmerica, they must speak the truth, as we know it at the time, based on \nthe information we know.\n  First, we have politicizing intelligence, which is a disaster. Then \nwe have a pattern of retribution against lower level employees, which I \nbelieve leads to paralysis in the workplace. When you have a \ncircumstance where Colin Powell had to come over to talk to these \nintelligence analysts and tell them, Don't worry, we are with you, keep \ndoing your job, do not be intimidated, that is an extraordinary \ncircumstance, and that is what happened in the case of Mr. Bolton. He \nhad so harmed the morale of the intelligence agents, as Mr. Ford, a \nconservative Republican testified, that Colin Powell had to take time \nout to go over and speak to these analysts.\n  This is not a question of partisan politics. This nominee has as many \nRepublicans opposed to him as he does Democrats, and maybe even more.\n  So we have the politicizing of intelligence which is very dangerous \nfor our people, and we have retribution against lower level employees. \nWhen Mr. Bolton was asked about this, he brushed it off: Oh, I didn't \nreally, didn't matter--I am paraphrasing--I shrugged it off, just got \nit off my chest. Yet he sought to remove Christian Westermann for \ndisagreeing with him over intelligence in Cuba. Not once and shrug it \noff, not twice and shrug it off, but the record shows three times over \na 5-month period he went after Mr. Westermann.\n  This is confirmed by Carl Ford, the former Assistant Secretary for \nthe INR--that is the State Department intelligence division--Thomas \nFingar, former Deputy Assistant Secretary for INR; and Fred Fleitz, \nChief of Staff to John Bolton; Neil Silver, an INR office manager; and \nLarry Wilkerson, former Chief of Staff to Colin Powell.\n\n  Bolton said to the committee: No, it was nothing, it was no biggie, I \ngot it off my chest, I shrugged it off, I did not do anything. Carl \nFord, Thomas Fingar, Fred Fleitz, Neil Silver, and Larry Wilkerson--\nmost of those people from the Bush administration--said: No, he tried \nto remove Mr. Westermann three times over a 5-month period. And Mr. \nBolton sought to remove Mr. Smith over at the CIA, over whom Mr. Bolton \nhad no authority whatsoever. We know that Bolton and his staff \ndiscussed the removal of this person over several months, and Bolton \npersonally went out to CIA headquarters to seek Mr. Smith's removal.\n  Let me say that again. We have retribution against independent \nintelligence analysts, three times in 5 months against Westermann, and \nMr. Bolton went all the way out to the CIA to get rid of Mr. Smith. Who \nconfirms this? John McLaughlin, Deputy Director of the CIA, Stu Cohen, \nformer acting chairman of the National Intelligence Council, and Alan \nFoley, Director of the CIA Weapons Intelligence Nonproliferation and \nArms Control.\n  We have not only the smoking gun, but the two victims. Now we have \nanother person. Bolton also wrongly accused Rexon Ryu--a highly \nregarded midlevel State Department officer--of withholding a document \nfrom him. Eight months after the incident, Bolton denied Ryu a \nsignificant new assignment working on the G8 summit. This is confirmed \nby John Wolf, former Assistant Secretary of State for Nonproliferation.\n  Of all the people you want to promote, it would not be somebody who \npeople in his own party say tried to politicize intelligence, tried to \ndish out retribution on independent intelligence analysts and because \nsomeone did not give him a piece of paper, he denied him a very \nimportant new assignment.\n  Then, in 1994, we have a bizarre report of Bolton allegedly chasing a \nwoman through a hotel lobby in Moscow, pounding on her door, falsely \ntelling her colleagues she was under criminal investigation. How do we \nknow that? There is a contemporaneous account provided by a colleague \nof this woman who said, yes, she called him during that whole time and \ntold him everything that happened.\n\n[[Page S5951]]\n\n  In addition to these examples, we have learned that Mr. Bolton tried \nto have a State Department lawyer removed from a case involving \nsanctions and tried to have two unnamed State Department officers \nremoved over policy differences.\n  So there is a clear pattern of politicizing intelligence, which is \ndangerous for this country, and seeking retribution against lower level \nemployees. You know what I find very significant is that the reason \nJohn Bolton failed in every one of his efforts, no matter how hard he \ntried--and we have the records, he tried--is because another official \nstepped in to stop John Bolton from his abusive behavior. One time it \nwas Assistant Secretary Ford who prevented the retribution from taking \nplace, again, a conservative Republican. In another instance, the \nDeputy Director of the CIA John McLaughlin, under this President George \nBush, had to step in when an analyst's job was threatened. Even \nSecretary Armitage, who was the Assistant Secretary to Colin Powell, \nwas forced to intervene to prevent Bolton from removing a State \nDepartment lawyer from a particular case.\n  Who is going to prevent Mr. Bolton from handing out this type of \nretribution when he is in New York managing 150 Americans? Secretary \nRice has told Senator Voinovich that Mr. Bolton would be closely \nsupervised as U.N. Ambassador. How embarrassing is that? How \nembarrassing is that, a U.N. Ambassador who has to be closely \nsupervised by the Secretary of State. She is going to make sure he does \nnot step out of line. She has other things to do.\n  I want to quote Senator Voinovich in the Foreign Relations Committee \nwhen he said:\n\n       Why in the world would you want to send someone to the U.N. \n     that has to be supervised?\n\n  We have a circumstance here, and I want to say to Senator Voinovich \nwhat courage he has to step out on this and what credibility he has. I \nhave watched Senator Voinovich, and I never remember him speaking out \nagainst a Presidential appointee ever. This is a momentous and \ndifficult thing to do for Senator Voinovich. But this leads me to my \nthird reason to oppose the Bolton nomination--not only politicizing \nintelligence, not only seeking retribution, but unprecedented \nopposition from both parties. I put into the Record already a list of \n102 former ambassadors who oppose this nominee, most of whom worked in \nthe Reagan administration, some in the Ford administration, the Carter \nadministration, the George H.W. Bush administration. But let's hear \nwhat some of the Republicans have said about Mr. Bolton. Here are the \ncomments of Carl Ford, self-described conservative Republican, former \nAssistant Secretary of State for their Intelligence Division within \nState:\n\n       He is a quintessential kiss up, kick down sort of guy. \n     There are a lot of them around . . . But the fact is he \n     stands out, that he's got a bigger kick and it gets bigger \n     and stronger the further down the bureaucracy he is kicking.\n\n  And here is a quote from Lawrence Wilkerson, the former Chief of \nStaff to Secretary of State Colin Powell, who, as we all know, was the \nSecretary of State in George Bush's first term. This is really \nunprecedented, to get these kinds of quotes from people who served \nunder Republican administrations about the Republican nomination.\n\n       My objections to . . . him being our Ambassador at the U.N. \n     stems from two basic things. One, I think he is a lousy \n     leader. And there are 100 to 150 people up there that have to \n     be led . . . Second, I differ from a lot of people in \n     Washington both friend and foe of Under Secretary Bolton as \n     to his quote `brilliance' unquote. I didn't see it. I saw a \n     man who counted beans . . . and had no willingness--and, in \n     many cases no capacity--to understand the other things that \n     were happening around those beans. And that's a recipe for \n     problems at the United Nations.\n\n  This is Elizabeth Jones, former Assistant Secretary for European and \nEurasian Foreign Affairs:\n\n       I don't know if he's incapable of negotiation but he's \n     unwilling.\n\n  And here we want someone at the U.N. to reform the U.N., to \nstraighten out the U.N., to change it for the better, and you are \nsending someone who is shown, as she says, as being unwilling to \nnegotiate and maybe even incapable of it.\n  John Wolf, former Assistant Secretary of State for Nonproliferation, \nOctober 2001 to July 2004--so this is very recent--says:\n\n       I believe it would be fair to say that some of the officers \n     within my bureau complained that they felt undue pressure to \n     conform to the views of Under Secretary Bolton versus the \n     views they thought they could support.\n\n  John McLaughlin, former Deputy Director of the CIA for a while. He \nwas Acting Director before they put Mr. Goss in place.\n\n       It is perfectly all right for a policy maker to express \n     disagreement with an NIO or an analyst, and it's perfectly \n     all right for them to challenge such an individual \n     vigorously, challenge their work vigorously. But I think it's \n     different to then request because of the disagreement that \n     the person be transferred . . . Therefore [I] had a strong \n     negative reaction to the suggestion about moving him.\n\n  And he was talking about Mr. Smith, the intelligence analyst who Mr. \nBolton tried to get removed from his portfolio. I have told you about \nthe letters the committee has received. The committee never asked for \nthese letters. A letter with more than 100 former diplomats who oppose \nthe nomination. In the letter that I put in--I didn't read the letter \nto you. I will just read it now in part. This letter is signed by \npeople who served the Nixon, Ford, Reagan, and George H.W. Bush \nadministrations.\n\n       [John Bolton's] past activities and statements indicate \n     conclusively that he is the wrong man for this position at a \n     time when the U.N. is entering a critically important phase \n     of modernization, seeking to promote economic development and \n     democratic reforms and searching for ways to cope better with \n     proliferation crises and spurt of natural disasters and \n     internal conflicts.\n\n  I talked about how unprecedented this opposition is to such a post. \nSince 1945, the Senate has confirmed 24 nominees to serve as U.N. \nambassador. Of these 24, only 2 received any opposition and nothing of \nthe level of opposition we see to John Bolton. The people who received \nsome opposing views were Andrew Young and Richard Holbrooke. That was \nabout pretty much it on the list as I saw it.\n  Let me see if there is anybody else.\n  That is it. All the rest, unanimous consent or everybody voted for \nthem.\n  Unprecedented, polarizing, divisive, and partisan appointment.\n  Now, there is a fourth reason I oppose this nomination, and I hope my \ncolleagues will consider this. John Bolton holds views on the U.N. and \ninternational law that shatter his credibility in the world. You want \nto send someone over there who doesn't have to be babysat by \nCondoleezza Rice. You don't want to send someone over there who doesn't \ntell the truth. You want to send someone over there you do trust and \nwho comes to the job with credibility.\n  I ask you this, my colleagues: Mr. Bolton in a speech--and I have \nseen the actual film--said:\n\n       There is no United Nations.\n\n  ``There is no United Nations.'' We are going to send someone to the \nUnited Nations who says there is no United Nations. He also said:\n\n       If the U.N. Secretariate building in New York lost 10 \n     floors, it wouldn't make a bit of difference\n\n  Now, what kind of credibility does he have walking onto the floor of \nthe--even if he is babysat by Condi Rice, who says she is going to \nwatch over him--what kind of credibility does this man have? He has \nthis record of politicizing intelligence. He has this record of \nretribution. He has the most unprecedented opposition of anyone.\n\n  I see the Senator from Connecticut has come, and I thank him, Senator \nDodd, for working so hard on this. It is not easy. Senator Dodd rarely \nsteps out like this on a Presidential appointment. It is extraordinary. \nAnd when we look at the votes of all the U.N. ambassadors since 1945, \nonly twice did we even have anybody get a few ``no'' votes. It is \nunprecedented. It is unprecedented. And there are all these reasons for \nit.\n  If you really want to reform the U.N., which we all do, we should not \nbe sending John Bolton. He simply does not have the credibility to do \nit. He doesn't have the credibility to convince wavering countries to \nbe on our side. He has been inaccurately compared to Jeane Kirkpatrick. \nIf you look at some of the U.N. ambassador's, former U.N. Ambassador \nJeane Kirkpatrick's comments, she talked about the following. She said:\n\n       U.N. votes matter because they affect widely held views \n     about perceptions of\n\n[[Page S5952]]\n\n     power, about effectiveness, and about legitimacy.\n\n  What did John Bolton say. He said:\n\n       Many Republicans in Congress and perhaps the majority not \n     only don't care about losing a General Assembly vote, but \n     they actually see it as a make my day outcome.\n\n  How does this bring John Bolton credibility?\n  I wish to take a moment to just ask my friend from Connecticut if he \nis prepared to speak at this time because if so, I would wind down.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I say to the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia, I came over to hear my colleague's remarks. I appreciate \nher courtesy.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator.\n  I have how many minutes remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 3 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent to have an additional 5 minutes. \nI will close down in 3 minutes.\n  So we have reason after reason after reason here. Senator Voinovich \nlaid out the record. He read from the record. I am going to close with \nsomething I hope every single Member of this Senate will listen to. \nJohn Bolton did not tell the truth to the committee. I am going to \nrepeat that. John Bolton did not tell the truth to the Foreign \nRelations Committee. He said he shrugged off the issue. He shrugged off \nthe issue with these people he tried to fire. He said he just dropped \nby the CIA on his way home from work. He said he didn't try to dish out \nretribution or try to fire anybody at all. He said a lot of things that \nweren't true to our committee. And that is very serious. He wasn't \ntruthful with us. He didn't give us honest accounts. He didn't tell us \nthe truth about how he tried on many occasions to fire these analysts. \nAnd if nothing else I have said matters about the retribution, about \nthe twisting of arms to get intelligence to build up a phony case \nagainst other countries, if the fact that he said there was no United \nNations doesn't move you, or if that 10 stories were gone it wouldn't \nmatter, if you don't care anything about that, I think you ought to \ncare about telling the truth before a committee of the Senate. And we \nhave had chapter and verse. We have it cold here.\n  For all those reasons, I hope we will not vote for John Bolton. And \nif we do not get the information Senators Biden and Dodd are pushing so \nhard for, we should delay this until we see that information because it \nis a matter of right and wrong. It is right for us to get that \ninformation. It is wrong for the administration to withhold it. We are \na separate but equal branch with the White House.\n  I thank my colleagues. I know this was a long statement, but this is \na very important issue. And it is not just one reason against John \nBolton; there are about six. I hope I have laid them out.\n  I thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor and note the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask would ask the time in the quorum be divided equally \nbetween both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would note that has been requested. \nIt is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the \nnomination of John Bolton. The question for me is, in a position of \nexceptional importance to the United States and our Government, that of \nrepresentative to the world body--the United Nations, is John Bolton \nthe kind of person who can best represent the interests of the United \nStates? Is John Bolton the kind of personality who can negotiate and \ntalk and establish personal relationships with the representatives of \nthe other nations of the world as we try to carry forward the agenda of \nthe United States? To those two questions, the answer is clearly no.\n  There are examples of former representatives to the United Nations, \nnominated by Republican Presidents--such as Ambassador Negroponte, such \nas a former Senator and former Ambassador John Danforth--who embody the \ntype of person you would want representing our country before the \nUnited Nations.\n  This position is particularly critical to our country at this time \nbecause two of the greatest threats to the interests of the United \nStates are North Korea and Iran, and their pursuit of nuclear weapons.\n  Clearly we have an interest in preventing both countries from \npossessing the bomb, even though it looks as though North Korea already \ndoes. We ought to be making sure that at the end of the day North Korea \ndoes not have weapons of mass destruction that they can proliferate all \nover the world, particularly into the hands of terrorists.\n  The same with Iran. There is no evidence that Iran has a bomb now, \nbut clearly the evidence is there that Iran is trying to achieve that. \nWe need a representative in the United Nations who can help us work \nwith other nations, particularly European nations, with regard to Iran. \nAlso, we must focus on the nations in the region of North Korea, so, at \nthe end of the day these two countries do not have nuclear weapons. \nThis is in the clear interests not only of the United States, but it is \nin the clear interests of the world. Otherwise, you raise the \npossibility of nuclear weapons or nuclear materials getting into the \nhands of terrorists. And once that happens, Katie bar the door, we \nwould have a whole new and extreme threat to the interests of the \ncivilized world.\n  Is John Bolton the person who we think can establish those personal \nrelationships within the United Nations? The relationships that we will \nneed in order to get Europe to help us with Iran, and in order to get \nhelp with North Korea. I think that answer is clearly no.\n  The stakes are high. That is why I speak with passion. That is why I \nhave spoken with passion as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee.\n  But there is more. The ``more'' is simple. Should John Bolton be \npromoted based on his performance in his existing job as arms control \nnegotiator? Should he be promoted? I think the answer is clearly no \nbecause John Bolton has not done a good job. Look at those two nations \nI just mentioned, North Korea and Iran. Have we gotten anywhere in our \narms control negotiations with regard to those two countries in the \nlast 4 years when he was Under Secretary for Arms Control? The answer \nto that is no.\n  Why should we be promoting an individual who has not done his job \nwell into a position of even higher visibility--I will not say of \ngreater importance--of higher visibility as a representative of our \ncountry? It is clear to me that we should not.\n  If we didn't have this deal here about supporting the President's \nnominations, do you think if Senators on that side of the aisle voted \ntheir conscience, they would support this nomination? I think the \nanswer is clearly no. Senator Voinovich has had the courage to stand up \nand call it as he sees it. I do not know Mr. Bolton, but I have \nobserved him and I have observed his demeanor and I have looked at his \nrecord. I think his record is one that does not suggest we elevate him \nto this position of extreme prominence in the representation of the \ninterests of the United States before the United Nations, particularly \nat this delicate time when we need our best representative at the \nUnited Nations. I think at the end of the day it is clear he should not \nbe our representative at the United Nations. Therefore, I am going to \nvote no on the nomination of John Bolton.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nsince Senator Nelson of Florida yielded the floor be charged against \nRepublican-controlled time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of \nJohn Bolton to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. The President \nhas made an inspired choice.\n  Mr. Bolton has the necessary experience, the knowledge of the U.N. \nsystem and the confidence of the President to be a successful advocate \nof U.S. policy at the United Nations.\n  As Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International \nSecurity, Mr. Bolton has taken a tough line\n\n[[Page S5953]]\n\nagainst the tyrants and the despots who wish to harm us.\n  He has stood up to Iran and North Korea, refusing to appease their \nnuclear ambitions.\n  Mr. Bolton is candid about his disdain for rogue regimes. He's not \ngoing to be dancing with Kim Jong Il--he called him a tyrannical \ndictator. That is fine with me. He has also been candid about the \nweaknesses of the United Nations. That is fine with me too.\n  The United States has sent forceful, blunt-speaking ambassadors to \nthe United Nations before like Jeane Kirkpatrick and Daniel Patrick \nMoynihan, and the United States has been better for it.\n  Senator Moynihan called the U.N. ``a dangerous place'' for American \ninterests.\n  That is why it is necessary to send Mr. Bolton to the U.N.--to make \nsure that American interests are advanced.\n  He is outspoken, but he also is a skilled diplomat, who knows how to \nwork with friends and allies, and has a proven track record of success \nin building coalitions to support vital objectives.\n  It was John Bolton who led the effort to create the Proliferation \nSecurity Initiative--a multinational coalition of nations, working \ntogether in unprecedented ways to stop the transport of dangerous \nweapons and materials at sea, on land and in the air. Some 60 nations \nare now supporting this effort.\n  When he was Assistant Secretary of International Organization \nAffairs, with the United Nations as part of his portfolio, he was the \none responsible for the repeal of the odious 1975 ``Zionism is Racism'' \nresolution that was passed in the United Nations.\n  At a time when the United Nations continues to be plagued by scandal \nand mismanagement, the United States needs a strong presence to reform \nthat body.\n  Just look at the scandals the UN is facing on oil-for-food, sexual \nabuse, theft, and sexual harassment:\n  We now know that Saddam Hussein, corrupt U.N. officials, and corrupt \nwell-connected countries were the real benefactors of the Oil-for-Food \nProgram.\n  They skimmed their illegal gain from illegal oil shipments, financial \ntransactions, kickbacks, and surcharges and allowed Saddam Hussein to \nbuild up his armed forces and live in the lap of luxury while his \npeople starved.\n  There have been allegations of sexual abuse in peacekeeping \noperations by U.N. personnel going back at least ten years, most \nrecently in the Congo where 150 allegations of rape, pedophilia, and \nprostitution are being investigated.\n  The theft of $3.8 million by an employee of the World Meteorological \nOrganization led to the revelation that Mohammed Hassan apparently \ncashed an undetermined number of checks for his own enrichment, but his \ncolleagues chose not to speak out.\n  There was a recent whitewash by the Secretary General of sexual \nharassment by two senior U.N. officials, the High Commissioner for \nRefugees and the United Nation's top oversight official.\n  This list of current scandals does not even begin to touch on broader \nissues such as the proper role of the United Nations and the need for \nfiscal responsibility and austerity. There has been a 42 percent \nincrease in the U.N. regular budget over the past 10 years. The United \nNations is supposed to have a zero nominal growth budget.\n  Those funds support programs with questionable value. We are all \npainfully aware that the United Nations has a Commission on Human \nRights which includes notorious human rights abusers such as Sudan, \nChina, Cuba, Saudi Arabia, and Zimbabwe.\n  The United Nations is imploding under the weight of its own scandals. \nAnd these scandals are helping to unveil the cronyism that is corroding \nthe U.N. system. The U.N. is in desperate need of reform--and in \ndesperate need of a reformer like John Bolton. Perhaps most \nimportantly, John Bolton is a strong believer in sovereignty.\n  The principle of state sovereignty is what undergirds the entire \ninternational system.\n  Yet today we see respect for state sovereignty eroding all around us. \nWe see it in the International Criminal Court's claim of authority to \ntry the citizens of countries that have not consented to ICC \njurisdiction. We see it in the U.N. false claim to have sole authority \nto permit the use of force.\n  These trends are dangerous, not only because the erosion of \nsovereignty is a threat to freedom, but because the erosion of respect \nfor state sovereignty absolves states of their sovereign \nresponsibilities to deal with problems within their borders.\n  It gives states an excuse to punt problems to supra-national bodies, \nlike the UN and the ICC, instead of taking responsibility for problems \nthat originate within their border from poor national governance. In \nthe war on terror, every state needs to meet its sovereign \nresponsibilities. As sovereignty has eroded, terrorists have taken \nadvantage of these trends. John Bolton has the fortitude to stand up \nfor what is right, fight the good fight, and prevail.\n  Secretary Rice called John Bolton a tough-minded diplomat. That's \nexactly what the U.S. needs at the U.N.---and exactly what the U.N. \nneeds from the U.S.\n  Let me conclude by reinforcing why this body should support John \nBolton's nomination. The U.S. does not need a U.N. representative for \nthe world. We need a U.S. representative to the world. We need someone \nwho has the interests of our country first and foremost in his mind as \nhe represents us at the U.N.\n  There are many anti-U.S. forces at the U.N. Appeasement has never \nworked in dealing with aggressors. And it will not work for our country \nat the U.N.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I say to my friend, the junior Senator \nfrom Nevada, he is right on target as he always is. The Senator is \nright: The policy of appeasement is what we have been watching for a \nlong time. I have often said an appeaser is a guy who feeds his friends \nto the alligators hoping they eat him last.\n  Hiram Mann said:\n\n     No man survives when freedom fails,\n     The best men rot in filthy jails,\n     And those who cry appease, appease\n     Are hanged by those they tried to please.\n\n  John Bolton is not that appeaser. I am so much in support of this \nman. I have been listening to the criticisms, and I cannot figure who \nthey are talking about. My feelings about John Bolton can be summed up \nby the former Governor of Massachusetts, William Weld. He is not \nsomeone I very often quote, very often agree with, but William Weld \nsaid:\n\n       He's strong medicine, all right, but sometimes strong \n     medicine is needed, such as it is at the United Nations \n     today.\n\n  I think he is actually very correct in that. My colleagues know I \nhave many concerns about the United Nations and about Kofi Annan. I \nhave been quite outspoken and a critic of his and the United Nations in \ngeneral. It seems every day we hear new reasons to express outrage \nabout the performance of the United Nations.\n  There are clearly abundant problems in the United Nations, \nparticularly related to the Iraqi Oil for Food Program. We are not \ntalking about thousands of dollars; we are talking about millions of \ndollars. We are talking about dollars with ties to the actual family of \nKofi Annan.\n  Do not get me wrong, the United Nations should be a tremendous force \nfor good in the world by providing a place for countries to cooperate \nand pursue and achieve the original missions of the U.N. founders: to \npromote freedom, peace, respect for human rights.\n  Unfortunately, it has been a disaster. I have grave concerns about \nthe means that have been employed, reportedly, to achieve those ends.\n  The U.N. peacekeeping missions have been questionable. In addition, \nthese operations rely heavily on the use of U.S. troops and funding in \na way that threatens our military readiness and unfairly taxes our \nresources.\n  Other serious concerns are questions about the focus of the United \nNations on its inefficient structure and massive bureaucracy which \nwastes American taxpayer dollars. This is significant because the \nUnited Nations operates by collection of assessments and dues. Each \nmember of the United Nations is required to pay a certain percentage of \nthe organization's budget based on their size and based on their \nability to pay. I never quite understood the formula.\n\n[[Page S5954]]\n\n  Since January of 2001, the United States was assessed 22 percent of \nthe regular budget of the United Nations even though all nations, \nregardless of size, get the same vote in the General Assembly. This \nleads to the situation where the United States is forced to both \nsubsidize the United Nations and go along with many of the decisions \nthat are against our national interests.\n  As Americans, we should have no problem leading the way on the global \nstage on issues of peace, human dignity, and liberty, but the U.N.'s \naction in recent years has made it clear that the organization has lost \nits moorings. Unless things change for the better, we will want to \nreevaluate our support.\n  In addition to financial matters, there are several other areas in \nwhich the U.N. has shown itself to be badly in need of reform. I \nmentioned the oil-for-food scandal. We know about that. That has \nreceived a lot of attention--not enough but a lot of attention.\n  One of the elements of the oil-for-food scandal has not gotten as \nmuch attention, and that is what Saddam Hussein's regime was doing with \nthe money they got by skimming from oil contracts negotiated under the \nprogram. As we learned from Charles Duelfer's Iraqi Survey Group \nreport:\n\n       The ISG has been investigating Iraq's procurement process, \n     sources of finance, the involvement of foreign firms, and the \n     specific types of goods that were sought, Iraq utilized a \n     complex and well developed procurement system hidden by an \n     effective denial and deception strategy. By the late 1990s, \n     Iraq, in contravention of U.N. sanctions, pursued the \n     procurement of military goods and technical expertise for \n     military capabilities . . .\n       . . . Money also was obtained from kickback payments made \n     on contracts set up through the U.N.'s Oil for Food Program. \n     Iraq derived several billion dollars between 1999 and 2003 \n     from oil smuggling and kickbacks. One senior regime official \n     estimated Iraq earned $4 billion from illicit oil sales from \n     1999 to 2002. By levying a surcharge on Oil for Food \n     contracts, Iraq earned billions more during the same period.\n       . . . this was revenue outside U.N. control and provided \n     resources the regime could spend without restriction . . .\n       . . . Iraq imported banned military weapons, technology, \n     and dual-use goods through Oil for Food contracts. Companies \n     in several countries were involved in these efforts. Direct \n     roles by government officials are also clearly established.\n\n  If this is the kind of program the U.N. runs, I don't know how anyone \ncan get away with saying it does not need serious reform.\n  Another outrageous abuse of U.N. authority took place in the Democrat \nRepublic of Congo. The U.N.'s own watchdog department, the Office of \nInternal Oversight Services, investigated alleged abuse by the U.N. \npeacekeeping forces in the northeastern Congolese town of Bunia and \nfound a pattern of sexual exploitation of women and children which it \nsaid was continuing at the time of the report. U.N. peacekeepers \nworking in the Democrat Republic of Congo sexually abused girls as \nyoung as 13. I have been to both Congos many time, and I have watched \nthese things going on.\n  The other day I was in the Congo and I saw a fleet of cars, about 400 \ncars. I asked what they were. They had the U.N. symbol. They were cars \nthat were going to take the peacekeeping people to remote areas of \nAfrica.\n  I suggest for the reading of anyone who is interested in that part of \nthe country, ``King Leopold's Ghost.'' It tells what has happened in \nthat country. I cannot help but believe that many of these U.N. \npeacekeepers are continuing to abuse these people, as we have seen in \nthe past.\n  I have spoken many times on this floor about the redundant and \ncounterproductive bureaucracy that has been built up, layer upon layer, \nproviding cushy jobs with no accountability and little, if any, \ntransparency. And I have also noted in the past the exorbitant cost of \nthe renovation of the U.N. headquarters, for which American taxpayers \nare again footing the bill, we think. These issues, and others like \nthem, remain unresolved and will continue to undermine the U.N.'s \nlegitimacy around the world.\n  There are so many things we hear about over and over again, about the \nabuse of power of these peacekeepers going in, but I would like to \nshare with you a personal experience. About 3 weeks ago, I was in \nUganda, and in northern Uganda, on the southern Sudan border, there is \na terrorist group there that has been operating for 30 years, with the \nsame individual. They will go in and raid these camps, take these kids \nout--I am talking about 12-year-old kids--and arm them with guns, teach \nthem to fight, and then send them back home to murder their parents. \nAnd if they don't do it, they cut their hands off.\n  Now, this is going on today. I saw it. I was there. Where is the \nUnited Nations? They are not there. They are not doing anything. I \noften wonder what they are doing. But something has to happen to change \nall of that.\n  That is where this nominee comes in. After reviewing John Bolton's \ncredentials, I cannot tell you how strongly I endorse him. He has \nserved as Under Secretary of State, is extremely qualified to hold the \nposition of ambassador to the United Nations, and has an impressive \nrecord as an accomplished lawyer, diplomat, and scholar.\n  My colleagues have extolled Mr. Bolton's successes as a reformer in \nthis Chamber before. He has a reputation of toughness, reliability, \nhonor, and, yes, tenacity. Because of these very reasons, I believe Mr. \nBolton will be extremely effective in this position and will best \nrepresent President Bush and the United States at the United Nations.\n  I have often watched the United Nations and have wondered sometimes, \nwho is on our side? I can assure you, with John Bolton there, you are \ngoing to have someone on our side.\n  We have already spent a great deal of time discussing the Democrats' \nobstructionism this week, so I will only say a few words about that \nnow. The various political ploys used to hold up Mr. Bolton's \nnomination were frustrating and ridiculous, and were based on nothing \nmore than personal dislike, attacks on this administration's policy, \nand a misguided and irresponsible vision for the United Nations.\n  Now, I have heard criticism that John Bolton should not be confirmed \nbecause he has opposed the U.N. activities and he has said negative \nthings about the United Nations. That is all the more reason we should \nconfirm him in this position. I often think how they say: Well, he \ndoesn't like the United Nations. Why should we send him as our \nrepresentative? That is exactly the kind of person who needs to be \nthere to effect some changes. It is like saying, if you have a prison, \nthat you need to have a convict running the prison. No, you do not. You \nneed to have somebody who is wanting to come up with some reforms. So \nwe need somebody who will reform the mess that is up there.\n  There are a lot of us who have said for a long period of time that we \nought to just get out, just give up, that the United Nations is not \nlooking after our best interests. I think with John Bolton there that \nwill change. He has a proven record of success. He will do a great job. \nIt is broke. He can fix it. We need to confirm his nomination.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I wish to join my colleague from Oklahoma \nand other colleagues who have risen today to support the nomination of \nJohn Bolton to be our U.N. ambassador.\n  The United Nations is a unique institution, obviously. It is an \ninstitution which has gone through its good times and some bad times. \nMany of us, on our side of the aisle especially, have been critical of \nthe United Nations over the years for different activities, whether \nthey have been policy driven or, in some cases, just the operations \naspects of the United Nations. But I think, at least for my part, I \nagree that it is an extremely important institution, that it represents \nan attempt by the community of nations across the world to find a forum \nwhere they can interact and, hopefully, reach conclusions which are \nconstructive to mankind generally and especially address issues which \ncannot and should not be addressed by nation states individually, such \nas issues involving large expansions of disease, issues involving the \ntreatment of children around the world, issues involving the questions \nof war.\n  It is important we have a forum where nations can come together and \ntry to work together and, if they disagree, at least have the \ndisagreements be more transparent and, therefore, the ability, \nhopefully, to reach agreements, and at least have the capacity to \ntemper those disagreements, which is more probable of occurring as a \nresult of transparency.\n\n[[Page S5955]]\n\n  It is an institution which, by its very nature, is going to have \ndifficulty reaching consensus and moving forward on extremely complex \nissues and issues which are intensely felt because of the fact that it \nrepresents such a diverse collection of the world, almost the entire \nworld, for all intents and purposes, nation states which all have \ndifferent purposes and interests.\n  But it is a very important forum, and it is something that we, as a \ncountry, clearly were one of the originators of in San Francisco after \nthe war. It actually is the outgrowth of Woodrow Wilson's concepts with \nthe League of Nations. We have helped it evolve and grow, and we have \nbasically underwritten it. The American taxpayers, for better or worse, \npay approximately 25 percent of all the costs the U.N. incurs, whether \nthey are operational costs or peacekeeping costs. That number varies \nbetween those two accounts, but the number is very significant.\n  I used to chair the appropriating committee which had jurisdiction \nover those funds, and it was frustrating at times to send the money \nbecause I felt their actions in a number of areas, to be kind, maybe \ninvolved a bit of mismanagement, to be kind, and in other areas were \njust misguided but were part of the whole.\n  As a participating member state, we have an obligation to support the \ninstitution and to try to correct it from within. How do you correct it \nfrom within? I think this administration has made a very aggressive \neffort to try to make the U.N. more accountable, first in the area of \noperations, in the area of just the basic management of the \ninstitution, reducing the amount of patronage, reducing the amount of \nmisallocation of funds. This administration has focused aggressively on \nthat. And secondly, this administration has made a very aggressive \neffort in the area of initiating policy, policy which may impact how we \ndeal with AIDS in Africa, how we deal with the health care problems \nacross the world, and the pandemics that are coming at us, regrettably, \nand how we deal, obviously, with peacekeeping initiatives in a variety \nof different pressure points around the world, especially in the Middle \nEast and in Africa and, of course, in the Balkans to some degree.\n  So we have, as a Government--and this Government specifically, the \nGovernment under President George Bush--aggressively pursued policies \nto try to focus the U.N. on trying to be a better managed place and \nbeing an institution which better, more effectively reflects policies \nof democracy and liberty. That has been our basic theme in trying to \nwork within the U.N. structure.\n  John Bolton brings to the table the expertise necessary to continue \nthat initiative. He may be rough around the edges on occasion. There is \nno question about that. But there is also nothing wrong with that. If \nbeing rough around the edges on occasion is a detriment, a personality \ntrait which people should not have, then I guess there are a lot of us \nhere who should not be in the Senate.\n  The fact is, you have to be aggressive and you have to be willing to \nassert your view and the views that you are projecting as a \nrepresentative of this country if you are going to be effective in \nmaking a case for this Nation. John Bolton will accomplish that in the \nU.N., in my opinion. In fact, it is his type of personality in the \nsense of his willingness to aggressively advocate a position which is \nconsistent with our promotion, as a nation, of liberty, democracy, and \nhonesty within the management of the U.N. ``Honesty'' may be too strong \na word, but at least more efficiency within the management of the U.N. \nThat will be the greatest strength that he brings to the table there. \nPeople will understand clearly where America is coming from, and it is \nimportant they understand that. And the American taxpayer will know \nthat we, within the hallways of the U.N., will have someone who is \ngoing to advocate for efficient and effective use of those tax dollars \nwe are sending there. That is our right, I believe, as taxpayers, to \nask for that type of leadership within the U.N.\n\n  So John Bolton, in my opinion, with his broad expertise in foreign \npolicy and with his commitment to promoting this administration's \ncommitment to the promotion of liberty and the promotion of democracy \nacross the globe, and to fighting terrorism, is the right person for \nthis job. I regret he has been held up. And it appears Members of the \nother side intend to try to filibuster his appointment.\n  A President should have, just as a matter of policy, a person in the \nposition at the U.N. who is of his choosing. This is the right of a \nPresident, to send a person to the U.N. who the President feels most \neffectively will advocate the policies of the administration because it \nis, after all, the President who has the primary responsibility of \npromoting foreign policy within our Government structure. It is not the \nresponsibility of the Congress, although there are a lot of folks in \nthis body who appear to think they are Secretary of State. The fact is, \nthe Constitution does not provide that portfolio to the Congress, it \nprovides it to the President and the President's appointees to Cabinet-\nlevel positions, which the U.N. ambassador position represents.\n  So it seems highly inappropriate that we should be holding up his \nnomination unless someone can show definitively that he does not have \nthe personal integrity or the personal honesty to serve in the \nposition. If individuals disagree with his ability or his capacity to \ncarry out the job, that is not really our call, unless that \ndisagreement is a function of honesty, integrity relative to the \nindividual's qualifications, because in this instance it is the \nPresident's right to pick the individual he thinks can carry out the \njob most effectively, and the President has picked John Bolton.\n  I have not heard anything from anybody that calls into question John \nBolton's integrity or honesty. I heard a lot of people who expressed \nfrustration about maybe how he manages individuals, but that clearly is \nnot the criteria for rejecting a nominee to a Cabinet-level position. \nIf it were, there would have been a lot of nominees rejected under \nevery President who has ever nominated individuals because all of us \nhave warts, and many of those people who have been nominated to Cabinet \npositions clearly had a number of warts.\n  So I do think it is inappropriate to pursue a filibuster in this \ninstance. To have a policy disagreement with the President as to the \nway he approaches the U.N., that may be appropriate. That policy \ndisagreement can be debated, but it should not ensue or lead logically \nto a filibuster of an individual who has a nomination to the position \nbecause it is, after all, the President's right to choose individuals \nto serve at his Cabinet-level positions. Those individuals should be \nconfirmed in a timely manner so that the President has the capacity to \npursue foreign policy initiatives and the leadership of this Nation on \nthe issues of foreign policy with a full complement, a full team of \nindividuals to support his initiatives.\n  I do hope we will move forward to a final vote on Mr. Bolton this \nafternoon. People who feel he is the wrong choice--and they may have \npolicy differences with the President on how we are pursuing liberty \nand democracy across the globe--can vote against him on that basis, but \nat least give him a vote, and give him a vote promptly.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the nomination of John \nBolton to be the U.S. Representative to the United Nations.\n  Let me begin, briefly, by stating what this nomination and debate is \nnot about. It is not about reform at the United Nations. There is not a \nsingle Member of this body who I know of who does not agree with the \nnotion that we ought to be doing everything we can to make the United \nNations a stronger institution, a more meaningful one, in today's \nworld, where more direct actions can be taken where problems exist \naround the world to make it more efficient, to function better. All of \nus agree with that, and all of us agree that whoever assumes this \nposition as ambassador from the United States to the U.N. ought to play \na critical role in that effort. That is not in question here. That is \nnot a matter of debate.\n  What is also not a matter of debate is the style of the particular \nnominee in question. I think all of us in this city certainly respect \nthe fact that some people's style is a little more brusque than others, \ncan be a little more blunt\n\n[[Page S5956]]\n\nthan others. I do not know of anyone, certainly on this side of the \naisle--or that side, for that matter--who disagrees with a nominee \nbecause they do not particularly like their style, although they may \nhave been particularly rough on some employees. We may not applaud it. \nWe may not like it. We may think it is unwise and bad management style. \nBut almost nobody in this Chamber on either side has objections to this \nnominee solely because of the question of reform at the United Nations \nor whether Mr. Bolton's style is objectionable or not.\n  My objection to this nomination focuses on one single issue. Members \nwill have to decide for themselves whether they think this issue is of \nsuch importance that it would disqualify Mr. Bolton from the position \nhe has now been nominated to or allow him to go forward.\n  The facts are no longer in debate. It is often said in this Chamber, \nyou are entitled to your own opinion, but you are not entitled to your \nown facts. The facts are overwhelming in terms of the allegation that \nMr. Bolton, whatever his motivations may have been--and I suspect I \nknow what they were--decided that because he disagreed with some \nintelligence analysts, he wanted them removed from their jobs.\n  I have never objected, nor would I--in fact, I agree with my \ncolleague from Michigan who spoke so eloquently, that, in fact, there \nought to be more debate between policy centers and intelligence \nanalysts. What was missing during the debate on Iraq, as to the issue \nof weapons of mass destruction, was the absence of debate between \npolicymakers and intelligence analysts. None of us, that I know of, \ndisagree with the notion that there ought to be more debate. Where \npolicy setters disagree with intelligence analysis, they ought to \nexpress that objection and tell people they think it is wrong. But if \nyou go beyond just disagreeing, if you go beyond forceful debate, if \nyou reach down and decide you are going to remove or try to remove an \nintelligence analyst from their position because you don't like what \nthey are saying to you, that then crosses a line.\n  I don't care whether it is a Democratic administration or a \nRepublican one. If this body, by a vote of confirmation says to a \nperson who seeks the position of ambassador to the United Nations, that \neven though you have tried to fire intelligence analysts because you \ndisagreed with their analysis, then I think we send a dreadful signal \nat the very time in the world that our credibility on intelligence is \nin question.\n  We all know that to be the case, regrettably. We have been through a \ndreadful period where intelligence was very wrong in assuming there \nwere weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. So the issue for this Senator \nis, did Mr. Bolton do this or not? And if he did, why are we even \nconsidering this nomination? Because anyone, regardless of the \nadministration, their political persuasion or ideology, who tries to \nfire people, not debate, not disagree with them, not reprimand some \nhigher official because he disagrees with what they are saying, but to \nreach down and fire an analyst at the CIA or the Department of State \nbecause you don't like what they were telling you, in my view, crosses \na line.\n  This body has an obligation to the American public to stand up and \nsay: We will not tolerate that.\n  This is far more important than Mr. Bolton. It is far more important \neven than this President or this Congress.\n  The issue goes far beyond any individuals. It goes to the heart of \nwhether we are going to have credible intelligence which we, as Members \nof Congress, can believe, and our allies around the world, and from \nthose we seek to find support on various foreign policies who will \nunderstand the purposes for which we are seeking their support. That is \nwhat I worry about more than anything else.\n  Yesterday I spoke on the floor about the availability of information. \nThe reason I had requested, and that we have an expedited version of a \ncloture motion, doesn't have to do with whether or not Mr. Bolton \nshould have an up or down vote. I want to have an up or down vote on \nMr. Bolton. But I also believe this body has a right to information.\n  When the chairman of the Intelligence Committee and the vice chairman \nof the Intelligence Committee are deprived the opportunity to read the \nnames on the intelligence intercepts, the names Mr. Bolton could see, \nthat his staff could see, but that the chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee and the ranking member, the chairman and ranking member of \nthe Foreign Relations Committee are deprived the opportunity to see, \nthen we are not getting the information we ought to have in order to \nmake an intelligent decision.\n\n  The only vehicle I have available to me is to say, I am going to \ninsist upon a 60-vote criteria unless you give us the information. It \nis 11:20. I am still waiting. There is no reason for us to have to have \na cloture vote this afternoon. Instead, we can have a simple up-or-down \nvote on Mr. Bolton at 6 o'clock tonight, if in the next hour or two the \nadministration would release those names to the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Intelligence Committee, and the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Foreign Relations Committee, and the information Senator \nBiden is seeking regarding the matter of the supposed weapons of mass \ndestruction in Syria. There are not a lot of documents. It wouldn't \ntake much time. But if we can't get those documents, if we are not \nbeing allowed to see the very things the nominee had a right to see, \nthen I don't think we are being treated as a coequal branch of \nGovernment that has a right, through the appropriate means, with the \nappropriate members. I am not suggesting every member of the committees \nshould see these names, but that the appropriate people we have \ndesignated historically have access to that kind of information for a \nnomination such as the one before us.\n  I am still hopeful that will happen. I am not so naive as to be \nunaware of what we have just been through in the debate about \nfilibusters on Federal judges. I would not have brought up this \nnomination right now in the wake of that. I thought we were going to \ndeal with Federal judges, not the nominee to the United Nations. But \nthe majority, as is its right, sets the agenda. They have asked this \nCongress, this Senate to debate the issue of Mr. Bolton.\n  I am put in the position of saying: I guess after all of this you can \ndo what you want and deny us that information. I would hope some of my \nRepublican friends, despite the fact they are going to vote for Mr. \nBolton, would vote with us on the cloture motion. I took some interest \nin the fact that even on the House Republican side, the difficulty that \nmajor committees of the Congress, both the House and the Senate, are \nhaving in getting information from this administration is growing. If \nwe don't at some point stand up for our rights as a constitutionally \ndesignated coequal branch of Government, then this administration will \nreceive the message that we don't care about this and that we can deny \nthis Congress anything we want and they will do nothing about it.\n  So aside from how you feel about Mr. Bolton, yes or no, it is \nimportant for this institution to stand up for its rights and to demand \nthis information as we have a right to.\n  I am hopeful we can still get the information and not have to go \nthrough a cloture vote at 6 o'clock this evening.\n  Let me get back to the subject matter of Mr. Bolton himself. The \nreasons for my concern are primarily focused on one issue. That is, of \ncourse, whether Mr. Bolton tried to fire people within the CIA and the \nState Department because he did not like the analysis they were giving \nhim.\n  What is extraordinary about this nomination, first and foremost, is \nthe number of people on whom we have relied, considering their status, \nwho oppose this nomination. I would like to read the names. I am not \nsuggesting all of these people are opposed to Mr. Bolton, but the basis \nupon which we have determined that Mr. Bolton tried to fire two \nintelligence analysts relied primarily on the names on this particular \nchart. I want to read the names and the positions they hold. It was \nthese individuals, more than anything else, who made a significant \ndifference in our conclusions that Mr. Bolton had, in fact, tried to \nfire these individuals.\n  John McLaughlin was the Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence \nAgency.\n\n[[Page S5957]]\n\n  These individuals are either presently members of the Bush \nadministration, this President, or were formerly members of the Bush \nadministration.\n  Larry Wilkerson was chief of staff to Secretary Colin Powell; Robert \nHutchings, Chairman of the National Intelligence Council. The dates of \ntheir service are here. They are all dates that run roughly 2002, 2003, \nup to the present time, or just a month or so ago.\n  Stuart Cohen, Acting Chairman of the National Intelligence Council; \nAlan Foley, head of the CIA's Office of Weapons, Intelligence, \nNonproliferation, and Arms Control; Jamie Miscik, Deputy Director of \nIntelligence at the CIA; Thomas Hubbard, United States Ambassador to \nSouth Korea, a Bush appointee; John Wolf, Assistant Secretary of State \nfor Nonproliferation; Tom Fingar, Assistant Secretary of State for \nIntelligence and Research; Christian Westermann, analyst for the State \nDepartment's Bureau of Intelligence and Research; Neil Silver, Office \nDirector, Bureau of Intelligence and Research; INR supervisor, we don't \nuse his name here, the immediate supervisor of Mr. Westermann; Fred \nFleitz, acting chief of staff of John Bolton; Wil Taft, Department of \nState legal advisor; and a Department of State attorney whose name we \nare not using as well in the office of legal advisor.\n  These are 15 individuals either presently serving in the Bush \nadministration or having previously served. It is on them that we \nrelied. It is their damning statements that confirm without any \nquestion that Mr. Bolton essentially tried to have these intelligence \nanalysts fired. They also provided other damaging information.\n  I have been a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for 24 \nyears. Those who have served with me know it is rare, indeed, for this \nmember to get up and object to a Presidential nomination, particularly \none that is not a lifetime appointment. In fact, as my colleagues who \nhave served with me for some time know, I have been one of only a \nhandful who have supported nominees of Republican administrations. I \nwas one of two Democrats who supported John Tower when he was nominated \nto be Secretary of Defense under President Bush's father. I supported \nJohn Ashcroft in the first administration of the current President \nBush, one of only a handful of Democrats who did that.\n  I tried to recall an instance when I have taken such a strong \nobjection to another nominee in 24 years. I can't recall one that has \ngone this far. I have had my objections to others, but they usually \ndidn't reach this particular point. So it is uncomfortable for me to \ncome to the floor to engage, over almost the last 2 months, in this \nnomination. But when you add the names of 102 former ambassadors, 15 \npresent or former members of the Bush administration, these are not \nDemocrats, these are not some left-wing organizations that are out \nthere objecting to John Bolton. These are serious people who do a \nserious job, many of them career officials who have served our country \nwith great distinction over the years. These individuals are the ones \non whom we relied to draw their conclusion.\n  I am going to share with my colleagues their statements, not mine, \nnot the names of some Democrats who might have some political \nmotivation but, rather, people who care about our country, care about \nthe United Nations, believe it needs reform, believe we need a strong \nperson there to engage in that kind of reform, but believe John Bolton \nis not the person who ought to be receiving the nomination.\n  The committee did an extensive review of all the allegations related \nto this nominee. Committee staff, on a bipartisan basis, conducted more \nthan 30 interviews of individuals with knowledge of the nominee. There \nwas excellent cooperation on the part of most of those staff we sought \nto interview. I believe the work of this Senate has been assisted by \nthese individuals who courageously came forward to answer questions and \nprovide information that in many cases they would rather not have done. \nThese individuals did not want to speak ill of another Republican or a \nformer colleague. But they acted as dutiful citizens, patriots, and \ncooperated with the committee's efforts to fully explore matters \nrelated to the nomination of John Bolton. Regardless of how this Senate \ndisposes of this nomination, these individuals have done a service to \nour country. We should honor them for doing so, for having the courage \nto come forward and to be honest when asked questions about this \nnominee.\n  Mr. Bolton's behavior clearly troubled a number of people who have \nworked directly with him over the last number of years.\n  Former Assistant Secretary of State Carl Ford, a self-proclaimed \nconservative Republican, described Mr. Bolton as ``the quintessential \nkiss-up, kick-down sort of guy.'' He also labeled Mr. Bolton a ``serial \nabuser.''\n  We did not hear from any people disabusing the committee of that \nview. That he has an abusive management style is problematic, but as I \nsaid at the outset, that would not be justification for voting against \nMr. Bolton to be the ambassador to the United Nations. This is not \nabout style. It is not about reform of the U.N. It is about whether \nthis individual tried to fire intelligence analysts in his position as \nUnder Secretary of State.\n  However, when Mr. Bolton harnesses that management style of his, as \nhe has over the last 4 years, to affect intelligence judgments or to \nstifle the consideration of alternative policy opinions, then I think \nhe has crossed the line over what is acceptable behavior. Why? Because \nthose actions go directly to the heart of the integrity of U.S. \nintelligence and the firewall that must exist between policy and \nintelligence to ensure the integrity of that intelligence. Again, I \nemphasize, this is not about a disagreement. It is not about a \npolicymaker disagreeing with an intelligence analyst.\n  Intelligence analysts do not speak ex cathedra. They are not sitting \nthere coming to conclusions that we ought not to question. That is \nlegitimate. In fact, we need more questioning. The issue is whether one \nought to go beyond questioning and decide to remove someone because you \ndisagree with their conclusions.\n  When this committee convened last month to consider the matter, we \nhad irrefutable evidence--this is not conjecture--and this body has to \ndecide whether you are going to send this man forward in the face of \nirrefutable evidence that on 5 different occasions over the past 48 \nmonths, Mr. Bolton tried to have 2 intelligence analysts removed from \ntheir jobs--one at the State Department and one at the CIA--because \nthese individuals would not clear the language Mr. Bolton wanted to \nuse, which was not supported by available intelligence.\n  I emphasize another point that needs to be made. When Mr. Bolton \nspeaks as John Bolton, he can say whatever he wants. But when he gets \nup and says, ``I am speaking on behalf of the United States,'' then \nthere is a different standard. When you speak on behalf of our country, \nyou cannot just say anything you want. You have to rely on the best \nintelligence we have. You may disagree with that and you can fight over \nit, but in the final analysis you cannot offer your own opinions when \nyou are expressing them as the U.S. views. You can say John Bolton \nbelieves this. If Mr. Bolton wants to speak to the Heritage Foundation \nand say, ``I believe the following,'' I may think he is profoundly \nwrong, but I would fight with my life for John Bolton to be able to say \nit. That is first amendment rights.\n  It is when Mr. Bolton gets up and says, ``I am speaking on behalf of \nthe United States of America and I want to say the following,'' and \nthen he absolutely contradicts what is being concluded by the \nintelligence analysts here, at that point, it seems to me he has a \nhigher responsibility than he has shown.\n  Carl Ford's testimony was a watershed for me. Never in my 24 years as \na Senator have I ever witnessed one high-ranking, former administration \nofficial testify as vociferously and as strongly as Mr. Ford did \nagainst a colleague. That is exactly what he did last month. Carl Ford \nmade it clear why he did so. He believed Mr. Bolton's actions caused a \nchill among his intelligence analysts--so much so that the Secretary of \nState, Colin Powell, had to buck up the employees to assure them that \nthey should not succumb to political pressure.\n  Because we have talked a lot about this, I used this chart in the \nForeign\n\n[[Page S5958]]\n\nRelations Committee. I realize from a distance it looks like a lot of \nspaghetti. What it amounts to is the chart of the positions of the \nState Department, beginning with the Secretary of State, Deputy \nSecretary of State, Chief of State, Executive Secretary, and the \nvarious Under Secretary positions here. The third one is Mr. Bolton, \nUnder Secretary for Arms Control and International Security Affairs. \nThat is his responsibility, this group right here. He was in charge of \nthe people who worked in this particular column.\n  Where did that intelligence analyst work? He worked down here. You \nhave to go way down to the Assistant Secretary for Intelligence and \nResearch, Carl Ford, who was head of the INR. This intelligence analyst \nwas down here; that is where Mr. Westermann worked. He was not directly \nin Mr. Bolton's line of command, but in a separate division. He is a \nGS-14 at this level.\n  You need to understand what happened here. This was a case where Mr. \nBolton doesn't get ahold of Mr. Ford and say: I have a problem with \nyour intelligence analyst because I disagree with what he said. I think \nhe is wrong and I want to argue about it.\n  Mr. Bolton reaches down out of his line and drags this guy up to his \noffice and begins to berate him for the job he has done. That is \nobjectionable to me, and outrageous. If it ended there, that is \ndreadful behavior and nobody ought to do that without clearing what you \nwant to say with the people who are responsible for that individual's \nwork. If it ended there, maybe I would just vote against the nominee \nand I would not make the case on that basis alone. It is what happens \nafterward. It is not just berating. There is no doubt that there would \nbe chill in the Department if an Under Secretary of State dragged an \nintelligence analyst to his office and word goes out. As we all know, \nin institutions the word flies around immediately. One of our fellow \nworkers has been dragged up to the Under Secretary's office and \nscreamed at because he didn't like his conclusions. That is why Colin \nPowell, the guy at the top, had to go down to these offices--down here \non the chart--and explain to them that they did the right thing. You, \nMr. Westermann, did the right thing. You are not supposed to succumb to \npolitical pressure. You tell people what they think they need to hear, \nand if they don't like it and disagree with you, that is one thing. But \nyou did the right thing. It was wrong by implication, because why would \nthe Secretary of State go down here and bring these analysts together \nand remind them that they had done their job if he felt Mr. Westermann \nbeing dragged up to Mr. Bolton's office was not wrong? That is why the \nSecretary of State did that. He went down there to tell those people \nnot to worry about this, do your jobs. I think the Secretary was \nworried that the word would go out to these analysts that if you don't \nwant to get in trouble, start to agree with Mr. Bolton when he \ndisagrees with you; that is the easy thing to do. If he tells the \nanalyst you ought to say the following, you better say that. If you do, \nyou won't be brought up to his office and bellowed at. That is \ndangerous and that is one of the reasons we have such concern about \nthis nomination.\n\n  As I said, this was the conclusion of Secretary Powell, according to \nMr. Wilkerson, his chief of staff. Mr. Wilkerson, who was the chief of \nstaff of Secretary Powell, testified before the staff of the Foreign \nRelations Committee the following: Secretary Powell ``went down into \nthe bowels of the building and talked to people about not being \ninhibited by, or in any way fearful of, people on the seventh floor, or \nleadership in general, questioning their analyses or their statements \nor whatever.''\n  Mr. Bolton had a very selective recollection about his interactions \nand intentions with respect to intelligence analysts at the State \nDepartment and the CIA during his appearance before the committee.\n  Mr. Bolton told the committee:\n\n       I didn't seek to have these people fired. I didn't seek to \n     have discipline imposed on them. I said, ``I've lost trust in \n     them.'' And are there other portfolios they could follow. It \n     wasn't anything to me that I followed at great length. I made \n     my point and moved on.\n\n  Committee staff interviews and review of State and CIA documents \npaint a very different picture indeed. What is that picture?\n  First, with respect to Mr. Westermann. Six months after this event I \nhave described on the chart with--this run-in occurred, Mr. Bolton was \nstill seeking to have Mr. Westermann removed from his job as the \nbiological weapons expert analyst at the Intelligence and Research \nDivision of the State Department.\n  Mr. Bolton's recollection about what he did with respect to the CIA \nanalyst was likewise clouded on April 11. As to the so-called ``Mr. \nSmith,'' as we called him to protect identity, Mr. Bolton said:\n\n       I had one part of one conversation with one person one time \n     on ``Mr. Smith,'' and that was it. I let it go.\n\n  We now know that much more than that occurred. Let me lay it out for \nyou.\n  In addition to a meeting with the Acting Chairman of the National \nIntelligence Council, we now know from e-mails that Mr. Bolton \nconsidered raising the matter directly with the Director of the CIA, \nGeorge Tenet. We know as well that he continued to conspire with former \nAssistant Secretary of State Otto Reich and his office for a period of \n4 months after he first ``lost confidence'' in ``Mr. Smith'' to have \nhim removed from his job.\n  Also under consideration by Mr. Reich and Bolton were other punitive \nmeasures--we know this now--such as denial of country clearance for Mr. \nSmith's official travel throughout Latin America, banning him from all \nmeetings held in their bureaus. And the ultimate act of pettiness--\nconsider revoking his State Department building pass.\n  I am not making this stuff up. He said he had ``one part of one \nconversation with one person one time, and I let it go.''\n  Hardly. The facts are overwhelming here regarding what he tried to do \nboth at the State Department and the CIA.\n  We have also learned that other intelligence analysts were having \ndifficulties with Mr. Bolton's office.\n  Jami Miscik, Deputy Director for Intelligence, 2002 to 2005, in the \nBush administration, told the committee staff that Mr. Bolton had a \nreputation for being difficult to deal with. She noted that \n``interaction between policymakers and the intelligence community \nusually goes more smoothly than it often did . . . in the cases with \nMr. Bolton . . . It is rare that . . . a single policymaker is known \nfor having . . . pretty regularly contentious kinds of issues in this \nregard.''\n  We know as well that expert intelligence officials disapproved of and \nresisted Mr. Bolton's efforts to ``cherry-pick'' intelligence for \nideological purposes.\n  Dean Hutchings, Chairman of the National Intelligence Council, 2003 \nto 2005, described the ``cherry-picking'' problem in the context of \nwhat Mr. Bolton wanted the Intelligence Committee to bless with respect \nto Syria's weapons of mass destruction capabilities:\n\n       Mr. Bolton took isolated facts and made much more of them \n     to build a case than I thought the intelligence warranted. It \n     was a sort of cherry picking of little factoids and little \n     isolated bits that were drawn out to present the starkest \n     possible case.\n\n  We also know that Deputy Secretary Armitage didn't trust Mr. Bolton's \njudgments when it came to making public speeches. We have heard this \nfrom others, such as George Voinovich, as well as Carl Levin, as well \nas Barbara Boxer and others, who have spoken on this matter.\n\n  Mr. Wilkerson, Secretary Powell's chief of staff, told the committee:\n\n       There were problems on a number of occasions with Under \n     Secretary Bolton's proposed remarks. . . . The Deputy, Mr. \n     Armitage, made a decision and communicated that decision to \n     me, that John Bolton would not give any testimony, nor would \n     he give any speech, that wasn't cleared first by Rich \n     Armitage.\n\n  With all of the other duties Deputy Secretary Armitage had in \nmanaging the Department in Secretary Powell's absence, he also felt he \nhad to babysit Mr. Bolton because the normal clearance procedures \nestablished by the Department didn't work with Mr. Bolton. Yet, this \nbody is now being asked to vote to send Mr. Bolton to New York, where \nhe will be unsupervised on a daily basis. Lord only knows the kind of \nproblems that can ensue with Mr. Bolton, given his past performance.\n  Individuals under Bolton's direct line of authority also took issue \nwith the\n\n[[Page S5959]]\n\nrigidity of his views. John Wolf, former Assistant Secretary of State \nfor Nonproliferation and a career diplomat, told committee staff that \nMr. Bolton ``tended to hold onto his own views strongly and . . . he \ntended not to be enthusiastic about alternative views. And he did not \nencourage us to provide our views to the Secretary.''\n  Again, I am not arguing about someone's style here. But when you have \n125 employees at the U.N. and the only things you want to hear are the \nthings you agree with, that is a management style that is dangerous for \na person who is going to work with all of the nations we have to build \nrelationships with in the U.N. We all do this as Senators. We know when \na staff member gets up and wants to tell us an alternative view, it is \nuncomfortable. We would like them to agree with us. We also know how \nvitally important it is as Senators that people in our offices who have \nthe willingness to stand up and know when they do, they are not going \nto be threatened with their jobs, or considered for removal because \nthey are telling us something we don't want to hear. We understand the \nvalue of that. Mr. Bolton doesn't. That is dangerous.\n  Mr. Wolf said:\n\n       Some of the officers within the nonproliferation bureau \n     complained that they felt undue pressure to conform to the \n     views of the Under Secretary, versus the views that they \n     thought they could support.\n\n  That is a dangerous statement, that we have somebody who is about to \ntake on a position who would make others feel they were unfit or are \nbeing pressured to conform their views.\n  All of these matters I have just mentioned cause me grave concern \nabout this nomination. But what troubled me the most were the \ndevastating comments made by Secretary Powell's chief of staff, Mr. \nWilkerson, an individual who on a day-to-day basis was in a position to \nknow what was going on in the Department and what foreign policy \nchallenges the Secretary of State was attempting to manage.\n  This is what he has to say about Mr. Bolton's single-minded \npreoccupation with sanctioning every Chinese entity he could find which \nmight have violated nonproliferation standards:\n\n       Are we actually stopping China's proliferation through \n     sanctions that was dangerous to our interests? Or are we \n     doing it, and ignoring problems that cry out for cures, \n     diplomatic? The one time I had a conversation with John about \n     this, I asked him, ``How do you go beyond sanctions, John? \n     War?'' Mr. Bolton replied, ``It is not my business.''\n\n  Mr. Wilkerson also explained to our committee staff why he believes \nMr. Bolton is ill suited for the U.N. position. I am quoting Mr. \nWilkerson, Secretary Powell's chief of staff. This is not some liberal \nleft-leaning Senator or Congressman or columnist talking about Mr. \nBolton. This is the former chief of staff of a Republican Secretary of \nState under George Bush--this President's administration:\n\n       One, I think he's a lousy leader. And there are 100 to 150 \n     people up there at the United Nations that have to be led; \n     they have to be led well, and they have to be led properly. \n     And I think, in that capacity, if he goes up there--\n\n  Speaking about Mr. Bolton--\n\n     you'll see the proof of the pudding in a year.\n       Second, I differ with a lot of people in Washington, as to \n     his brilliance. I didn't see it. I saw a man who counted \n     beans . . . had no willingness--and in many cases no capacity \n     to understand other things that were happening around those \n     beans. And that is just a recipe for problems at the United \n     Nations.\n\n  These are very serious conclusions from an individual who was a loyal \nand trusted member of Secretary Powell's team, and they go to the heart \nof whether Mr. Bolton has the capacity to carry out his duties at the \nUnited Nations. This is not about whether we like the nominee's views \non the United Nations, arms control, or Cuba. He is entitled to his \npersonal views about any of those matters, and he should not be \ndisqualified from any office because he has them. But for the interests \nof the United States to be served at the United Nations, there has to \nbe a balance between ideology and pragmatism.\n  The individual on the spot in New York will be called upon, from time \nto time, to strike that balance. He also must have the credibility to \nmake the best case for the United States before that international \nbody. These things are at the heart of effective diplomacy.\n  Ambassador Negroponte was able to strike that balance between \nideology and pragmatism and have the credibility to make the case of \nthe United States before the U. N. Security Council. Senator John \nDanforth, a former colleague, was able to do so as well.\n  Based on what we have learned about Mr. Bolton in recent days, I \nseriously doubt he is willing or able to strike that balance, and I now \nknow, given his penchant for stretching intelligence and pressuring \nanalysts, that his credibility will be challenged by other U.N. \nmembers.\n  Our colleagues brush aside this problem by saying Mr. Bolton will be \ngetting his instructions from Secretary Rice. Mr. President, that is \njust not realistic at all. Much of the guidance that is developed for \nour U.N. ambassadors is developed cooperatively between Washington and \nNew York. What gets said at the United Nations by a representative is, \nin large measure, shaped by our reporting from our mission in New York. \nI feel Mr. Bolton will be incapable of making the kind of judgments \nthat move the diplomatic process forward.\n  We all know these are difficult times. Our responsibilities in Iraq \nand Afghanistan are significant and costly. Other challenges to \ninternational peace and stability loom large on the horizon--Iran, \nNorth Korea, the Middle East. The humanitarian crises in Africa and \nAsia cry out for attention. The United States cannot solve these \nproblems all by ourselves. We know that. We need tremendous \ninternational assistance and cooperation to address them, and the \nlogical focal point for addressing that international support is the \nUnited Nations. It makes sense.\n  But international support will not be automatically forthcoming and \nwill require, as we all know, U.S. leadership at the U.N. to build the \ncase for such cooperation. That U.S. leadership must necessarily be \nembodied in the individual who serves as our ambassador to the United \nNations is obvious.\n  Based on what I know today about Mr. Bolton, I believe he is \nincapable of demonstrating that kind of leadership. The ambassador to \nthe United Nations is a very important position. The individual who \nassumes that position is necessarily the face of our country before the \nworld.\n  For all the reasons I have cited--Mr. Bolton's management style, his \nattack on the intelligence community, his tunnel vision, his lack of \ndiplomatic temperament--I do not believe he is our man to be the face \nat the United Nations.\n  But of all those reasons, I come back to the one I made at the \noutset. It is not about style, it is not about reform at the United \nNations, it is not about Mr. Bolton's views on a variety of subject \nmatters. Our colleagues have to make a decision. We now know, \ncategorically, without any question whatsoever, that this nominee tried \nto fire intelligence analysts at the Central Intelligence Agency and \nthe Department of State. That evidence comes from his own colleagues, \nfrom people with whom he has served, not from outside groups or members \nof this body.\n  The decision for our colleagues today is whether or not we promote \nsomeone who has done that and what message it sends to the analyst \ncommunity, what message it sends to our allies, and what message it \nsends to our adversaries, for that matter, around the globe. That this \nindividual who engaged in such reprehensible behavior, in my view, \nshould be given the position of U.N. ambassador to represent the United \nStates at this critical hour, I think is a massive mistake.\n  Again, I am still hopeful that in the remaining hours of this debate, \nthe administration will see fit to provide the additional information \nfor which we have asked for almost 2 months. I regret deeply having to \nask my colleagues to vote on a cloture motion. I have said, if cloture \nis invoked, we will vote immediately on Mr. Bolton. If it is not \ninvoked, it will layover, and we will continue to try to get the \ninformation.\n  I have no desire to filibuster this nomination. I do have a desire to \nsee the Senate stand up for its rights when it seeks information--\ninformation the nominee had access to but the chairmen and \nranking members of the Intelligence Committee and Foreign Relations \nCommittee were denied. That is a precedent we need not make with this \ndecision.\n\n[[Page S5960]]\n\n  My hope is our colleagues will support the opposition on the cloture \nmotion and, if we get a vote on Mr. Bolton today, we reject this \nnominee. There are many qualified, blunt, forceful people who can \nassume this job who embrace the President's view on foreign policy and \nwho will do a very good job at the United Nations. John Bolton is not \nthat individual.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DODD. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I commend the very able Senator from \nConnecticut both for his statement and for the letter that he and the \nranking member of the committee, Senator Biden, sent to a number of us \nabout the necessity of trying to get these materials which we have \nsought.\n  Clearly the Congress needs this information in order to do its job. \nThe position of the Senator from Connecticut on the cloture motion, as \nI understand it, is that we ought not to invoke cloture and move to a \nvote on Bolton until the material is provided. If the material is made \navailable and we are in a position to make judgments, then I take it we \ncan move forward in the normal course of the debate toward a final vote \non Bolton's nomination; is that correct?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, in response to my friend and colleague from \nMaryland, that is exactly the point.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That strikes me as an eminently reasonable position. It \nneeds to be made clear that there is material the executive branch is \nrefusing to make available to the Senate, and which we need in order to \nbe adequately informed in carrying out our responsibilities of advising \nand consenting on this nomination.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if I may respond to my colleague from \nMaryland, I was going to recite to him--because I think some of my \ncolleagues may think this Senator from Connecticut has raised this \nissue in the last 24 hours as a delaying tactic--I want to point out to \nmy colleagues the chronology which begins actually on April 11--\napproaching 2 months ago. Then there were subsequent requests on April \n14, April 22, April 29, May 4, May 18, as well as even as late, as of \ncourse, we all know, yesterday.\n  I want to make it clear that from very early on, we tried to get this \ninformation. I emphasize, again, these are names Mr. Bolton has seen, \nhis staff has seen, and we are not asking every Member see, only the \nranking members and the chairmen of the Intelligence Committee and the \nForeign Relations Committee, to let them know whether or not the names \ncoincide with the names of people we have run across in our examination \nof Mr. Bolton to be a nominee to the U.N.\n  The chairman of the Intelligence Committee will tell you they had an \ninterview with General Hayden and he showed them some documents. But in \nhis letter to our colleagues last evening, the chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee very honestly pointed out that the names of the \n19 individuals in the 10 intercepts he sought are redacted. The only \npertinent information is those names and the motivation Mr. Bolton had \nin seeking that information.\n  The heart of the request--even the Intelligence Committee chairman \ncannot see it. Yet Mr. Bolton could see it, his staff could see it. But \nthe chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee is not allowed to see \nit. Every Senator ought to be outraged about that. If we let them get \naway with it here, they will get away with it every single day \nhereafter. Either we stand up for our rights as a Senate, as a coequal \nbranch of Government, or we do not.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator from Connecticut yield?\n  Mr. DODD. Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It is not every single day hereafter for this \nadministration; it becomes a precedent for every administration. And I \nsuggest to all Members of the Senate that they may find themselves, \ndown the road at some point, seeking information they think is relevant \nand having it denied to them by the executive branch, citing the \nrefusal to provide the information in the Bolton case as a precedent \nfor the action they are taking.\n  Mr. DODD. Again, the Senator from Maryland is absolutely correct. \nThese issues come back and come around and the word spreads: You can \nget away with this. It is not just this administration. The Senator is \ncorrect. Future administrations will use this as an example of why they \ndo not have to comply with the request because previous Congresses \nallowed this information to be kept secret when Senate committees were \nseeking it.\n  Mr. President, may I inquire how much time I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The Senator has 19 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent that the remaining time I have be \ndivided between the Senator from Maryland and the Senator from \nMassachusetts. The Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. Reed, also asked for \ntime. I had 60 minutes, and want to give up some time.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. If I can make an inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. My understanding is the Senator from Arizona was going \nto be recognized during this timeframe for his remarks.\n  Mr. DODD. I have a little less than 20 minutes remaining. What I want \nto do is give the 20 minutes I have left to my colleagues to use. Mr. \nPresident, I make that request, that the time remaining be divided \nbetween the Senator from Maryland and the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nremaining time is divided between the Senator from Maryland and the \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. DODD. And Senator Reed from Rhode Island also seeks some of that \ntime. Just Senator Reed and Senator Kennedy. The Senator Maryland has \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, first, I commend the very able Senator \nfrom Connecticut not only for his statement on the floor, but the very \nreasoned and judicious way he has proceeded in considering this \nnomination.\n  I join with those who think the refusal to provide the information \nconstitutes a sufficient basis not to invoke cloture while we continue \nto press the administration to provide the information the Senate needs \nin order to do its job.\n  I spoke yesterday with the distinguished Ranking Member of the \ncommittee, Senator Biden, on the floor about this issue, and I have \ndone so again here today with my friend, the Senator from Connecticut. \nI strongly urge my colleagues to take that position because it is a \nvery important question of the role the Senate should play, and whether \nwe really are an independent branch of the Government that will act to \ncarry out our responsibilities.\n  Let me now address the substance of the Bolton nomination. In the 60 \nyears since the founding of the United Nations, a number of \nextraordinarily distinguished men and women have been chosen to \nrepresent us in that body as the U.S. ambassador: Warren Austin, Henry \nCabot Lodge, Jr., James Wadsworth, Adlai Stevenson, Arthur Goldberg, \nGeorge W. Ball, James Russell Wiggins, Charles Yost, George Bush, John \nScali, Daniel P. Moynihan, William Scranton, Andrew Young, Donald \nMcHenry, Jeane Kirkpatrick, Vernon Walters, Thomas Pickering, Edward \nJoseph Perkins, Madeleine Albright, Bill Richardson, Richard Holbrooke, \nJohn Negroponte, and John Danforth.\n  The fact that at least 17 of them, spanning 8 administrations--\nRepublican and Democratic--have been elevated to serve on the \nPresident's Cabinet demonstrates the critical importance in which this \nposition historically has been held.\n  The fact that we proudly remember so many of these names, after the \npassage of a number of years, underscores both the visibility of the \nU.N. ambassador and the statesmanship that the position requires. On a \ndaily basis, our ambassador to the U.N. speaks to the entire world on \nbehalf of the United States.\n  The comments our ambassador makes and the relationships he or she \ncultivates make the difference between a United States that is \nrespected as a leader in the world, setting an example of American \nvalues and principles, and a United States that is ignored and \nmisunderstood.\n\n[[Page S5961]]\n\n  In today's world, this difference affects the lives of millions at \nhome and abroad. The United Nations is not a tool to be used ``when it \nsuits our interest and when we can get others to go along,'' as Mr. \nBolton has suggested but is, rather, an essential and ongoing forum for \nthe advancement of U.S. foreign policy and the protection of U.S. \nnational security interests.\n  The U.N. makes decisions that affect war and peace. It helps to \ndetermine whether the United States will have international support and \nallies or will be forced to undertake difficult missions on its own in \nthe face of broad opposition across the globe. Skillful work at the \nU.N. enables us to have burden sharing, both in terms of the commitment \nof human resources and the commitment of financial sources.\n  The United Nations offers us an opportunity to make our case to the \nworld, to demonstrate international leadership, and to build \nmultilateral cooperation. As Secretary General Annan commented in a \nrecent speech, the U.N. ``is not just a building in Manhattan, or a \npiece of international machinery. It embodies a conviction on the part \nof people everywhere that we live on a small planet, and that our \nsafety, our prosperity, our rights--indeed, our freedoms--are \nindivisible.'' For this reason, our representatives at the United \nNations must be men and women of exceptional wisdom and credibility, \nwho can listen and persuade, whose counsel and leadership other nations \nwill seek and rely upon.\n  Despite the need for a U.N. ambassador who recognizes and can make \nthe most of the U.N.'s potential and promise, we have before us now a \nnominee to be our ambassador to the U.N., who over a number of years \nhas demonstrated outright hostility toward the United Nations as an \ninstitution and toward the fundamental legitimacy of international law. \nMr. Bolton has argued repeatedly that the United States has no legal \nobligation to pay its dues to the United Nations and that treaties are \nnothing more than ``political commitments''.\n  He called the Law of the Sea Treaty, which has been endorsed by our \nmilitary and submitted by President Bush as an urgent priority for \nSenate advice and consent, ``an illegitimate method of forcing \nfundamental policy changes on the United States outside the customary \npolitical process.'' He is quoted as saying:\n\n       It is a big mistake for us to grant any validity to \n     international law even when it may seem in our short term \n     interest to do so--because, over the long-term, the goal of \n     those who think that international law really means anything \n     are those who want to constrict the United States.\n\n  To send someone as our ambassador to the United Nations who does not \ndemonstrate a basic respect for the institution and its legal \nfoundations is a disservice to our national interests. This has nothing \nto do with whether reforms are needed at the U.N. or whether we should \nmore closely monitor its activities. Many of us are committed to doing \nboth of those things. It is a very basic question of one's mindset \nabout the United States, about the United Nations and about \ninternational law. If other nations believe that the U.S. is not out to \nreform the United Nations but to undercut it, then they are likely not \nto be receptive to any of our criticisms or recommendations.\n  Secondly, it is clear that Mr. Bolton does not have the diplomatic \nskills or, indeed, the demeanor to represent our country effectively at \nthe U.N. There are certainly moments when the situation may call for \nbluntness, when abandoning diplomatic niceties can convey the urgency \nof a particular issue or position. However, Mr. Bolton has shown a \npropensity for making extreme and provocative statements that have \ncaused unnecessary conflict and confrontation. It is not an occasional \noutburst that might, on occasion, be justified by the situation but, \nregrettably, a routine way of doing business.\n  Does it help us in trying to shape the direction in which the U.N. is \nto move when Mr. Bolton says that the Security Council should have one \npermanent member, the United States, ``because that is the real \nreflection of the distribution of power in the world''?\n  Does anyone think that Mr. Bolton's assertion that ``if the U.N. \nSecretariat building in New York lost 10 stories, it wouldn't make a \nbit of difference'' will help us in persuading other countries to \nsupport U.N. reform efforts?\n  These are not isolated misstatements or slips of the tongue but, \nrather, his customary and consistent approach to dealing with others \nwho disagree with him. Even given the opportunity to demonstrate a less \nconfrontational approach, he has repeatedly declined to do so. Mr. \nBolton, time and again, has shown himself singularly lacking in the \nwillingness to hear, to consider, and to respect opposing points of \nview.\n  Contrast that attitude with these comments made by Ambassador \nMoynihan and Ambassador Kirkpatrick when they were nominated for this \nposition. Ambassador Moynihan, in his confirmation hearing before the \ncommittee, said:\n\n       A certain principled statement of views on both sides can \n     be useful: it requires that we respect what others think and \n     try to understand what they think and ask that they do the \n     same in return. . . . Things where we disagree are marginal \n     compared with where we do agree. And yet it is so easy to \n     grow estranged at the first problem, the first question is \n     how to get away from a confrontation system back to the quest \n     for understanding and agreement in a situation where this is \n     wholly possible and entirely necessary.\n\n  Similarly, Ambassador Kirkpatrick, in her confirmation hearing before \nthe committee, said:\n\n       I do not think that one should ever seek confrontation. \n     What I have every intention and hope of doing is to operate \n     in a low key, quiet, persuasive and consensus-building way.\n\n  This nomination came out of the committee without recommendation. \nThere was a 9-to-9 divided vote. By contrast, all of the previous \nnominees to be U.N. ambassador were brought to the floor by very strong \ncommittee votes and approved on the floor by very strong votes--most of \nthem unanimous, none of them really close.\n\n  In addition to Mr. Bolton's extreme policy views and his \nconfrontational demeanor, there is the issue of his professional \nconduct. There is ample evidence that he has attempted to politicize \nintelligence in a way that I believe has harmed our Nation's diplomacy.\n  Mr. Bolton sought the transfer of two intelligence analysts with whom \nhe disagreed on substantive matters. He repeatedly attempted to stretch \nthe facts to back his own ideological predisposition. He created such a \nclimate of intimidation in the State Department that the Secretary of \nState found it necessary to set up a special meeting with the \nIntelligence and Research Bureau in order to directly reassure the \nanalysts.\n  To make matters worse, Mr. Bolton told the committee that he had not \ntried to have analysts punished or disciplined, and he denied that he \nsought retribution against them. He said, ``I shrugged my shoulders, \nand I moved on,'' when his attempts to have them reassigned were \nrebuffed.\n  And yet we have learned from extensive interviews with numerous \nadministration officials that he did try to have the analysts removed \nfrom their positions, that he did seek to punish people for disagreeing \nwith him, and he did persist in his efforts for many months after, as \nhe says, he shrugged his shoulders and moved on.\n  That he was ultimately unsuccessful in his efforts does not speak for \nMr. Bolton. What it speaks to is the steadiness and determination of \nthose professionals who withstood his demands, who refused to bend to \nthe inordinate pressure he was applying.\n  Given this conduct, when he goes before the United Nations to make a \nstatement about evidence of nuclear weapons production or a terrorist \nplot or whatever it may be, what credibility will he have, knowing that \nhe sought repeatedly to punish intelligence analysts who delivered \ncontradictory information; knowing that he is sort of a man who, as \nRobert Hutchings, the former chairman of the National Intelligence \nCouncil, put it, ``took isolated facts and made much of them to build a \ncase than I thought the intelligence warranted. It was a sort of cherry \npicking of little factoids and little isolated bits were drawn out to \npresent the starkest possible case''?\n  We need a credible spokesman at the United Nations, and Mr. Bolton's \nconduct casts serious doubt on his ability to be one.\n  Moreover, Mr. Bolton's poor administrative and management skills, in \nmy view, raise serious questions as to whether he can exercise a senior \nleadership role. The testimony of Carl\n\n[[Page S5962]]\n\nFord, Assistant Secretary of State for Intelligence and Research, was \nespecially powerful on this point. Mr. Ford told the committee:\n\n       In my experience, throughout my time in the executive \n     branch, I've really never seen someone so abusive to such a \n     subordinate person.\n\n  He said he could think of no one else who comes even close to John \nBolton in terms of the way that he abuses his power and authority with \n``little'' people.\n  Secretary Powell's Chief of Staff, Larry Wilkerson, described to the \ncommittee staff the kinds of problems he had on a daily basis in \ndealing with Bolton.\n\n       Assistant secretaries, principal deputy assistant \n     secretaries, acting assistant secretaries coming into my \n     office and telling me, ``Can I sit down?''\n       ``Sure, sit down. What's the problem?''\n       ``I've got to leave.''\n       ``What's the problem?''\n       ``Bolton.''\n\n  When asked if he got similar complaints about other Under \nSecretaries, he replied:\n\n       On one occasion, on one particular individual. The rest \n     were all about Undersecretary Bolton.\n\n  In summarizing this experience Wilkerson stated, ``I think he's a \nlousy leader. And there are 100 to 150 people up there''--meaning at \nthe U.S. mission to the U.N.--``that have to be led. They have to be \nled well, and they have to be led properly.''\n  Being ambassador to the United Nations is not just a representational \njob; it is also a management job. There are 125 full-time, permanent \nState Department employees working there at our mission alongside \nnumerous detailees from other agencies and departments. The ambassador \nhas supervisory responsibility over all these people. Most are career \ncivil servants, and they are there to represent the policies of the \nPresident and to serve the interests of the Nation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n   Mr. SARBANES. I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 2 minutes to \nconclude the statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SARBANES. What are they going to do up there in New York if John \nBolton repeats the kind of abusive behavior that led people in the \nState Department, under incredible pressure, to seek the support and \ncounsel of their assistant secretaries? There will be no one in New \nYork to shield them from the wrath and vindictiveness of John Bolton.\n  Mr. President, unfortunately, it seems to have become, for some, a \nfavorite pastime to assault the United Nations. They blame it for \nfailing to resolve many of the problems that have occurred in the \nworld. But I think we have to acknowledge that the U.N. has a role to \nplay in preventing conflict and promoting cooperation. Skillful U.S. \nleadership at the United Nations can enhance our national interest in a \nvery significant way, and part of that skilled leadership is to send an \nambassador who has credibility and the wisdom necessary to carry out \nhis responsibilities.\n  This nominee falls far short of that standard. Mr. President, 102 \nretired diplomats have taken the extraordinary step of sending a letter \nurging the Senate to reject the nomination.\n  Finally, let me say just this word about the witnesses who came \nforward to the committee to testify about Mr. Bolton's past conduct. \nThese people, in effect, volunteered themselves to give what they \nthought would be an accurate view of Mr. Bolton's behavior. It took a \nlot of courage for people like Mr. Ford, Mr. Wilkerson, Mr. Hutchings, \nAmbassador Hubbard, and others to come forward. I am very concerned \nthey may pay a price for this brave action, and I very deeply regret if \nthis should turn out to be the case. I think their motive in coming \nforward was to promote the national interests of our country. In that \nsense, I think they are true patriots. They have nothing to gain by \nopposing the nomination.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SARBANES. In fact, they have much to lose.\n  Mr. President, this nomination ought to be defeated. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in opposing it. We can do better, and, for the \nsake of our country, we must do better.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to ask if we could get a \nunanimous consent request here. The Senator from Arizona, my colleague \nfrom Arizona, I believe is next. How long does he wish?\n  Mr. KYL. I would like to speak for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator from Massachusetts?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Nine minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Arizona be \nrecognized for 10 minutes, the Senator from Massachusetts for 10 \nminutes, and me for 10 minutes following that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object, may I ask that Senator \nObama be recognized subsequent to that?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I would like to be recognized as well in \nthe ensuing sequence. My understanding is it has been going back and \nforth between the sides. The Senator from Connecticut spoke, and then \nthe Senator from Maryland spoke. That caused us to have a little bit of \na scheduling issue, so I would like to continue on that schedule and \nthen allow myself to be recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask that the Senator from Florida be recognized \nfollowing Senator Obama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request before the Chair is Senator Kyl \nfor 10 minutes, Senator Kennedy for 10 minutes, Senator McCain for 10 \nminutes, Senator Obama for 15 minutes, and the Senator from Florida for \n15 minutes.\n  Is there any objection? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Arizona is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise in very strong support of John Bolton \nto be our next ambassador to the United Nations. I have known Mr. \nBolton for a long time. He is a great individual, a great \nrepresentative of the United States, and, most importantly, the person \nthe President wants to represent the United States at the United \nNations. It is the responsibility of the Senate to act on his \nnomination because the President has requested us to do so.\n  Mr. Bolton has successfully championed a number of multilateral \ninitiatives during the time he has been working for the Bush \nadministration. He is committed to the success of the United Nations \nand sees it as an important component of our diplomacy and is a strong \nvoice for U.N. reform.\n  I am concerned that a lot of debate has shifted to matters that have \nnothing to do with his qualifications and some of which attempt to \nassassinate his character. There is no question he\n\n[[Page S5963]]\n\nis qualified for the job. In fact, Mr. Bolton has been confirmed by \nthis body on four separate occasions previously. Most of the Members \nobjecting to him now have voted for him in the past. They did so based \nupon his substantive views, not any allegations about his conduct.\n  A lot of it has to do with the fact that there is opposition to \nPresident Bush's policy in different regards, and Mr. Bolton's \nnomination is a surrogate, in effect, for a debate about that policy. \nWe can have a debate about the President's foreign policy, but we \nshould not hold up the nomination of a man with the qualifications of \nJohn Bolton for a position we need to fill in the process of having \nthat debate.\n  Moreover, I am concerned about some of the charges that have been \nmade about him. One of the allegations--the Senator from Connecticut \nwas speaking about this--has to do with some requests Mr. Bolton made \nwhich have been examined by the Intelligence Committee. Mr. Bolton's \njob at the State Department is to deal with this kind of information, \nand what the Intelligence Committee did in response to the request of \nthe chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee was to look into the \nmatter. Here is the response, on May 25, just quoting two paragraphs \nfrom the letter of the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. \nHe said:\n\n       After completing an examination of these issues I found no \n     evidence that there was anything improper about any aspect of \n     Mr. Bolton's requests for minimized identities of U.S. \n     persons. I further found no violation of procedures, \n     directives, regulations or law by Mr. Bolton. Moreover, I am \n     not aware that anyone involved in handling these requests had \n     any concerns regarding these requests at any point in the \n     process.\n\n  The chairman of the Intelligence Committee also said:\n\n       Committee staff interviewed INR analysts and NSA officials \n     responsible for processing requests for the identities of \n     U.S. persons contained in signals intelligence products. None \n     of the individuals interviewed indicated there was anything \n     improper or inappropriate about Mr. Bolton's requests. We \n     also were briefed by General Michael Hayden, former Director \n     of the NSA and the current Principal Deputy Director of \n     National Intelligence. He also stated that Under Secretary \n     Bolton's requests were not only appropriate, but routine. In \n     fact, INR records indicate that since May 2001, INR submitted \n     489 other requests for minimized identities.\n\n  Ten, by the way, had been requested by Mr. Bolton.\n  So what Mr. Bolton did was routine and proper. There was nothing \nimproper about it. As the chairman of the committee noted, they found \nabsolutely nothing that would suggest anything improper in Mr. Bolton's \nactivities. This is all a smokescreen. There is nothing there.\n  The last point on this matter had to do with the fact that the \nSenate, it is alleged, should have access to all of these names. This \nhas nothing to do with Mr. Bolton's qualifications to be the U.S. \nRepresentative at the United Nations. But there is some feeling that \nuntil Senators have access to these names, we should not act on the \nBolton nomination.\n  Talk about a non sequitur, the Senate routinely does not have access \nto these names. They are highly classified. They get into the sources \nand methods of our intelligence. It is appropriate for certain people \nin the administration to gain access to the names, which is why, as is \nnoted, there were 489 requests for those names by people within the \nadministration--10 of which came from Mr. Bolton. There was nothing \nwrong with that.\n  As to whether Senators want access to these names, if that is \nsomething we need to take up with the intelligence community, the \nIntelligence Committee is entirely capable of doing that, but it has \nnothing to do with Mr. Bolton's qualifications to serve and our need to \nact on his nomination.\n\n  I suggest we cut through all of this smokescreen and get to the \nquestion of whether John Bolton is qualified to serve in the position \nthe President would like to have him serve. That is the real question.\n  Let me note a couple of other things I am aware of that he has done \nin his position of Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and \nInternational Security.\n  Probably the most significant and, frankly, one of the most \nsignificant achievements of the State Department itself in the last 4 \nyears was John Bolton's initiative to develop the President's \nProliferation Initiative. Over 60 countries are now participating in \nthat initiative, and it is, frankly, one of the key reasons we disarmed \nLibya with its nuclear program.\n  John Bolton has played a key role in the implementation--creation and \nimplementation--of the G-8 Global Partnership Against the Proliferation \nof WMD and WMD Materials. Under that program, we have doubled the size \nof the nonproliferation effort in the former Soviet Union by committing \nour G-8 partners to match our dollars with programs under the so-called \nNunn-Lugar CTR effort.\n  He was instrumental in concluding U.N. Security Council Resolution \n1540, which for the first time identifies proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction as a threat to international peace and security--a \nresolution, by the way, that was adopted unanimously.\n  He has been a big advocate of U.N. reform. For example, while serving \nas Assistant Secretary of State for International Organizations, he \ndetailed his concept of a ``Unitary U.N.'' that sought to ensure \nmanagement and budget reforms across the U.N. system, and that is \nsomething that is sorely needed. Almost everybody acknowledges that the \nU.N. needs this kind of reform today.\n  John Bolton is the guy who has worked tirelessly on this effort, \nincluding, by the way, the payment of arrearages in U.N. assessments \nthat were created during the 1980s. In that same capacity, he led the \neffort to repeal perhaps the most heinous resolution in U.N. history, \nthe resolution equating Zionism with racism. He also served as a member \nof the Commission on Religious Freedom.\n  He has been there. He has fought on behalf of the United States. He \nhas been an effective diplomat. Yes, he is a tough guy. People have \nnoted that. Do we want a weak Representative at the United Nations? \nEspecially today? I don't think so. President Bush is the person who \nhas talked to all of these diplomats and Presidents and representatives \nof countries around the world. He has a good feel of what it takes at \nthe United Nations now. None of us has the President's experience in \nknowing all these world leaders. The President has thought about this \nand said, knowing all these people, the way they act, how we use \ndiplomacy at United Nations: I think the best guy to represent the \nUnited States at this point in time is my man John Bolton. He is the \nman I want to send there.\n  We ought to acknowledge that the President knows a little bit about \nforeign policy and foreign affairs, having worked with all these \npeople, and probably has a pretty good idea of what it takes to get our \ncountry's interests represented well at the United Nations. John Bolton \nis the man he wants us to confirm in that position.\n  There are a variety of other things Mr. Bolton has worked on with \nrespect to U.N. reform and efforts to reform the International Atomic \nEnergy Agency and a variety of other items.\n  I will conclude by noting that we all appreciate the fact that the \nUnited Nations needs reform, and John Bolton is a person who can \naccomplish that reform. He has accomplished a great deal in the matter \nthat is primarily of importance to us these days--the proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction and the war on terror. I believe all the \ncharges made against him have been answered, of course--they have been \nanswered in spades--but we ought to move beyond all that smokescreen \nand get back to the central point, which is John Bolton is the man the \nPresident wants at the United Nations, he has been confirmed by this \nbody four times before, there is no question about his qualifications \nand his desire, and the Senate needs to uphold the great tradition of \nthis body by acting on--debating, certainly, but acting on the \nPresident's nominees and confirming John Bolton by 7 o'clock tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, would the Chair remind me when I have 2 \nminutes left, please.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is premature for this nomination even \nto be brought up before the Senate until we have the opportunity to see \nall the obviously relevant information on Mr. Bolton's record.\n\n[[Page S5964]]\n\n  I want to congratulate our friends and colleagues, Senator Biden, \nSenator Dodd, Senator Kerry, Senator Sarbanes, and the other members of \nthe committee, for the outstanding job they have done on this \nnomination.\n  The obvious conclusion from the administration's stonewalling is that \nthe documents being withheld from the Senate contain nothing to support \nthe nomination and will only make it even clearer that Mr. Bolton is \nthe wrong choice for this extremely important position.\n  The United Nations is the world's preeminent diplomatic body. We need \na representative there who is a strong and effective leader, who \nbelieves in diplomacy, and who has a proven record of using diplomacy \nto advance America's foreign policy and national security objectives.\n  Now more than ever, America needs to put our best face forward to the \ninternational community. We can--and should--do far better than John \nBolton.\n  Jeane Kirkpatrick, who served as the U.S. ambassador to the United \nNations under President Reagan, has spoken of the need to approach the \njob of U.N. ambassador in a ``low key, quiet, persuasive and consensus-\nbuilding way.'' As she says:\n\n       John Bolton may do diplomatic jobs for the U.S. government, \n     but John is not a diplomat.\n\n  In fact, John Bolton is more a bully than a diplomat. His \nconfirmation hearings suggest that on many occasions he twisted the \nintelligence to fit his views and wrongly pressured analysts to produce \nintelligence conclusions at odds with the facts. He continually sought \nto exaggerate the intelligence about Cuba's possible biological weapons \nactivities and support for terrorism. He continually sought to \nexaggerate Syria's nuclear activities beyond what the intelligence \nanalysts regarded as accurate. Rather than accept the analysis produced \nby the intelligence community, Mr. Bolton insisted on advancing his own \nviews and retaliated against those who disagreed with him. He should be \nheld accountable for this behavior, not rewarded and promoted.\n  The lessons of the Iraq war are abundantly clear. We need to make \ndecisions based on facts and sound analysis of intelligence.\n  We need to encourage intelligence analysts to ``speak truth to \npower'' when intelligence is in danger of being distorted, manipulated, \nor misrepresented. We can't demand the results we want and try to fire \npeople who refuse to go along. But that's precisely what Mr. Bolton \nrepeatedly tried to do.\n  He tried to fire Christian Westermann a State Department intelligence \nanalyst in the Bureau of Intelligence and Research, who disputed the \nmisleading language that Bolton tried to use about Cuba and biological \nweapons.\n  In another incident, the National Intelligence Officer for Latin \nAmerica had said that a speech by Mr. Bolton on Cuba did not accurately \nreflect the assessment of the intelligence community. So what did John \nBolton do? He personally went to the CIA to try to have him fired.\n  Mr. Bolton's contempt for anyone with opposing views was not limited \nto intelligence officers who disagreed with him.\n  When two State Department officers in the nonproliferation Bureau \ndisagreed over policy, he sought their removal.\n  He accused Rexon Ryu, a career civil servant, of intentionally \nwithholding a cable on the U.N. inspection process in Iraq from his \noffice. Nine months later, John Bolton denied Mr. Ryu a significant new \nassignment as the point person for the Nonproliferation Bureau for the \nupcoming G-8 summit.\n  In the case of a State Department lawyer, Mr. Bolton tried to remove \nhim from a legal case on China sanctions, based on a misunderstanding \nof a position the lawyer had taken.\n  These are not isolated incidents of disgruntled employees. They \nrepresent a clear and troubling pattern of a bully who repeatedly tried \nto silence opposition by attempting to intimidate analysts and \nsubordinates into conforming to his views.\n  Sadly, his view is not one that envisions a great and important role \nfor the United Nations. On the contrary, Mr. Bolton has shown nothing \nbut disdain for the United Nations. He has continued to articulate a \nvision of a go-it-alone foreign policy.\n  Speaking to the World Federalist Association in February 2004, he \nsaid:\n\n       There is no such thing as the United Nations. . . There is \n     an international community, that occasionally can be led by \n     the only real power left in the world and that is the United \n     States, when it suits our interest and when we can get others \n     to go along.\n\n  He said:\n\n       The Secretariat building in New York has 38 stories. If you \n     lost 10 stories today, it wouldn't make a bit of difference.\n\n  These are not the views of a person who is supposed to represent \nAmerica's diplomatic interests in the international community. These \nare not the views of an individual who, as the Administration argues, \nis well suited to reform the United Nations.\n  These views are likely to make Mr. Bolton less effective, not more \neffective, pursuing our interests at the United Nations. We can't \nexpect the support of other nations on issues that matter to the United \nStates, if we show nothing but contempt for other nations.\n  In fact, on one highly important issue where diplomacy is desperately \nneeded--North Korea--Mr. Bolton has been consistently wrong.\n  The nuclear threat from North Korea continues to grow. North Korea is \nalready the greatest proliferator of ballistic missiles. Desperate, and \nstrapped for cash, the threat is very real that North Korea could be a \nsource of nuclear material for Al Qaeda terrorists.\n  We agreed to the Six-Party Talks, but have not effectively engaged \nthe North Koreans. At Mr. Bolton's urging, our policy's been AWOL so \nfar.\n  The results may be deadly. When President Bush came to office, North \nKorea's plutonium program was inactive. Its nuclear rods were under \nseal.\n  Then the President called North Korea part of his Axis of Evil. As we \nprepared for war with Iraq over nuclar weapons that did not exist, we \nlearned that North Korea had begun a secret uranium enrichment program. \nWhen we confronted North Korea, but then refused to negotiate with it, \nNorth Korea expelled the international inspectors and began producing \nplutonium for nuclear weapons. On the eve of war with Iraq, North Korea \npulled out of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.\n  At the beginning of the Bush administration, North Korea was already \nthought to have two nuclear weapons. They are now believed to have up \nto eight such weapons--and possible more--and they may well be \npreparing for a nuclear test.\n  One of our worst national nightmares is nuclear material or even \nnuclear weapons in the hands of al Qaeda, with North Korea as their \nsupplier.\n  The person guiding President Bush's policy on North Korea was John \nBolton. His policy's been a failure, yet the administration now wants \nto promote him to be our Ambassador to the U.N.\n  Mr. Bolton was not able to advance effective diplomacy as Under \nSecretary for Arms Control and International Security Affairs, and \nthere is no reason to believe he can advance America's interests at the \nU.N.\n  The challenges facing America are serious--terrorism, war, ethnic \nconflict, ancient and modern rivalries, disease and poverty, human \nrights--all these are still the pressing daily realities--for peoples \nthroughout the world.\n  The need for a strong United Nations as an effective international \norganization and a strong U.S. Ambassador to advance our interests is \nclear and compelling.\n  As Franklin Roosevelt said about America in 1945:\n\n       We have learned that we cannot live alone, at peace; that \n     our own well-being is dependent on the well-being of nations \n     far away . . . . We have learned to be citizens of the world, \n     members of the human community. It is not a Republican or \n     Democratic or American community. It is a world community.\n\n  In the age of instant global communication, trade zones that span \nhemispheres, transnational criminal gangs, international terrorism, and \nthe prospect of nuclear devastation--the need of nations to work \ntogether is greater than ever. The challenges we face today are too \ncomplex, too immense, and too pervasive for the United States or any \nnation to face alone.\n  The United Nations is the one and only organization through which the \nnations of the world can link their\n\n[[Page S5965]]\n\nunique strengths in a realistic hope of building a peaceful future for \nall humanity.\n  We need a representative at the United Nations who supports that \nvision and is committed to that future for us all. John Bolton is not \nthe person for that job, and I urge my colleagues to vote against him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak again in support of John \nBolton's confirmation as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. When I \nspoke in April in favor of Mr. Bolton, I highlighted a number of his \nqualities, including that he is smart, experienced, hard working, \ntalented, and he knows the United Nations. In view of these and other \nimpressive qualifications, the Senate has confirmed him four times in \nthe past.\n  It is worth repeating several times: The Senate has done its work and \nconfirmed him four times in the past.\n  In his current job as Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and \nInternational Security, he has compiled a record of accomplishment. For \nexample, next week marks the second anniversary of the Proliferation \nSecurity Initiative, a multilateral effort to stop trafficking of \nweapons of mass destruction and their components. John Bolton \nspearheaded this program since its inception, and today more than 60 \ncountries support it. This success alone should disprove the argument \nthat Mr. Bolton is somehow an arch unilateralist, bent on subverting \ncollective international action.\n  The PSI is not his only multilateral success. He has also helped to \nconstruct the G-8's global partnership to secure dangerous technologies \nand materials. He led the negotiations leading to the Treaty of Moscow \nwhich dramatically reduced the size of deployed nuclear arsenals in the \nUnited States and Russia, and in his previous post as Assistant \nSecretary for International Organizations he led the successful drive \nto repeal the U.N. resolution equating Zionism with racism.\n  A lot has been made in recent weeks about Mr. Bolton's personal \ndisposition in dealing with colleagues. Let's be frank: He is not a \ncareer diplomat either by profession or temperament, but then, the role \nof ambassador to the U.N. has always required something special. A look \nback at some of the personalities who have held this job--from Adlai \nStevenson to Daniel Patrick Moynihan, from Jeane Kirkpatrick to Richard \nHolbrooke--shows that directness and forcefulness are assets, not \nhindrances, to effectiveness at the U.N.\n  We all know Mr. Bolton is perhaps not the world's most beloved \nmanager nor one to keep his temper entirely under wraps. Perhaps I have \na certain bias in that direction and an extra special sympathy because \nI am well known to my colleagues as always calm and never engaged in \nany controversial issues nor activities.\n  But seriously, I ask my colleagues, I ask seriously, is this unique \nto Mr. Bolton? If a temper and an unorthodox management style were \ndisqualifiers from Government service, would that disqualify a lot of \npeople, including maybe one or two in this body?\n  But the fact is, it is worth wondering not whether Mr. Bolton is a \nmild, gentle diplomat--we know he is not--but, rather, whether he is a \nrepresentative we need at the United Nations. We need an ambassador who \nknows the U.N. We need an ambassador who is willing to shake up an \norganization that requires serious reform. Is there anyone in this \nSenate who does not believe the United Nations needs serious reform, an \norganization that has countries such as Sudan on its Human Rights \nCommission or whose General Assembly equates Zionism with racism?\n  We all know about the oil-for-food scandal that is unfolding now. We \nknow there have been several calls for reform. One of my friends, Brent \nScowcroft, served on a panel that was named by the Secretary General. \nAnd Kofi Annan has presented his own serious plan to implement these \nrecommendations because the United Nations needs reform.\n  Why do I care so much? I care for a broad variety of reasons, \nincluding the fact that my taxpayer dollars support some 20 percent of \nthe United Nations operations. The United Nations needs reform. The \nUnited Nations has failed in peacekeeping operations throughout the \nworld. Some of the scandals concerning peacekeeping activities, of rape \nin the Congo, have got to be changed. The United Nations needs the \npresence of a tough, hard, dedicated individual who has been already \nconfirmed in various posts four times by this Senate.\n  Elections have consequences. One consequence of President Bush's \nreelection is he has a right to appoint officials of his choice. I \nstress this because the President nominates. It is not my choice, or \nany other Senator's, but the President's choice. When President Clinton \nwas elected, I didn't share the policy views of some of the officials \nhe nominated, but I voted to confirm them, thinking that the President \nhas a right to put into place the team he believes will serve him best.\n  The Foreign Relations Committee has spent weeks investigating Mr. \nBolton's background. In his recent report on behalf of the committee \nmajority, Senator Lugar, one of the most respected individuals in this \nNation, determined ``the end result of all this is that Secretary \nBolton emerged looking better than when it began.'' Chairman Lugar \nultimately concluded that Mr. Bolton is a highly qualified nominee. I \nagree.\n  In the last 48 hours or so I have noticed a change in the temperature \naround this body. I am very pleased about it. We realized it is time to \nmove ahead with the people's business. It is time we started addressing \nseriously the energy crisis in this country. It is time we got \ntogether, along with the President, in coming together to save Social \nSecurity. It is time we move forward with the Defense authorization \nbill and help the men and women who are defending this Nation and \nsacrificing as we speak.\n  I strongly urge my friends on the other side of the aisle, we are \ngoing to have a cloture vote this evening. After that, let's vote up or \ndown. For my colleagues who disagree and do not want Mr. Bolton there, \nI respect their views. But let's go ahead and give him an up-or-down \nvote before we go into recess for a week. Let him go. If the Senate in \nits wisdom approves of his nomination, let's go ahead and let him get \nto work rather than wait a week or 10 days or more. We have been at \nthis for weeks. Let's move on to other things.\n  If we asked our constituents, What would you like us to do, take up \nthe Defense authorization bill? Take up an energy bill? Try to work on \nthis deficit problem that is mortgaging their futures? Sit down and \nnegotiate a bipartisan agreement on Social Security? Those would be \ntheir priorities. Let's move ahead tonight, have the cloture vote, have \na vote on Mr. Bolton, and move forward and plan for when we come back \nfrom the recess, addressing the issues that are important to the \nAmerican people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, let me begin my statement today by \noutlining what I think this debate is not about.\n  I do not believe this debate is about Mr. Bolton being rude on \noccasion. This debate is not about Mr. Bolton being blunt. The debate \nis not about Mr. Bolton occasionally losing his temper.\n  As the distinguished Senator from Arizona just noted, if this is the \ncriteria, many of us in the U.S. Senate would not be qualified to serve \nin a position that requires confirmation. Almost all of us lose our \ncool from time to time and say things we come to regret later. Let me \nadd, I don't think this debate is about whether Mr. Bolton is an \nintelligent man.\n  These are not the issues at the heart of the strong bipartisan \nobjections that have been voiced on this nomination.\n  The crux of the objections is very specific, very credible \nallegations that Mr. Bolton sought to shade intelligence and sideline \ncareer intelligence analysts who did not agree with his policy views. \nThis is the core of the bipartisan objections to this nomination.\n  Over and over again, we heard from a range of career officials and \nBush administration appointees that Mr. Bolton sought to massage \nintelligence to fit an ideological bias. Let me emphasize, these are \nobjections coming forward from Bush appointees.\n  In addition, we have 102 former ambassadors and senior diplomats who \noppose Bolton--from the Nixon administration, the Ford administration, \nand\n\n[[Page S5966]]\n\nthat bastion of fuzzy-headed liberalism, the Reagan administration.\n  In an environment where reliable intelligence is one of the best \ntools we have to keep us safe, we must heed the lessons from the Iraq \nwar: Intelligence must never be shaped to fit policy views. Dissent \nwithin the intelligence community should not be muzzled or suppressed; \nit should be respected and encouraged.\n  The United States Senate should be sending a clear, unequivocal \nstatement to our intelligence officers: We want you to play it straight \nand call it like you see it--even if it is something we do not want to \nhear.\n  I am afraid that by voting to confirm Mr. Bolton, we will fail to \nsend that critical message.\n  Now, I believe the President is entitled to the benefit of the doubt \nwhen appointing senior members of his team. To that end, I have \nsupported a number of the President's choices for top foreign policy \npositions, including Secretary Rice; Robert Zoellick, to be her deputy; \nand Nick Burns, to fill the third-ranking position at the State \nDepartment.\n  I think we should provide some deference to the President. The \nexecutive branch is primarily responsible for the day-to-day operations \nof our foreign policy.\n  At the same time, the Constitution gives the Senate the power to \nadvise and to consent. This is a responsibility I take very seriously.\n  And so, because of Mr. Bolton's consistent breach of the line between \npracticing politics and analyzing intelligence--that is pivotal to our \nnational security--I intend to vote ``no'' on the nomination of John \nBolton to be our representative to the United Nations.\n  I agree with much of what my colleagues have said about the problems \nwith Mr. Bolton's qualifications to serve in this position. But I would \nlike to focus on one issue that I believe has not been covered in great \ndetail--Mr. Bolton's performance in his current job.\n  It has been suggested we should overlook the troubling aspects of Mr. \nBolton's record--the fact that he appears to have attempted to \nmanipulate intelligence data; the fact he does not appear to have been \nentirely forthcoming before the Foreign Relations Committee; and the \nfact we still cannot get basic information from the State Department on \nhis nomination--for one reason: because Mr. Bolton is so competent for \nthe job. I have heard this argument repeatedly from the other side of \nthe aisle.\n  I am baffled by this reasoning. I am stupefied by the suggestion that \nMr. Bolton is such an excellent choice for the job, so uniquely \nqualified for this job, that we should just ignore all of these other \nproblems.\n  When I look at the record of Mr. Bolton during the last 4 years as \nthe top arms control and nonproliferation official at the State \nDepartment, I am not impressed. Let's look at his track record.\n  On North Korea, the approach that has been advocated by both Mr. \nBolton and this administration has simply not worked. Under Mr. \nBolton's watch, there are no longer international inspectors and \ncameras at any site in North Korea. The North Koreans have withdrawn \nfrom the Non-Proliferation Treaty. We now believe North Korea has \ndeveloped material for six to eight nuclear weapons.\n  When North Korea has one or two nuclear weapons, the situation is \ncritical. They can test one weapon, and hold one weapon. When it has \nsix to eight, the situation is terminal. North Korea can now test a \nweapon, hold a couple, and sell the rest. And we know that North Korea \nwill do virtually anything for the money.\n  Another area Mr. Bolton was responsible for is the Non-Proliferation \nTreaty, a critical tool for helping to prevent the spread of nuclear \nweapons to rogue states, which could ultimately fall into the hands of \nterrorist organizations.\n  President Bush recognized the importance of the NPT and pledged to \nstrengthen this treaty in a 2004 speech at the National Defense \nUniversity. A week later, Mr. Bolton promised to do the same.\n  What has happened since? Virtually nothing. The administration has \nmade very little progress on this issue, and the Non-Proliferation \nTreaty review conference currently underway is not going well.\n  An article from MSNBC reports:\n\n       The United States has been losing control of the \n     conference's agenda this week to Iran and other countries, a \n     potentially serious setback to U.S. efforts to isolate \n     Tehran.\n\n  Where has Mr. Bolton been throughout this process?\n  According to the same article:\n\n       [S]ince last fall Bolton, Mr. Bush's embattled nominee to \n     be America's ambassador to the United Nations, has \n     aggressively lobbied for a senior job in the second Bush \n     administration. During that time Mr. Bolton did almost no \n     diplomatic groundwork for the NPT conference . . . officials \n     say. Everyone knew the conference was coming, and that it \n     would be contentious, says a former senior Bush official, but \n     Bolton stopped all diplomacy on this six months ago.\n  In other words, Mr. Bolton was more interested in lobbying for the \nU.N. job than doing the tough groundwork necessary for a successful \nreview conference.\n  Let's turn to Iran--another issue on which Mr. Bolton should have \nbeen working to formulate a coherent, workable administration strategy. \nInstead, the administration's policy has been all over the map. In a \nhearing before the Foreign Relations Committee last week, a senior \nState Department official described the latest iteration of the \nAdministration's policy as a ``patient policy.''\n  I would say the policy has been less about patience and more about \nparalysis--a dangerous situation for a nation such as Iran that is \ndeveloping nuclear weapons, is a state sponsor of terrorism, and is \nmeddling in Iraq.\n  Perhaps this paralysis and incoherence is best illustrated by the \nfact that since 2001, the administration has tried--to my knowledge, \nwithout success--to formulate a Presidential Directive on Iran. As the \ntop non-proliferation official at the State Department, Mr. Bolton \nshould have been doing more to shape a workable policy instead of \nletting it drift dangerously along for the last 4 years.\n  Mr. President, I know my time is running short, so let me conclude \nwith a couple of simple points.\n  Two examples are frequently cited by Mr. Bolton and his supporters as \nevidence of his success and competence in his current position: Libya \nand the Proliferation Security Initiative. During his confirmation \nhearings, Mr. Bolton touted these successes over and over again.\n  Now, I agree with Mr. Bolton that we have made important progress on \nthese issues. But reports suggest that the Libya deal was struck in \nspite of Mr. Bolton, not because of him. In fact, Mr. Bolton was \nsidelined from the negotiations by the White House. And, the British \nGovernment specifically asked that Mr. Bolton not play a role in this \nprocess.\n  I quote from an MSNBC article that specifically addresses this issue:\n\n       Bolton, for instance, often takes and is given credit for \n     the administration's Proliferation Security Initiative, an \n     agreement to interdict suspected WMD shipments on the high \n     seas, and the deal to dismantle Libya's nuclear program, a \n     deal that Bolton, by the way, had sought to block. But [a] \n     former senior Bush official . . . says that, in fact, \n     Bolton's successor, Robert Joseph deserves most of the credit \n     for these achievements. This official adds that it was Joseph \n     who was in charge of counterproliferation at the NSC [and] \n     who had to pitch in when Bolton fumbled preparations for the \n     NPT conference as well.\n\n  Now, here is my point: If there was clear evidence that Mr. Bolton is \na terrific diplomat, maybe I could understand how some in the Senate \ncould overlook what I consider to be a mountain of evidence concerning \nhis misuse of intelligence and say: You know what, this guy is such a \ncapable administrator and diplomat, we need him to reform the United \nNations.\n  I would still believe that the misuse of intelligence, in and of \nitself, disqualifies Mr. Bolton from the job, but at least I could \nunderstand why some people would draw such a conclusion.\n  But the record indicates that in his current job he has not had much \nsuccess, which leads me to ask: Why is it we are so confident this is \nthe person who is going to lead reform in the United Nations?\n  The distinguished Senator from Arizona is exactly right, we need \nreform in the United Nations. It is inexcusable some of the things that \ngo on up there.\n  But as a consequence of Mr. Bolton's diminished credibility and \nstature, I\n\n[[Page S5967]]\n\nthink he is exactly the opposite of what we need at the United Nations. \nCountries such as Zimbabwe and Burma, and others that do not want to \nsee reform take place at the UN, are going to be able to dismiss our \nefforts at reform by saying: Mr. Bolton is a U.N. basher, someone who \nis ideologically opposed to the existence of the U.N.--thereby using \nMr. Bolton's own words and lack of credibility as a shield to prevent \nthe very reforms that need to take place.\n  Moreover, I have yet to hear a comprehensive plan from Mr. Bolton or \nthe administration for U.N. reform.\n  So let me close by saying this: When the Foreign Relations Committee \nconsidered Mr. Bolton's nomination, I invoked the memory of Adlai \nStevenson, a great citizen of the State of Illinois. Stevenson had the \ncredibility, the temperament, and the diplomatic skill to guide the \nUnited States through some of the worst, most difficult times at the \nUnited Nations--especially the Cuban missile crisis.\n  During this crisis, we were able to isolate the Soviets because of \nthe stature and integrity of our permanent representative to the United \nNations.\n  Given the issues that have surfaced surrounding Mr. Bolton's \nnomination, I simply ask my colleagues this: If a crisis were to occur \nwith North Korea or Iran, are we sure the integrity and credibility of \nMr. Bolton would command the respect of the rest of the world? Would \nMr. Bolton, like Adlai Stevenson, be able to convince the world that \nour intelligence and our policies are right and true? Would Mr. Bolton \nbe able to isolate our enemies and build a coalition that would \nultimately make our troops safer and our mission easier?\n  I believe the answer is no. There are some wonderful, capable, tough, \nconservative, reform-minded Republican diplomats who are well qualified \nfor this task and would easily be confirmed by the Senate. Mr. Bolton \nis not one of them.\n  I would urge that the other side of the aisle seriously consider \ntheir position on this nomination. I hope we can muster the votes to \nsend this nomination back to the President. Let's start afresh. I know \nwe can do better.\n\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I rise to strongly support the \nnomination of John Bolton to be the United States next permanent \nrepresentative to the United Nations. I do so because I believe this is \na man of great integrity who has dedicated himself to serve this Nation \nin various different posts over the course of his life.\n  I want to try hard not to repeat a lot of what has been said already \nbecause it is, I know, at times repetitious. But I do believe it is \nimportant we recognize and know this gentleman has been previously \nconfirmed by the Senate in four prior Presidential appointments, and \nthree of those in the area of diplomacy.\n  I am intrigued by the comments of the Senator from Illinois about Mr. \nBolton's diminished stature. It appears that now we are going to find \nhim unqualified by what has transpired over the last 60 days to this \ngood man, as his record has been trashed repeatedly, oftentimes with \nscant or little evidence.\n  So let me say I believe this is a good man who has earned the right \nand has been chosen by the President of the United States to represent \nour Nation at this very important post.\n  The Senator from Arizona spoke about elections having consequences. \nThe fact is, President Bush not only has made this choice but has made \na choice of someone who he believes is the right person to lead our \nefforts at this time at the United Nations.\n  Mr. Bolton is someone who has sometimes been called blunt speaking. \nAt the same time, our President at times has irked people because of \nthe directness of his language, because of the fact that sometimes he \ncalls a spade a spade. I do recall, as a member of his Cabinet, sitting \nin a joint session of the Congress when a great deal of talk was \ngenerated about him speaking about an ``axis of evil.'' The President \nhas chosen this direct man to be at the United Nations, and at a time \nwhen we need direct talk. There is a great tradition at the United \nNations of people who have been plain spoken.\n  I have had the pleasure and honor of knowing Ambassador Jeane \nKirkpatrick. No one has ever suggested that Ambassador Kirkpatrick was \nshy, retiring or unclear about her views. I also had the honor of \nknowing someone who was ambassador to the United Nations, Vernon \nWalters. I know Vernon Walters embarked on many diplomatic missions, \nusually to set the record straight with some foreign leader, usually to \ntell him bluntly what needed to be done or said. If there is any doubt \nabout that, there is a wonderful book he wrote about his life called \n``Silent Missions'' that provides good evidence.\n  We hold up Adlai Stevenson as someone who should be emulated. The \nfact is, Ambassador Stevenson, who was a wonderful public servant as \nwell, at times used rather blunt language. I can remember as a child \nbeing glued to the TV set during the missile crisis with Cuba and the \nSoviet Union, and Adlai Stevenson demanding: Don't wait for the \ntranslation. He was prepared to use blunt language. It is in our \nnational interest, at times, to have direct, blunt-speaking people, \nparticularly at a place like the United Nations.\n  We have heard, in the course of the debate, that Mr. Bolton should \nnot be qualified for this job because he spoke of the fact that out of \nthe 38 stories at the U.N. building, perhaps 10 could be done away \nwith. Who here does not, in a serious way, believe that the United \nNations bureaucracy could use some streamlining? More interesting than \nthat, Mr. Bolton has been speaking about this for over a decade. He \nwrote some very interesting articles, which I took the time to read, \nabout United Nations reform, about streamlining that bureaucracy, about \nbetter budgetary management. Sadly, although his writings are 8 or 10 \nyears old, even longer, little has been done to move the ball forward, \nto change that stymied bureaucracy that continues not to use taxpayer \ndollars appropriately and who has engaged in some condemnable practices \nin recent days.\n  One of the charges I find most unfair--and its repetition does not \nadd to its credibility--is the charge that Mr. Bolton has politicized \nintelligence, has massaged intelligence, has not used intelligence \nadequately. There is no evidence, for those of us who sat in the \nForeign Relations Committee meetings and heard the evidence of those \nwho spoke, that Mr. Bolton ever massaged intelligence. There is \nevidence that Mr. Bolton acted swiftly to try to explain to those who \nworked for him how they should approach the clearance of his speeches. \nAnd he did react strongly to those who tried to go around him and \nattempted to impact or influence that which would be clear for him to \nsay.\n  It is, in fact, at times difficult to study intelligence and analyze \nit in a way that gives it clear and complete clarity. So what do we do? \nWe have intelligence analysts. We have human beings who are, similar to \nhistorians and journalists and all of us in life, given to the \nproclivities of their own bias, their own life experience, their own \npolitical views. Through that filter, comes the intelligence which \ncomes not in a clear package but as a mosaic, something that comes in \nbits and pieces and dribs and drabs. Out of that, we have to make a \nwhole cloth. We have to create a judgment. That is where judgment comes \nin.\n  Those who are in politically appointed positions have the \nresponsibility to challenge the professionals in the intelligence \ncommunity as they seek to put together the ultimate judgments about \nwhat the pieces of information tell them concerning the truth of that \nintelligence.\n  In that instance, at times, maybe Mr. Bolton has had differences, but \nin every single instance that could be overturned--and believe me, his \nrecord has been combed carefully--there was never a time when Mr. \nBolton went outside that which was approved and that which was cleared.\n  It is important to me that the record be clear about Mr. Bolton's \nstatements on the issue of bioweapons capabilities by Cuba. In his \nspeech at the Heritage Foundation, which has caused so much controversy \nand interest, he used the very same language that 3 months earlier one \nof his accusers, Carl Ford, had used before a Senatorial committee. \nThat language, which stands to this day, reads:\n\n       The United States believes that Cuba has at least a limited \n     developmental offensive biological warfare research and \n     development\n\n[[Page S5968]]\n\n     effort. Cuba has provided dual use bio-technology to rogue \n     states. We're concerned that such technology could support \n     [bioweapons] programs in those states. We call on Cuba to \n     cease all [bioweapons] applicable cooperation with rogue \n     states and to fully comply with all its obligations under the \n     Biological Weapons Convention.\n\n  I believe those are responsible remarks. I believe those are timely \nremarks. I believe those are remarks that are intended to make the \nworld safer and to make America safer from terrorism by bioweapons. \nSharing bioweapons technology with rogue states is not a good thing. \nThe fact that Mr. Bolton would dare to call their hand on it is not a \nbad thing. We should be grateful to Mr. Bolton for his directness, for \nhis bluntness, for his willingness to take on this issue and speak \nabout it clearly.\n\n  It has also been said that Mr. Bolton may not have done a good job at \nhis last assignment. I repeat, again, that this is the fourth time the \nSenate, after a Presidential appointment, has sought to confirm Mr. \nBolton, most recently as Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and \nInternational Security.\n  A number of states around the world pose great danger and concern. We \nspoke about Cuba. It is one of those. But there is also Iran. As to \nIran, on Under Secretary Bolton's watch, Iran's formerly covert nuclear \nprogram has been exposed and has been described in detail in seven \npublic reports by the IAEA director general. The IAEA board of \ndirectors has adopted six resolutions calling on Iran to suspend its \nnuclear fuels cycle activities and fully cooperate with IAEA \ninspections.\n  The EU--particularly UK, France, and Germany--the United States, and \nRussia are working closely to suspend and reverse Iran's nuclear \nprogram and to develop a complete absence of any further nuclear \ntesting by them. Today we had some encouraging news. We hope we can \nbuild on that. That is a success that, in no small measure, is due to \nMr. Bolton's work.\n  In addition, we have talked about North Korea. I find it terribly \ninteresting that the irrational behavior of the North Korean \nGovernment, which we all know to be irrational and unconventional, \nwould be laid at the feet of this nominee. North Korea has had nuclear \naspirations for decades. And it began an active effort to acquire \nnuclear weapons years before the Bush administration came into office, \nyears before Mr. Bolton was in the position he holds. The 1994 agreed \nframework was doomed to fail and was only a short-term Band-Aid to the \nresolution of this problem. It was akin to looking down a soda straw \nand at a plutonium facility and ignoring the fact that North Korea \nbegan cheating, almost as the ink was drying, by embarking on a covert \nuranium enrichment program. The Bush administration changed tracks. The \nBush administration took a different policy approach.\n  I understand there may be some on the other side of the aisle who \ndisagree with that policy approach, and much has been said about that. \nIn fact, in the Presidential debate, there was discussion of this very \nissue. Again, elections have consequences. President Bush's approach to \nproceeding with the six-party approach to negotiations with North Korea \nis what is continuing today.\n  We cannot blame Mr. Bolton for those instances where foreign policy \nissues have not gone as we wished and then refuse to give him credit \nfor those that have been successful. That is the height of unfairness \nand the height of hypocrisy.\n  In Libya, our policies have met with success. Negotiations on Libya's \nweapons of mass destruction dismantling effort were conducted at a \nsenior level by the CIA and White House negotiators. Mr. Bolton was not \na part of that process, as often is the case for diplomats. I can \nrecall a distinguished ambassador to the United Nations, Adlai \nStevenson, when President Kennedy received information, with \nphotographs by our reconnaissance airplanes, that there were offensive \nmissiles hidden in Cuba, Adlai Stevenson did not have that information. \nWe know now, from the books that have been written about that, he was \nhighly offended that he was not included in or given that information \nuntil later when it had been made public. The fact is, sometimes \ndiplomacy has to be conducted in serious and closed circles. Mr. Bolton \nsuccessfully oversaw WMD dismantling and removal from Libya.\n  In addition, I believe there have been a number of other unfair \naccusations about Mr. Bolton's conduct in terms of his relationship \nwith subordinates.\n  The fact is, some of these allegations have been found to be \ncompletely devoid of any merit. In fact, the majority report on the \nMelody Townsel case--one of those that was so sensational, that caused \nthe Foreign Relations Committee to defer consideration of his \nnomination until 3 weeks later--the investigation on page 315 of the \nreport says:\n\n       The investigation was not able to establish conclusively \n     that the alleged events even occurred.\n\n  The fact is that, along with many of these other allegations that \nhave really nothing to do with the qualifications and competence of Mr. \nBolton, has been found to be either without merit or with very little \nmerit.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, it is time that we move forward with \nthis good man's nomination. I find it, as a fairly new Member of the \nSenate, a little disturbing and disappointing how easily and with \nlittle hard evidence a person's reputation can be tarnished. The fact \nis, there have been bits and pieces that were either exaggerated or \nsimply not found to have merit that have been now utilized to try to \nderail this good man's nomination.\n  I look forward to Mr. Bolton's service at the U.N. I think he will be \na good and effective reformer in an institution that is in desperate \nneed of reform and an institution where he has taken the time, over the \nhistory of his work, to talk about those issues of reform--management \nreform and budgetary reform.\n  Our Nation contributes a very sizable percentage of the U.N. budget. \nIt is our taxpayer dollars that are being wasted at the U.N. and that \nare oftentimes not only not serving our national interests but are, in \nfact, harming our national interests.\n  We have a person with Mr. Bolton's experience, and it has been \nsuggested that he is someone who is simply not going to be effective at \nthe U.N., and he is not going to be effective because it keeps being \nrepeated that he will not be effective there.\n  Mr. Bolton has a strong record of accomplishment. I point to the \nrepeal of the Zionism as racism resolution, on which Mr. Bolton led the \neffort that was so important in establishing a dynamic paradigm so the \nMiddle Eastern peace process could move forward, so that fundamental \nfairness toward Israel could also prevail at the U.N., a place that has \nbeen so incredibly harsh on Israel and its right to exist.\n  I am delighted and it is with great pleasure that I support the \nnomination of John Bolton to be the next Permanent Representative at \nthe U.N.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the \nnomination of John Bolton to be ambassador to the United Nations.\n  There are two issues at stake. First is an issue of whether this \nSenate will receive critical information so that we can deliberate \ncarefully and thoroughly about Mr. Bolton's nomination. So far, the \nState Department, as my colleagues, Senators Dodd and Biden, pointed \nout, failed to provide information under the theory that they get to \ndecide what we should know when we are casting a vote as important as \nambassador to the United Nations. It is a novel theory, but it holds no \nwater. If we allow this to go on, it will make the Senate irrelevant \nwhen it comes to major decisions about nominations and major decisions \nabout the future policy of the country.\n  The second issue is the qualifications of Mr. Bolton to be ambassador \nto the United Nations. For me, this is not a particularly hard vote. I \nopposed Mr. Bolton's nomination to be Assistant Secretary for Arms \nControl. That was based upon my review of his record, his statements, \nand his commitment to arms control and counterproliferation. Frankly, I \nthink over the last several years--the record is mixed, but in large \npart it suggests that his duties there certainly don't warrant a \npromotion to be ambassador to the U.N.\n  He was instrumental in establishing the Proliferation Security \nInitiative, which is a potentially useful framework, but as CRS pointed \nout:\n\n\n[[Page S5969]]\n\n\n       Without greater resources, legal authority or technical \n     tools for interdiction, the success of PSI may rest on a \n     political commitment of like-minded states to follow through.\n\n  In a sense, after all of the initial hype, there does not appear to \nbe the followthrough necessary to make this work. That was on Mr. \nBolton's watch.\n  He also negotiated the 2002 Moscow Treaty, but this is an interesting \narms control treaty. It has no verification regime. There is no \nrequirement for either side to make adjustments in the status of \nnuclear weapons until the last day of the treaty, which is years from \nnow. It has no provisions for continuing negotiations. Again, more \nstyle than substance, more press release than real progress.\n\n  Secretary Rice has indicated that Mr. Bolton was involved in \nnegotiations which led to a significant breakthrough--the renunciation \nof nuclear weapons by the Government of Libya. However, if you listen \nto British officials participating in the negotiations, they requested \nthat the White House take Mr. Bolton off the negotiating team because \nhe was undermining their potential for success.\n  While Mr. Bolton was an Under Secretary for State for Arms Control, \nthe United States withdrew from the ABM Treaty, becoming the first \nnation since World War II to withdraw from a major international \nsecurity agreement.\n  Mr. Bolton also blocked efforts to add a verification clause to the \nBioweapons Convention, blocked negotiations in the Geneva Conference on \nDisarmament with respect to the weaponization of space, and worked to \nweaken a treaty on small arms trafficking.\n  That is not the record of somebody who is an Arms Control Under \nSecretary committed to ending proliferation. If you look at North \nKorea, when he took over, they had, at most, two nuclear weapons. Now, \nNorth Korea may have as many as eight--four times the peril and danger. \nThat is not a record that compels a promotion.\n  I think this is a situation in which other factors have come into \nplay--assertions and allegations that he has pushed the envelope with \nrespect to intelligence, about threats from Syria and other countries. \nAgain, this is not a record that deserves promotion, a record of \nsomeone who is in a challenging world and is able to make a major, \npositive difference with respect to arms control, and it reflects the \nadministration's disdain for the process of arms control and \ncounterproliferation.\n  Now Mr. Bolton has been nominated to be ambassador to the U.N. And \nonce again, Mr. Bolton is reflecting the administration--this time \ntheir disdain for the U.N. I believe that is wrong.\n  We should have recognized, after our experience in Iraq, that we \ncannot go it alone. As unpleasant as international organizations can be \nsometimes, as inefficient and unworkable as they are at times, in the \nlong run we are better when we ally with other nations than striking \nout alone. Mr. Bolton has a different view of the U.N.\n  In 1994, he stated:\n\n       There is no such thing as the United Nations. . . .If the \n     U.N. Secretariat Building in New York lost 10 stories, it \n     wouldn't make a bit of difference.\n\n  That is a narrowed-minded view and not historical. The U.N. has made \na difference.\n  Repeatedly, Mr. Bolton talked about his disdain for the U.N. In 1998, \nhe was responding to the ramifications of not paying U.N. dues. In his \nwords:\n\n       Not only do I not care about losing the General Assembly \n     vote, but actually see it as a ``make my day'' outcome.\n\n  That is not the kind of cavalier attitude that will bode him well as \nambassador to the United Nations, where he becomes one of the chief \ndiplomats in our diplomatic arsenal, if you will.\n  In an article in the New York Times, Elizabeth Jones stated:\n\n       I don't know if he's incapable of negotiation, but he's \n     unwilling.\n\n  Ms. Jones believed that:\n\n       ``The fundamental problem,'' if Mr. Bolton were to become \n     U.N. ambassador, would be a reluctance on his part to make \n     the kinds of minor, symbolic concessions necessary to build \n     consensus among other governments and maintain the American \n     position.\n\n  In another view by Jeane Kirkpatrick, former U.S. ambassador to the \nU.N. and referred to by my colleague from Florida, she stated:\n\n       John Bolton may do diplomatic jobs in the U.S. Government, \n     but John is not a diplomat.\n\n  Frankly, the role of ambassador requires a diplomat, not someone who \nis an intellectual bully, not someone who is there to make a point and \nnot to make progress, not someone there to send a message, to deride \nthe work of his colleagues at the U.N.\n  So I think we have a responsibility on two fronts: First, to assert \nrather strongly that we are relevant to this process, that we need \ninformation, and that executive agencies do not decide what information \nwe need. And second, Mr. Bolton's record to date, his statements to \ndate, his attitude to date suggest he will not be an effective \nambassador to the United Nations. As a result, I urge that his \nnomination be opposed.\n  Mr. President, I yield back my time. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise to offer to my colleagues my strong \nand unequivocal support for John Bolton and his nomination to be our \nUnited States representative to the United Nations.\n  John Bolton was picked by the President. A President ought to be able \nto bring people into his administration, men and women, who share the \nvalues, the aspirations, the goals, of that administration. This \nPresident also represents the views of most Americans who believe the \nUnited Nations needs reforming. We need to bring someone into that \nposition to get those reforms done.\n  I believe very strongly John Bolton is exceptionally well-qualified \nfor this task. This is a time of change, a time of improvement that is \nnecessary for the United Nations.\n  During the protracted committee process, we saw all sorts of \nsensationalized charges and outright fabrications against John Bolton. \nHis nomination nonetheless, has finally reached the Senate where I am \nsure my colleagues will see the wisdom in confirming John Bolton. This \ndebate provides an opportunity to have a full discussion on John Bolton \nand his qualifications to serve as Ambassador to the United Nations.\n  What has been lost in this entire debate from the very beginning as \nthey are off on tangents, detours, and all sorts of allegations. What \nis being missed--and what I hope my colleagues and the American people \nwill focus on--is the dire need for change in the United Nations. The \nneed for accountability, the need for scrutiny, the need for reform.\n  In testimony before the Foreign Relations Committee and in interviews \nconducted by the committee staff, there is almost no mention, or \ndiscussion, of what needs to be done to reform the United Nations. John \nBolton is a man with the skill, wisdom, principles, and the right \nperson to unflinchingly lead those changes as our representative.\n  Much of the debate during the committee consideration and some of the \nthings that have been said in the Senate has been focused on the \nsensibilities of some who are apparently easily offended. There is a \nfascination with speech crafting. For example, there is concern over \nwhat Mr. Bolton said at a speech to the Heritage Foundation concerning \nCuba's biological weapons program and how that might be shared with \nrogue nations.\n  The reality is, and I will quote this for the record so if anyone \nwants to see what was actually said that created this controversy. What \nwas actually said is the following by John Bolton at the Heritage \nFoundation in the speech ``Beyond the Axis of Evil,'' May 6, 2002:\n\n       Here is what we now know. The United States believes that \n     Cuba has at least a limited offensive biological warfare \n     research and development effort. Cuba has provided dual-use \n     biotechnology to other rogue states. We are concerned that \n     such technology could support biological weapons programs in \n     those states. We call on Cuba to cease all biological weapons \n     applicable cooperation with rogue states and to fully comply \n     with all of its obligations under the Biological Weapons \n     Convention.\n\n\n[[Page S5970]]\n\n\n  Well, one of the people, a very cheerful fellow, Carl Ford, \ncomplained about the sensibilities of some staff person. Here is what \nhe said in testimony to the Foreign Relations Committee. He said:\n\n       The United States believes that Cuba has at least a limited \n     developmental offensive biological warfare research and \n     development effort. Cuba has provided dual use bio-technology \n     to rogue states. We are concerned that such technology could \n     support biological weapons programs in those states. We call \n     on Cuba to cease all biological weapons applicable \n     cooperation with rogue states and to fully comply with all \n     its obligations under the Biological Weapons Convention.\n\n  Mr. President, I see you are squinting and trying to probably figure \nout: Well, what is the difference? There is no difference. It is the \nsame in the speech as was the testimony from Mr. Ford in the Foreign \nRelations Committee. Then, we hear from folks talking about: Oh, people \nwere upset because of all of this concern on how this speech was \nconstructed. Well, here is the reality. The whole process was one in \nwhich the person who was clearing this language did some things that \nwere inappropriate. An e-mail from Thomas Fingar to Thomas Bolton \nstated the following:\n\n       I looked at what my guy sent to the IC and that won't \n     happen again . . . Choice of the phrase ``does not concur'' \n     was entirely inappropriate . . . we have no role whatsoever \n     in determining how you or any policymaker says what you want \n     to say beyond suggesting alternatives that we think might be \n     cleared more readily than what has been drafted if time was \n     of the essence and the drafter asked for such advice.\n\n  The bottom line, he ends it:\n\n       We screwed it up, but for base reasons. It won't happen \n     again.\n\n  So John Bolton had a reason to be concerned about how some things \nwent around through the loops and so forth. The reality is, as many \nindividuals, our colleagues, fellow Senators, particularly on the \nForeign Relations Committee--in recent months, once John Bolton had \nbeen nominated for this position--were talking about how he was rude \nmaybe, or irascible with some staff, or concerned about this, that, or \nthe other. Things that have supposedly come up in recent years, of \ncourse, each and every one of these allegations have been refuted and \nthe truth has come forth.\n  The reality is that when John Bolton was proposed and nominated to be \nUnder Secretary of State, back in 2001, Senators Biden, Boxer, Kerry, \nDodd, and Sarbanes--all of them--voted against John Bolton. That was \neven before they knew about these tangential issues.\n  Now, I would prefer, when looking at the United Nations, we would be, \nas a country, united in making sure we pursue the abuse and anti-\nAmericanism that pervades the United Nations. Rather than get off on \nthese tangential and unfounded charges, I am much more concerned about \nthe United Nations being used as a front for dictatorships and \nterrorists, as well as being a waste of the taxpayers' money.\n  Over the last year, we have witnessed scandal after scandal in the \nUnited Nations. Unfortunately, these are not issues that can be \naddressed by a few marginal changes. These are issues that have shaken \nthe credibility of the United Nations and caused many citizens in the \nUnited States, and people around the world, to really wonder whether \nthe U.N. has any relevance in the future or has a redeeming role in \nworld affairs.\n  Now, the United Nations was founded on:\n\n     faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth \n     of the human person.\n\n  While the United Nations performs a number of admirable endeavors, it \nis also beholden to tyrants, dictators, and repressive regimes in \ncertain circumstances. Not considering the scandals, this is an \norganization that has allowed some of the world's worst violators of \nhuman rights to chair its Commission on Human Rights. Just when the \nUnited States has made a commitment to the spread of freedom and \njustice throughout the world, it is difficult for Americans--I know in \nVirginia, in North Carolina, and elsewhere around this country--to see \nthe United Nations as anything other than wasting their tax dollars. \nWhen a country such as Libya is chairing the Human Rights Commission. \nSudan is on the Human Rights Commission, and within the last several \nweeks, Zimbabwe has been made a member of the Commission. This is \ncertainly not an indication that the Secretary General's call for \nreform of the Commission on Human Rights is at all being heeded.\n  Now, as public servants and stewards of the American taxpayers' \ndollars, we need to make sure the revenues we allocate are being put to \ngood use. The United States and the people of this country, the \ntaxpayers, every single year, are providing $2 billion to the United \nNations. We will provide over 22 percent of the U.N.'s regular budget \nin 2005.\n  I believe all Americans want reforms enacted that would prevent \nfuture abuses in programs like the Oil-for-Food Program, where Saddam \nHussein and his thugs skimmed off $20 billion. I think we also, as \nAmericans, want to hold accountable U.N. peacekeepers who commit crimes \nagainst children. We have an obligation to work with like-minded \nreformers in the U.N. to make sure policies are implemented to prevent \nsimilar abuses in the future.\n  Now, reform is absolutely necessary in the United Nations. The United \nNations is in a crisis, and the United States has a strong interest in \nseeing it emerge as a credible and relevant institution once again. The \nU.N. Security Council and International Atomic Energy Agency, otherwise \nknown as IAEA, are needed forums for discussing the proliferation of \nnuclear weapons and the actions that need to be taken, not just by the \nUnited States but with our European and other allies around the world, \nto make sure that rogue nations do not acquire those nuclear weapons.\n\n  We have seen in recent years that the United Nations can provide an \nimportant role in helping the spread of democracy. They can be helpful \nin rebuilding societies that are emerging from decades of tyranny and \nrepression.\n  The United Nations has a role to play in the future of global affairs \nand security, but it can only do so if it takes serious steps to reform \nthe extraordinary corruption and ineptitude that has plagued it in \nrecent years.\n  Now, John Bolton comes to this nomination with a broad and deep \nknowledge of international affairs. From his early days as General \nCounsel at the U.S. Agency for International Development during the \nRonald Reagan administration, to his most recent post as Under \nSecretary of State for Arms Control and International Affairs, Mr. \nBolton has spent a great deal of time working on advancing the \ninterests of the United States and our foreign policy.\n  Some have wrongly criticized John Bolton as a rigid unilateralist who \nis incapable of building consensus with allies. However, his years of \nservice prove otherwise.\n  On counterproliferation, Mr. Bolton's efforts gave life and actual \nmeaning to President Bush's Proliferation Security Initiative. Under \nJohn Bolton's leadership, a dangerous gap in counter-proliferation \nenforcement on the seas has been filled by international cooperation \nand information sharing. Sixty countries were brought together. That is \nnot working alone. He understands, if we are going to interdict weapons \nof mass destruction, biological weapons, nuclear or otherwise, we do \nneed the support of other countries.\n  In addition, Mr. Bolton helped create the Global Partnership at the \nG-8 summit in Alberta, Canada, in 2002. This partnership doubled the \nsize of the nonproliferation effort in the former Soviet Union by \ncommitting our G-8 partners to match the United States' $1 billion per \nyear Cooperative Threat Reduction or Nunn-Lugar program.\n  He also played a central role in negotiating the Treaty of Moscow, \nwhich will reduce operationally deployed nuclear weapons by two-thirds.\n  Elimination of North Korea's nuclear threat still requires much hard \nwork, but it is clear that the half century stalemate that has allowed \nthe North Koreans to steal or develop nuclear arms technology is over. \nGrowing pressure is on that dictatorship, and John Bolton's role at the \nState Department in creating it are being confirmed by the torrent of \npersonal invective directed at him from the North Korean Government.\n  While our Ambassador there might have had his sensibilities offended \nby John Bolton calling the North Korean regime a ``repressive \ndictatorship,''\n\n[[Page S5971]]\n\nwhich seems to be accurate, as well as saying it is a ``hellish \nnightmare'' for people to have to live in. North Korea, which I might \nnot have used the first word, but it is certainly a nightmare, it seems \nto me to be very accurate description.\n  Of course, some have criticized John Bolton for doing that. And gosh, \nthe North Koreans called him ``human scum.'' I am going to stand with \nJohn Bolton in his characterization of North Korea. In fact, they say \nof John Bolton: Oh, this was not helpful for him to be calling North \nKorea or characterizing it as it is.\n  He helped break a long international silence, while there are some \nwho think, when you are dealing with a repressive dictatorship, the \nbest thing to do is just be quiet, calm them down, try to coordinate \nthem into a corner, pet them, don't get them agitated, and maybe they \nwill just change on their own. Maybe there are those who think you can \nhave editorials in newspapers and that is going to matter to tyrants \nand dictatorships. They don't care about public opinion. They don't \ncare about human rights. All they care about is power and staying in \npower.\n  So John Bolton, in my view, performed a valuable service in breaking \nthis long international silence about the suffering of the people in \nNorth Korea. For too long, savage conditions, condemned by food aid \nworkers, and glimpsed by visitors to the North, received very little, \nvery scant world attention. By magnifying the human dimension of the \nNorth Korean problem, his work may hasten the day when these abhorrent \nhuman rights violations in North Korea will end. The reality for North \nKorea is that we need the Chinese. The South Koreans, the Japanese, and \nthe Russians are all very important but as a practical matter the ones \nwho really prop up that regime is the Government of the People's \nRepublic of China.\n  When people are allowed to escape from North Korea, what happens? \nThey get to some embassy in China and they get sent back to North \nKorea. Guess what happens? They get tortured and in some cases they get \nkilled. We need to make sure that if somebody can get out of that \nregime--just as if someone could have gotten out of East Germany or \nCzechoslovakia or Hungary or Poland; if they somehow could get out of \nthose countries and escape to Austria, to West Germany, to the \nNetherlands, to Denmark, we certainly would not say: Go on back in \nthere and let the East German police take care of you or let the Soviet \npuppets in the Eastern Bloc take care of you.\n  So, I think John Bolton has done a great job in pointing out the \nhuman rights violations in North Korea. Some may also not agree with \nhis forthright critique of the United Nations and its failings. I think \nMr. Bolton has clearly placed a great deal of thought into his views, \nand he can work with the United Nations' bureaucracy. But he is not \ngoing to be a lapdog. He is not going to get seduced by niceties. He is \ngoing to say: This is what needs to be done.\n  As Assistant Secretary of State for International Organizations--and \nthis is, indeed, working with the United Nations--John Bolton--and you \ncan read what Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger wrote--led the \neffort to have the United Nations change its odious resolution that \nequated Zionism with racism. Now, to get the United Nations to say that \nthey ever did something wrong and to repeal it--similar to anything \nthat even happens here, to say we did something wrong and to repeal \nsome law--takes some negotiation. John Bolton was able to get the \nUnited Nations to repeal that odious resolution.\n\n  It is a clear, a very clear--example of his ability to stand by \nprinciple, stand for what is right, and also to work cooperatively with \nother countries in the United Nations.\n  So in my view, John Bolton has the knowledge and experience to \neffectively represent the United States at the United Nations and to \nnegotiate the changes that need to be made to ensure its relevancy and \nits credibility in the future. All of us want a United Nations that is \nwith us, working to advance free and just societies and human rights \naround the world. We do not want them squandering, wasting money, \npropping up repressive regimes, being a front for terrorist regimes. We \nneed the United Nations to remember what its charter is.\n  Now, unfortunately, the committee was forced to spend a majority of \nits nomination hearing and subsequent meetings on tangents, exploring \nwild claims, and not addressing the issues that face the United States \nat the United Nations. Nor has the debate been much about John Bolton's \nqualifications to serve as our representative.\n  Most of those who have complained and made charges against John \nBolton never had any intention of considering the merits of his \nnomination in the first place. When considered, as I said earlier, for \nhis current position, all of these--Senators Biden, Sarbanes, Dodd, \nBoxer, and Kerry--voted against him. We have had many unsubstantiated \nclaims and rumors and exaggerated innuendo. I do see the Senator from \nWisconsin, who did vote for him the other time, so it does not apply to \nSenator Feingold. I hope the Senator recognizes I did not list his \nname. I think, as people look at these overly hyped charges, they have \nbeen refuted. They do not have any bearing on John Bolton's ability to \nserve as our ambassador to the United Nations.\n  A President should have the prerogative to select the men and women--\nunless there is some extraordinary, proven infirmity or criminal \nviolation--he determines to advance and lead his initiatives and also \nto keep the promises he made to the American people. President Bush has \nnominated John Bolton to advance our foreign policy and goals at the \nUnited Nations.\n  Let me conclude with these final thoughts. In 1945, when it reported \nthe U.N. Charter to the Senate for ratification, the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee wrote that:\n\n     . . . neither this Charter nor any other document or formula \n     that might be devised can prevent war. . . . The \n     establishment of the United Nations will at best be a \n     beginning toward the creation of those conditions of \n     stability throughout the world which will foster peace and \n     security.\n\n  As we know, the United Nations has fallen short of these \nexpectations. But a better, more accountable United Nations may better \nserve our interests much more reliably.\n  Thus, the Bolton nomination offers the Senate an opportunity to again \nplay a historic role in bringing sensible reform to the United Nations. \nIt is worth the effort. John Bolton is the right person to advocate our \nprinciples, and he will not be easily seduced by empty, meaningless, \ncourteous pontifications of international bureaucracies.\n  John Bolton will bring much needed reform and accountability to the \nUnited Nations, that is in dire need of such to regain its credibility. \nHe will be a watchdog, and that is what I think the taxpayers of this \ncountry want. He is going to be a strong diplomat, a man of vision, and \nan integral part of an administration team that has proven its \nreadiness to foster positive change throughout the world.\n  The Senate, at 6 o'clock this evening, I hope, will take action--take \naction, and very positive action. There will be some differences, but \nlet's recognize that this is a historic time, a time for change in the \nUnited Nations, a time for reform. And these reforms will be positive. \nOur taxpayers will support these changes.\n  I think freedom-loving countries and people who are not yet tasting \nthat sweet nectar of liberty will also appreciate these changes. The \nbillions of dollars going to the United Nations will be used for \npositive, constructive change in implementing and fostering the \nconstruction of those pillars that are so essential for a just and free \nsociety: The freedom of religion, freedom of expression, private \nownership of property, and the rule of law. Those are the principles we \nneed to address, and we are, as a country, in advancing the United \nNations, consistent with its Charter, which ought to be a strong ally, \nnot an impediment, in those efforts.\n  I hope we will work with John Bolton and the United Nations to bring \nforth this reform, improve the credibility and, in fact, the \neffectiveness of the United States and the United Nations, to advance \nfreedom and justice for people throughout the world.\n  I thank you for your attention, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the confirmation of \nJohn\n\n[[Page S5972]]\n\nBolton to be the next U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. I do not \ntake this decision lightly. As the Senator from Virginia just pointed \nout, when Mr. Bolton's nomination was first announced, my vote was by \nno means a foregone conclusion. In fact, in 2001, when the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee considered the nomination of Mr. Bolton to \nbe the Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International \nSecurity, I parted company from my Democratic colleagues on the \ncommittee to vote in favor of his nomination both in committee and on \nthe floor.\n  I did so because I generally believed, as the Senator from Virginia \nsaid, that the President has the right to choose executive branch \nnominees who share his overall world view, even when I do not share \nthat world view. Barring serious ethical lapses or a clear lack of \nappropriate qualifications for a given job, I tend to give the \nPresident a great deal of latitude in making these appointments.\n  But after examining the record, I have concluded that Mr. Bolton is \nfundamentally unsuited for the job to which he has been nominated. His \nblatant hostility toward the institution at which he would serve and \nhis history of pursuing his personal policy agenda while holding public \noffice lead me to question whether Mr. Bolton's appointment as our \nambassador to the United Nations would serve the interests of the \nUnited States.\n  I share the views of many who are insisting on reform at the U.N. The \nU.N. must become more effective and more accountable and, as stewards \nof the American taxpayers' dollars, we must insist on this point. But \nMr. Bolton's record suggests that his personal animosity toward the \nUnited Nations is so great that he cannot effectively lead the charge \nfor reforms that can make this vital, but deeply flawed, institution \nstronger and more effective.\n  He seems to view the U.N. as an instrument to be used when it suits \nonly our immediate interests but one best ignored or even undermined \nthe rest of the time. His failure to grasp the give and take required \nfor effective multilateralism makes him a real obstacle to any hope of \npursuing vital long-term U.S. interests and increasing burden sharing \nand marshaling a global force strong enough to defeat the terrorist \nnetworks that seek to do us harm.\n  Mr. Bolton's record also reveals many instances of intemperance and \nrash decisionmaking. At least two senior intelligence officials told \ncommittee staff that Bolton's draft testimony prepared for a House \nhearing on Syria in 2003 went well beyond what the intelligence \ncommunity would clear or could clear. This wasn't a case in which State \nDepartment intelligence analysts alone had concerns about Bolton's \nproposed language. The CIA, the Department of Energy, and the Defense \nIntelligence Agency all objected. According to interviews conducted by \nthe committee staff, Bolton's office pushed back, resisting the \nintelligence community's efforts to alter problematic provisions. \nBolton was determined to be such a loose cannon that the Deputy \nSecretary of State instituted an extraordinary policy to address the \nproblem, requiring all of Mr. Bolton's public presentations to be \ncleared by Larry Wilkerson, Secretary Powell's Chief of Staff, or \nDeputy Secretary Armitage himself.\n  Regrettably, I do not have confidence that his personal agenda would \nalways, as it must be, subordinated to that of the Secretary of State \nwho, in testimony before this committee in her first days in office, \nhas placed such a premium on restoring frayed diplomatic ties.\n  In addition, information that came to light during the Senate Foreign \nRelation Committee's consideration of this nomination indicates that \nJohn Bolton has sought to punish intelligence analysts whose \nassessments did not support what Mr. Bolton wanted to say or wished to \nsay. After all that has happened to our country's reputation and \ncredibility in recent years, we cannot afford to tolerate, let alone \npromote, a policymaker who seeks to silence dissent from the \nintelligence community. What the committee found was not that Mr. \nBolton made careless remarks in the heat of a tough bureaucratic \ndispute; the evidence shows that over a period of many months, Mr. \nBolton repeatedly sought the removal of a respected intelligence \nanalyst at the State Department who had raised concerns about language \nMr. Bolton wished to use publicly, in the course of the standard \nclearance process, a process that is there to protect against \nmisleading or inaccurate public characterizations of important security \nissues. And Mr. Bolton repeatedly sought the removal of the National \nIntelligence Officer for Latin America, again pursuing this vendetta \nfor months, not heated minutes, and going so far as to consider \nblocking country clearance for Mr. Smith to travel abroad. In both \ncases, the offense that so incensed Mr. Bolton appears to be that the \nanalysts did their jobs--they presented the facts as they saw them, and \ndeclined to keep silent when the facts did not support what Mr. Bolton \nwished to say. And in both cases, senior officials with decades of \nexperience in government who were involved in these episodes told \ncommittee staff that Bolton's actions--his attempts to retaliate \nagainst these analysts--were absolutely extraordinary.\n\n  In addition to these disturbing incidents, other interviews conducted \nby committee staff revealed a broader pattern of attempting to simply \ncut those who disagreed with his policy views, or those who he believed \ndisagreed with his policy views, out of the policy-making process \nentirely. John Wolf, the former Assistant Secretary of State for Non-\nProliferation, told committee staff that Bolton attempted to retaliate \nagainst at least two public servants in the non-proliferation bureau \nbecause of differences in their policy views. Mr. Bolton tried to \nremove a State Department attorney from a case relating to a sanctions \nissue because of perceived policy disagreements--the record suggests \nthat Mr. Bolton actually misunderstood where the lawyer in question \nstood--and went so far as to suggest that he would not work with the \nState Department's entire legal bureau on the matter from that point \non--a declaration quickly negated by Deputy Secretary Armitage, who \nfelt compelled to remind Bolton that as a State Department official, he \nwould indeed be working with the State Department's lawyers. This kind \nof tunnel-vision, everyone-else-out-of-the-room approach was summed up \nby Secretary of State Powell's Chief of Staff Larry Wilkerson, who told \nthe committee staff, ``when people ignore diplomacy that is aimed at \ndealing with [North Korea's nuclear weapons development] in order to \npush their pet rocks in other areas, it bothers me, as a diplomat, and \nas a citizen of this country.'' When asked specifically if he thought \nthat Mr. Bolton had done that, Wilkerson said, ``Absolutely.'' Mr. \nWilkerson ended his interview with the committee with the following:\n\n       I would like to make just one statement. I don't have a \n     large problem with Under Secretary Bolton serving our \n     country. My objections to what we've been talking about \n     here--that is, him being our ambassador at the United \n     Nations--stem from two basic things. One, I think he's a \n     lousy leader. And there are 100 to 150 people up there that \n     have to be led; they have to be led well, and they have to be \n     led properly. And I think, in that capacity, if he goes up \n     there, you'll see the proof of the pudding in a year. Second, \n     I differ from a lot of people in Washington, both friend and \n     foe of Under Secretary Bolton, as to his, ``brilliance''. I \n     didn't see it. I saw a man who counted beans, who said, ``98 \n     today, 99 tomorrow, 100 the next day,'' and had no \n     willingness--and, in many cases, no capacity--to understand \n     the other things that were happening around those beans. And \n     that is just a recipe for problems at the United Nations. And \n     that's the only reason that I said anything.\n\n  Some have suggested that, because Mr. Bolton did not succeed in his \nattempts to end the careers of analysts whose dissenting views angered \nhim, and because he did not succeed in his attempts to manipulate the \ngovernment's processes to shut out voices of disagreement, caution, or \ndissent, there is no problem here. I cannot believe that any of my \ncolleagues actually believes that is true--not after all that we have \nlearned about the vital importance of dissent in the intelligence \ncommunity from the 9/11 Commission, the Silberman-Robb Commission, and \nnumerous other investigations into the major intelligence failures that \nhave gravely harmed our credibility and our security over the past \nyears. Why would we choose to promote to a position of prominence and \ntrust an individual who has repeatedly tried to suppress inconvenient\n\n[[Page S5973]]\n\nanalysis? As the former Chairman of the National Intelligence Council \ntold the committee staff, politicization ``even when it's successfully \nresisted, it doesn't mean that there hasn't been an effect, because it \ncreates a climate of intimidation and a culture of conformity that is \ndamaging.'' Carl Ford told this committee about his concerns of a \n``chilling effect'' that Bolton's actions with regard to Mr. Westermann \ncould have on all of the analysts in the department's intelligence \nanalysis bureau. And Mr. Westermann told the committee staff that in \nthe wake of his run in with Mr. Bolton, ``I was concerned that I had to \nspend time thinking about how I was approaching issues so that I didn't \nstep on a landmine.'' Attempting to undermine important clearance \nprocesses, attempting to run roughshod over the safeguards in place to \nprotect U.S. credibility, is an awfully big problem, whether or not the \nattempt was successful. It is, in my view, a disqualifying problem.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to examine the record of \nthe Foreign Relations Committee's consideration of this nomination. It \nraises very serious concerns regarding Mr. Bolton's understanding of \nhis obligations to be forthcoming with this committee. Several of Mr. \nBolton's answers to Senators' questions were misleading at best, and \nseveral were quite blatantly non-responsive. A number of these \ninstances relate to Mr. Bolton's efforts to retaliate against \nintelligence analysts, and these are detailed in the minority report on \nthis nominee. But others relate to more general foreign policy issues. \nThe Bush administration's first Ambassador to South Korea, Tom Hubbard, \nwas so troubled by Mr. Bolton's misleading characterization of Mr. \nHubbard's role in approving a controversial speech that Mr. Bolton gave \nin Seoul that he felt obligated to contact the committee to correct the \nrecord.\n  In light of the evidence this committee has seen in recent weeks, \nmost of us can probably agree that if Mr. Bolton does end up being our \nnext Ambassador to the UN, extremely careful oversight will be \nrequired. But our oversight responsibilities depend, in many instances, \non the executive branch officials who come before us understanding that \nthey have a constitutional obligation to be forthcoming with Congress. \nThe record that he has amassed during this confirmation process gives \nme no confidence that Mr. Bolton intends to adhere to this obligation.\n  Mr. Bolton's nomination raises fundamental questions regarding both \ncredibility and accountability. The credibility of our representation \nat the UN, the credibility of intelligence, the credibility of the \noversight process are at stake. And the question of whether or not this \ncommittee will hold officials who seek to suppress dissent accountable \nfor their actions is before us today as well.\n  I deeply appreciate the extraordinary courage of the many people who \ncame forward to share with the Foreign Relations Committee their own \nconcerns about Mr. Bolton's fitness for the UN post or to correct \ninaccuracies in the record--in some cases at real risk to their own \ncareers. I am grateful for their efforts, and deeply appreciate their \nhonesty. I hope that my colleagues will consider their words carefully. \nTheir statements came at a price to them, and they should not be \nignored.\n  In contrast to these admirable public servants--many of whom, by the \nway, I would likely disagree with on any number of important policy \nissues--the administration has failed to be forthcoming in this \nprocess. Mr. President, I share the concerns that have been expressed \nby some of my colleagues on the Committee regarding the \nadministration's failure to respond satisfactorily to requests for \ndocuments and information relating to this confirmation. The \nadministration declined to produce requested documents and information, \napparently because they do not believe the requested information is \nrelevant. Quite frankly, that is not for the administration to \ndetermine. Not only does the administration's rationale fail to respect \nthe Congress as a co-equal branch of Government, it also speaks of bad \nfaith and contempt for the role of Congress in the confirmation \nprocess.\n  Finally, Mr. President, during the committee's consideration of this \nnomination, Senator Sarbanes reminded all of us of the history of the \nposition of the United States Ambassador to the United Nations. He \nlisted the names of all 24 public servants who have held the office. \nTwenty-two of those twenty four were confirmed by unanimous consent, or \nwith unanimous votes, or with voice votes. One was confirmed by a vote \nof 89 to 3. The most controversial Ambassador in our history was \nconfirmed by a vote of 81-16. We have been represented by some very \ndirect, opinionated, colorful characters at the United Nations. But we \nhave never sent a figure so polarizing, or one with credibility so \ntattered, as the nominee before us today. John Bolton does not have the \nsupport of a single Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \nHe does not have the support of a majority of that committee. I do not \nunderstand why the administration is insisting upon thrusting such a \ntroubled nominee into such a sensitive and important post. From \nachieving real reform of the UN to rebuilding US credibility to \ncreating a solid global coalition to combat terrorism, the stakes at \nthe UN are as high as they have ever been. If the President had chosen \na public servant of impeccable judgment, the committee and the Senate \nwould have rallied around that selection, eager to work in partnership \nwith a nominee capable of, and committed to, mending frayed \nrelationships, encouraging real burden-sharing, and nurturing a strong \ninternational coalition to fight terrorism and the proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction. John Bolton is not that nominee. I urge my \ncolleagues to reject this nomination, and let us work together to \nquickly confirm a different nominee--one who represents the President's \nviews but also has the skills, the record, and the confidence of the \nSenate required to be an effective ambassador. We can do, and we should \ndo, much better than John Bolton.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HAGEL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about \nthe nomination of John Bolton. The Presiding Officer is a member of the \nForeign Relations Committee, and we spent a good deal of time listening \nto testimony on the President's nomination of Mr. Bolton to be \nPermanent Representative at the United Nations.\n  On the face of it, he is as well qualified for this position as any \nperson who has ever been nominated for the position. He has a \ndistinguished background, confirmed by this body, I believe, four \ntimes, 4 years ago as Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and \nInternational Security. He was Assistant Secretary for International \nOrganizations under the first President Bush, for whom I served. He was \nassistant to Attorney General of the Department of Justice in the late \n1980s. That would be during the Reagan administration. That is a big \njob. I believe he was the Assistant Attorney General for the Civil \nDivision of the U.S. Department of Justice. He was Assistant \nAdministrator for Program Policy Coordination for USAID in 1982 and \n1983. He was general counsel for the U.S. Agency for International \nDevelopment.\n  He has the kind of academic record all of us would like to have: \nsumma cum laude from Yale, a JDL from Yale Law School.\n  He comes from an enormously distinguished background. As has often \nbeen pointed out on this floor and in committee hearings, he has some \nsolid accomplishments, including leading the American efforts to repeal \nthe resolution at the United Nations which equated Zionism with racism \nand his work with the liberation of Kuwait in 1991 through the U.N. \nSecurity Council. When former U.S. Secretary of State Jim Baker was \nasked to help the United Nations in its work in western Sahara, \nSecretary Baker, who is known for choosing exceptionally talented \npeople to work with him, asked John\n\n[[Page S5974]]\n\nBolton to work with him in the western Sahara in the 1990s pro bono. He \ndesigned the current administration's proliferation security initiative \nunder which more than 60 nations now share intelligence and take action \nto stop the transfer of dangerous weapons.\n  So I was not one bit surprised when Mr. Bolton made an impressive \nappearance before the Foreign Relations Committee on the first day of \nour testimony. He demonstrated command of the issues facing the United \nNations. He got a lot of intense questioning, as he should from \nSenators, for such an important position. The questioning lasted for \nmore than 7 hours. He was calm and collected. He answered the questions \nwith great skill and accuracy, I thought, and he focused on the need \nfor reform of the United Nations.\n  He brought with him for that testimony strong support of former \nSecretaries of State Jim Baker, Larry Eagleberger, Al Hague, Henry \nKissinger, George Shultz, and endorsements from more than 50 former \nambassadors. I was with one of those ambassadors a few weeks ago, a man \nvery well known in this body, a former Senator and majority leader, \nHoward Baker. Howard Baker has just returned from 4 years as Ambassador \nto Japan. He did a tremendous job there, as everyone expected him to, \nbut he remarked to me privately and said I was free to say it \npublicly--in fact, he volunteered the information--about how he had \ndealt with Secretary Bolton during those 4 years in Tokyo, these last 4 \nyears, from time to time, and how impressed he was with him and how \nmuch he enjoyed working with him. He liked him. He said he spoke \nfrankly, and Senator Baker said he thought John Bolton would make a \ngood ambassador to the United Nations.\n  The second day of hearings that the Presiding Officer and I were \nprivileged to be a part of was a little different. I was, frankly, \ndisappointed by what I heard. One of the witnesses was called forward, \nthe former Assistant Secretary for Intelligence and Research, and he \npresented evidence about how John Bolton had, in his words, chewed out \nintelligence analysts in the State Department.\n  Mr. Ford was mad about that. He didn't like the fact that Mr. Bolton \nhad chewed out people on down the line and he came to us and told us \nso. He was a convincing witness. He was believable because he didn't \noverstate his case and the information he gave us was information I \nwould rather not have known about the next ambassador to the United \nNations. I am sure Mr. Bolton was disappointed, perhaps even \nembarrassed to hear it.\n  But Mr. Ford did not say, in the case that we were talking about, \nthat Mr. Bolton was misusing or compromising intelligence. In fact, Mr. \nFord himself said, ``In this particular case''--the one Mr. Ford was \nled to complain about, ``there wasn't politicization of the \nintelligence.'' Mr. Ford was very clear on that point in his testimony \nto the committee.\n  In other interviews conducted by our Foreign Relations Committee \nstaff since that time, another issue was raised about a disagreement \nabout intelligence. One of Mr. Bolton's subordinates who was on detail \nfrom the CIA sent a report to the Deputy Secretary of State for review \nand was unhappy that another bureau had put a memo on top of that \nreport that said the report was incorrect. That certainly sounds like a \nlot of inside baseball to people outside of Washington, and it sounds \nlike a simple disagreement to me, a disagreement over intelligence that \nis quite common, from what even Mr. Ford said. In this case, there is \nno evidence Mr. Bolton was even aware of the dispute. So, again, no \nevidence of politicization of intelligence. Rather, it appeared that \ndifferent staff members were arguing for their own point of view, which \nshould not surprise anyone around here.\n  There have been a variety of other charges and suggestions. Mr. \nBolton has had the pleasure that many Presidential nominees had. I was \nonce a Presidential nominee and went through a confirmation process \nwhen the Senate was in the hands of the Democrats. So they made sure \nthat everything about me was pretty well known and explained. They took \ntime to do it. I was as polite and happy as I could be. No one enjoys \nall of that, but it serves its purpose, and it served its purpose with \nMr. Bolton as well.\n  In the end, it is my judgment, after attending the hearings, reading \nthe testimony, conferring with others who have known Mr. Bolton over \ntime, that only one charge against John Bolton appears to have any \nsubstance. John Bolton has been rude to staff members who are below him \nin the bureaucracy. As I said, I imagine he is embarrassed by that. I \ndidn't like to hear it. Perhaps he deserves to be embarrassed by those \ncharges and perhaps he has even learned a lesson. But what I heard \nhasn't changed my vote, even though it might change Mr. Bolton's ways \nof dealing with people with whom he works.\n\n  How significant is such a charge, that he was rude to people in the \nbureaucracy? As has been mentioned by many others in this body, if that \nwere the standard for remaining in the Senate we would all have a hard \ntime getting a quorum. There are regularly occasions when busy Senators \neager to make their own point are brusque--with staff members, even \nshout at colleagues. In fact, the shouting was so loud in one business \nmeeting of our Foreign Relations Committee by some of the Senators I \ncould barely hear the charges against Mr. Bolton.\n  That is not attractive. I do not endorse it. It has even caused me to \nthink back about times that I may have become angry or brusque or \nimpatient or startled in dealing with a staff member or another person, \nand I have always regretted it when I have and it has made me redouble \nmy efforts to make sure I swallow my pride more quickly and think about \nwhat I say and not do that anymore. It is not good conduct. It is not \ngood business. But just how significant is this?\n  Here is what former Secretary of State Larry Eagleburger had to say \nabout it a couple of weeks ago in the Washington Post. This deserves \nspecial attention.\n  Larry Eagleburger was Secretary of State for the first President \nBush. But, in a way, he was more than that. Larry Eagleburger had 27 \nyears in the Foreign Service. We hear a lot of times that a football \nplayer is a football player's player, or a man is a man's man, or a \nwoman is a woman's woman. Larry Eagleburger is a Foreign Service \nOfficer's Secretary of State. He had and has enormous respect from \nthose men and women who put their lives on the line daily around the \nworld and in the United States in support of our diplomacy, our foreign \npolicy, and our country.\n  Here is what Larry Eagleburger had to say about John Bolton in an op-\ned in the Washington Post:\n\n       ``As to the charge that Bolton has been tough on \n     superordinates,'' Secretary Eagleburger said, ``I can say \n     that only in more than a decade of association with him in \n     the State Department I never saw or heard anything to support \n     such a charge, nor do I see anything wrong with challenging \n     intelligence analysts on their findings. They can, as recent \n     history demonstrates, make mistakes. And they must be \n     prepared to defend their findings under intense questioning. \n     If John pushed too hard or dressed down subordinates, he \n     deserves criticism but it hardly merits a vote against \n     confirmation when balanced against his many \n     accomplishments.''\n\n  That is Larry Eagleburger, the Foreign Service officer's Secretary of \nState.\n  Where Larry Eagleburger comes down is where I come down. I believe \nthe benefit of hearing Mr. Ford's testimony may prove to be a little \nbit of a lesson to Mr. Bolton, and a reminder to the rest of us, us \nSenators, of how unattractive it is to shout at an associate or \nunnecessarily dress down a staff member.\n  I agree with Secretary Eagleburger. John Bolton has a distinguished \nbackground and record. He has dedicated himself to improving our \ncountry's foreign policy. His action toward subordinates might have \nbeen inappropriate. Perhaps he has learned a lesson. But it doesn't \ncause me to change my vote. I am glad to support him.\n  This is a critical time for the United Nations. Even the Secretary \nGeneral acknowledges it is in need of reform. Billions of dollars \nfiltered from the U.N. coffers to Saddam Hussein's pockets in the oil-\nfor-food scandal. Top human rights abusers such as Sudan and Zimbabwe \nsit on the Human Rights Commission. United Nations peacekeepers in \nAfrica have been found to rape and pillage.\n\n[[Page S5975]]\n\n  The United Nations has many important roles in the world. I am glad \nwe have them. I want it to work. The President is right in his thinking \nthat we need to take action to help the United Nations reform itself \nand that a frank-talking, experienced diplomat named John Bolton is an \nexcellent candidate for that commission.\n  I am pleased to support this nomination. I hope my colleagues will do \nthe same.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Natural Gas Prices\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I take a few minutes to speak about \nnatural gas prices, the prices at the pump, blue-collar workers, \nfarmers, and homeowners.\n  The reason I do that is because the Senate Energy Committee earlier \ntoday did a good piece of work that I hope the American people \nunderstand.\n  By a virtually unanimous vote, 21 to 1, the committee, after 5 months \nof work, reported to this body what I hope will be called the Clean \nEnergy Act of 2005.\n  I suppose people outside of the Senate get tired of hearing Senators \ncompliment one another, but I do that today because this would not have \nhappened had it not been for the leadership of Chairman Pete Domenici, \nthe Republican chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, and the ranking Democrat, Jeff Bingaman.\n  We tried to do this in the last session of Congress in the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee. We were not able to pass an energy bill to \ngive this country a comprehensive energy policy. Senator Domenici \ndeliberately set out to do things different in this session of \nCongress. He sat down with Senator Bingaman and the Democratic staff \nand pledged to work with them, to share everything with them. Senator \nDomenici visited every member of the committee, Republican and \nDemocrat. We worked together on a variety of major hearings and \nroundtables. The coal roundtable lasted 3 or 4 hours; one on natural \ngas lasted 3 or 4 hours. He encouraged a variety of committee members \nto become involved.\n  On the Subcommittee on Energy, which I chair, he encouraged me to go \nahead and, working with Senator Tim Johnson of South Dakota from across \nthe aisle, we came up with a Natural Gas Price Reduction Act of 2005 \ninto which we put ideas to bring down the $7 natural gas price we have \ntoday, which is the highest natural gas price in the world. Senator \nDomenici and Senator Bingaman did their best to come up with aggressive \nideas.\n  Sometimes when Members set out to compromise and work together, we \nend up with nothing because the easiest way to compromise is to do \nnothing. We can all agree on doing nothing and then we will not have a \nbold bill. But we are almost fortunate this did not pass last year \nbecause this is a more urgent time. The natural gas prices are $7, the \nhighest in the industrial world. We have gone from the lowest in the \nindustrial world to the highest in the industrial world. Prices at the \npump are high. We have a million blue-collar manufacturing jobs in the \nchemical industry alone that will go overseas if we do not find some \nway to deal with this.\n  September 11 was a big surprise to our country. Our next big surprise \nis going to be to our pocketbooks if we do not figure out how to deal \nwith the price of energy. We must figure out how to have a low-cost, \nadequate, reliable supply of clean energy that is increasingly produced \nin the United States of America and not overseas. That is our goal.\n  What is exceptional about this bill, in my view, is that it attacks \nthe problem in a much more comprehensive way than other versions of the \nbill have. It begins with aggressive conservation. For example, the \nappliance efficiency standards, which are in this year's bill, are \nabout double the effectiveness of those that were in last year's bill. \nWhat does that mean? It simply means that by some estimates these \nstandards could save at peak demand the equivalent of 45 500-megawatt \npowerplants. If we save building 45 gas powerplants, we decrease the \nbuilding of natural gas and we tend to lower the price.\n\n  There are a good many other examples of aggressive conservation. The \nsecond thing the bill does is to begin to change the way we produce \nelectricity. This country produces about 25 percent of all the energy \nin the world. We use it here. We have 5 to 6 percent of the American \npeople and we produce 25 percent of the energy. Where does that \nelectricity come from? It comes primarily from what we call \nnonrenewables. It comes from, first, coal; natural gas, second; and \nnuclear, third. That is 91 percent of it. Now, another 7 percent comes \nfrom dams from hydropower and about 2 percent comes from renewable \npower, which is windmills, solar, biomass, and geothermal.\n  If we are in competition with China and India for jobs, and an \nimportant part of every farm, every manufacturing plant, every home, is \nthe provision of reliable, low-cost, adequate supply of energy, as a \npractical matter for the next 20 years, most of that will have to come \nfrom nuclear power, from coal, and from gas and conservation. That is \nwhere it has to come.\n  Of course, we want to do more with other kinds of energy. For \nexample, I hope the tax committee, when it reports its part of this \nbill, does something about solar power. We have a renewable tax credit \nin the law today that does not do much for solar. It encourages \npowerplants that produce electricity from sun. We almost don't have any \nof those. What we use solar for is, we put shingles on roofs. We need \nto give incentives to individual owners to do more of that. That's why \nI proposed an investment tax credit so individual owners can take \nadvantage of it.\n  We can do more research and development in biomass and more research \nand development in geothermal. Even if we do all that we can do for the \nso-called renewable energies, in the next 20 years--and there is some \ndisagreement about this--in my view, we will still be producing about \n95 percent of our power--certainly not less than 90 percent of our \npower--from nuclear power, from coal, from gas, and hydro.\n  Now, how many more dams are going to be built in the United States? \nIt is limited. In fact, this bill addresses relicensing of hydro dams. \nThere are a good number of those in Oregon where the Presiding Officer \ncomes from. By the year 2018, according to the National Hydropower \nAssociation, there will be 30,000 MW of hydropower plants that need to \nbe relicensed. That's half of the hydropower in the United States. This \nlandmark, bipartisan agreement on hydro relicensing is both urgent and \nmeaningful.\n  So if one puts all of that aside, if we want to compete for our jobs \nwith people from around the world and if the price of energy is a big \npart of it, what do we have to do? Nuclear, coal and gas.\n  Over the last 10 years, almost all of the new powerplants in America \nthat make electricity have been built from natural gas. Now, how wise \nis that? Here we are with $7 a unit natural gas, the highest price in \nthe industrialized world, our chemical companies, our blue-collar \ncompanies using this, some of them as a raw material--Dow Chemical \nestimates that 40 percent of the cost of its production is energy. Now, \nif in other parts of the world natural gas is significantly lower, we \nwill have a problem. We will have jobs moving from here to there.\n  We do not want to make all of our power from natural gas. We do it \nbecause we know how to do it and because it is clean. That leaves us \nwith two sources of what we call base load energy, the two things that \nwe must find a way to use and use in a clean way if we want to have a \nlow-cost supply of American-produced energy. One of those is nuclear, \nand one of those is coal.\n  Nuclear power is a technology that we invented in the United States, \nthe peaceful uses of the atom. We figured out how to do that in the \n1950s. One of the remarkable technological stories in the United States \nis our Navy and its nuclear-powered vessels. I suppose it is a \nclassified matter exactly how many we have, but we have dozens of them. \nSome of them have small reactors. Some of them have a couple of big \nreactors on them.\n  Since the 1950s, there has never been one single nuclear reactor \naccident in the U.S. Navy, not one. They are underwater. When they are \nabove water,\n\n[[Page S5976]]\n\nthey dock at ports all around the United States, and we use them. In \nour country today, 20 percent of all of our electricity and 70 percent \nof our carbon-free electricity is produced by nuclear energy. Yet we \nhave not built a nuclear powerplant in the United States since the \n1970s, not one new one. How wise is that?\n  Other countries in the world are. Eighty percent of France's \nelectricity is now produced by nuclear power. Japan, ravaged by nuclear \nweapons in World War II, relies on nuclear power. They build one or two \nnew plants a year.\n  We are in competition to keep jobs here. We want clean power. We \nincreasingly want carbon-free power. If 70 percent of our carbon-free \nelectricity is nuclear, then what is keeping us from going ahead? This \nbill will help us move ahead because it makes it easier for investors \nto build nuclear powerplants that are safe.\n  Senator Domenici has come up with an imaginative loan guarantee \nprogram that would help launch an entire new generation of nuclear \npowerplants. Senator Craig, Senator Domenici, and Senator Bingaman have \ncome up with a program that will be based in Idaho for advanced \nresearch on how we build lower cost, more effective nuclear powerplants \nfor our country. There is a growing consensus, especially as the Kyoto \nTreaty and the need to be concerned about global warming persuades more \nand more people of the importance of capturing carbon, that nuclear \npower for the next 15 or 20 years is the only logical first step to \nhaving a low-cost, adequate, reliable supply of American-produced clean \nenergy. Britain recently has been coming to the same conclusion that \nnuclear is a necessity for a carbon-free emissions future.\n  What is the other step? The other step is coal. We instinctively \nthink coal is dirty and it is a source of a lot of problems because of \nthe pollution it causes.\n  I live 2 miles away from the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. It \nis the most polluted national park in America. The Knoxville area where \nI live is one of the most polluted parts of our country. Why is that? \nThere is too much sulphur, too much nitrogen, and too much mercury in \nthe air. Much of that comes from coal-fired powerplants, not just from \nthe Tennessee Valley Authority, which has a number of them in the area, \nbut from all over America. The wind blows the air in, and it backs up \nagainst the Great Smoky Mountains, which are the highest mountains in \nthe East, and we breathe the dirty air. So any energy bill has to be a \nclean energy bill so we can solve our air pollution problems.\n  There is an even larger issue with coal-fired powerplants. India and \nChina, with their huge economies, a couple of billion more people, are \ngoing to be building hundreds of powerplants in the next few years. The \nconventional coal plant is what many of those plants will be. If India, \nChina, Malaysia, Brazil, and the rest of the world build only \nconventional coal plants, it will not matter very much what our clean \nair policies are in the United States because they will produce so many \npollutants around the world that when the wind blows them around the \nworld and over the air in the United States, we will suffer from that. \nSo if we solve the problem of how to burn coal in a clean way, then the \nrest of the world is likely to pick up our innovation and solve their \nproblem because they do not want to have polluted air, either.\n  So how do we do that? Well, there seems to be a way to do it. We call \nit coal gasification. There are several technologies. I like to call it \nclean coal gas because that makes it a little easier to talk about.\n  The New York Times business section had an excellent article on this \non Sunday that Senator Domenici gave to all of us. It talked about this \nidea of taking coal, turning it into gas, and then burning the gas. \nThat solves a great amount of the pollution. It solves the sulphur, the \nnitrogen, and the mercury part of the pollution, but it does not solve \nthe carbon part.\n  Then what we need to try to do is to advance the technology of \ncapturing and sequestering the carbon--in other words, getting rid of \nthe carbon. If we are ever able to do that, we could burn coal as \ncleanly as we can burn gas, capture the carbon and put it in the \nground, and we would never have to worry about the Kyoto Treaty. We \nwould never have to worry about the McCain-Lieberman bill or the \nCarper-Chafee-Gregg-Alexander bill or caps on carbon because we would \nnot be producing carbon. We would be producing it and recapturing it. \nNuclear power is free of it, and clean coal gasification with carbon \nsequestration captures it and gets rid of it.\n\n  The other thing is that we are the Saudi Arabia of coal. We have a \n500-year supply of it. So if we can move ahead with nuclear and clean \ncoal gas, we can lower the price of natural gas, and we can have more \nAmerican-produced energy.\n  So this legislation begins with aggressive conservation. As I said, \nthe appliance efficiency standards alone would save the building of \nforty-five 500-megawatt gas plants, but then it begins to change the \nway we make electricity by research and development in advanced nuclear \ntechnology, by the loan guarantee support which could be for nuclear \nplants of that kind. It also has loan guarantees that I hope would help \nlaunch a half dozen coal gasification powerplants and a half dozen coal \ngasification plants at industrial sites. It also has research and \ndevelopment support for carbon sequestration and for other technologies \nthat hold promise.\n  We still have some issues to work on. We began with what we could \nagree on, worked 5 months on it under the leadership of Senators \nDomenici and Bingaman, and reserved a few issues to the floor. Senator \nDomenici announced that we will be coming to the Senate floor shortly \nafter the recess, in a completely different spirit than last year, with \nall of us hoping to get a result. We will then put that bill with the \nHouse bill and present to this country a clean energy act of 2005 that \nwill lower natural gas prices, begin to produce more American energy at \nhome, include more aggressive conservation, change the way we make \nelectricity, and focus especially on advanced technologies for nuclear, \ncoal gasification, and the supply of gas.\n  In the short term, we are going to have to bring more gas in from \naround the world in liquefied natural gas. I'm pleased that the \ncommittee adopted the ideas I and Senator Johnson had on LNG siting in \nthe energy bill.\n  There is one other area I want to mention without dwelling on it too \nmuch. One of the things I hope happens as we debate this bill is that \nit doesn't change from a national energy policy into a national \nwindmill policy. I say that because one of the issues we have pushed \nout to be debated on the floor is something called a renewable \nportfolio standard, renewable energy. That all sounds very good. The \nproposal was, let's make 10 percent of all of our electricity by the \nyear 2025 from renewable energies. That sounds good, too.\n  The problem is, I don't think it will work because all we are talking \nabout is geothermal--that is hot water from the ground--solar, which \nour incentives today don't help much, and biomass, which is burning \nwood chips and other such technologies. According to a Department of \nEnergy analysis, even if we had such a requirement of all our electric \ncompanies that they produce 10 percent of their energy from renewable \nfuels, they couldn't do it. They could only get to 5 percent due to the \nway the Bingaman price caps are structured. So what utilities would do \nrealistically is buy credits in a complicated scheme which would then \nraise the price of our electricity. We should be in the business of \nlowering energy prices, not raising them for nothing.\n  The other concern I have is that a renewable portfolio standard is \nreally a wind standard because geothermal and solar and biomass will \nonly increase it a tiny bit. This information I have is from an \nanalysis that the Energy Information Agency did on Bingman's bill shows \nclearly that the impact of a Bingaman RPS is growing windpower. The \nonly way to go forward is with windmills. So the effect of continuing \nthe current policy is to take this country from about 6,700 windmills \nto 40, 60, 80,000, depending on estimates that you believe. My point is \nnot to make a big discussion about the windmills themselves. I don't \nlike to see them. I think most people don't. The Governor of Kansas has \nput a moratorium on some windmills, as has the Governor of New Jersey, \nand so have communities in\n\n[[Page S5977]]\n\nmany parts of America, such as Vermont and Wisconsin. I asked the \nTennessee Valley Authority to put a 2-year moratorium on new wind power \non Tennessee until we could assess the damage it might cause to our \ntourism industry and to our electric rates and to our view of the \nmountains.\n  People think of windmills and think those are nice. Grandma had one \non her farm. It was by the well. My grandparents did. But these aren't \nyour grandmother's windmills.\n  We have the second largest football stadium in the United States in \nKnoxville, TN. We call it Neyland Stadium. One hundred seven thousand \npeople can sit there, and it has sky boxes that go up as high as you \ncan see. Just one of these windmills would fit into Neyland Stadium. \nThe rotor blades would extend from the 10-yard line to the 10-yard \nline. The top of the windmill would go twice as high as the sky boxes \nor more. And on a clear night you could see the red lights 25 miles \naway. There are significant problems with this power. It only works 25 \nto 40 percent of the time. You don't get rid of any nuclear or coal \nplants when you have the windmills because you still need the power. \nYou can't store the energy for your lights or your computer and all the \nthings you use electricity for going all the time. So there are many \nproblems.\n  But here is the biggest problem, the one I want to mention today. I \nwill just leave it for the members of the Finance Committee upon which \nthe Presiding Officer serves and others. This Energy bill will have \nthree parts to it. It will have some things from the Energy Committee \nwhich we have finished today. It will have a contribution from the \nFinance Committee, which will come in June, and it will have a \ncontribution from the Environment and Public Works Committee, which \nwill also come in June. We will put all those parts together.\n  We are told that this whole bill, when it is put together, can't \ncost, our Budget Committee says, more than $11 billion. The President \nhopes we won't spend more than $8 billion. But the production tax \ncredit in the current policy provides $3.9 billion over 5 years, almost \nall of which will go to windmills unless we change the policy.\n  In other words, if we have $11 billion to spend and we spend $3 \nbillion on ethanol or renewable fuel, we will only have $8 billion left \nto spend on everything else, and nearly 3.5 to 4 of it will go for \nwindmills. That is what I mean by a national windmill policy.\n  My hope is that my colleagues will take a fresh look at our tax \ncredit for renewable fuels and make sure that we use it wisely because \nthat is a lot of money to create the largest amount of carbon-free \nclean energy.\n  Here are some of the suggestions for better use: For example, $1.5 \nbillion for consumer incentives for 300,000 hybrid and advanced diesel \nvehicles. That would give 300,000 Americans a $2,000 deduction to \npurchase a hybrid car or an advanced diesel vehicle. Those operate \nabout 40 percent more efficiently than conventional cars. That saves a \nlot of energy. For $750 million, we could give manufacturing incentives \nfor building those hybrid cars and advanced vehicles in the United \nStates. Unfortunately, as it stands now, we aren't doing that. They \nwould all be built overseas because most of the good hybrid technology \nhas been invented overseas and is being rented to the United States. \nThat would be 39,000 jobs in the United States.\n  I have with me a copy of the National Commission on Energy Policy \nwhich recommends both of these ideas, the $2,000 tax deduction and the \nincentive for manufacturing of hybrid cars. That would be a wise way to \nspend money for clean carbon-free energy.\n  There are many more good ideas: $2 billion in tax incentives for \nenergy-efficient appliances and buildings, suggested by Senators Snowe \nand Feinstein. Senator Johnson and I had suggested $2 billion for tax \nincentives to commercialize coal gasification for powerplants and $300 \nmillion to make more effective support of another renewable energy, \nsolar energy, which has basically no support the way our laws are \nwritten today.\n\n  The National Commission on Energy Policy has several other \nrecommendations: Build in tax incentives to commercialize carbon \ncapture and geologic sequestration in a wide array of industries. As \nsoon as we figure out how to capture carbon, we can use coal \ngasification in a big way to reduce dependence on foreign energy and to \nlower the cost of natural gas.\n  They also recommend $2 billion in tax incentives for nuclear \ndeployment, $1.5 billion for biodiesel and nonpetroleum low-carbon \nfuels. I have suggested those in the order in which I like them.\n  I am not a member of the Finance Committee so I won't have a chance \nto be a part of that discussion in that committee. My point is simply \nthat if we have $8 billion to spend or $11 billion to spend, we may \nhave already spent a couple of billion in what we are doing with \nrenewable fuel, then we have a lot more good ways to spend money in \nsupport of carbon-free energy than we have money for. I respectfully \nsuggest that if we are spending most of $3.7 billion over the next 5 \nyears as a national windmill policy and not a national energy policy, \nthat ought to be reasonably adjusted.\n  Let me not emphasize the disputes that we have yet to come. I am here \ntoday to say, particularly, after a time in the Senate when people who \nwatch us must wonder if we are speaking to each other, the answer is, \nyes, we are. We have been meeting for 5 months on this Energy bill. We \nhave been working together, as Senator Bingaman said today. I don't \nremember a party-line vote in the 5 months. We had some close votes, \nbut it wasn't Republican versus Democrat. It was just different ones of \nus with different opinions. And there must have been half the committee \nthere today when Senators Domenici and Bingaman announced the results \nat a press conference.\n  So I honor them for their leadership. I think the American people are \nproud of Domenici and Bingaman as Senators. New Mexico ought to be \nproud. It has both of them from the same State. Even though we have \nCAFE standards still to debate, MTBE still to debate, we have some \nfinal work to do on how do we site terminals for liquefied natural gas, \nfurther increasing the supply of natural gas, and we will be debating \nthe so-called renewable portfolio standard for how many windmills we \nshould have--all that will be sometime in June. That is what we are \nsupposed to do as Senators.\n  That is why we are here, to take both sides of this issue and see if \nwe can come to a good result. So far, I think we have.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nfollowing my speech the article on coal gasification from the New York \nTimes business section on Sunday; a letter I wrote to the directors of \nthe Tennessee Valley Authority, asking them to put a 2-year moratorium \non wind power until we had an opportunity--we in Congress and local \nofficials--to consider the effect of these large wind farms on our \ntourism industry, on our view of the mountains, on our gas prices; and \nfinally, an article from the Guardian Unlimited, which is an \ninteresting discussion of what is going on in Great Britain, as they \nconsider how to meet the Kyoto standard for carbon-free electricity \nproduction, and how many of the people who formerly had favored large \nwindmills are concluding they don't want them destroying the rural \nareas of Britain, and they are looking at nuclear power in a fresh way \nwhich, as I mentioned, is the way we in the United States today produce \n70 percent of our carbon-free electricity.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, May 22, 2005]\n\n            Dirty Secret: Coal Plants Could Be Much Cleaner\n\n                         (By Kenneth J. Stier)\n\n       Almost a decade ago, Tampa Electric opened an innovative \n     power plant that turned coal, the most abundant but the \n     dirtiest fossil fuel, into a relatively clean gas, which it \n     burns to generate electricity. Not only did the plant emit \n     significantly less pollution than a conventional coal-fired \n     power plant, but it was also 10 percent more efficient.\n       Hazel R. O'Leary, the secretary of energy at the time, went \n     to the plant, situated between Tampa and Orlando, and praised \n     it for ushering in a ``new era for clean energy from coal.'' \n     Federal officials still refer to the plant's ``integrated \n     gasification combined cycle'' process as a ``core \n     technology'' for the future, especially because of its \n     ability--eventually--to all but eliminate the greenhouse \n     gases linked to global warming.\n       Since that plant opened, however, not a single similar \n     plant bas been built in the\n\n[[Page S5978]]\n\n     United States. Abundant supplies of natural gas--a bit \n     cleaner and, until recently, a lot cheaper--stood in the way.\n       But even now, with gas prices following oil prices into the \n     stratosphere and power companies turning back to coal, most \n     new plants--about nine out of 10 on the drawing board--will \n     not use integrated gasification combined-cycle technology.\n       The reason is fairly simple. A plant with the low-\n     pollution, high-efficiency technology demonstrated at the \n     Tampa Electric plant is about 20 percent more expensive to \n     build than a conventional plant that burns pulverized coal. \n     This complicates financing, especially in deregulated \n     markets, while elsewhere utilities must persuade regulators \n     to set aside their customary standard of requiring utilities \n     to use their lowest-cost alternatives. (A federal grant of \n     $143 million covered about a fourth of the construction cost \n     of the Tampa Electric plant, which was originally a \n     demonstration project.)\n       The technology's main long-term advantage--the ability to \n     control greenhouse gas emissions--is not winning over many \n     utilities because the country does not yet regulate those \n     gases.\n       That could be a problem for future national policy, critics \n     say, because the plants being planned today will have a \n     lifetime of a half-century or more. ``It's a very frightening \n     specter that we are going to essentially lock down our carbon \n     emissions for the next 50 years before we have another chance \n     to think about it again,'' said Jason S. Grumet, the \n     executive director of the National Commission on Energy \n     Policy.\n       The commission, an independent, bipartisan advisory body, \n     has recommended that the federal government spend an \n     additional $4 billion over 10 years to speed the power \n     industry's acceptance of the technology. In a recent report, \n     the commission concluded that ``the future of coal and the \n     success of greenhouse gas mitigation policies may well hinge \n     to a large extent on whether this technology can be \n     successfully commercialized and deployed over the next 20 \n     years.''\n       Mr. Grumet was more succinct. Integrated gasification \n     combined cycle technology, combined with the sequestration of \n     carbon stripped out in the process, ``is as close to a silver \n     bullet as you're ever going to see,'' he said.\n       Until Congress regulates carbon emissions--a move that many \n     in the industry consider inevitable, but unlikely soon--\n     gasification technology will catch on only as its costs \n     gradually come down. Edward Lowe, general manager of \n     gasification for GE Energy, a division of General Electric \n     that works with Bechtel to build integrated gasification \n     combined-cycle plants, said that would happen as more plants \n     were built. The premium should disappear entirely after the \n     first dozen or so are completed, he added.\n       Even now, Mr. Lowe said, the technology offers operational \n     cost savings that offset some of the higher constructIon \n     costs. And if Congress eventually does limit carbon \n     emissions, as many utility executives say they expect it to \n     do, the technology's operational advantages could make it a \n     bargain.\n       James E. Rogers, the chief executive of Cinergy, a heavily \n     coal-dependent Midwestern utility, is one of the technology's \n     biggest industry supporters. ``I'm making a bet on \n     gasification,'' he said, because he assumes a carbon-\n     constrained world is inevitable. ``I don't see any other way \n     forward,'' he said.\n       The operating savings of such plants start with more \n     efficient combustion: they make use of at least 15 percent \n     more of the energy released by burning coal than conventional \n     plants do, so less fuel is needed. The plants also need about \n     40 percent less water than conventional coal plants, a \n     significant consideration in arid Western states.\n       But for some people, including Mr. Rogers and other utility \n     leaders who anticipate stricter pollution limits, the primary \n     virtue of integrated gasification combined-cycle plants is \n     their ability to chemically strip pollutants from gasified \n     coal more efficiently and cost-effectively, before it is \n     burned, rather than trying to filter it out of exhaust.\n       Proponents say that half of coal's pollutants--including \n     sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, which contribute to acid \n     rain and smog--can be chemically stripped out before \n     combustion. So can about 95 percent of the mercury in coal, \n     at about a tenth the cost of trying to scrub it from exhaust \n     gases racing up a smokestack.\n       The biggest long-term draw for gasification technology is \n     its ability to capture carbon before combustion. If \n     greenhouse-gas limits are enacted, that job will be much \n     harder and more expensive to do with conventional coal-fired \n     plants. Mr. Lowe, the G.E. executive, estimated that \n     capturing carbon would add about 25 percent to the cost of \n     electricity from a combined-cycle plant burning gasified \n     coal, but that it would add 70 percent to the price of power \n     from conventional plants.\n       Gasification technology, although new to the power sector, \n     has been widely used in the chemical industry for decades, \n     and the general manager of the gasification plant run by \n     Tampa Electric, Mark Hornick, said it was not difficult to \n     train his employees to run the plant. Tampa Electric is the \n     principal subsidiary of TECO Energy of Tampa.\n       Disposing of the carbon dioxide gas stripped out in the \n     process, however, is another matter. Government laboratories \n     have experimented with dissolving the gas in saline aquifers \n     or pumping it into geologic formations under the sea. The \n     petroleum industry has long injected carbon dioxide into oil \n     fields to help push more crude to the surface.\n       Refining and commercializing these techniques is a \n     significant part of a $35 billion package of clean energy \n     incentives that the National Commission on Energy Policy is \n     recommending. The Senate considered some of those ideas in a \n     big energy policy bill last week, but it is doubtful whether \n     Congress will approve the funds to enact them because they \n     are tied to regulating big carbon emissions for the first \n     time, something that many industry leaders and sympathetic \n     lawmakers oppose.\n       Still, the energy bill may have some incentives for \n     industry to adopt gasification technology, and the Department \n     of Energy will continue related efforts. These include \n     FutureGen, a $950 million project to demonstrate \n     gasification's full potential--not just for power plants but \n     as a source of low-carbon liquid fuels for cars and trucks as \n     well, and, further out, as a source of hydrogen fuel.\n       Regardless of the politics of carbon caps, the Energy \n     Department has made it clear that it intends to push the \n     development of integrated gasification combined-cycle \n     technology. Last month, for example, Mark Maddox, a deputy \n     assistant secretary, said at an industry gathering that the \n     technology ``is needed in the mix--needed now.''\n       Some industry leaders are skeptical, to say the least. ``We \n     would not want to put all of our eggs in one basket as far as \n     a single technology is concerned,'' said William Fang, deputy \n     counsel for the Edison Electric Institute, a trade \n     association whose members, shareholder-owned utilities, \n     account for three-quarters of the country's generating \n     capacity.\n       Besides, he added, many of his members think that mandatory \n     carbon controls, in place in much of the world since the \n     Kyoto Protocol came into force in February, can be kept at \n     bay in the United States--possibly indefinitely.\n       It's a risky strategy--for industry and for the climate. \n     ``Coal-fired plants are big targets,'' said Judi Greenwald of \n     the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, ``and if we do get \n     serious about climate change, they are going to be on the \n     list of things to do quite early.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 23, 2005.\n     Hon. Skila Harris,\n     Tennessee Valley Authority, Knoxville, TN.\n     Hon. Bill Baxter,\n     Tennessee Valley Authority, Knoxville, TN.\n       Dear Skila and Bill: Recently Sen. John Warner of Virginia \n     and I introduced the ``Environmentally Responsible Windpower \n     Act'' which would:\n       1. Stop federal subsidies for giant windmills near highly \n     scenic areas, such as the Great Smokies and Grand Canyon, and\n       2. Give communities a l20-day opportunity to have some say \n     in whether and where these huge machines will be located in \n     their communities and neighborhoods.\n       Today I am writing to ask that TVA place a two-year \n     moratorium on construction of new wind farms--either by TVA \n     or on TVA-controlled land--until the new TVA board, Congress \n     and local officials can evaluate the impact of these massive \n     structures on our electric rates, our view of the mountains \n     and our tourism industry. The governors of Kansas and New \n     Jersey have recently imposed similar moratoria. Local \n     moratoria have been adopted in parts of Vermont and \n     Wisconsin.\n       The idea of windmills conjures up pleasant images--of \n     Holland and tulips, of rural America with windmill blades \n     slowly turning, pumping water at the farm well. My \n     grandparents had such a windmill at their well pump.\n       But these are not your grandmother's windmills.\n       Most new windmills are about 300 feet high--as tall as a \n     football field is long or as tall as the Statue of Liberty. \n     Their rotor blades are wider than the wingspan of a 747 jumbo \n     jet and turn at up to 100 miles per hour. Each tower costs \n     more than $1 million to erect, and, once constructed, the \n     towers will be around for a long time. For example, TVA's new \n     18-windmill farm on Buffalo Mountain is a 20-year contract.\n       Only one of these giant windmills could fit into UT's \n     Neyland stadium. It would rise more than twice as high as the \n     highest skybox, its rotor blades would stretch almost from \n     10-yard line to 10-yard line, and on a clear night its \n     flashing red lights could be seen for 20 miles--the distance \n     from Knoxville to Maryville. Usually these windmills are \n     grouped in windfarms of 20 or more.\n       Our country needs a national clean energy policy, not a \n     national windmill policy. TVA is a national leader in \n     producing clean energy through nuclear and hydroelectric \n     power. A moratorium on windmills would give Tennesseans two \n     years to stop and think about the wisdom and cost of building \n     hundreds of 100-yard tall structures across our most scenic \n     ridges.\n       Here are some of the facts I have gathered so far:\n       There are 6,700 windmills in the United States today; by \n     2025, that number could grow to somewhere between 40,000 and \n     100,000, according to varying estimates.\n       Even if only a few hundred of those windmills are built in \n     Tennessee, most will be built on top of mountain ridges \n     according to Senate testimony by Kerry W. Bowers, Technology \n     Manager of Southern Company. That could damage our tourism \n     industry.\n\n[[Page S5979]]\n\n       These giant windmills are being built primarily because of \n     a huge federal taxpayer subsidy, about $3 billion over the \n     next five years if present policies continue. Without these \n     federal tax breaks, American Wind Energy Association \n     statistics suggest that three out of four windmills would not \n     be built across the country because they aren't cost-\n     effective producers of power.\n       Once those tax credits expire, TVA ratepayers would likely \n     have to pick up most of the tab for the higher cost of the \n     power.\n       These windmills may be huge, but they don't produce much \n     power. It would take at least 1,300 windmills--covering the \n     land mass of almost one and one half times the city of \n     Knoxville--to produce as much power as TVA's new Brown's \n     Ferry nuclear plant.\n       Because they only work when the wind blows the right speed \n     (20 to 40 percent of the time), and customers need their \n     electricity almost all the time, building more windmills does \n     not mean building fewer coal or nuclear power plants.\n       Since windy ridgetops are not usually where the largest \n     number of people live, windmills are likely to be built away \n     from population centers and therefore require the building of \n     miles of new transmission lines through neighborhoods and \n     communities.\n       So, these oversized windmills produce a puny amount of \n     unreliable power in a way that costs more than coal or \n     nuclear power, requires new transmission lines, must be \n     subsidized by massive federal tax breaks, and, in my view, \n     destroys the landscape.\n       Chattanooga has just spent 20 years improving its \n     waterfront, saving the Tennessee River Gorge and renaming \n     itself the Scenic City. The Great Smoky Mountains attract 10 \n     million visitors a year. Do we really now want to string \n     hundreds of towers with flashing red lights as tall as \n     football fields on Signal and Lookout Mountains, the \n     foothills of the Smokies and Roan Mountain? It's hard to \n     imagine that 10 million visitors would come to the foothills \n     of the Smokies each year to see windmills.\n       As chairman of the Senate Energy Subcommittee, I intend to \n     examine whether it is wise to provide $3 billion in subsidies \n     over the next five years for the building of tens of \n     thousands of giant windmills across America, when the same \n     amount of money might, for example, give $1,000 incentives to \n     more than 300,000 purchasers of hybrid or advanced diesel \n     vehicles. As chairman of the Tennessee Valley Authority \n     Congressional Caucus, I intend to do my best to make local \n     officials aware of their options to decide for themselves \n     whether these structures belong in their communities.\n       Our country needs lower prices for energy and an adequate \n     supply of low-cost, reliable American-produced clean energy. \n     Wind doesn't fit the bill: it is a high-cost, unreliable \n     supply of energy. While we are considering what the \n     appropriate policies should be, I hope that TVA will help by \n     placing a two-year moratorium on any new wind farms.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Lamar Alexander,\n     United States Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   [From The Observer, May 22, 2005]\n\n        Tilting at Windmills: Nation Split Over Energy Eyesores\n\n                           (By Mark Townsend)\n\n       Hundreds of turbines will be switched on this year, and the \n     volume of protest is rising. Mark Townsend reports on the \n     issue that will overtake hunting as a cause of rural unrest.\n       The clue lies in the grass, pummelled and then flattened by \n     a force the area is famous for. Whinash is all about wind, \n     and it is a resource which has put the Lakeland beauty spot \n     at the heart of Britain's debate about the country's \n     insatiable need for energy.\n       The site--amid the classic Cumbrian vista of rolling fells \n     criss-crossed with dry stone walls and the shuffling specks \n     of sheep--is to be home to England's largest wind farm. If \n     the plans ever get the go-ahead.\n       This week, the public inquiry to site 27 turbines, each \n     almost the height of St. Paul's Cathedral, on the ridge of \n     Whinash enters its most potentially explosive phase. Two of \n     Cumbria's favourite sons, the broadcaster Melvyn Bragg and \n     the mountaineer Sir Chris Bonington, are scheduled to give \n     evidence in the squat Garden Room of the remote Shap Wells \n     Hotel. There can be no place for 21st-century windmills in a \n     Wilderness largely-unaltered for centuries, they will argue.\n       Almost 200 miles north in Aberdeen, Malcolm Wicks will mark \n     his entrance as the new energy minister by stressing the \n     crucial role of wind power in the crusade against climate \n     change. Only weeks into his new brief, Wicks appreciates that \n     wind farms are already eclipsing farming and foxhunting as \n     the most likely source of rural unrest during Labour's third \n     term.\n       Ministers, aware that the government's target of cutting \n     carbon dioxide emissions is in jeopardy, have identified \n     Whinash as the acid test of whether they can expect that \n     renewable energy will provide 10 percent of power in five \n     years' time.\n       But the significance of Whinash runs even deeper. Among the \n     windblown crags that lie between the national parks of the \n     Lake District and the Yorkshire Dales, the schism that is \n     tearing Britain's environmental movement from top to bottom \n     is most pronounced.\n       The self-appointed custodian for future generations, \n     Britain's green lobby has found itself caught between the \n     need to protect the landscape from global warming and \n     defending Britain's countryside from the creation of a \n     `pseudo-industrial' skyline. This month, one of the \n     movement's most influential figures James Lovelock, the man \n     who developed the Gaia theory of the forces governing nature, \n     will launch his most candid critique yet of Britain's energy \n     conundrum by accusing groups such as Greenpeace and Friends \n     of the Earth of betraying the planet through their unswerving \n     promotion of wind energy.\n       Nuclear energy, Lovelock will claim, offers the only \n     solution to the twin challenges of providing Britain with a \n     reliable energy supply and global warming.\n       Britain currently stands poised at the start of the `wind \n     rush'. Hundreds more turbines in 18 new wind farms will be \n     switched on by the end of the year. Already the UK is poised \n     to become the world's biggest producer of power from offshore \n     wind farms, a reminder of the 17th century, when Britain \n     boasted 90,000 windmills.\n       Around one per cent of the UK's energy is currently \n     provided by wind although the Industry claims there are \n     enough applications moving through the planning process to \n     suggest seven per cent of the nation's electricity needs will \n     be met by wind by 2010.\n       Next month the 300ft turbines at Cefn Croes, scene of the \n     bitterest wrangle before Whinash, will start turning in mid-\n     Wales. Yet pressure is mounting on the fledgling industry. If \n     Britain's climate change targets are not met, experts warn \n     that the generous subsidies which have helped establish wind \n     farms could be withdrawn by an exasperated government.\n       Already a new era for nuclear power appears to be dawning \n     and seems certain to feature prominently in the government's \n     forthcoming energy review. Vastly more expensive than \n     predicted and plagued by persistent safety concerns, \n     nuclear's strength remains its proven reliability. And even \n     those who have lived in the shadow of Sellafield, 30 miles \n     west across central Lakeland from Whinash, are beginning to \n     believe nuclear is the saviour.\n       Sir Christopher Audland shook his head as he tramped along \n     the pummelled cotton grass tufts of the Whinash site last \n     Tuesday afternoon. A former director-general of energy for \n     the European Commission, Audland was in charge when reactor \n     number four exploded in the Ukraine almost 20 years ago, its \n     radioactive contents drifting from Chernobyl to the fells of \n     Cumbria where his family has lived for 500 years. For a \n     man who saw first-hand the inherent risk of nuclear power, \n     Audland is dismissive of the safer alternative proposed \n     for the hills north of Kendal. `It cannot be allowed to \n     happen here,' he said.\n       Bragg, who has relatives who happily work at Sellafield, is \n     among the growing Lakeland fraternity who believes nuclear is \n     the sale viable option for tackling climate change.\n       `We seem to be running away from the safest, most efficient \n     industry. Nuclear energy seems to be the only sensible option \n     and it is a safe option,' said the presenter of The South \n     Bank Show. It is a consensus corroborated by Lovelock, who in \n     1991 opened Britain's first windfarm at Delabole, Cornwall. \n     Since then, Lovelock has reviewed his initial enthusiasm.\n       `To phase out nuclear energy just when we need it most to \n     combat global warming is madness,' he said. `The anti-nuclear \n     agenda is pushed by groups such as Greenpeace and Friends of \n     the Earth and by Green Party politicians. They are pursuing \n     goals in which neither environmental good sense nor science \n     plays a part--a strange way to defend the earth,' he writes \n     in Reader's Digest.\n       Even the spectre of Chernobyl is dismissed by Lovelock, who \n     claims that the fallout from the radioactive cloud that swept \n     over the Cumbrian peaks `was really nothing. A few times \n     higher than the natural background levels or at worst a \n     couple of chest X-rays'.\n       It is 13 years since the arrival of the anti-wind lobby \n     surfaced with the Country Guardian, a group that vehemently \n     denies links to the nuclear sector although its chairman, Sir \n     Bernard Ingham, has been a paid lobbyist for British Nuclear \n     Fuels. Since then, complaints advanced to discredit wind \n     energy have multiplied: falling property prices, the whirring \n     noise that makes people sick a mile away, horses that \n     suddenly bolt and the grisly deaths of kites and golden \n     eagles, even if their numbers are a fraction of those of \n     birds that are killed on the roads.\n       The most persistent criticism, however, concerns the \n     efficiency of wind power. Critics claim windmills would \n     struggle to cope with the half-time power surge during \n     yesterday's FA Cup final because they only generate \n     electricity for a part of the time. Such issues would be \n     irrelevant if electricity could be stored, but there is no \n     battery for the national grid.\n       A recent study in Germany, which has the largest number of \n     wind farms in the world, found the energy was an expensive \n     and inefficient way of generating sustainable energy, costing \n     up to K53 to avoid emitting a ton of carbon dioxide. \n     Professor David Bellamy, a vociferous windfarm critic seen \n     recently at the Shap Wells Hotel, is among those worried \n     whether wind could guarantee his half-time cuppa: `How are \n     people going to be able to boil their kettles?'\n       Sir Martin Holdgate, a former chief scientist to the \n     Department of Environment who has served on a number of \n     government committees on renewable energy, was also present \n     in the Garden Room last week. Holdgate, too, has run out of \n     patience with\n\n[[Page S5980]]\n\n     wind farms in sensitive areas. `We shouldn't sacrifice our \n     landscape on our crowded island. Wind doesn't make sense.'\n       Others, the so-called `blade lovers', welcome them as an \n     aesthetic asset, claiming that their beauty lies in the \n     environmental message they communicate to a throwaway \n     society. Designer Wayne Hemingway says: `I love them. They \n     are a massive visual sign that we are doing something that is \n     not damaging the Earth.'\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority controls 50 minutes of the time \nremaining.\n  Mr. KERRY. Fifty?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I am told 50.\n  Mr. KERRY. How much does the majority have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority controls 52 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I will use at this moment. \nObviously, I will not use all of it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator controls 30 minutes of the time \nallocated.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am not sure how much of that time I will \nuse.\n  I have made a significant amount of argument, as others have, in the \nForeign Relations Committee during the time leading up to this debate \non the floor. I listened to Senator Biden's comments and I listened to \nSenator Biden's colloquy with Senator Sarbanes. They raised critical \npoints, as have others, such as Senator Dodd and Senator Voinovich, and \nothers on the floor. I am not sure it serves any great purpose to \nrehash all of those arguments, but I will say in summary that what \nbrings a lot of us to this point of questioning the nomination of John \nBolton is not personal and it is not political in the sense that it is \nsort of an automatic reflex reaction to a nomination of the President, \nor to divisions between the parties.\n  I think people can sense from the bipartisan concerns that have been \nexpressed, as well as the record that has been set forward, that these \nare really deeply felt and very legitimate concerns about a position \nthat is one of the most important foreign policy positions for our \ncountry.\n  Obviously, the President has the right to make a choice. We all \nunderstand that. Subsequent to the President making that choice, an \nenormous amount of information has come forward, not from traditional \nsources, not from people who might have been disposed to oppose this \nnomination, but from people who have worked with Mr. Bolton, from \npeople who are ideologically in the same place as he is, who are \nmembers of the same administration.\n  The picture they have painted is clearly one that ought to raise \nconcern for any Member of the Senate about a position that requires \nspecial credibility, special stature, and special ability to be able to \ncarry the message of our country in one of the most important fora in \nthe world, in a very complicated world.\n  On several occasions, a number of Senators have talked about this \nissue of credibility, and it cannot be overlooked. One cannot gloss by \nit. We are in the midst of delicate, critical negotiations with Iran. \nNobody knows where that will go in these next months. The potential for \ncritical intelligence analysis to be put before the United Nations in \norder to persuade the world of potentially dangerous steps requires a \nvoice that has no questions attached to it, where people will not have \nto ask whether that person speaks for the administration or for \nthemselves.\n  The history of Secretary Colin Powell, whom we all admire but who was \nsent to the United Nations with information that was inaccurate and \nmade a speech which he now personally wishes were otherwise, raises \neven further the question of credibility. In addition, we will have to \ndeal with Syria itself where important issues have been raised with \nrespect to Mr. Bolton's attitude toward Syria, his willingness to \nstretch information with respect to Syria. Obviously, North Korea looms \nhuge on the diplomatic and security horizon.\n  All of this fits within a context of information that the Foreign \nRelations Committee has requested a number of times. Two weeks ago, the \nForeign Relations Committee, in a historical moment, voted to send John \nBolton's nomination without recommendation. I voted no at that time for \nthe reasons that I stated, and I believe we have yet to complete the \ntask of building the complete record to be able to have the full Senate \nmake a judgment on this nomination.\n  Over the last 24 years, the Foreign Relations Committee has sent \nhundreds of nominations to the floor with favorable recommendations. \nOnly twice did the committee report a nomination unfavorably, and only \nonce did it report a nomination without recommendation. So obviously we \ncome with serious reservations within the committee, and the Senate \nought to want a full record to be put in front of it before it votes on \nthis nomination.\n  The power of advice and consent has been talked about a lot in the \nlast weeks. Obviously, we have a constitutional responsibility not just \nto advise but also to consent, and nowhere is it suggested in the \nConstitution that we ought to consent automatically.\n  So over the last week, both Democrats and Republicans on the \ncommittee have worked hard together to jointly interview more than 30 \nindividuals with information relevant to this nomination. We also \nrequested numerous documents from the State Department, USAID, and the \nCIA. This indepth level of investigation was necessary because concerns \nwere raised by individuals in Government and in the private sector \nabout the nomination. Again, I repeat, we did not seek out these \npeople. They came to us. Most of those who came to us have worked with \nMr. Bolton and continue to work in Government. They came to us at great \nrisk to themselves. That risk has to be measured by our colleagues in \nthe Senate.\n  Everybody knows how this place works. We know the difficulty of a \nperson coming out of the same place of business in politics and saying \nsomething that is critical of somebody they worked with. The fact is \nthat we owe those people who took those risks a serious and complete \neffort in the consideration of this nomination, not a perfunctory \neffort, not one that seeks to find a way around a legitimate request \nfor information.\n  The fact is that this administration's cooperation in the Foreign \nRelation Committee's effort to do due diligence on the Bolton \nnomination has been sporadic at best and far from complete. In the 22 \nyears I have served on the committee, I have seen efforts on both sides \nof the aisle that have been far more extensive and far lengthier for \nless important positions or for the similar position.\n  Initially, the administration's response was to refuse access to \ndocuments or individuals to be interviewed until just a few days before \nthe committee's first business meeting to consider the Bolton \nnomination on April 19. Chairman Lugar had to personally intervene in \norder to persuade the administration to comply with earlier requests \nthat were made repeatedly by Senator Biden on behalf of all of the \nDemocrats on the committee.\n\n  The State Department finally responded but, again, not fully. It did \nnot provide all of the documents requested, and those that were \nprovided were suddenly deemed to be classified, even though many were \nunclassified e-mails.\n  After the committee decided on April 19 to further investigate \nallegations and concerns about this nomination, the administration \ncontinued to drag its feet on the Democratic request for information. \nOn April 29, Senator Biden sent a letter specifying nine different \ncategories of documents relating to the issues of concern that needed \nto be investigated thoroughly. Some of these requests involved \nadditional information related to specific cases the committee had been \nreviewing. Four of them were requests for drafts of speeches or \ntestimony. These four requests were designed to ascertain whether Mr. \nBolton sought to stretch the intelligence to support his policy views. \nA lot has been spoken on the\n\n[[Page S5981]]\n\nSenate floor about that effort to stretch, and I would associate myself \nwith the concerns that have been expressed by other Senators about that \neffort. There is nothing more serious at this moment in time.\n  The State Department refused to respond fully to Senator Biden's \nrequest. Instead, it responded to a letter by Chairman Lugar on May 4 \nsuggesting that it needed to provide documents in only five of the nine \ncategories. Well, it is not up to the administration to decide which \ncategories are appropriate for the proper advice and consent of a \nSenate committee or of the Senate itself.\n  So in an effort to move the process along and get further cooperation \nfrom the administration, Senator Biden narrowed the Democratic request \ndown to two areas: Information related to the clearance of Mr. Bolton's \nSeptember 2003 testimony on Syria before the House International \nRelations Committee and information related to National Security Agency \nintercepts and the identity of U.S. persons on those intercepts.\n  Over a period of 4 years, Mr. Bolton requested the identity of U.S. \npersons on intercepts 10 times.\n  Senator Dodd originally asked for these intercepts in a question for \nthe record on April 11. The Department responded by saying that the \ncommittee needed to get these from the National Security Agency. So \nChairman Lugar supported the Democratic request for the NSA intercepts \nbut asked the Intelligence Committee to request them and find a means \nof sharing them with the Foreign Relations Committee.\n  The Intelligence Committee finally did get the intercepts, but the \nchairman and ranking member of that committee were not allowed to see \nthe key information; that is, the names of the U.S. persons, which is \nan essential part of the evaluation of the committee. No one--no one on \nthe Foreign Relations Committee, not Chairman Lugar or Senator Biden--\nhas been given access to these intercepts.\n  In response to letters from Senator Biden regarding the intercepts, \nthe Director of National Intelligence, Ambassador Negroponte, referred \nSenator Biden back to the Intelligence Committee.\n  What the Senate has to decide is whether it is going to stand up for \nthe rights of a committee, for the rights of an appropriate set of \ninquiries to be answered so we can fulfill our constitutional \nresponsibilities. Senators can be for Mr. Bolton, Senators can have \nalready made up their minds, Senators can have decided that they know \nhow they are going to vote and they do not need more information, but \nthey ought to respect the fact that both the chairman and the ranking \nmember made a request and that request has not yet been fulfilled.\n  The information we are seeking relating to the Syria testimony will \nshed further light on whether Mr. Bolton tried to press the envelope on \nintelligence and whether he told the committee the truth when he said \nhe was not personally involved in the preparation of the Syria \ntestimony. The question of whether Mr. Bolton told the committee the \ntruth is important because there are already several other instances \nwhere it is in doubt, where in fact there is clear evidence that he \ndidn't tell the truth, specifically with respect to the efforts to fire \nthe two analysts of intelligence.\n  Stretching intelligence and credibility are two of the key areas of \nconcern with respect to the Bolton nomination, two of the key areas of \ninquiry that the committee is seeking. This is a proper and a critical \nrequest. Having access to the NSA intercepts will tell us whether Mr. \nBolton did anything improper after receiving the identities of U.S. \npersons involved. The fact they do not want anybody to see it seems to \nsuggest the exact opposite.\n  Senator Roberts, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, \nindicated in his letter to Senators Lugar and Biden that on at least \none occasion Mr. Bolton shared the identity information of a U.S. \nperson with another individual in the State Department without \nauthorization from NSA.\n  Did he do this more than once? Why did he request these intercepts? \nWhat was he trying to find out? What was he going to do, or did he do \nwith the information? We can only speculate without proper access to \nthose intercepts and without knowing the identities of the persons on \nthem.\n  The State Department has told the committee that the request for \ninformation about the Syria testimony is not ``specifically tied to the \nissues being deliberated by the committee.'' But for the executive \nbranch of Government, which has already been slow-walking this \nprovision of information, to tell a Senate committee how to exercise \nthe advice and consent power of the Senate is not only unacceptable, it \nis unconstitutional. The Foreign Relations Committee has the \nprerogative to determine, and has laid out for our colleagues to judge, \nthe legitimacy of the basis of this request. I think it passes muster.\n  For the chairman and ranking member of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee to be denied access to NSA intercepts and information which \nMr. Bolton was able to see is unacceptable on its face. An Assistant \nSecretary of State and staff are permitted to see this, but the \nchairman and ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee are not? \nIs the Senate prepared to ratify that as a standard by which we will \nhave our inquiries pursued with respect to any nomination on either \nside at any time?\n  The Foreign Relations Committee has spent an enormous amount of time \nand energy related to this nomination. Grudgingly, cherry-picking \ndocument requests, we have proceeded along with the administration \nactually denying other requests entirely.\n  The information we continue to seek is relevant to this nomination \nand to the critical concerns that many of us have about the nominee and \nhis use of intelligence. We should have access. Since the \nadministration has refused to provide it, the only choice we have is to \ndeny the vote on this nomination until there is full compliance. That \nis not a filibuster. That is not an effort to not have a vote. Give us \nthe information. We are prepared to have a vote immediately and let the \nchips fall where they may. But it is vital that the rights of the \ncommittee and the rights of the Senate, the rights of the advice and \nconsent process, be upheld.\n\n  Let me just say again this should not be anything except a \nmeasurement on the merits. During her confirmation hearing in 1981, to \nbe U.S. ambassador to the U.N., Jeane Kirkpatrick described her vision \nof the job. She said:\n\n       I do not think that one should ever seek confrontation. \n     What I have every intention and hope of doing is to operate \n     in a low key, quiet, persuasive, and consensus-building way. \n     I think a principal objective should be to try to communicate \n     effectively with the representatives of as many nations as \n     possible to broaden a bit the areas of mutual understanding. \n     We should try to extend a bit the frontiers of reason and \n     cooperation, and I think we should work to that end, and we \n     should work to establish the patterns of consultation and \n     trust.\n\n  No one would ever accuse Jeane Kirkpatrick of being soft or shying \naway from her views. She is a staunch conservative who speaks her mind. \nBut she understood and respected the value of diplomacy and \nnegotiation; of listening to and respecting others' views; of working \nthe system; of seeing the big picture and, most importantly, of \nestablishing credibility and trust. She herself has said of this \nnominee that he is ``no diplomat.''\n  We should make the judgment in the end of whether this is the right \nperson. I have heard colleagues argue how important it is to have a \nstraight-talking, tough person at the U.N. This is not about the U.N. \nper se, obviously. It is about our interests and how we are going to \nbest advance those interests. But those of us who spent a long time \ntrying to reform the U.N. and working with it, and have had some \nsuccess in some measure with respect to that effort, in a bipartisan \neffort going back to the time we worked with Nancy Kassebaum and Larry \nPressler and Jesse Helms, all of us understood you need to establish \nthose patterns of consultation and trust and speak with credibility.\n  I regret that this process has proven that this nominee does not meet \nthe Jeane Kirkpatrick standard or test, and therefore all of us ought \nto raise serious questions about the nomination.\n  I think my time is about up, so I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S5982]]\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, what is the current time on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 28 minutes and the majority \nhas exactly 1 hour.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, will the quorum be tallied to both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under a previous order, that is correct.\n  Mr. KERRY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I appreciate Senator Voinovich allowing me \nto speak a moment or two on the John Bolton nomination.\n  No. 1, when it comes to how and why Members vote, every Senator has \nto make a decision they feel comfortable with, that is good for the \nNation, good for the Senate, good for the White House, good for the \nAmerican people.\n  One thing I am confident of: Senator Voinovich, of all the people I \nknow in the Senate, is right at the top of the list of those who make \ndecisions based on conscience and principle. Whatever problems he has \nwith this nominee have come from soul searching, thinking, and looking. \nHe will articulate why he feels the way he does and vote his \nconscience. That is exactly what he should do. I am all for that \nbecause that is what makes the Senate great. That is what makes America \ngreat.\n  In terms of myself, I would like a moment or two to express why I \nhave come to the conclusion that I think John Bolton will make an \noutstanding ambassador to the United Nations. We have heard a lot about \nhis disposition, about his temper, about his working relations. \nEveryone will make a judgment about where they come down on that. I \nmade a judgment that, obviously, some of the things about his working \nrelationships can be troubling. The idea that he has been confirmed \nfour times, has served his country for well over 20 years in a variety \nof posts and done an outstanding job, is what I will base my vote on--\nnot a conversation here or there but 20-plus years of serving the \nUnited States at the highest level of Government, with a great academic \nbackground.\n  But why him and why now? Are there other people who can be United \nStates ambassador to the United Nations? There are a lot of good people \nout there. What drove the President to pick him now? The honest truth \nis, I haven't talked to the President about why he picked John Bolton, \nbut I have a pretty good idea what was on his mind. The President sees \nvery clearly the need for the United Nations. This world is in \ntremendous conflict. We are splitting along religious lines. We are \nhaving all kinds of problems getting along with each other and trying \nto find out how to fight the war on terrorism. The United Nations \nprovides a hope for the world, a place where we can come together and \nhave good people stand up to bad people. Sometimes it is hard to \ndetermine who is good and who is bad, but many times it is not, and it \nshould be a place where people of good will can deal with problems for \nbad people such as Saddam Hussein and others, the Osama bin Ladens of \nthe world, a place where they can be controlled and checked.\n  The President sees from the American conservative perspective that \nthe United Nations has lost its way. From a conservative point of view, \nbeing a conservative Republican, I hear continuously of problems with \nthe United Nations from people I represent and people I know. The worst \nthing we can do is to allow the good will of the American people to \nslip away from the United Nations and reject that body.\n  What will it take to repair the damage done from the Oil-for-Food \nProgram, the corruption at the United Nations, the, at the least, \ninconsistent approach to regulating dictators such as Saddam Hussein? \nHow can we get the United States and the United Nations back together \nwhere we can work as one team? It will take a person Americans have \nfaith in. And that is a big problem with the United Nations right now.\n  American conservatives need to feel better. John Bolton will provide \nthat assurance from a conservative point of view that the United \nNations would be pushed to reform itself. From a moderate and liberal \npoint of view, I can assure members that the policies John Bolton will \nfight for will be those policies directed by President Bush, who won \nthe last election. And some may not agree with the policies, but that \nis where he will get his marching orders.\n  He sees the United Nations as a value-added product to the world. He \nsees clearly where it has gone astray. He has the credibility with the \nAmerican public, particularly among conservatives, to be a force for \nchange.\n  The worst thing that could happen is for the United Nations to slip \naway, in the eyes of Americans, as an effective body. It surely has \ngone that route.\n  The best thing that can happen from this nomination is that John \nBolton goes to the U.N. with an attitude of: I will work with you, but \nyou have to be better--and to effectively articulate President Bush's \npolicies. I think that can happen. I think it must happen. Not only am \nI enthusiastic about his nomination, he clearly--given the dynamic our \ncountry has with the United Nations--is the right person at the right \ntime and can do things no other person could do; namely, repair the \nimage of the U.N. with a large percentage of the American people, who \nbelieve it has lost its way. That is why I will support this nominee \nwith enthusiasm.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, first, I thank the Senator from South \nCarolina for his kind remarks about this Senator early today and this \nafternoon.\n  What we are doing here today is what the Senate should be doing; that \nis, to have a robust debate about a nominee by the President of the \nUnited States to the United Nations.\n  I have deep concerns about the nomination of John Bolton. We face an \nimportant decision today. We are at a crossroads in foreign policy, at \na time when there has been a drastic shift in the attitude of our \nfriends and allies. If we do have a vote today, I urge my colleagues in \nthe Senate to let their consciences and their commitment to our \nNation's best interests guide them.\n  I would plead with them to consider the decision and its consequences \ncarefully, to read the pertinent information, and to ask themselves \nseveral important questions:\n  Is John Bolton the best person to serve as the lead diplomat to the \nUnited Nations?\n  Will he be able to pursue the needed reforms at the U.N. despite his \ndamaged credibility?\n  Will he share information with the right individuals, and will he \nsolicit information from the right individuals, including his \nsubordinates, so he can make the most informed decisions?\n  Is he capable of advancing the President's and the Secretary of \nState's efforts to advance our public diplomacy?\n  Does he have the character, leadership, interpersonal skills, self-\ndiscipline, common decency, and understanding of the chain of command \nto lead a team to victory?\n  Will he recognize and seize opportunities to repair and strengthen \nrelationships, promote peace, and uphold democracy with our fellow \nnations?\n  I also came to the floor today to respond to some of the statements \nthat have been made regarding the nomination of Mr. Bolton.\n  It has been argued by my colleagues that Mr. Bolton is the right man \nfor the job because he has ``sharp elbows,'' can give a dose of needed \n``strong medicine,'' and because he will not be an ``appeaser'' to the \nhorrors that have been committed by the U.N. peacekeepers.\n  The question is not whether we want to achieve U.N. reforms. We will \nsupport U.N. reforms. And I particularly want U.N. reforms. We need to \npursue its transformation aggressively, sending a strong message that \ncorruption will not be tolerated. The corruption that occurred under \nthe Oil-for-Food Program made it possible for Saddam's\n\n[[Page S5983]]\n\nIraq to discredit the U.N. and undermine the goal of all of its \nmembers. This must never happen again. This is an ideal time for reform \nof the United Nations. Those reforms are needed to strengthen the \norganization or there will not be an organization.\n  And, yes, I believe it will be necessary to take a firm position so \nit can succeed. But it is going to take a special individual to succeed \nin this endeavor, and I have great concerns with the current nominee \nand his ability to get the job done. How successful will he be on \nreform if the message is lost because of baggage surrounding the \nmessenger? I worry that Mr. Bolton will become the issue and the \nmessage will be lost.\n  I understand the arguments just made by my colleague from South \nCarolina in regard to the conservative movement here in the United \nStates that is very concerned about the U.N. and feels comfortable that \nif John Bolton goes to the U.N., with his ``sharp elbows,'' something \nis going to happen.\n  I would like to point out that Mr. Bolton will be going to the U.N. \nto do more than just push forward U.N. reforms with his ``sharp \nelbows.'' He is there to be the U.S. representative to the world.\n  Do we want the supreme quality for our next U.S. representative to \nthe world to be ``sharp elbows''? Don't we need a man who has superior \ninterpersonal skills, who can bring people together, form coalitions, \nand inspire other countries to agree with his point of view?\n  To the conservatives who are concerned about reform of the United \nNations, do we want the messenger to become the issue so we never get \nto the message? And the message is: reform.\n  I agree the next Ambassador needs to be a strong presence, firm in \nhis beliefs, persistent in his drive, and determined in the face of a \nmonolithic bureaucracy and many obstructionist countries. It is not \ngoing to be easy. But even more than this, he will need the \ninterpersonal and diplomatic skills required to inspire and lead.\n  If you think about John Danforth, our last ambassador to the United \nNations--or let's talk about John Negroponte. Let's put John Negroponte \nand John Bolton in the same room together, colleagues. Put them in the \nsame room together. John Negroponte went to the U.N. and did an \noutstanding job. John Negroponte was taken from the U.N. The President \nneeded somebody in Iraq, so he sent John Negroponte to Iraq. Then he \nneeded to call on someone to be the Director of the National \nIntelligence area. Now, John Negroponte--that is the quality of the \nindividual who we need to be sending to the United Nations today.\n  One of my colleagues stated earlier today that we should not reject \nMr. Bolton because of his management techniques because ``management is \nnot a criterion for rejecting a nominee and if it were, a lot of \nnominees would have been rejected.''\n  In the case of Mr. Bolton, his poor management techniques intimidated \nintelligence officers and have called U.S. credibility into question, \nat a time when we cannot afford any further damage to our credibility. \nThat is one of the problems we have today--the WMD and Iraq, some of \nthe recent stories about the WMD. There are a lot of people who are \nquestioning this Nation's credibility.\n  Further, his management and interpersonal failures reflect on his \ndiplomatic skills, which are an undeniable requirement for the \nambassador to the United Nations.\n  Colin Powell's chief of staff, COL Lawrence Wilkerson, testified \nbefore the committee that Mr. Bolton would make ``an abysmal \nambassador'' because of his management flaws.\n  I would like to read from Mr. Wilkerson's testimony.\n  Mr. Wilkinson:\n\n       I would like to make just one statement. I don't have a \n     large problem with Under Secretary Bolton serving our \n     country. My objections to what we've been talking about \n     here--that is, him being our ambassador at the United \n     Nations--stem from two basic things. One, I think he's a \n     lousy leader. And there are 100 to 150 people up there that \n     have to be led; they have to be led well, and they have to be \n     led properly. And I think, in that capacity, if he goes up \n     there, you'll see the proof of the pudding in a year.\n\n  It has been argued during our floor debate that many of the people \nwho oppose Mr. Bolton's nomination originally supported Mr. Bolton and \nvoted for him several times before they heard about these new \nallegations against him.\n  The statement seems to argue that many allegations about John Bolton \nare not relevant to our decision on whether he is the right man for the \njob and should be confirmed as the next ambassador to the United \nNations.\n  The allegations about Mr. Bolton are very relevant to our decision. \nThe allegations speak to Mr. Bolton's character, his temperament, his \ncredibility, his management style, his skills, and his performance over \nthe last 4 years.\n  The testimony of our witnesses has certainly had an impact on my \nopinion.\n  I expect that the allegations have had an incredible impact on the \nworld's opinion of Mr. Bolton. I believe that the allegations have \ncaused great damage to Mr. Bolton's credibility and that the \nallegations will impair our influence with the United Nations. If Mr. \nBolton is confirmed for the position, he goes to the U.N. with a \ntremendous amount of baggage that he is going to have to overcome. \nAgain, I want to repeat to the people who feel he is just the right \nticket to get the job done, I am very concerned that he will become the \nissue and the reform of the United Nations that we all would like to \nsee is not going to happen.\n  It has also been stated today that none of the incidents involving \nintelligence resulted in misuse. This is all of the testimony about \nspeeches that Mr. Bolton gave. I guess my colleagues believe that the \nmisuse of intelligence would have only occurred if Mr. Bolton would \nhave been successful in clearing the language that he originally \ninsisted upon. In other words, he would have these ideas about the \nworld and about intelligence and said: This is what I want to say. And \nthe intelligence folks came back and said: No, you can't say that \nbecause that doesn't reflect the reality. And everyone says that is not \na problem because ultimately he didn't say what he wanted to say \nbecause he got the better information from the intelligence officers.\n  The misuse of intelligence occurs as a process. It begins with \nintimidation and pressure on analysts, and it ends with analysts \nproducing reports that meet the political needs of top leadership. Mr. \nBolton contributed to this process with his actions. He created an \natmosphere of intimidation within the ranks of the Bureau of \nIntelligence and Research and at the CIA. The people in these agencies \nwere made to understand that if they disagreed with him, there would be \nconsequences. His actions sent the message that if you don't seek to \nmeet his particular request for specific language, they may be \nsidelined from future opportunities to provide him intelligence, and \nthey may even be pulled off of the account and moved to another bureau.\n  The Presiding Officer was there for some of the hearings. There was \nno question that the message was, if you disagree with him, you might \nget moved to some other place. Some have argued that you would be \nfired. But it wasn't in this language; it was like ``moved to somewhere \nelse.'' It is the same signal, same message: Don't fool with John \nbecause, if you do, he is going to put pressure on to move you to some \nother place.\n  His behavior put pressure on the intelligence officers, and it begins \nthe very dangerous path to misusing intelligence and damaging U.S. \ncredibility. The point Senator Kerry made earlier this afternoon is \nwell taken. We all know there is a real problem with Iran. We know that \nthe International Atomic Energy Agency is very concerned about what is \ngoing on in Iran today. We are hopeful that the EU-3 will be able to \nwork out the problem and deal with the proliferation problem in Iran. \nBut they may not be successful. If they are not, you know where they \nare going. They are going to the U.N. Security Council. Can you imagine \nif the spokesman for the United States at the U.N. Security Council \nabout intelligence and the impact of whether Iran has this or that, if \nthe spokesman is going to be John Bolton? Can you imagine how much \ninfluence he is going to have with his past record? It is a serious \nissue, one we hope doesn't happen, but it could very well happen. And \nthere will be other instances that come before the United Nations where\n\n[[Page S5984]]\n\nthe credibility of the individual representing us is going to make an \nenormous amount of difference if we are to be successful.\n  I agree with Mr. Bolton's policies. I believe in U.N. reform. I \nbelieve in nonproliferation. I believe in working to secure Article 98 \nagreements to protect U.S. forces against trial by the International \nCriminal Court, although I do not agree with his decision to hold up \nimportant military education in order to achieve that goal. I believe \nin removing the anti-Israel prejudices in the United Nations. I believe \nin reforming the anticorruption and enforcement mechanisms of the \nUnited Nations. I believe in preventing abuses and crimes by U.N. \npeacekeepers. I believe in making the United Nations a strong \ninstitution that fulfills its mission to preserve and protect human \nrights and democracy. I know that I agree with Mr. Bolton's policy \nbecause I sat down with him to discuss his policies. I still just \nbelieve we can do much better than Mr. Bolton at the United Nations.\n  Many people have come today to defend Mr. Bolton. In some cases, they \nargue that the allegations are false. In some cases, they argue that \neven though Mr. Bolton behaved badly, his rough edges are what the \nUnited States needs to be successful at the U.N., so we should overlook \nhis record of behavior. But nobody has disputed the argument that I \nmade yesterday before the Senate that Mr. Bolton will contradict our \nefforts to improve public diplomacy at this critical time.\n  Public diplomacy has been the No. 1 priority of Secretary Rice since \nbecoming Secretary of State. She is running all over the world putting \nher best foot forward, saying: We are the team. We all have to work \ntogether. It is a clear priority of the President, who has done \neverything in his power to improve the image and understanding of the \nUnited States, including getting the First Lady to get out there and \nstart doing public diplomacy and then naming Karen Hughes, his \nconfidant for so many years, to lead public diplomacy at the Department \nof State.\n\n  In the spirit of the President's objectives, we cannot ignore the \ndamage that John Bolton could have on U.S. public diplomacy. We also \ncannot ignore the warning signs of so many loyal servants of our \nGovernment who testified before our committee. These witnesses who came \nbefore the Foreign Relations Committee came voluntarily. We didn't go \nout and solicit them to come. They came in voluntarily. Most of them \nare Republicans. Most of them are proud they are conservatives.\n  I ask my colleagues to consider these questions: When was the last \ntime so many individuals have come out in opposition to a nomination? \nThink about it. When was the last time that 102 diplomats have opposed \nthe appointment of a new ambassador? I should check the Congressional \nRecord. It hasn't happened since I have been here, and I am in my \nseventh year. When was the last time so many witnesses have emerged \nfrom an administration to send warning signals to the Congress about an \nindividual? When was the last time a Secretary of State did not sign \nthe letter of recommendation for a nominee? It would have been a lay-up \nshot for Secretary Powell to join that letter recommending Mr. Bolton \nto be our ambassador to the United Nations, but his name was absent \nfrom the letter. And who best to understand whether he is the kind of \nindividual we should send to the U.N. to be our ambassador?\n  It is rare, and it should serve as a warning to all of us. We owe it \nto the United States, our children and grandchildren, to heed this \nwarning and to ask our President: Mr. President, please, find a better \ncandidate to send to the United Nations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, again, I commend my friend and colleague. I \ndon't want to do this too frequently. I am afraid I may hurt his \nreputation in certain quarters. I want to tell him how much I admire \nwhat he has done over the last number of weeks and did so so that the \npeople of Ohio and America understand this. This was not a decision \nthat my colleague from Ohio reached quickly. In fact, I recall vividly \nthe day in room 116 where we made our case. It was one of those rare \nmoments that we don't see often enough around here these days, where \nthe Senator from Ohio said: I am troubled by this. I want to know more.\n  I was tempted a couple of times during the period between that \nhearing on April 18 or 19 and when we reconvened again in early May as \npart of the Foreign Relations Committee to consider this nomination. I \ndecided the best thing I could do was to leave the Senator from Ohio \nalone and let him go through the process himself of deciding on the \nconcerns that had been raised. As he so appropriately pointed out--I \ntried to make the point this morning myself--these allegations are not \ncoming from some outside groups who have a vested political interest in \nthe outcome.\n  Many of these people were people who were presently there or have \njust left the present administration or they have had the experience of \nworking with the nominee. They were the ones who raised the concerns. \nIn fact, at lunch today, we were talking about North Korea with several \nformer career diplomats who have worked with the nominee, including in \nthis administration. I asked them for any observations. They confirmed \nwhat the Senator has said.\n  They had complimentary things to say about Mr. Bolton, as well. I am \nnot saying there are not qualities about this nominee that are good. He \nis certainly a well-educated individual, and he has an incredibly \nattractive life story of where he has come from. But they all made the \nsame point the Senator from Ohio made, and it deserves being made \nagain. I raised the issue about the intelligence analyst. But the \nSenator is absolutely correct. In this day and age, what we have been \nthrough over the last several years, having people who can help us take \nunwilling nations that may be cautious about joining us in certain \nthings, for all the reasons we are familiar with, and to be able to \nbuild those coalitions around issues critical to us and to peace and \nstability in the world, is going to be absolutely essential. The U.N. \nis a forum particularly for smaller nations.\n  Large nations have big delegations here in Washington, and we go back \nand forth to major European allies and the major countries in the \nPacific rim. For an awful lot of countries, the best forum for them is \nthe U.N. The person who interfaces with those people on a daily basis \ncan do a tremendous amount of good for our country with that notion--\nthe face of public diplomacy that the Senator from Ohio talked about.\n  I wanted to, once again, thank my colleague for his willingness to \nshare his feelings with his colleagues about this, and we are going to \nhave a vote this afternoon, only because I felt it was important for us \nto be able to have information that should be forthcoming. It is a \nmatter of right here on a cloture motion and, if that succeeds, we will \ngo right to a vote on Mr. Bolton. If not, it will lay over and when we \nget back, if we don't invoke cloture, we will deal with it fairly \nquickly when we return and we will move on.\n  I hope Members will have listened, particularly on the majority side. \nI suspect that when you hear some of us, you may say that is a bunch of \nDemocrats talking. I regret that that is the feeling, but if you are \nnot impressed with what some of us who have worked on the issues for \nmany years feel about it, listen to George Voinovich from Ohio. This is \na good person who cares about the status of the United States and about \nthis matter before us. I thank the Senator.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased that, after much too long a \ndelay, the Senate will meet its constitutional responsibility to vote \non an important nomination for the President's national security team.\n  I am referring to the nomination of Mr. John Bolton to be our next \nambassador to the United Nations.\n\n[[Page S5985]]\n\n  This position must be filled if the administration is to advance its \nforeign policy, which includes both the use of the United Nations to \nsupport our country's goals, as well as our goals to advance reform in \na very difficult international organization that, to be frank, has \nearned the skepticism of a good many Americans, including many in my \nhome State of Utah.\n  It would be a mistake, however, to suggest that this administration \nis anti-U.N. After all, during his first term, President Bush addressed \nthe United Nations more times than any of his predecessors ever had in \nthe same period, throughout the entire history of the United Nations.\n  That the President has regularly consulted with, and sought the \nsupport of, the United Nations gives lie to accusations that he is a \nunilateralist.\n  That he has never hinged our foreign policy needs and goals on the \nsupport of the United Nations demonstrates that our President has a \nproper understanding of our sovereign rights, as well as a realistic \nunderstanding of what the U.N. can contribute. The vast majority of the \ncitizens of my State agree with President Bush that the U.N. can be \nsought as a useful tool to advance our national security, but that the \npursuit of our foreign policy goals should never, never be conditioned \non U.N. approval.\n  John Bolton, whose career in foreign policy has included numerous \npositions where he was worked with international organizations, \nincluding much experience with the U.N., understands this. Certainly it \nis not for lack of experience that Mr. Bolton's nomination has become \nso controversial. Nobody can credibly make that argument.\n  It is because of his philosophical convictions about the limits of \ninternational organizations--convictions shared by the President who \nnominated him--that Mr. Bolton's nomination has been delayed. I have \nfound this entire spectacle to be dismaying.\n  Early objections were quite plain in this approach: John Bolton was \ncharged with an unnecessarily skeptical view of multilateralism.\n  In my opinion, the reason George Bush won a decisive victory in a \nclose re-election campaign is because the American public recognizes \nthat national security issues are of dire importance, and that the \nPresident has a better grasp of how the real world works.\n  The vast majority of the Utahns I represent object to any suggestion \nof checking American power with multilateral institutions.\n  They do not believe in ``aggressive multilateralism'' an expression \nused during past administrations.\n  They do not believe that the reluctance of European powers to join us \nin all our causes is a failure of our diplomacy, because nations will \npursue their national interest no matter what the rhetoric may be. To \nmeasure diplomacy by the decisions of nations is to misunderstand both \ndiplomacy and the dynamics of how nations pursue their national \ninterest. President Bush understands this, as does John Bolton.\n  The nomination process grew quite tawdry, in my opinion, when it \nturned to innuendo and, in some cases, attacks on the nominee's \ncharacter.\n  I know John Bolton. He is a decent, honorable man of inestimable \nintelligence who has done a tremendous job in every public position he \nhas held.\n  Opponents of Mr. Bolton declared, insinuated, and denounced the \nnominee based on a handful of alleged reports of his cantankerousness. \nImagine that. A cantankerous personality in a high-powered job. In \nWashington, no less. Give me a break.\n  Mr. President, the list of those who have stood up for Mr. Bolton is \none of the most impressive I have ever seen in my years in the \nSenate, And I will leave it to my colleagues to attempt to include it \nall in the Record. I must note, however, the following statement \nincluded in a letter to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee:\n\n       We, the undersigned, have been appalled at the charges that \n     have been leveled at John Bolton during the course of his \n     nomination hearing to be this country's ambassador to the \n     United Nations. Each of us has worked with Mr. Bolton. We \n     know him to be a man of personal and intellectual integrity, \n     deeply devoted to the service of this country and the \n     promotion of our foreign policy interests as established by \n     this President and the Congress. Not one of us has ever \n     witnessed conduct on his part that resembles that which has \n     been alleged. We feel our collective knowledge of him and \n     what he stands for, combined with our own experiences in \n     government and in the private sector, more than \n     counterbalances the credibility of those who have tried to \n     destroy the distinguished achievements of a lifetime.\n\n  This is a letter signed by former Attorney General Ed Meese, former \nAttorney General and Governor of Pennsylvania Dick Thornburgh, former \nAssociate Attorney General and Governor of Oklahoma, Frank Keating, \nformer Assistant Attorney General and Governor of Massachusetts, \nWilliam Weld, and more than 30 of Mr. Bolton's former colleagues in the \nDepartment of Justice.\n  Following the ideological criticisms, following the attacks on his \ncharacter, the opponents of Mr. Bolton tried the intelligence angle. \nApparently, Mr. Bolton has disagreed with a few intelligence reports \nand analysts. His opponents appear to believe that by waving a specious \ncharge of ``misrepresenting intelligence,'' they can hit the theme of \nimperfect intelligence that serious policymakers have been wrestling \nwith during the last few years of this administration. And we all know, \nand certainly we members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence \nknow, that intelligence has been seriously flawed in recent years. We \nall know that.\n  But to take a serious problem, which our committee has now spent \nyears exposing and correcting, with the support of the administration--\nand to turn it into an opportunistic attack on a nomination for the \nU.N. ambassador is specious at best. At no point in our investigations \nof intelligence regarding Iraq, have we found convincing evidence that \nintelligence analysts were pressured to change their views based as a \nresult of political pressure. And none of our conclusions have \nindicated that the intelligence process would be made better if \ndissenting views would be suppressed. If anything, we need more dissent \nto qualify and verify our intelligence products.\n  If there is anything we have learned in our review of faulty \nintelligence, it is that there is not enough scrutiny, not enough \nskepticism and, frankly, not enough expressing contrasting views. \nApparently, our friends on the other side, the Democrats, do not seem \nto understand this. I am relieved now that after all the delay, the \nPresident will get his vote on his nomination of this very fine man for \nthis very important position.\n  I commend the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for \nhis commitment and patience in bringing this nomination to the floor. I \nknow how tough it is to sit through meeting after meeting where the \nnominee is being attacked with what really amount to almost flippant \nattacks. Both of Senator Lugar's virtues--his commitment and patience--\nhave been, I suspect, severely tested.\n  John Bolton served as a senior diplomat for this country in various \ncapacities for over 20 years. He has served with great distinction and \nhas many accomplishments to his credit. He has my personal admiration \nfor these accomplishments. Whether they have been standing up to the \nUnited Nations and our country's rejection of that organization's \nintellectual disease, known as declaring Zionism as racism, or in his \npost-9/11 efforts to advance multilateral cooperation in his \nproliferation security initiative, Mr. Bolton's efforts have advanced \nU.S. interests and U.S. values. I am grateful for his work on behalf of \nour Nation, and I am grateful that he chooses to continue to serve.\n  In closing, I note a section of a letter sent to the Foreign \nRelations Committee by former Secretaries of State Baker, Eagleburger, \nHaig, Kissinger, and Shultz, and former Secretaries of Defense Carlucci \nand Schlesinger, former U.N. Ambassador Kirkpatrick, and other \ndistinguished former national security officials:\n\n       Secretary Bolton, like the administration, has his critics, \n     of course. Anyone as energetic and effective as John is bound \n     to encounter those who disagree with some or even all of the \n     administration's policies. But the policies for which he is \n     sometimes criticized are those of the President and the \n     Department of State which he has served with loyalty, honor, \n     and distinction.\n\n  President Bush has the right to his nominee for the United Nations. \nAll Senators have the right to refuse consent if they so choose. If our \nfriends on the other side, or even friends on this\n\n[[Page S5986]]\n\nside, disagree with Mr. Bolton and want to vote ``no,'' they have every \nright to do so. But he certainly deserves a vote up or down for this \nvery important position, and he does not deserve to have his nomination \nfilibustered.\n\n  All Senators, as I say, have a right to refuse consent. In a time of \nwar--and we remain in a complicated global war--a President's right to \nassemble his national security team should not be hindered, and it \ncertainly should not be hindered by people on the floor of the Senate. \nIt is time, well past due, to have this vote.\n  Mr. Bolton is a good man. I have known him for most of those 20 \nyears. I know him personally. I know he is a man of integrity. I know \nhe is a man of great intelligence. I know he is a tough person, exactly \nwhat we Americans would like to have at the U.N., sometimes called a \ndysfunctional U.N. This is a man who can bring some credibility. This \nis a man who can straighten some of the mess out. This is a man who can \nmake a difference. He has been confirmed so many times in the Senate, \none would think we would be ashamed to make some of the arguments that \nhave been made against this very fine man.\n  I will vote for Mr. Bolton, and if he is confirmed, I will offer him \nmy continuing support as he undertakes yet another demanding mission, \nand it is demanding. I urge all my colleagues to be fair. That is what \nis involved here. It is a question of fairness. I hope they will be \nfair and vote for this very fine man and give our side a chance to have \nsomebody there who is strong, tough, knowledgeable, loyal, and capable. \nHe is all of those things. I can personally testify to that extent, \nknowing this man as I do. I hope everybody will vote for cloture today \nand then hopefully afterwards vote Mr. Bolton up so he can start \nserving and the President can have his foreign policy team in place.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Republican side for yielding me \n10 minutes. So I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Byrd are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the vote we will be \ncasting at 6 o'clock today, the cloture vote. I had some opportunity to \nspeak on the merits and demerits of the Bolton nomination yesterday and \nhad an opportunity to discuss this issue with my colleague, Senator \nLugar, and others who were on the Senate floor at the time.\n  Today, I rise to focus on what the vote that may take place at 6 \no'clock today is about. We are about to vote on a genuine \nconstitutional option. The vote we are about to cast on cloture, if it \ntakes place, is about whether we are going to stand up for this coequal \nbranch of Government's rights to review relevant information in the \nexercise of our constitutional responsibility and our constitutional \npower to advise and consent to nominations put forward by the President \nor whether we are going to let the executive branch define for us what \ninformation is necessary in the exercise of our constitutional \nresponsibility.\n  The President has his constitutional responsibilities, defined in \narticle II. We have our constitutional responsibilities, defined in \narticle I. Our responsibility is to advise and consent as it relates to \nany nomination for an appointive office, above a certain level, that \nthe President of the United States makes. It is the President's \nobligation to propose; it is our obligation to dispose of the nominee.\n  The State Department has denied the request completely, stating that \nto fulfill it would chill the deliberative process and that it ``does \nnot believe the requests to be specifically tied to issues being \ndeliberated by the Committee.''\n  The department's assertion about deliberative process is not trivial. \nThat concern did not stop the Department and the CIA, however, from \nalready turning over numerous materials to the committee that involve \nthe very same type of deliberative process--preparation of speeches and \ntestimony. And the department has made no effort to justify why it is \ndrawing the line here.\n  The Department's second assertion--that the Syria material is not \nrelevant to the committee's inquiry--is nothing less than an outrageous \nattempt by the executive branch to tell the Senate how it may exercise \nits constitutional power.\n  For several weeks, the Committee on Foreign Relations has been \nrequesting two types of information which have been denied to it.\n  The first relates to preparation for testimony on Syria and weapons \nof mass destruction that Mr. Bolton was to give in 2003. The State \nDepartment has denied the request completely, stating that to fulfill \nit would chill the deliberative process and that it ``does not believe \nthe requests to be specifically tied to issues being deliberated by the \nCommittee.''\n  The Constitution says that the Senate shall advise and consent to \nnominations. The appointments clause does not limit the Senate's power \nto review nominations to those matters the executive branch deems \nrelevant.\n  Our Founding Fathers designed a system of checks and balances, not a \nsystem of blank checks.\n  We must defend the Senate's constitutional powers, however, or we \nshall surely lose them.\n  The second type of information the committee has not received relates \nto Mr. Bolton's requests to obtain the identity of U.S. persons cited \nin NSA intercept reports. We are told that Mr. Bolton did this on 10 \noccasions, involving 19 U.S. person identities.\n  The chairman and vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee have \nbeen shown these intercepts, but Senator Lugar and I have not.\n  Even Senators Roberts and Rockefeller were not told the identities of \nthe U.S. persons, moreover, information that was readily shared with \nMr. Bolton and even with his staff.\n  No one in the executive branch has explained why an Under Secretary \nof State--and a staff member not holding any Senate-confirmed \nposition--may see this information, but the chairman and ranking \nmembers of the relevant Senate oversight committees may not.\n  Senator Roberts tells us that after reviewing the contents of each \nreport, it is apparent that it is:\n\n     not necessary to know the actual names [of the U.S. persons] \n     to determine whether the requests were proper.\n\n  With all respect, I believe my friend has it wrong. Learning the \nactual names is the key to the inquiry--and it is impossible to make \nany judgment about the propriety of Mr. Bolton's requests without \nknowing the names.\n  I am inclined to think there is nothing improper in Mr. Bolton's \nrequests for this NSA information.\n  But the longer the executive branch withholds this material, the more \nI start to wonder. If Mr. Bolton did nothing wrong, then why won't the \nadministration let us confirm that?\n  Senator Rockefeller reported to our committee yesterday that Mr. \nBolton, upon learning from NSA the identity of a U.S. official who had \ndelivered a message just the way that Bolton wanted it to be delivered, \nsought out that U.S. official and congratulated him. That action may \nhave violated the restrictions that NSA imposes on further \ndissemination of its information.\n  More importantly, if Mr. Bolton used U.S. person identities in an NSA \nintercept to congratulate officials who did what he wanted, might he \nalso have used such U.S. person identities to attack officials with \nwhom he did not agree? That has been suggested in the press, and while \nI doubt that Mr. Bolton would do that, Senator Rockefeller's report \nurges the Foreign Relations Committee to seek:\n\n       . . . a more complete understanding of the extent to which \n     he may have shared with others the nineteen U.S. person \n     identities he requested and received from the NSA.\n\n  All Members of the Senate should understand: both the integrity of \nthe nomination process, and the Senate's constitutional role, are being \nchallenged today.\n  The failure of the administration to cooperate with the committee, \nand one\n\n[[Page S5987]]\n\nof the rationales offered for this failure--that the:\n\n       Department does not believe these requests to be \n     specifically tied to the issues being deliberated by the \n     Committee\n\n--has no constitutional justification.\n  The administration has asserted neither executive privilege nor any \nother constitutionally-based rationale for not cooperating with this \ncommittee.\n  It has no right under past practice or under constitutional theory to \ndeny us information on a nomination based on its own belief that the \nrequest is not specifically tied to the issues being deliberated by the \nCommittee.\n  Under the doctrine of separation of powers, the Senate is a co-equal \nbranch of Government. It is within our power--and ours alone--to decide \nwhat we think is relevant to our deliberations in the exercise of the \nadvice and consent power.\n  To acquiesce in the administration's remarkable assertion would \nundermine the Senate's power. If we vote on this nomination without \ngetting all the facts first, that it is a step that we will all come to \nregret.\n  The request for this cloture vote is not a filibuster. If there were \na filibuster, we would have demanded the use of 30 hours of debate time \npost-cloture.\n  This vote is a vote about the Senate's constitutional power. It is a \nvote to tell the executive branch it must turn over information the \nSenate has requested.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject cloture.\n  The Constitution, to paraphrase Hamilton in Federalist 76, is \ndesigned to make sure that nobody becomes an appointed official at the \nexecutive level, the Cabinet level, whom the President does not want. \nThat is a guarantee. But it does not guarantee the President gets the \nfirst person he asks for, or the second person. It guarantees that the \nSenate will use due diligence in determining whether the person the \nPresident of the United States nominates to fill a position--in this \ncase, ambassador to the United Nations--whether that appointment is in \nthe interest of the United States of America.\n  That is our job. We are not filibustering. This is not about whether \nwe will vote on Mr. Bolton's nomination. The Senator from Connecticut \nand I and others have said, we are ready to vote on Mr. Bolton's \nnomination, if you give us information that we have requested and are \nentitled to in assessing whether Mr. Bolton should go to the U.N. \nrepresenting the United States of America.\n  The President has an option under the Constitution. He can say, \nSenate, what you are asking for is a violation of the separation of \npowers doctrine; you are not entitled to the information you seek \nbecause it falls into the purview of what we call executive privilege. \nIn order for me as President--or for any President--to be able to \nconduct my job I must be able to have conversations with my key people \nthat are wide ranging and open with the sure knowledge they will never \nget beyond this Oval Office; otherwise, the President couldn't do his \njob. That is what executive privilege is all about. As the Executive, I \nhave the privilege to have confidential discussions with my \nsubordinates. Or, the information you are seeking infringes upon the \npower of the executive in such a way that you are usurping article II \npowers, or attempting to yield them, like Estrada, to the third branch \nof Government in article III.\n  They do not assert any of that. They just say the information we have \nasked for, in their opinion, is not relevant to our legitimate inquiry. \nThat is a new one for all the years I have been here.\n  I thank the majority leader of the Senate, Senator Frist, for trying \nwhat I believe has been his level best to get the information. He and I \nhad a call today. He has talked about this. I am sure I am not \nrevealing anything I shouldn't. He contacted the National Security \nAgency. He said, Why can't we see the so-called intercepts we are \ntalking about? Give me, the majority leader, the same information you \ngave to Mr. Bolton and his staff.\n  The majority leader was surprised when he was told by a general \nrunning the National Security Agency, No, I won't give you that. I will \ngive you the same thing I gave to the Intelligence Committee which is a \nredacted document. That is a fancy phrase for saying, the document \nwithout the names.\n  I said, Mr. Leader, I think that is not good enough. I think he knows \nit is not good enough. This is strong-arming. They are making no \nargument as to why we are not entitled to it.\n  I remind Members, the information we are seeking is information Mr. \nBolton's staff got. Mr. Bolton, as important as an under secretary is, \nis not the majority leader of the Senate; he is not the Senator from \nConnecticut. Mr. Bolton's staff got this information.\n  I asked the leader why they wouldn't release the information, and he \nsaid because it is highly secret. Translate that. Got that? They are \nnot going to give information to the leader of the Senate because it is \nsecret. In the neighborhood I come from, that means, you don't trust \nme. The nerve of this outfit to say they are not going to give the \ninformation.\n  With regard to Syria--and my time is about up--we have asked for \ninformation relating to whether Mr. Bolton was lying to us and whether \nMr. Bolton was trying to get us into war with Syria in the summer of \n2003 when a lot of people wanted to go to war.\n  Remember the argument? The argument was that all the weapons of mass \ndestruction--that turned out never to have existed--were smuggled to \nSyria. Syria has them, plus a nuclear program, and we better do \nsomething about it. And what the intelligence community said to Mr. \nBolton was, you cannot say that--or whatever it was that he proposed to \nsay. The facts do not sustain it. He pushed and pushed and pushed. But \nhe told the Foreign Relations Committee he had nothing to do with that \ndraft testimony, he was not pushing.\n  All we want to see is the draft texts of the speech and the material \non the clearance process. I hope the Senate will stand up for itself \ntoday at 6 o'clock.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I ask unanimous consent to address the Senate as if in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, before I make the remarks, let me \nreaffirm my commitment and my support for John Bolton as ambassador to \nthe United Nations.\n  Like every Member of this Senate, I recognize the importance of that \nappointment. I recognize the concerns many of my constituents in \nGeorgia have had with the United Nations. John Bolton is the right man \nat the right time for this country to be our ambassador to the United \nNations.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Isakson are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, once again, I come to the floor to voice my \nconcerns regarding the appointment of John Bolton to an important \noffice in this administration. This time he is being promoted to a \nGovernment position with high international profile, the U.S. \nambassador to the United Nations. I believe his appointment to this \npost will harm our interests at the UN and hamstring our international \ncooperation efforts.\n  Mr. Bolton, whom I opposed when he was nominated to be the Under \nSecretary for Arms Control, did not distinguish himself in his last \njob. His comments about the North Korean regime during sensitive \nnegotiations almost derailed our efforts there. This is not just my \nopinion. After his remarks, Mr. Bolton's superiors recalled him to the \nUnited States and sent a replacement. This blunder is not the only \nblack mark on Mr. Bolton's record. He also failed in another highly \ncritical negotiation--our unsuccessful attempts to convince Iran to \ncurtail its nuclear activities.\n  Mr. Bolton also has publicly and often expressed his disdain for the \nUnited Nations--the very institution the President has chosen to send \nhim presumably to represent us and pursue our interests. How can he do \nthat when his public criticism of the U.N. has been, not constructive \nor thoughtful, but heavy handed and destructive? He has advocated not \npaying our U.N. dues and, in a moment of high arrogance, said he \nthought there should only be one permanent member of the Security \nCouncil--the United States--to reflect today's international power \nstructure. Statements like these make our allies believe that we do not \nvalue their cooperation and effort--and perhaps Mr.\n\n[[Page S5988]]\n\nBolton does not. His remarks create ill will and make it harder for us \nto lead in the international community--and perhaps Mr. Bolton believes \nthe United States needs to play no role in that community. He has a \nright to those views. But we in the Senate have a right not to consent \nto the appointment to the ambassador to the U.N. of a man whose views \nwould, in my opinion, keep him from being able to do his job.\n  There is an old saying that ``you gather more flies with honey, than \nwith vinegar''. I am afraid that we are sending a big bottle of vinegar \nto the U.N., and it will attract us no friends. Diplomacy requires \ntact. It requires being able to use both the carrot and the stick, \nrewards and sanctions. Mr. Bolton seems to be focused entirely on the \nstick, believing that by wielding our power and the threat of force \nlike a cudgel, we can bring the international community into line. I do \nnot agree.\n  Senator Voinovich was right when he said the United States can do \nbetter than John Bolton. There are so many bright, gifted people in the \nadministration that would do a better job and be a better fit. I regret \nthe President did not send one of those people to us for this high \nprofile job. Mr. Bolton's presence at the U.N. will do little to build \nour prestige around the world, and may well hamstring our efforts in \nthe war on terror. I urge my colleagues to vote against this nominee.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the nomination \nof John Bolton to be the United States Representative to the United \nNations.\n  I have three criteria I use to evaluate all executive branch \nnominees: competence, integrity, and commitment to the core mission of \nthe department.\n  Mr. Bolton has had wide-ranging experience and is competent.\n  I do not agree with many of Mr. Bolton's past statements about the \nU.N. However, his statements during the confirmation process indicate \nhe is now committed to the mission of the U.N. I will give him the \nbenefit of the doubt on this one.\n  But I cannot be so flexible when it comes to the very serious \nquestions about Mr. Bolton's integrity.\n  I rise today as the Senator from Maryland and as a long-time member \nof the Senate Intelligence Committee. I have been working on reforming \nour intelligence community since I first became a member of the \nIntelligence Committee before the tragedy of September 11. I served on \nthe 2002 joint inquiry about what happened on that terrible day. I \nserved on the Intelligence Committee's 2003 review of Iraq \nintelligence.\n  I worked on the 2004 reform legislation that built on the work of the \n9/11 Commission and that we passed last year. We looked for ways to \nprevent what happened on September 11 from ever happening again. We \nlooked for ways to make sure that what happened with Iraq--where we \nthought there were weapons that weren't there--will never happen again. \nWe looked for ways to get the right information to policy makers.\n  Throughout all that work over the years, I have kept the many \ntalented, hard working, dedicated, and patriotic Americans working \nthroughout the world for our intelligence agencies foremost in my mind. \nOne of my central concerns has been to try to ensure that they have the \nright and ability to do their jobs: to get the facts and speak truth to \npower.\n  Speaking truth to power means telling the boss what he or she should \nhear rather than just what they want to hear. This is absolutely \ncritical to the security of our Nation. That is why I am opposing John \nBolton's nomination to be America's Representative to the United \nNations. It is clear to me that he does not respect the truth or the \nhard working experts that labor day in and day out to provide policy \nmakers with the best information and their best judgments.\n  I have carefully reviewed the report prepared by the Foreign \nRelations Committee. It is evident to me, from reading the minority \nviews of the committee's report, that Mr. Bolton is a bully, but not \njust any bully. He is a bully with a purpose: to browbeat intelligence \nprofessionals to disregard the facts, and to send a message to all the \nother intelligence professionals that they speak the truth at their \nperil. His purpose seems clear: to intimidate. His actions seem clear: \nto retaliate.\n  Mr. Bolton retaliated against those who disagreed with him. He claims \nnot to have sought to have anyone fired. He said he merely ``lost \nconfidence'' in them. But, that's just a polite way to say a person is \nunqualified and should be fired. It's a distinction without a \ndifference. When a senior policy maker has lost confidence in you, I \nthink we can all agree that your career is effectively over.\n  Playing with words cannot obscure the fact that Mr. Bolton went after \nintelligence professionals for doing their jobs, for telling the truth, \nfor speaking truth to power. He was the power, the boss, the senior \nofficial and he had no use for truth.\n  According to the investigation by the Foreign Relations Committee, \nMr. Bolton tried to fire an analyst with the State Department's Bureau \nof Intelligence and Research. The intelligence professional disagreed \nabout language regarding biological weapons that Mr. Bolton wanted to \ninclude in a speech. Mr. Bolton also asked that the National \nIntelligence Officer for Latin America be reassigned, because he told \nMr. Bolton that the language on biological weapons did not reflect the \nintelligence community's assessment.\n  Mr. Bolton also appears to have abused his access to intelligence. \nThe Senate Intelligence Committee recently investigated charges that \nMr. Bolton shared classified information that he received from the NSA. \nThe minority view of that investigation concluded that Mr. Bolton did \nshare classified information, after being specifically instructed by \nNSA not to do so. Even more troubling, it appears that the reason Mr. \nBolton gave the NSA to justify his ``need to know'' was not the real \nreason he sought out the information.\n  This is yet another example of John Bolton using and misusing \nintelligence to suit his own purposes. It is also clear that Mr. Bolton \nbullied a number of others who dared to disagree with him, including \nothers in the intelligence community. My colleagues--Senator Biden, \nSenator Voinovich and others--have detailed these charges well, and I \nwill not repeat that here.\n  Mr. Bolton's intolerant attitude and conduct must not be rewarded. It \ninevitably results in chilling truth and facts. It is an attitude \nhostile to the very concept of speaking truth to power.\n  We need the world to understand that the United States getting Iraq \nwrong was an aberration, a one-time, never-to-be-repeated mistake. The \nworld must believe, and it must be true, that facts and truth are what \ninform our policies and actions at home and abroad.\n  They must also believe our leaders and policy makers when they speak. \nWhen we speak about intelligence, people cannot be wondering, is that \nAmerican lying to me, misleading me, telling me half the truth.\n  The stakes are too high: war and peace; life and death; weapons of \nmass destruction; Iran; North Korea; terrorism. These are the stakes we \nare talking about.\n  America cannot afford to send someone to the U.N. that many people \nalready believe does not respect the truth. We already have a huge \ncredibility gap at the U.N. and in the world.\n  The U.N. was where our respected Secretary of State laid out our case \nfor going to war with Iraq. We disclosed extensive intelligence \ninformation to demonstrate that Iraq had WMD, that it was a threat to \nthe region, our country and the world. We now know, through no fault of \nour Secretary of State, that much of that information was wrong.\n\n  Many of us have worked tirelessly to make sure that something like \nthat never happens again. Building on the work of the 9/11 Commission, \nwe worked for much of last year to pass dramatic and broad based reform \nof our intelligence community. We fought hard to make sure that a \nsingle person would be in charge of the entire intelligence community, \nto mandate alternative or red team analysis to always make sure that we \npolicymakers have the best information available.\n  We are now working to make that reform a reality. Just last month, I \nvoted with 97 of my colleagues to confirm the\n\n[[Page S5989]]\n\ncountry's first Director of National Intelligence and his deputy. We \nhave done much, but there is much to do.\n  We are building a new foundation for our entire intelligence \ncommunity. It is a work in progress. Every step is important.\n  But one of the most important steps is ensuring that our intelligence \nprofessionals understand and believe that their work is valued. That \ntruth and facts are important. That they can and must speak truth to \npower. That we are on their side. That the Senate of the United States \ntakes these matters seriously.\n  That is why at the confirmation hearing of our nation's first nominee \nfor Director of National Intelligence, I asked Mr. Negroponte if he \nagreed that the professionals in the intelligence community must be \nfree to ``speak truth to power.'' He said, ``Truth to power is crucial. \nAnd we've got to assure the objectivity and integrity of our \nintelligence analysts.''\n  I also asked him if he will create a tone where there will be no \nretaliation for people who attempt to speak the truth. Mr. Negroponte \nsaid, ``Yes. I think the short answer to you is a categorical yes.''\n  I asked those questions of the nominee, who was under oath and at an \nopen hearing, for two very important reasons.\n  First, I wanted the world to hear what he had to say.\n  Second, I wanted all of our intelligence professionals throughout the \nWorld to hear what he had to say.\n  I wanted our intelligence professionals to know that they were \nauthorized, indeed, obligated to seek the truth and speak the truth. \nAnd, I wanted them to know that our most senior intelligence \nprofessional, the Director of National Intelligence, would not tolerate \nretaliation for speaking truth to power. Mr. Negroponte's statements \nstand on their own.\n  I believe it would be wrong to confirm Mr. Bolton as the United \nStates representative to the United Nations. He has disregarded the \ntruth. He has sought to punish intelligence professionals for speaking \nthe truth. He has tried to intimidate intelligence professionals into \nagreeing with him regardless of the facts.\n  To confirm Mr. Bolton would send a terrible message to our \nintelligence professionals. It would be a terrible signal for our \nintelligence reform efforts. It would undermine our efforts to restore \nour credibility in the world and to do the hard work of reforming the \nUnited Nations.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have been privileged to have served under \nboth President Clinton and President George W. Bush as one of the two \nSenate delegates to the United Nations, and there is no doubt that the \nUnited States Permanent Representative to the U.N. is one of the most \nimportant diplomatic posts in the U.S. government.\n  The Permanent Representative is the public face, voice, and vote of \nthe United States at the world's only body charged with maintaining \ninternational peace and security. Therefore, it is essential that this \nindividual be someone with indisputable integrity and extraordinary \ndiplomatic abilities. After listening to John Bolton's confirmation \nhearings before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I feel \nconfident in saying that John Bolton is not that person.\n  Most troubling to me are allegations from senior U.S. intelligence \nofficials--including a senior Bush administration appointee--of Mr. \nBolton trying to intimidate and even remove intelligence analysts \nsimply because they did not share his political views. Mr. Bolton even \nwent so far as to get in his car and go out to the CIA to seek the \nremoval of one intelligence officer. At any time, but especially in the \nwake of the massive intelligence failures associated with the decision \nto invade Iraq, efforts by administration officials to shape \nintelligence to conform to a particular preconceived view is \nunacceptable. It is essential that dissent be tolerated and even \nencouraged in the intelligence community and not distorted to fit a \nparticular ideology or political agenda.\n  Second, I have strong concerns that Mr. Bolton's pattern of \ninflammatory statements about the U.N. will make it difficult for him \nto effectively advance U.S. security interests in New York and to build \nsupport for much-needed reforms at the U.N. The last thing we want is \nfor countries to make Mr. Bolton an excuse for resisting reform. Taking \na tougher approach to the U.N. through constructive criticism is one \nthing; disregarding its value and belittling its very existence is \nanother. We need someone in New York who is unafraid to shake things up \nand challenge the status quo, but that person must also have the \ncredibility, temperament, and diplomatic skills to work with other \nnations, form coalitions, and advance U.S. interests. The only tool in \nMr. Bolton's toolbox appears to be a hammer.\n  Third, I am disturbed by some of the contradictions in Mr. Bolton's \nrecent testimony. For example, Mr. Bolton pledged to the Foreign \nRelations Committee that he has not and will not make statements that \nare not approved by the administration. Yet his own testimony about \nIran appeared to do just that--using language rejected by the \nadministration more than a year ago. There are other instances of this \nbehavior during the hearings, where our Ambassador to South Korea has \ndisputed what Mr. Bolton said\n  Finally, there is a tone and temperament issue with Mr. Bolton's \nnomination. According to respected officials who have worked with him, \nMr. Bolton bullies, belittles and undermines those who do not agree \nwith him. We all lose our cool from time to time. Disagreements are \npart of human discourse. But, there is a pattern with Mr. Bolton that \ngoes beyond appropriate behavior--a disturbing trait for someone \nseeking to become our chief diplomat at a place where people come \ntogether to resolve disagreements.\n  When Mr. Bolton was nominated to be Under Secretary of State in 2001, \nI strongly opposed and voted against his nomination. At that time, I \nhad serious reservations about his experience, diplomatic temperament, \nand his poor track record on non-proliferation and arms control. Over \nthe last four years, Mr. Bolton has proved me right. As the top \nproliferation official at the State Department, Mr. Bolton has been \nineffective in his current responsibilities and the world has become \nmore dangerous under his watch. The Bush administration's record on \nproliferation, from Pakistan to Iran to North Korea, has been poor, at \nbest.\n  After much debate, the Foreign Relations Committee was not able to \nsupport Mr. Bolton's nomination and, rather, reported it out without \nrecommendation. Secretary Powell's Chief of Staff has said that Mr. \nBolton would be an ``abysmal'' ambassador to the U.N. I might not put \nit as strongly as that, but I will be opposing the nomination of Mr. \nBolton.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition \nto the nomination of John Bolton to be the next United States \nAmbassador to the United Nations.\n  Simply put, he is the wrong man at the wrong time for what is an \nimportant and critical position.\n  At a time when the reputation of the United States is at an all time \nlow in many parts of the world and our military is stretched thin, we \nneed a representative at the United Nations who can engage and work \nwith our friends and allies to forge multilateral solutions on: the war \non terror, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, global \npoverty, the HIV/AIDS pandemic, and global warming, just to name a few.\n  Yet throughout his career, John Bolton has demonstrated an \nunrestrained contempt for diplomacy and international treaties.\n  In a letter to Senator Richard Lugar, chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, 102 former American diplomats representing both \nDemocratic and Republican administrations urged the committee to reject \nMr. Bolton's nomination because of his ``exceptional record of \nopposition to efforts to enhance U.S. security through arms control. \nThe letter notes that Mr. Bolton led the effort against ratification of \nthe Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty; blocked a more robust international \nagreement to curb the proliferation of small arms; led the effort to \nblock the Ottawa Landmine Treaty; led the effort to have the United \nStates withdraw from negotiations to formulate a verification system \nfor the Biological Weapons Convention; and led the campaign to have the \nU.S. withdraw from the ABM Treaty.\n\n[[Page S5990]]\n\n  What sort of message do we send to our friends and allies by \nnominating an ideologue and not a consensus builder for this leading \npost at the United Nations?\n  I, for one, am unaware of another nominee to an international body \nwho has garnered so much opposition from individuals who have served on \nthe front lines of American diplomacy.\n  The fact is, these 102 U.S. diplomats who have written in strenuous \nopposition to Mr. Bolton recognize that dialogue, cooperation, and, \nyes, compromise are essential if we are to build alliances and enlist \nthe support of other states in tackling the common problems we all \nface.\n  By opposing virtually every meaningful arms control treaty over the \npast few years, John Bolton has placed his faith in a unilateral, go-\nit-alone foreign policy that has stretched our military thin and \ndramatically weakened respect for America in the world.\n  I had hoped that President Bush would make the rebuilding of our \nfriendships and alliances a priority for the next four years. The \nnomination of Mr. Bolton sends precisely a different signal that the \nU.N. will continue to be our rhetorical whipping boy.\n  We all know that we cannot afford to go it alone in taking on the \ngreat challenges in front of us. It is faulty to assume that once he \narrives at the United Nations headquarters in New York, John Bolton \nwill suddenly discover a new faith in diplomacy and international \nagreements.\n  It is also a stretch to assume that John Bolton will likewise \ndiscover a newfound faith in the United Nations and its mission. Many \nof Mr. Bolton's comments about the United Nations have been raised \nbefore but they are worth repeating. Such as:\n\n       There is no such thing as the United Nations. There is an \n     international community that occasionally can be led by the \n     only real power left in the world and that is the United \n     States when it suits our interest and we can get others to go \n     along.\n       The secretariat building in New York has 38 stories. If you \n     lost ten stories today it wouldn't make a bit of difference.\n       If I were redoing the Security Council today, I'd have one \n     permanent member because that's the real reflection of the \n     distribution of power in the world . . . the United States.\n\n  As my friend and colleague Senator Biden has stated, when you listen \nto quotes such as these, you wonder why Mr. Bolton would even want the \njob of Ambassador to the United Nations.\n  Indeed, given his disdain for the institution and the other members \nof the Security Council, Mr. Bolton is unlikely to find a receptive \naudience for his ideas and initiatives, much less be able to forge \nalliances to protect American interests and increase global security.\n  How successful is Mr. Bolton likely to be in enlisting United Nations \nsupport for promoting political stability and economic development in \nIraq and Afghanistan; stopping the genocide in Darfur; convincing North \nKorea and Iran to forgo their respective nuclear weapons programs; \ncombating the global HIV/AIDS pandemic; stopping the proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction; and fighting the war on terror?\n\n  To say the least, I have little confidence in Mr. Bolton's chances \nfor success if he is confirmed and his inability to be an effective and \nconstructive ambassador will produce disastrous consequences for \nAmerican foreign policy.\n  In response to the mounting criticism of the President's nomination, \nthe administration has attempted to shift the debate from Mr. Bolton's \nqualifications to the need for reform of the United Nations.\n  A vote for Mr. Bolton is a vote for reform at the U.N., they argue. A \nvote against Mr. Bolton is a vote for the status quo. A blunt, no-\nnonsense approach is needed to get the job done.\n  Nothing could be further from the truth. Mr. Bolton has made it clear \nthat he does not have faith in multilateral diplomacy or the mission of \nthe United Nations. Why should we expect him to be committed to a more \neffective United Nations? How effective is a blunt manner if the \nindividual is unprepared to listen or compromise?\n  United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan has produced a report on \nrecommendations for reforming the U.N. so that it can better tackle the \nchallenges of the new century. The United States should play a \nmeaningful and constructive role in that debate.\n  But his inflexible views and harsh temperament suggest to me that Mr. \nBolton will himself be the issue at the U.N.--not the steps that need \nto be taken to improve the workings of the institution.\n  Let me turn now to several allegations have been made about Mr. \nBolton's past conduct as Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and \nInternational Security that raise serious questions about his fitness \nto serve as United States ambassador to the United Nations.\n  As detailed in the minority report of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee on his nomination, Mr. Bolton sought to replace two \nintelligence analysts, Christian Westermann, a State Department analyst \nin the Bureau of Intelligence and Research, and the National \nIntelligence Officer, NIO, for Latin America at the Central \nIntelligence Agency, who refused to back his assertion that Cuba was \ndeveloping a biological weapons program; exaggerated intelligence on \nCuba's biological weapons program and Syria's nuclear activities to fit \nhis own personal views; and pushed for the dismissal of a State \nDepartment official he wrongly accused of purposefully withholding a \ndocument.\n  Supporters of Mr. Bolton's nomination argue that these charges should \nfall by the waistside because no one lost their job and his statements \nlargely reflected the views of the intelligence community.\n  Even if you assume that this is true, Mr. Bolton's efforts to trash \nintelligence analysts and pattern intelligence to fit his views, had a \nchilling effect on the intelligence community and its ability to \nprovide sound, credible intelligence.\n  Robert Hutchings, the former Chairman of the National Intelligence \nCouncil, told the Foreign Relations Committee:\n\n       [W]hen policy officials come back repeatedly to push the \n     same kinds of judgments, and push the Intelligence Community \n     to confirm a particular set of judgments, it does have the \n     effect of politicizing intelligence, because the so called \n     `correct answer' becomes all too clear . . . it creates a \n     climate of intimidation and a culture of conformity that is \n     damaging.\n\n  Given the failure of pre-war intelligence on Iraq and the profound \nnegative impact that failure had on the credibility of the United \nStates in the international community, we should not send a \nrepresentative to the United Nations who has sought to conform \nintelligence to his stated views and punish those who disagreed with \nhim.\n  Indeed, the next United States Ambassador to the United Nations may \nvery well be charged with gathering international support to convince \nIran and North Korea to abandon their nuclear weapons programs. A \nperson of Mr. Bolton's credibility on intelligence matters is unlikely \nto garner much support and, indeed will likely face stiffer opposition.\n  Surely the President can find another nominee who is committed to \nmultilateral diplomacy and appreciates, rather than denigrates, the \ngoals and mission of the United Nations.\n  Despite what the administration may assert about Mr. Bolton's \n``blunt'' manner, such an individual will be far more effective at \nrepresenting United States interests, shaping alliances to confront \nproblems that transcend borders, and encouraging U.N. reform.\n  Mr. Bolton has made a career out of shunning diplomacy, blasting the \nUnited Nations, ignoring the advice of others, and moving ahead with a \nforeign policy that emphasizes arrogance over leadership.\n  In these difficult times, he is a risk, not an asset, in advancing \nour national security interests abroad and on that basis does not \ndeserve the Senate's support in confirming his nomination.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, today I will be voting against the \nnomination of John Bolton to be Ambassador to the United Nations.\n  When the President first nominated Mr. Bolton for this position, I \nexpressed deep disappointment and concern. First, because of his \nrepeated expression of disdain for the organization. But, more \nimportantly, because Mr. Bolton is as responsible as any member of the \nadministration for the needless confrontations with the rest of the \nworld and for the international isolation that plagued President Bush's \nfirst term and for the shaky credibility\n\n[[Page S5991]]\n\nwe carry today. At a time when we need to be strengthening our \nalliances and making full use of international institutions to achieve \nour foreign policy goals, sending Mr. Bolton to the United Nations \nsends the exact wrong message. I don't accept his view that the U.N. is \na vehicle to be used by the U.S. ``when it suits our interests and we \ncan get others to go along.'' Diplomacy in most people's minds requires \nattention to more than just coalitions of the willing.\n  Over the past month, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has \nuncovered a pattern of behavior on the part of Mr. Bolton that has only \nconfirmed my concerns. Most disturbing to me is the evidence of Mr. \nBolton's troubled and confrontational relationship with our \nintelligence community.\n  In speeches and testimony, he has appeared to stretch the available \nintelligence to fit his preconceived views. On three separate \noccasions, he tried to inflate language characterizing our intelligence \nassessments regarding Syria's nuclear activities. He sought to \nexaggerate the intelligence community's views about Cuba's possible \nbiological weapons activities. His track record, on these and other \nmatters, was so bad that the Deputy Secretary of State made an \nextraordinary order--that Mr. Bolton could not give any testimony or \nspeech that was not personally cleared by the Deputy Secretary or the \nSecretary's Chief of Staff.\n  He also dampened critical debates among professionals on important \npolicy issues by retaliating against analysts who presented a different \npoint of view than his own. For example, on three occasions over a six \nmonth period, he sought to remove a mid-level analyst who disputed the \nlanguage he tried to use about Cuba.\n  The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is a serious matter. \nI would not criticize Mr. Bolton for asking intelligence analysts hard \nquestions about proliferation issues, nor should policy makers refrain \nfrom challenging the assumptions of those analysts. But Mr. Bolton was \ndoing something far different. He made it clear that he expected \nintelligence analyses that conformed with his preconceived policy \nviews. Rather than welcome contrary intelligence analyses as essential \nto an informed debate, he retaliated against those who offered contrary \nviews.\n  Mr. Bolton's approach to those around him has been harshly criticized \nby those who have worked with him. Larry Wilkerson, the Chief of Staff \nfor Secretary Powell, called him a ``lousy leader.'' Carl Ford, former \nhead of the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research, \nreferred to Mr. Bolton as a ``quintessential kiss-up, kick-down sort of \nguy.''\n  This is not the person we need at the United Nations. Good diplomacy, \nlike good business, relies on a great team and a good leader. Good \nleaders listen. They listen to their troops, they make reasoned \ndecisions, they take responsibility, and they build the respect and \nloyalty of their staff. Management by fear is a recipe, in both public \nservice and the private sector, for getting only the information that \nyou want to hear. Shoot the messenger and other messengers will not \nvolunteer to deliver the bad news. And I submit to you that Mr. Bolton \nhas developed a reputation for shooting the messenger.\n  We must begin to learn the lessons of Iraq. It should be more than \nclear by now that our national interests are damaged when policy makers \nbend intelligence. And we should all understand by now that accurate, \nobjective intelligence requires analysts who are free to offer \ndiffering views. We face serious threats, from international terrorism \nto the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. We have serious \nforeign policy concerns to address, from genocide to global climate \nchange. Protecting our national security interests demands policy \nmakers who seek objective intelligence on these and other challenges. \nGiven his track record, John Bolton is clearly not that policy maker.\n  Another lesson of Iraq is the critical importance of American \ncredibility. The inaccurate presentations made by our Government to the \ninternational community have done serious damage to our interests. If \nwe are to gain the active support of other nations in confronting \ncommon threats such as terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, we \nwill need to convince those nations of our views. To do so, we will \nneed their trust. This challenge is especially complicated at the \nUnited Nations, where Secretary of State Colin Powell gave what turned \nout to be an almost entirely inaccurate presentation on Iraq, and where \nthe administration dismissed all alternative views, including those of \nU.N. inspectors. Mr. Bolton is not the person to repair this damage. \nAnd his record makes it extremely unlikely that he could rebuild our \ncredibility in the international community in its most visible forum--\nthe U.N.\n  The nomination of John Bolton is a lost opportunity for this \nadministration to regain American leadership at the United Nations. It \nis also dangerous. Failure to gain support in the U.N. for our policies \nputs us at unnecessary risk. Simply put, we cannot afford an \nineffective Ambassador at the United Nations.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, before the people of New Jersey \nelected me to the Senate 23 years ago, I worked in the corporate world.\n  I helped start a company from scratch, and when I left, we had about \n20 thousand employees.\n  I learned a few things about hiring people.\n  I learned that a person might be an intelligent human being. They \nmight be proficient at many things. They might have a lot of \ninteresting ideas.\n  But if they don't fit the description for the position you need to \nfill, they are not the right person for the job.\n  If you need a carpenter, you don't hire someone who can't use a \nhammer, even if they know a lot about houses.\n  If you need help with your taxes, you hire an accountant, not a music \nteacher.\n  And if you need someone to represent the United States to the other \ncountries of the world, you hire a diplomat, not an ideologue.\n  We are talking about the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations.\n  This is not an entry level position. This job calls for an \nexperienced diplomat.\n  What does that entail? Webster's Dictionary defines ``diplomacy'' as: \nthe art and practice of conducting negotiations between nations for the \nattainment of mutually satisfactory terms; the procedures, methods and \nforms employed in conducting such negotiations; the skillful or \nsuccessful settlement of differences between peoples; and, adroitness \nor artfulness in securing advantages without arousing hostility.\n  That definition does not sound like the Mr. Bolton we have heard \nabout.\n  If we send Mr. Bolton to the United Nations, we would be sending a \ngo-it-alone ideologue with open disdain for the U.N., exactly what our \ncountry does not need.\n  Around the world today, polls show that even citizens of our \nstrongest allies have a generally unfavorable view of the United \nStates.\n  I realize that many Americans say, ``why should we care what other \nnations think?''\n  And the answer is, the attitudes of other nations affect our national \nsecurity.\n  We recently celebrated VE Day. It was a day I will never forget, \nbecause I was serving in the Army in Europe. I celebrated the end of \nthe war with my Army buddies, as well as British soldiers who were our \nallies.\n  As much as we might like to think that we don't need anything from \nany other country, it certainly was good to have allies in World War \nII.\n  And wouldn't it be good today if more nations would send troops to \nIraq, so some of our soldiers could come home, and so American \ntaxpayers wouldn't have to bear most of the cost of that war?\n  Whether we like it or not, world opinion matters.\n  The fact is, none of the major challenges our Nation faces today can \nbe conquered by us alone.\n  In order to win the war on terror, curb global warming or succeed in \nthe international economy, we need our allies and international \ninstitutions.\n  Failing to engage these indispensable partners will make U.S. efforts \nless effective, and jeopardize the stability, security, prosperity, and \nhealth of Americans.\n  John Bolton is the wrong man to forge the alliances we need to \naddress these vital challenges.\n  Instead of reaching out to the rest of the world, his nomination \nwould push\n\n[[Page S5992]]\n\nother nations away and isolate America.\n  Yesterday my friend from Indiana complained that we were putting Mr. \nBolton's career ``under a microscope.''\n  Well, when I was in the private sector and my company was evaluating \na potential new hire for a key position, that's exactly what we did--\nand I don't think there's anything wrong with it.\n  Mr. Bolton's track record at the State Department does not withstand \nclose scrutiny.\n  As Undersecretary at State, he did nothing to resolve the potentially \nexplosive situations in North Korea and Iran. Instead, he inflamed \nthem.\n  He has blocked international arrangements including treaties limiting \nnuclear weapons testing, landmines, child soldiers, missile defense, \nand small arms trade.\n  He dismantled the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, and blocked a \nverification clause to the bio-weapons treaty.\n  And he was a leading opponent against the ratification of the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n  Mr. Bolton does not have the credibility or the diplomatic skill to \nrepresent U.S. interests globally.\n  A smart businessman not only considers the work experience of a \npotential employee--you also look at his character and ability to get \nalong with other people.\n  In this regard, Mr. Bolton also falls short.\n  For example, in 2002, he sought to exaggerate assessments of Syria's \nnuclear weapons capability and Cuba's biological weapons activities and \nsupport for terrorism beyond what U.S. intelligence believed to be \ntrue.\n  Dr. Robert Hutchings, former chair of the National Intelligence \nCouncil, described Mr. Bolton's efforts as ``cherry-picking of little \nfactoids and little isolated bits that were drawn out to present the \nstarkest possible case.''\n  Mr. Bolton bullied and tried to remove analysts whose work did not \nreflect his own biases.\n  As if all this were not enough, it appears now that Mr. Bolton was \nnot truthful in his testimony before our Foreign Relations Committee on \nApril 11.\n  Among John Bolton's misstatements:\n  He said he did not try to get a State Department employee fired. He \nsaid he did not threaten any employees because of their views. He said \nhe did not act against those officials because of differing views. He \nsaid the U.S. Ambassador to South Korea approved of his July 2003 \nspeech, when we now in fact know that Ambassador Hubbard got in touch \nwith the Foreign Relations Committee to ``correct the record.''\n  Just this month, 102 retired diplomats signed a letter to Senators \nLugar and Biden urging the Senate to reject the nomination of John \nBolton to be our Nation's Ambassador to the United Nations.\n  These former diplomats have served in both Democratic and Republican \nadministrations. They all agree that John Bolton is the wrong man for \nthe job.\n  I have heard Mr. Bolton compared to one of our former colleagues, my \ngood friend and neighbor, Senator Pat Moynihan.\n  That is nonsense. Mr. Moynihan was not afraid to criticize the status \nquo, but as his daughter pointed out in a recent newspaper column, he \nappreciated the importance of the United Nations.\n  Pat Moynihan would never say, as John Bolton said, that, ``if the \nUnited Nations lost 10 stories it wouldn't make a bit of difference.''\n  This is an important position. We owe it to our country to fill it \nwith the best person available. As my friend the Senator from Ohio said \nyesterday, ``The United States can do better than John Bolton.''\n  Mr. President, not only can we do better, for the good of the \ncountry, we must.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I speak today on the nomination of John \nBolton to be the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. I want to \nexpress my full support for his confirmation.\n  Despite the criticisms of some of my colleagues across the aisle, \nJohn Bolton is without a doubt one the most qualified people to fill \nthis position. I believe his no-nonsense diplomacy will be a welcome \nchange at the U.N., and one that will prove to be effective in the \nfuture.\n  Now more than ever, the United Nations is in need of drastic reform. \nAs the world's only super power and one of the original founders of the \norganization, it is the United States' responsibility to play leading \nrole in this reform. Mr. Bolton's nomination is a reflection of this \ncommitment. His pursuit for the truth will serve him well in holding \nthe United Nations accountable for its past mistakes.\n  Although he is not a career diplomat, Mr. Bolton has a strong record \nof success within the international community. He has played pivotal \nroles in the signing of the treaty of Moscow, the repeal of the U.N. \nGeneral Assembly's 1975 resolution that equated Zionism with racism, \nand the negotiations in the G-8 Partnership Against the Proliferation \nof WMD to name a few.\n  Mr. Bolton not only possesses the tenacity to deal with the U.N. but \nalso has experience dealing with the organization on a first-hand \nbasis. He voluntarily, I repeat voluntarily, worked for the U.N. \nbetween 1997 and 2000 with former Secretary of State James Baker on \nresolving the conflict in the Western Sahara. Not only did he play an \nintegral role in creating a viable ``peace plan'' for the area, but did \nso on his own time.\n  Mr. President, this flies directly in the face of my colleagues \nacross the isle, who repeatedly accuse Mr. Bolton of hating the U.N. \nand wanting to dismantle the organization permanently. Rather than \nbeing committed to the organization's demise, I believe he is more \ncommitted to making it stronger and more effective.\n  I find myself deeply saddened by the efforts of a minority of \nSenators to delay Mr. Bolton's confirmation. He is an extremely \nqualified candidate, who has been confirmed by the Senate four times in \nthe past. Why the change of heart now?\n  Rather than questioning Mr. Bolton's qualifications for the position \nand the need for U.N. reform, a minority of Senators are engaging \nthemselves in what boils down to character assassination. I challenge \nmy colleagues to look at Mr. Bolton's real character. He is a man of \nintegrity and honesty, whose candid personality will serve him well at \nthe United Nations.\n  I am confident the Senate will confirm Mr. Bolton. I wish him well in \nhis new position and with the daunting task of reforming the United \nNations. It is not an easy one. Despite this challenge, I believe he \nwill be a welcome addition to the organization and an agent of change \nin the international community.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have time reserved at 5:30, but I will \nmake a comment before that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have had the pleasure to work with my \ngood friend, John Bolton, on several issues. Each time I have worked \nwith him, he has proven to be helpful and driven to obtain the results \nthat will best serve the interests of the United States. He is a \nstraight shooter, a no-nonsense type of guy who knows how to get \nresults.\n  As most of my colleagues know, I take a special interest in issues \nregarding Asia. Alaska's past, present, and future have always looked \nwestward to Russia, China, Japan, and the Korean Peninsula. It is for \nthat reason that I have decided to support John Bolton.\n  North Korea has had nuclear aspirations many years and has taken \naggressive steps to acquire nuclear weapons years before the Bush \nadministration came into office.\n  John Bolton's straight-forward talk on North Korea should be \napplauded. He was telling the truth.\n  The United States made the good-faith effort with the 1994 Agreed \nFramework by providing food and support for building of the reactor. \nBut this agreement was destined to fail because of North Korea's \ntreacherous actions in the region. This is not a country we can trust. \nWe now know that North Korea began cheating on it almost as the ink was \ndrying by embarking on a covert uranium enrichment program.\n  The Bush administration has accomplished the core prerequisite for a \nlasting solution. It has galvanized the international community to work \ntogether on a lasting, multinational solution to the problem. The White \nHouse\n\n[[Page S5993]]\n\nhas stated that the next venue for this discussion will be the United \nNations.\n  John Bolton will be that voice, a compelling one, to ensure we are \nable to have an agreement that will stick. John Bolton is the strong \nvoice that is required to ensure that America's vision on a nuclear \nweapon free North Korea is heard at the United Nations.\n  John Bolton believes in frank and honest diplomacy. John Bolton has \nnot shied away from naming rogue states that violate international \ncommitments such as the Biological Weapons Convention, the Chemical \nWeapons Convention, and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.\n  He has had an effective working relationship with foreign \ngovernments, international institutions, nongovernmental organizations, \nand the private sector for over three decades.\n  There is no question that John Bolton is qualified for the position \nof U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., and here are just a few reasons why:\n  As the Under Secretary for Arms Control and International Security, \nJohn Bolton led the efforts to implement the President's strong \nnonproliferation agenda, including reform of the International Atomic \nEnergy Agency.\n  He has actively promoted effective multilateral solutions to real-\nworld problems such as the proposal to create a Special Committee of \nthe International Atomic Energy Agency Board to focus on safeguards and \nverification of nuclear programs.\n  John Bolton helped to bring about new leadership to improve the \nOrganization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.\n  He was the President's point person in designing the Proliferation \nSecurity Initiative. Over 60 nations are now working together to share \nintelligence and are taking action to stop the transfer of dangerous \nweapons. The Proliferation Security Initiative was instrumental in \ngetting Libya to make the strategic decision to abandon its WMD \nprograms.\n  The U.N. is in need of reform. John Bolton supports reform at the \nUnited Nations so it is accountable, transparent, and effective. While \nserving as the Assistant Secretary for International Organizations, he \ndetailed his concept of a ``Unitary U.N.'' that sought to ensure \nmanagement and budget reforms across the U.N. system. John Bolton will \nwork with member states and the Congress to reform the U.N.\n  Allegations that Bolton manipulated intelligence are unfounded. As a \npolicymaker, he asserted his view on intelligence. That was his job. \nPolicymakers should question information extensively before accepting \nit as fact. These were internal policy debates, which occur in all \nDepartments and agencies.\n  He may have disagreed with intelligence findings at times, but John \nBolton always accepted the final judgments of the intelligence \ncommunity.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the \nnomination of Undersecretary of State John Bolton as United States \nAmbassador to the United Nations, an institution which he has openly \nand repeatedly disdained.\n  A number of factors have led me to this decision, but they fall into \nseveral broad categories: Mr. Bolton's apparent abuse of the \nintelligence process and of his subordinates; his opposition to \npeacekeeping and other fundamental functions of the United Nations; his \ndisdain for the institution itself; his opposition to important \nnonproliferation efforts; and the poor judgment he has displayed on key \nforeign policy questions.\n  Furthermore, there is the nomination process itself as it has been \ncarried out in this case. Despite repeated requests from the Foreign \nRelations Committee, the executive branch did not provide key documents \nconcerning Mr. Bolton's requests to learn the identities of 10 U.S. \nofficials who were cited in intelligence intercepts.\n  The administration's failure to provide requested and relevant \ndocuments distorts the nomination process.\n  Although handicapped by a lack of information and candor, the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee examined the charges that Undersecretary of \nState Bolton abused the intelligence process by seeking to have those \nwho dared to dissent removed.\n  The evidence demonstrated a clear pattern of conduct that led 9 out \nof 18 members of that committee to vote against confirmation.\n  The minority views of the committee report on the Bolton nomination \nreached four firm conclusions on this matter:\n  One, Mr. Bolton repeatedly sought the removal of intelligence \nanalysts who disagreed with him.\n  Two, in preparing speeches and testimony, Mr. Bolton repeatedly tried \nto stretch intelligence to fit his views.\n  Three, in his relations with colleagues and subordinates, Mr. Bolton \nrepeatedly exhibited abusive behavior and intolerance for different \nviews.\n  Four, Mr. Bolton repeatedly made misleading, disingenuous, or \nnonresponsive statements to the committee.\n  We have to examine these conclusions in terms of the position for \nwhich Mr. Bolton is now being considered as the United States voice at \nthe United Nations.\n  In his approach to intelligence, Mr. Bolton clearly sought to stretch \nthe analysis to meet his world view rather than stretching his world \nview to accommodate other possibilities.\n  This is an extremely dangerous way to look at the world, as the 9/11 \nCommission and others have shown us.\n  Even more damaging, Mr. Bolton apparently used his position to \nattempt to intimidate subordinates and even to have analysts fired who \ndared to disagree, on such critical issues as the alleged development \nof weapons of mass destruction in Cuba and elsewhere.\n  Crying wolf about weapons of mass destruction is an extremely \ndangerous habit. The United States will be living with the consequences \nof poor intelligence and unfounded allegations regarding Iraqi weapons \nof mass destruction for years to come.\n  The United Nations was at the center of the WMD debate over Iraq and \nit will be at the center as we seek to address North Korea and Iran as \nwell.\n  We cannot afford to be wrong about weapons of mass destruction again, \nand we cannot afford to have at the helm a man who has deliberately \nexaggerated intelligence regarding these devastating weapons.\n  There is also the question of pressuring colleagues and subordinates, \neven attempting to get people fired.\n  In response to Mr. Bolton's tactics as Undersecretary for Arms \nControl and International Security, Secretary of State Colin Powell \nreportedly came down to ask the analysts to continue to ``speak truth \nto power.'' I applaud Secretary Powell for this step, but he should \nhave never had to take it.\n  The Senate Intelligence Committee briefly addressed this issue of \npressuring and seeking to remove analysts last year. However, we \naddressed this question only superficially, as I pointed out then in \nthe committee's additional views on ``The U.S. Intelligence Community's \nPrewar Intelligence Assessments on Iraq.''\n  Even worse, our committee fell into the same trap of discouraging \ndissent. As I wrote then, ``the conclusion section in the [committee] \nreport rebukes the analyst for the temerity of raising a policy \nquestion with a State Department Undersecretary.''\n  That analyst did the right thing. Policy questions should be raised. \nIn fact, they should be welcomed.\n  If more questions had been asked, we might not have had a \ndistinguished Secretary of State testifying at the U.N. with apparent \ncertainty about weapons in Iraq that did not, in fact, exist.\n  The recent Silberman-Robb report from ``The Commission on the \nIntelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of \nMass Destruction'' concluded that ``the Intelligence Community was dead \nwrong in almost all of its prewar judgments about Iraq's weapons of \nmass destruction.''\n  One of the key recommendations of the commission was to ``preserve \ndiversity of analysis'' and to encourage debate among analysts.\n  These are the very impulses that Mr. Bolton apparently tried to \nstifle. These are the very impulses that we need most.\n  Mr. Bolton has been nominated to be our representative to the United \nNations. In that seat, he will effectively become our representative to \nthe world.\n  It is not a position that he has highly valued in the past. He \nfamously remarked that ``The secretariat building\n\n[[Page S5994]]\n\nin New York has 38 stories. If you lost ten stories today it wouldn't \nmake a bit of difference.''\n  Mr. Bolton has since explained that he was merely using a metaphor. I \nthink most of us realized that. The point is that the metaphor that he \nchose indicates his low regard for the institution.\n  Mr. Bolton has stated that ``there is no such thing as the United \nNations,'' he has flatly rejected the idea at least once that the U.S. \nshould pay its U.N. dues, and he has expressed his desire to see the \nSecurity Council reduced to one member, namely the United States.\n  Mr. Bolton is correct when he argues that the United Nations cannot \nbe effective unless the United States plays a leading role. The League \nof Nations showed us that. Where he is mistaken is his fundamental \nconfusion of leadership with domination.\n  A security council of one would leave us with no allies, no friends, \nand no supporters.\n  As we have seen with tragic clarity in Iraq, we are stronger when we \nhave allies, and we are more effective multilaterally than \nunilaterally.\n  In its domestic policies, the Bush Administration has posited an \nownership philosophy that implicitly tells us, ``We are all alone in \nthis.'' Mr. Bolton represents the international wing of that school of \nthought.\n  We see this very clearly with the issue of peacekeeping. This nominee \nhas stated that he opposes the use of peacekeepers in civil conflicts \nbecause he does not regard civil conflicts as ``threats to \ninternational security.''\n  Mr. Bolton testified against United Nations involvement in the Congo, \nwhere at least 3 million people have died, and he opposed the U.N. \ncivil administration missions in East Timor and Kosovo.\n  Humanitarian issues aside, civil conflicts have a tendency to spill \nover borders, just as the conflicts in Sudan, Rwanda, Uganda, and the \nDemocratic Republic of Congo have all become intertwined.\n  Moreover, civil conflicts can lead to failed states and failed states \nare very much a threat to national security.\n  We cannot have a representative to the U.N. who opposes one of its \nmost basic and important functions.\n  Mr. Bolton has also dismissed the role of international law. In the \nlate 1990s, he stated:\n\n       It is a big mistake for us to grant any validity to \n     international law even when it may seem in our short-term \n     interest to do so--because, over the long term, the goal of \n     those who think that international law really means anything \n     are those who want to constrict the United States.\n\n  I believe that international law means something.\n  I believe that international law is very much in our national \ninterest, and I believe that this perspective from our potential \nambassador to the United Nations is as damaging as a White House legal \ncounsel or Attorney General who dismisses the Geneva Convention as \nquaint and obsolete.\n  Most disturbing of all, Mr. Bolton has criticized any `` `right of \nhumanitarian intervention' to justify military operations to prevent \nethnic cleansing or potential genocide.''\n  That tells us Mr. Bolton has learned nothing from the bloodstained \nlessons of history, including the unforgivable failures of both the \nUnited States and the U.N. in Rwanda in 1994.\n  President Bush has rightly called the crimes in Sudan genocide. \nSecretary Rice recently echoed that judgment. The Administration has \nsaid that it has been blocked by other members of the Security Council \nin its attempts to do more to stop the killing in Darfur.\n  Is the United States going to appoint as our ambassador a man who not \nonly belittles the U.N. but denies that it can or should intervene to \nprevent genocide? What possible message does that send on Darfur?\n  Another absolutely central United Nations function is the fight \nagainst the proliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass \ndestruction. Mr. Bolton has undermined nonproliferation efforts, not \nstrengthened them.\n  Recently, 102 former ambassadors and high ranking diplomats wrote \nSenator Lugar to express their deep concern over the Bolton nomination. \nThey declared ``John Bolton has an exceptional record of opposition to \nefforts to enhance U.S. security through arms control.''\n  We are witnessing the results of the Bolton approach right now at the \nNon-Proliferation Treaty conference in New York. By all reports this \nconference is making little progress toward creating a stronger, safer \nnon-proliferation regime.\n  A former senior Bush administration official told reporters, \n``Everyone knew the conference was coming and that it would be \ncontentious. But Bolton stopped all diplomacy on it six months ago.''\n  We cannot have our representative at the U.N. stopping diplomacy. He \nshould be shaping it.\n  Finally, there is the question of judgment, a key quality in a \ndiplomat.\n  Mr. Bolton was effectively banished from negotiations with North \nKorea after he launched into public attacks on their government and its \nleader on the eve of discussions. The State Department was forced to \ncall Mr. Bolton back and send a replacement to the talks.\n  I cite this example not because North Korea does not merit criticism: \nBy virtually any measure, it is one of the worst governments in the \nworld.\n  But during Mr. Bolton's tenure, North Korea's nuclear weapons program \nhas expanded, negotiations have deteriorated, and the situation has \ngrown substantially more dangerous.\n  Ultimately, we return to Mr. Bolton's vision of the world and of the \nrole of the U.N.\n  Let me conclude by turning to Samantha Power, one of our nation's \nforemost scholars of genocide and an astute observer of international \nrelations.\n  Dr. Power has written:\n\n       It is unclear what the Bush Administration has in mind by \n     shipping Bolton to New York. The appointment has been spun as \n     ``Nixon goes to China.'' Nixon, however, actually went to \n     China: the visit was compatible with his world view. Bolton, \n     by contrast, seems averse to compromise, and is apparently \n     committed to the belief that the U.N. and international law \n     undermine U.S. interests.\n\n  The United Nations is in need of reform. The same could be said of \nmany of our own government institutions, as we are attempting to do \nwith the intelligence community, for example.\n  The United States should be a positive influence in transforming the \nU.N. to meet the needs of the 21st century. But John Bolton is not the \nperson for the job.\n  I cannot help but contrast John Bolton to John Danforth, a true \nstatesman, a true soldier in the campaign to end the killing in Sudan, \nand a gracious and skilled United States representative to the United \nNations.\n  John Danforth was unanimously approved for that position. Mr. Bolton \nis mired in a controversy of his own making over his suspect \nqualifications.\n  I cannot vote for a representative to the United Nations who demeans \nthe institution, who works against non-proliferation, who abuses the \nintelligence process and its analysts, who dangerously inflates \nassessments of weapons of mass destruction, who rejects the value of \npeacekeepers and their role in civil conflicts, and who undervalues the \nprinciple of international law itself.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, let me say at the outset, that I do not \nintend to vote for cloture on John Bolton, nor do I intend to support \nhim for the position of United States Ambassador to the United Nations.\n  As I have said repeatedly since he was nominated, this is the wrong \nman for the job not because of his abrasive personality, although I am \ndeeply troubled by his serial mistreatment of co-workers and \nsubordinates.\n  My objections to this nominee go much deeper than his inability to \nwork well with others. I am opposed to this nominee because of his poor \nperformance, his flawed views, and his repeated misstatements and \nmischaracterizations of his record.\n  Let me commend Senator Biden and the Democratic staff on the Foreign \nRelations Committee and Senator Rockefeller and his Intelligence \nCommittee staff. As a result of their leadership and diligence, the \nSenate and the American people have a much more complete understanding \nof John Bolton and his entire troubling record.\n  And there is no doubt that we have learned a lot about Mr. Bolton. We \nhave learned about his failures in the proliferation area, his repeated \nefforts\n\n[[Page S5995]]\n\nto manipulate intelligence, his numerous misstatements of fact, and his \nserial mistreatment of career civil servants.\n  But, in spite of the best efforts of Senator Biden and the other \nDemocratic members of the Foreign Relations Committee, the record on \nthis nominee is still incomplete.\n  Despite numerous requests, the administration has failed to turn over \nimportant information about this nominee. This is astounding to me. The \nadministration's stonewalling has not only had the effect of slowing \ndown the confirmation process, it has also put a further cloud over \nthis individual and has--perhaps unnecessarily--raised the impression \nthat the nominee and the White House have something to hide. The end \nresult is further questions about this nominee, further disruption to \nthe Senate's consideration of this nominee, and further demonstration \nof the administration's willingness to keep information from the \nCongress and the American people.\n  This is information that the Senate is entitled to under the advise \nand consent clause of the Constitution, information that is central to \nthis man's qualifications, information that, had it been provided, \ncould have possibly spared this man further questions about his already \ndamaged reputation.\n  But as has so often been the case with this administration, they have \nsought to ignore the public's right to know and prevent Congress from \nmaking a fully informed decision. They want to be the judge and the \njury. They have decided the information is not relevant to our \nconsideration of Mr. Bolton.\n  Let me see if I understand their argument. The administration asserts \nthat information that bears directly on Mr. Bolton's role in assessing \nthe threat posed by Syria and in his seeking intercepted conversations \nof foreigners and U.S. citizens is not relevant to his qualifications \nto represent this Nation at the United Nations, and therefore should \nnot be provided to the Senate.\n  After all the damage caused when this administration stretched the \ntruth at the United Nations as it made the case for war in Iraq, does \nthe White House really believe it is not relevant for us to be \nabsolutely certain their nominee was not trying to stretch the \nintelligence yet again?\n  So we are in this largely avoidable position of having to vote \nagainst cloture and extending debate until the information is turned \nover to the Foreign Relations and Intelligence Committees. I hope the \nadministration will do the right thing and provide the information to \nthe Senate.\n  In the meantime, the information the Foreign Relations Committee has \nmanaged to obtain is deeply troubling. This is a record which caused \none of the most respected and storied committees in the entire Congress \nto not recommend him favorably to the full Senate. Based on that fact \nalone, the President should have withdrawn the nomination. \nUnfortunately, since he didn't, I think the Senate should follow the \ncommittee's lead and not recommend him for this job either.\n  I know Mr. Bolton has tried to distance himself from certain parts of \nhis record, like his past statements about the United Nations and its \nrole in international affairs. However, there can be no denying that \nthe man harbors a deep animosity towards the institution. At a time \nwhen we need diplomacy more than ever, and we need help in Iraq and in \nthe global war on terrorism, this is exactly the wrong man to send to \nthe U.N., and it sends exactly the wrong message to our friends and \nallies.\n\n  Mr. Bolton's supporters have advanced only one reason to ignore the \nweight of all the evidence that he is unqualified: Mr. Bolton believes \nthe United Nations needs to be reformed. The U.N. does need to be \nreformed. The U.N. can improve its performance. It can reduce \ninefficiency in its bloated bureaucracy. It can become more effective \nand more relevant. And we ought to have a U.N. ambassador who is \nwilling to take on that mission of reform. But the President should be \nable to find someone capable of reforming the U.N. without Mr. Bolton's \nbaggage.\n  So let's be clear, I do not oppose sending someone to the United \nNations who is willing to engage in some tough-minded reform. I do \noppose sending someone who has misused intelligence and bullied \nintelligence analysts in a way that undermined our diplomatic corps and \nproduced wrong-headed national security policies.\n  The facts show that Mr. Bolton repeatedly sought the removal of \nintelligence analysts who disagreed with him. In speeches and \ntestimony, Mr. Bolton repeatedly sought to stretch intelligence to fit \nhis views. In dealing with other professionals, Mr. Bolton repeatedly \nexhibited abusive behavior and intolerance that had a chilling effect \non analysts' ability to provide different views.\n  The second highest ranking official at the State Department, \nSecretary Powell's Deputy Rich Armitage, was so concerned about Bolton \nspeeches that he decreed that he must personally review and clear all \nof Mr. Bolton's public statements. And Robert Hutchings, chairman of \nthe National Intelligence Council, said that Bolton took ``isolated \nfacts and made much more of them to build a case than I thought the \nintelligence warranted.'' He said the impact of Bolton's actions on the \nintelligence community, ``creates a climate of intimidation and a \nculture of conformity that is damaging.''\n  But this is not merely a concern for historians. At the same time \nthat Mr. Bolton was agitating and undermining intelligence \nprofessionals on issues such as Cuba and Syria's WMD programs, the \nadministration was putting together a dramatically hyped case for war \nin Iraq to deal with a threat from weapons of mass destruction that \nturned out not to exist. Mr. Bolton's modus operandi of hyping \nintelligence and berating analysts has been so discredited by the \nresults of the Iraq WMD fiasco that it will be difficult for him to \noperate in the future. Imagine Mr. Bolton arguing to the United Nations \nSecurity Council about the threat posed by Iran or North Korea's \nnuclear weapons programs. Why would anyone take him or the \nadministration that sent him seriously?\n  I support the President's message of reform of the U.N. I am open to \nsomeone who can speak bluntly on these issues, who can deliver tough \nmessages.\n  But we need a different messenger than Mr. Bolton.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I voice my support for John Bolton to \nbe U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. Undersecretary Bolton will \nbring to the table exactly what the U.N. needs now more than ever: a \nsure hand to guide much-needed reform.\n  The United Nations holds much promise today. But too often, it falls \nfar short in its attempts to defend freedom, security, and human \ndignity. Undersecretary Bolton wants the U.N. to succeed, and believes \nit can be a great force for good.\n  Over the past 3 months we have all heard many scurrilous, slanderous \npersonal attacks made against Undersecretary Bolton. However, as is \noften the case in Washington, the outrage is largely much ado over very \nlittle.\n  I believe that the opposition to him really stems from concern that \nhe has so effectively implemented the President's foreign policy. \nOpponents do not want to take on the President, so they try to bully \nJohn Bolton.\n  The problem is, the U.N. is rife with corruption, scandal, and \nincompetence. Take the Oil-for-Food Program. What started as a \nhumanitarian attempt to help Saddam Hussein's suffering victims \ndegenerated into a jackpot for the tyrant's friends.\n  Evidence now shows that Saddam Hussein illegally profited from the \nprogram, and used the funds to build weapons for use against American \ntroops. Millions of dollars in oil-soaked bribes may have gone to high-\nranking officials in France, Russia, and within the U.N. itself. And \nmost sickening of all, there is now evidence that Oil-for-Food money \nmay be funding the insurgents that attack our soldiers in Iraq.\n  I commend my good friend Senator Norm Coleman from Minnesota for \nleading the committee that has uncovered these abuses. He is proving \nhow much work lies ahead for Undersecretary Bolton when he arrives at \nthe U.N.\n  As Undersecretary of State, John Bolton took the lead to realize the \nPresident's Proliferation Security Initiative, which strives to halt \nthe spread of dangerous weapons. Thanks to his leadership, the once-\ndangerous regime in Libya has begun to be tamed,\n\n[[Page S5996]]\n\nas Libya has consented to the Initiative and begun the verifiable \nelimination of its weapons of mass destruction.\n  Undersecretary Bolton also led negotiations for the creation of the \nG-8 Global Partnership Against the Proliferation of WMD. Thanks to his \ndiplomatic work, other nations contributed $10 billion towards those \nefforts. And he led negotiations for the Treaty of Moscow, which \nreduced by two-thirds the number of operationally deployed strategic \nnuclear warheads.\n  As Undersecretary, Mr. Bolton secured 100 bilateral agreements \nensuring that other countries will never drag American troops before \nthe International Criminal Court on trumped-up, political charges and \ndeprive them of American justice. It is remarkable that he has \nnegotiated so many of these pacts--known as Article 98 agreements, for \na section of the ICC treaty--in just 4 short years.\n  Undersecretary Bolton was a leader of American efforts to persuade \nthe Security Council to pass Resolution 1540, which imposes standards \nfor arms control, disarmament, and WMD proliferation prevention on \nevery Member State.\n  So far, over 80 countries have outlined their plans to stop WMD \nproliferation. This is a tremendous step forward in the War on Terror, \nand much of the credit goes to Mr. Bolton. Thanks to his careful, \npatient work of diplomacy, Resolution 1540 not only passed the U.N. \nSecurity Council, it passed unanimously.\n  Let me close, Mr. President, with a reminder for my colleagues of how \ncommitted Undersecretary Bolton is to working with and reforming the \nU.N. to make it the sentinel of liberty that it can, and should, be. I \nwill read two statements. One was made by Undersecretary Bolton, the \nother by the revered Democrat and New Dealer Dean Acheson, Secretary of \nState to President Harry S Truman. Let's see if you can guess who said \nwhat.\n  Here's the first one:\n\n       The United States is committed to the success of the United \n     Nations, and we view the U.N. as an important component of \n     our diplomacy . . . Walking away from the United Nations is \n     not an option.\n\n  Now here's the second statement:\n\n       I never thought the U.N. as worth a damn. To a lot of \n     people it was a Holy Grail, and those who set store by it had \n     the misfortune to believe their own bunk.\n\n  One of these statements was made by the nominee, a man caricatured by \nhis detractors as dead-set against the U.N. and the need for America to \nwork with multilateral institutions. The other was made by the \nmultilateralist who helped create the World Bank and the North Atlantic \nTreaty Organization.\n  Well, surprise, surprise. The first statement was made by \nUndersecretary Bolton, and the second by Secretary Acheson. This just \ngoes to show, Mr. President, that much of the criticism about Mr. \nBolton is useless when it comes to determining his commitment to the \nU.N., and his fitness to be the Ambassador.\n  I urge my fellow Senators to focus on the dire need for U.N. reform, \nand Undersecretary Bolton's record as a diplomat who can get results. \nIn times like these the U.N. needs a little straight talk. And \nUndersecretary Bolton can give it to them.\n  He has a remarkable record of bringing about change through \nmultinational institutions. I say, let him work his magic at the U.N. \nThe U.N. can do better than what it is giving us, it must do better. \nJohn Bolton is the right man at the right time for this critical \nassignment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in 15 minutes or so, we will vote on the \nnomination of Under Secretary of State John Bolton to be ambassador to \nthe United Nations.\n  I applaud President Bush for his selection. The President describes \nthe Under Secretary as ``a blunt guy'' who ``can get the job done'' and \n``isn't afraid to speak his mind''--not even to the President himself.\n  We need a smart, principled, and straightforward representative to \narticulate the President's policies on the world's stage.\n  We need a person with Under Secretary Bolton's proven track record of \ndetermination and success to cut through the thick and tangled \nbureaucracy that has mired the U.N. in scandal and inefficiency.\n  A vote for John Bolton is a vote for U.N. reform. A vote for John \nBolton is a vote for progress on the international challenges of our \nday. A vote for John Bolton is a vote for the United States.\n  It is no accident that polling shows most Americans have a poor view \nof the United Nations. In recent months, we have seen a deluge of \nnegative reports. We now know that Saddam Hussein stole an estimated \n$10 billion through the Oil-for-Food Program. The U.N. official who ran \nthe operation stands accused of taking kickbacks, along with many other \nofficials.\n  Just this week, the head of the Iraq Survey Group told the Council on \nForeign Relations that as a result of the oil-for-food corruption, \nSaddam came to believe he could divide the U.N. Security Council and \nbring an end to sanctions. I commend Senator Coleman for his determined \nefforts to get to the bottom of this global scandal.\n  We know the U.N. failed to stop the genocide in Rwanda in the 1990s. \nThe U.N. is on the brink of repeating that mistake in Darfur.\n  In the Congo, it is alleged that U.N. peacekeepers have committed \nsexual abuse against the innocent female civil war victims they were \nsent to protect.\n  Meanwhile, the U.N.'s Human Rights Commission, which is charged with \nprotecting our human rights, includes such human rights abusers as \nLibya, Cuba, Zimbabwe, and Sudan.\n  These failures are very real and very discouraging. They can be \nmeasured in lives lost and billions of dollars stolen. And they can be \nmeasured in the sinking regard for an organization that should be held \nin high esteem.\n  America sends the U.N. $2 billion per year. Our contribution makes up \n22 percent of that budget. We provide an even larger percentage for \npeacekeeping and other U.N. activities.\n  It is no surprise that Americans are calling out for reform. John \nBolton is the President's choice to lead that effort. He possesses deep \nand extensive knowledge of the U.N. and has, for many years, been \ncommitted to its reform.\n  Back in 1991, Under Secretary Bolton successfully lobbied to repeal \nthe U.N.'s shameful resolution 3379, which equated Zionism with racism. \nMany in the diplomatic community told him it could not be done. But \nafter waging an aggressive campaign, he moved the U.N. General Assembly \nto repeal the resolution by a vote of 111 to 25.\n  As Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International \nSecurity, John Bolton helped build a coalition of 60 countries to \ncombat the spread of weapons of mass destruction through the \nPresident's Proliferation Security Initiative.\n  He was pivotal in our successful efforts to persuade Libya to give up \nits pursuit of weapons of mass destruction.\n  He was also the chief negotiator of the Treaty of Moscow, which calls \nupon the U.S. and Russia to reduce their nuclear warheads by nearly \ntwo-thirds.\n  Under Secretary Bolton has the confidence of the President and the \nSecretary of State, and it is to them he will report directly.\n  He has been confirmed by this body four times, and I believe if we \nare given the chance, he will be confirmed for a fifth time today.\n  The vetting of his current nomination has been exhaustive. The \nForeign Relations Committee interviewed 29 witnesses and reviewed more \nthan 830 pages of documents from the State Department, from USAID, and \nthe CIA. Under Secretary Bolton fielded nearly 100 questions for the \nrecord and underwent multiple hearings.\n  As Senator Lugar has pointed out, Under Secretary Bolton has served 4 \nyears in a key position that technically outranks the post for which he \nis now being considered.\n  This is a critical time for the United States and for the world. \nBecause of the President's vision and commitment, democracy is on the \nmarch around the globe.\n  In January, Iraq held its first truly free elections. Revolution has \nswept the Ukraine, Georgia, and Lebanon. We\n\n[[Page S5997]]\n\nare seeing political reforms in Egypt. Kuwait now allows a woman the \nright to vote. Saudi Arabia is slowly opening the door to democracy. \nThe Middle East peace process is at its most hopeful moment ever.\n  The U.N. can and should be vital in advancing these developments. The \nU.N. charter states that the purpose of that organization is ``to \npromote social progress and better standards of life in larger \nfreedom.''\n  I believe in the U.N.'s potential, if it is reformed and more rightly \nfocused. It has been an important instrument of peace and dialog. I \nbelieve, as does the President, that an effective U.N. is in America's \ninterest.\n  Ambassador Rudy Boschwitz, who has just returned from the 61st \nsession of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights, puts it well when he \nsays that:\n\n       Not only the United States, but the United Nations itself, \n     needs and will profit from a no-nonsense representative like \n     Mr. Bolton.\n\n  U.N. Secretary Kofi Annan, too, supports the Under Secretary's \nselection.\n  I thank my colleague Senator Lugar for his strong leadership. And I \nalso thank my colleagues Senators Allen, Coleman, Sununu, and Alexander \nfor their clear-eyed and unwavering support for this capable and fine \nnominee.\n  I will close with a story about John Bolton. When he was an intern in \nthe Nixon White House, John Ehrlichman had gathered the interns \ntogether to tell them they had to work for Nixon's reelection. A young \nJohn Bolton piped up, ``Work for him? I don't even know if I'm going to \nvote for him.''\n  He has always been a straight-shooter and a man of integrity--exactly \nwhat we need at the United Nations, and exactly what the United Nations \nneeds from us.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Under the previous order, the clerk will report the motion to invoke \ncloture.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on Executive \n     Calendar No. 103:\n         William Frist, Richard Lugar, Richard Burr, Pat Roberts, \n           Mitch McConnell, Jeff Sessions, Wayne Allard, Jon Kyl, \n           Jim DeMint, David Vitter, Richard Shelby, Lindsey \n           Graham, John Ensign, Pete Domenici, Robert Bennett, Mel \n           Martinez, George Allen.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on \nExecutive Calendar No. 103, the nomination of John Robert Bolton to be \nthe Representative of the United States of America to the United \nNations, shall be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senators were necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Specter).\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye), is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We will be closing shortly this evening, but before we close, I \nwill file cloture motions on the Brown nomination and the Pryor \nnomination. Our next vote will be Tuesday, June 7, and that vote will \noccur prior to the policy luncheons, probably at noon on June 7.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, while we have Senators in the Chamber, I \nwish to express, through the Chair, the appreciation of especially \nSenator Biden and Senator Dodd for the ends to which the majority \nleader went to try to resolve this issue. He spent an inordinate amount \nof time trying to get the information requested and was unable to do \nso. He did get information but not all that was necessary. I am \ndisappointed that tonight we were unable to have a vote on Mr. Bolton, \nbut it is not the fault of the Democratic caucus. We are not here to \nfilibuster Mr. Bolton's nomination. We are here to get information \nregarding Mr. Bolton, information to which we are entitled. The people \nwho voted against cloture--there were many--many of them will vote \nagainst Mr. Bolton if, in fact, he gets before the Senate. But most of \nthe people here tonight are concerned about this being an issue dealing \nwith the administration not giving us the information we want. That is \nall. It hurts their nominees. The administration has to be more \nforthcoming.\n  I hope that during the next 8 or 9 days the administration will take \na fresh look at this and give the information to Senator Dodd and \nSenator Biden--most of what they want. They are the only ones who will \nsee it. It will not be given to the entire Senate. They are not asking \nfor information that may affect our country's national interest.\n  I hope we can go forward with the people's business. The \ndistinguished majority leader told me yesterday that he was going to \nfile cloture on these two judges. This is fine. We will work out a \ntimely manner to complete the work on these judges and other judges. \nThe Energy bill was reported out of committee today. The asbestos bill \nwas reported out of committee today. There is a lot we have to do here, \nand we do not want this to be a divergence--the work we have to do is a \ndivergence, but it is not the fault of the Democratic Senators that it \nis a diversion.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield to the ranking member of the \nForeign Relations Committee.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I wish to make it clear to all my \ncolleagues, speaking for myself, that I have absolutely no intention to \nprevent an up-or-down vote on Mr. Bolton. The issue here is about \nwhether the executive branch will provide information which the \nmajority leader tried yesterday and today to get, and which I think \nalmost every Senator here would acknowledge the institution is entitled \nto get. We are prepared to not even ask that the ranking member and the \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee see the information we have \nsought. I implore the administration to provide the information, and--\nspeaking for myself, and I can speak for no one else, but I\n\n[[Page S5998]]\n\nbelieve my colleagues on my side would agree with me--we are willing to \nvote 10 minutes after we come back into session if, in fact, they \nprovide the information--information to which Mr. Bolton's staff had \naccess but which they will not give to the majority leader of the \nSenate. There is no reason offered.\n  I want to make it clear, we are ready to vote the day we get back, \nthe moment we get back. We are ready to vote immediately if they would \ncome forward, meeting us halfway on providing the information. That is \nall.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, needless to say, I am very disappointed \nwith where we sit today. We have had an interesting week, a very \nchallenging week, starting the week on one clear direction and then \nsidetracked a little bit to what I thought was not an unreasonable \nfeeling in this body that we were going to be working together and that \nwe were going to address the important issues to America.\n  John Bolton, the very first issue to which we turned, we got what to \nme looks like a filibuster. It certainly sounds like a filibuster, \nlooking at the vote today, it quacks like a filibuster, and I am \nafraid, shortly after we thought we had things working together in this \nbody again, we have another filibuster, this time on another \nnomination--not a judicial nomination but another nomination--the \nnomination of John Bolton.\n  It does disappoint me. We had an opportunity to finish and complete \nthis week with a very good spirit. We are going to come back to this \nissue. As has been said by Senator Biden, as I have said, we are going \nto revisit it, but I think what America has just seen is an engagement \nof another period of obstruction by the other side of the aisle, and it \nlooks like we have, once again, another filibuster.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, everyone here should understand that it is \nnow the 26th day of May. This is the first filibuster that has been \nconducted in this Congress, if, in fact, we want to call this a \nfilibuster--No. 1, first one. We have not been doing filibusters. We \nworked through some very difficult issues we talked about here before--\nbankruptcy, class action, and a number of other issues.\n  So it is not as if we are looking for things to have extended debate \non. We need to work together, and I think this week has established \nthat. We are going to work together. But how can we work together when \ninformation is not supplied?\n  So I hope we will all slow down the rhetoric during the break. This \nis something that happened. This is part of the Senate. I repeat, keep \nin mind, this is the first filibuster of the year and maybe the last. I \nhope so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes and that Senator Sununu speak \nafter me for up to 10 minutes as well to discuss bipartisan legislation \nthe two of us have introduced today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Wyden and Mr. Sununu pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 1128 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that after \nSenator Sununu's remarks, Senator Reed be recognized for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to be allowed to \nspeak for up to 15 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That order has already been entered.\n  Mr. REED. I also ask unanimous consent that upon the conclusion of my \nremarks, Senator Salazar of Colorado and then after that Senator Pryor \nof Arkansas be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/26/senate-section/article/S5998-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5998-S5999]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n RETIREMENT OF BRIGADIER GENERAL DANIEL J. KAUFMAN, UNITED STATES ARMY\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \naccomplishments of Brigadier General Daniel J. Kaufman, United States \nArmy, Dean of the Academic Board at the United States Military Academy \nat West Point. General Kaufman is retiring on the 6th of June, 2005 \nafter 37 years of active military service in war and peace. His \nmilitary career exemplifies the finest traditions of the United States \nArmy and demonstrates the rare combination of a combat-tested soldier \nand a first-rate scholar.\n  I have had the privilege of knowing Dan Kaufman since 1967 when I \nentered West Point and was assigned to Company C, Second Regiment, \nUnited States Corps of Cadets. Dan was a senior, or as we say at West \nPoint, a ``Firstie,'' shorthand for first classman. He distinguished \nhimself to me as a serious and conscientious Cadet with a wry sense of \nhumor. He ranked academically in the top 5 percent of his class. But, \nlike all of his classmates, Dan's attention was focused on Vietnam as \nmuch as academics.\n  Upon graduation in 1968, General Kaufman was commissioned as an \nsecond lieutenant in the Armored Cavalry and assigned to F Troop, 2d \nSquadron, 6th Armored Cavalry Regiment, Ft. Meade, MD as a platoon \nleader. After 6 months at Fort Meade, General Kaufman deployed to \nVietnam and served as platoon leader in L Troop, 3d Squadron, 11th \nArmored Cavalry Regiment. Later in the tour he served as the Troop's \nexecutive officer. For his service in Vietnam, General Kaufman was \nawarded the Bronze Star with V-device for Valor and two Purple Hearts.\n\n  Upon completion of his tour in Vietnam, General Kaufman served from \n1970-1971 as the Commander of E Troop, 2d Squadron, 6th Armored Cavalry \nRegiment, Ft. Meade, MD. General Kaufman left Fort Meade in 1971 to \nattend the Armor Officer Advanced Course at Fort Knox, KY. After a tour \nof duty as an instructor at the armor school, General Kaufman attended \nthe John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. Here, \nwe again renewed our friendship as we were both students at the Kennedy \nSchool of Government at Harvard. By that time, Dan had married his \nbeloved wife Kathryn and their daughter, Emily, was born in Mount \nAuburn Hospital in Cambridge, MA. General Kaufman then served as an \ninstructor and assistant professor in the Department of Social Sciences \nfrom 1974 to 1978. I joined Dan as an instructor in the Department of \nSocial Sciences for the academic year 1977-1978.\n  After departing West Point, General Kaufman served as Special \nAssistant to the Director, Planning Analysis, Office of the Deputy \nUnder Secretary of Defense (Policy) in Washington, DC prior to \nreporting into Ft. Bragg, North Carolina. Once at Fort Bragg, General \nKaufman assumed the duties of Assistant Chief of Staff, G-3, Force \nDevelopment, 82nd Airborne Division until 1979. From 1979 until 1981, \nGeneral Kaufman was the S-3 (Operations), 4th Battalion (Airborne), \n68th Armor, 82nd Airborne Division.\n\n  Following his assignment at Fort Bragg, General Kaufman completed the \nArmed Forces Staff College in route to Cambridge, MA to study for his \nPh.D. in political science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \nAfter earning his Ph.D., General Kaufman rejoined the faculty at West \nPoint as a permanent associate processor in the Department of Social \nSciences.\n  In 1990, he was appointed Professor and deputy head of the Department \nof Social Sciences. During this time, he served as chair for \nAccreditation Review Committee, Scholarship Committee, and Faculty \nDevelopment Committee. From 1991 through 1995, General Kaufman served \nas a key member of several Department of the Army committees, including \nChief of Staff of the Army transition teams for both General Sullivan \nand General Dennis J. Reimer, President-Elect Clinton's DOD Transition \nTeam, as well as a special assistant to the Chief of Staff, U.S. Army \n(1991-1992).\n  In 1996, General Kaufman was appointed Professor and Head of the \nDepartment of Social Sciences. There he continued the proud tradition \nof soldiers and scholars, first begun by GEN ``Abe'' Lincoln right \nafter World War II, carried on by GEN Don Olvey, by GEN Amos Jordan, \nand General Golden, and now GEN Dan Kaufman.\n\n[[Page S5999]]\n\n  In June 2000, General Kaufman was selected as the eleventh dean of \nthe academic board. As dean of the Academic board, General Kaufman \nenvisioned an academic program relevant to the needs of the Army that \ncontributes to the intellectual and professional development of cadets, \nsupported by 700 first-class staff and faculty, $500 million in \nfacilities, and a budget of $62.7 million. His visionary leadership led \nto the publication of Educating Future Army Officers for a Changing \nWorld, the operational concept for the Academic Program that links \ncadet education directly to the Cadet Leader Development System and the \nArmy.\n  General Kaufman oversaw several significant revisions to the academic \ncurriculum to better prepare graduates for the challenges of a \ntransforming Army in the post-Cold War world. The new curriculum places \ngreater emphasis on global and cultural awareness, information \ntechnology, and curricular integration; it also offers cadets more \nchoice in the selection of academic majors. He encouraged continued \ndevelopment of the academic assessment system, placing increased \nemphasis on performance assessments of the academic program goals. The \nextraordinarily positive assessment results from graduates and \ncommanders in the field attest to the success of General Kaufman's \nvision. Under his stewardship, the Military Academy continued to lead \nthe Nation and the Army in the use of information technology for \neducation. He oversaw the installation of a secure wireless \ninfrastructure in all academic buildings and encouraged the use of web-\nbased course management tools.\n  Perhaps the crowning achievement of his tenure was the design of \nThomas Jefferson Hall, the Military Academy's new library/learning \ncenter. General Kaufman led the effort to secure Army support and \nCongressional funding for the facility and oversaw all features of the \ndesign. In support of the Global War on Terrorism, General Kaufman \nexpanded outreach and support activities to the Army, including faculty \nsupport to combat operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. He personally led \na team of senior faculty members to help reopen Baghdad University \nafter decades of repression and isolation. During General Kaufman's \ntenure, USMA cadets won 43 international scholarships; the Military \nAcademy was named an Institution of Excellence, and the Center for \nAdvancement of Leader Development and Organizational Learning was \nestablished to provide professional forums for company-grade officers \nthroughout the Army.\n  BG Kaufman's awards include the Distinguished Service Medal, Legion \nof Merit, Bronze Star Medal for Valor, Purple Heart, 2 awards, \nMeritorious Service Medal, 2 awards, Army Commendation Medal, 2 awards, \nVietnam Service Medal, 4 campaigns and other service awards.\n  The Academic Program at the United States Military Academy has never \nbeen stronger and more connected to the Army. General Kaufman has set \nthe course for officer education into the first half of the 21st \ncentury. His dedication to excellence and his unsurpassed devotion to \nduty, honor, and country have marked his distinguished service over the \npast 37 years. For the past 5 years, he has profoundly shaped the \nintellectual future of the officer corps. And he has not done this \nalone. By his side at every step in his career has been his wife \nKathryn. They have a wonderful family, including their daughter, Emily, \nand their son, David. Emily is a proud wife of Steve Thomas. They have \nbrought to the Kaufman family the youngest Kaufman, baby Emma. Dan is a \ngreat soldier, a brave scholar, a devoted husband and father, and a \nsteadfast friend.\n\n  Dan has used his intellect and wit and devotion to the Army and the \ncountry to nurture a generation of cadets who will emerge as the \nleaders of our Army and our Nation. Because of Dan they will be ready \nfor the daunting challenges that lie ahead. His legacy will be felt in \n1,000 places around the world for decades to come.\n  Whenever a leader of our Army uses his intellectual and ethical power \nof his or her education at West Point to defend the Nation, protect our \nsoldiers, and advance our ideals, his legacy will be felt in a thousand \nplaces. West Point has never had a more faithful son or a better dean. \nAnd I have never had a better friend.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/26/senate-section/article/S5999-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5999-S6000]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             REMEMBERING OUR FALLEN HEROES ON MEMORIAL DAY\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, this Monday is Memorial Day. It is a \nday that is important to countless families across this nation, \nincluding my own. It is a time of remembrance for those heroes who have \nfallen serving our country and thanking those who were blessed to \nreturn home to their families and loved ones.\n  That we as a Nation take the time to thank our veterans is important. \nIt is a simple, gracious act that we all too often fail to do.\n  Our cities and towns, across Colorado and this Nation, have given up \ntheir young men and women without protest, men and women humbly \naccepting a calling greater than themselves.\n  In many ways, this is what makes our nation so great. We are a nation \nof individuals that can put ourselves aside for the common good. We can \ncome together and deliberate and differ, as we do here in the Senate. \nBut we are appreciative of the gift of freedom we all share, and the \nprice that our veterans and fallen heroes have paid on our behalf for \nour freedom.\n  Earlier this week, I was fortunate to work with a pair of bona fide \nwar heroes as we sought to preserve 200 years of Senate tradition. In \nmy 5 short months here, I have come to admire Senator John McCain and \nSenator Daniel Inouye, two men I am honored to call my friends. They \nserved bravely and with distinction, and have set an example for all of \nus to follow each day. I thank them for their sacrifice, their \nleadership and their continuing commitment to this Nation.\n  We owe them, and all of our veterans and members of the Armed \nServices, a debt which can never be truly repaid. In 1865 in his second \ninaugural address, President Lincoln elaborated on the respect we have \nfor those who served and the sacrifices made by the few for the many:\n\n       With malice toward none; with charity for all; with \n     firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let \n     us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the \n     nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the \n     battle, and for his widow, and his orphan--to do all which \n     may achieve and cherish a just, and a lasting peace, among \n     ourselves, and with all nations.\n\n  We are fortunate that they, and so many of our veterans, are still \nhere--husbands and wives, fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, \nbrothers, sisters and cousins. Too many of them, however, have been \ntaken from us all too soon.\n  One of those no longer with us is my father, Henry. My father served \nwith honor and distinction in World War II and always took great pride \nin his service. When he passed away in 2001 after a long battle with \nAlzheimer's, his final request to my brother John was that he be buried \nin his uniform.\n  We proudly honored this request, and afterwards I was struck by the \nimportance of it to him. My father had been many things--a thoughtful \nson, a loving husband, an attentive father. But most important to him \nwas his service to his Nation which he called home and which had given \nhim so much.\n  In 1962, GEN Douglas MacArthur gave the commencement address at West \nPoint. He reflected on his time in the Army and on the nature of the \nultimate action of any soldier--sacrificing his or her life for our \nNation. MacArthur said:\n\n       The soldier, above all other men, is required to practice \n     the greatest act of religious training--sacrifice. In battle \n     and in the face of danger and death, he discloses those \n     divine attributes which his Maker gave when He created man in \n     His own image. No physical courage and no brute instinct can \n     take the place of the Divine help which alone can sustain \n     him. However horrible the incidents of war may be, the \n     soldier who is called upon to offer and to give his life for \n     his country is the noblest development of mankind.\n\n  In many ways, it saddens us to know this fact. Each and every \nAmerican looks forward to the day when none are called upon to make \nsuch a sacrifice.\n  Over the past year, hundreds of Americans made that sacrifice for us \nwhile in service to our Nation, including 14 with Colorado roots: Shawn \nAtkins, of Parker; Dana Wilson, of Fountain; Douglas Bascom, of \nColorado\n\n[[Page S6000]]\n\nSprings; Theodore Holder, of Littleton; Michael Shackleford, of Grand \nJunction; Gregory Rund, of Littleton; George Geer, of Cortez; Lizbeth \nRobles, of Colorado Springs; Steven Bayow, of Colorado Springs; Derrick \nLutters, of Burlington; Travis Anderson, of Hooper, in my native San \nLuis Valley in southern Colorado; and Charles Wilkerson, of Colorado \nSprings; along with Paul Christopher Alaniz and Landon Giles, whose \nfamilies live in Colorado today.\n  Each of them served with honor and distinction and we are all forever \ngrateful for the sacrifice each of them made on behalf of all of us. \nTheir names will not be forgotten, and our prayers will remain with \ntheir loved ones.\n  One of our greatest Supreme Court Justices and a Civil War veteran, \nOliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., used to spend his Memorial Days just a few \nmiles from where we stand now, in Arlington National Cemetery. He would \nwalk among the gravesites, reflecting on the sacrifices of so many, \nincluding the countless, nameless souls who laid beneath.\n  Justice Holmes once observed:\n\n       At the grave of a hero we end, not with sorrow at the \n     inevitable loss, but with the contagion of his courage. . . .\n\n  Heroism is not in the deed itself, but in the courage to act. We have \nheroes because they chose to act, to step forward in the call to \naction. In this Senate, we are blessed with a history of service to our \nNation. Outside of this building, however, is where true heroes of our \nmilitary reside: men and women in uniform, our veterans who have stood \nwatch before them, and those who have laid down their lives so that we \ncan have freedom.\n  I encourage everyone over this weekend to take time out from the \nparades and barbecues and family gatherings to thank our veterans and \nservice members. They stand ready to defend the freedoms we take for \ngranted, without seeking thanks or praise. This heroic act deserves our \nthanks, for it is by grace that they keep us safe.\n  In the Book of Matthew we are taught: ``Blessed are the peacemakers: \nfor they shall be called the children of God.''\n  Through their service and sacrifice, they have earned that \ndistinction.\n  May God bless our service members and our veterans.\n  May the families of those who have given their lives for our freedom \nknow the depth of our appreciation. And may we never forget the \nimportance of their sacrifice to our work here in the U.S. Senate.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/26/senate-section/article/S6000-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6000-S6003]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         A HISTORIC COMPROMISE\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I rise today to discuss something that \nhappened this week in the Senate, something I was involved in, and \nsomething that received quite a bit of notice outside this Chamber, and \nthat is a compromise that was reached. I think it was a historic \ncompromise. I think it is a very good thing for the Nation. In fact, I \nwould say it was a win for Democrats, a win for the Republicans, and, \nmost importantly, it was a win for the American people.\n  Some in my party, some in the other party, may disagree with what I \njust said, but I think when you look back through American history--and \nyou can look at all the major legislative accomplishments that have \noccurred--most of those have occurred in this body.\n  This body is known for its ability to compromise. I look at these \nchairs and these desks in this body, and I can see the faces of my \ncolleagues and of those who have departed this Chamber. This is a body \nthat has a very special role in American history and in American \nGovernment.\n  I have heard some say they do not like compromise. In fact, I must \nsay I was disappointed--I was listening to talk radio yesterday, and \nsomeone said some of us Senators who compromised are in the middle, and \nno one supports the middle. I cannot disagree more. I think people all \nover this country are looking for Senators to show leadership, to find \ncommon ground. I think that is one result that has been sorely missing \nin the Congress. When you talk to people outside of the Beltway, that \nis one result they are hoping for, that we will find that common ground \nand we will have leadership in Washington that understands you do not \nhave to sacrifice your principles in order to find common ground.\n  In fact, in the very famous book written by John Kennedy, ``Profiles \nin Courage,'' he says:\n\n       We should not be too hasty in condemning all compromise as \n     bad morals. For politics and legislation are not matters for \n     inflexible principles or unattainable ideals.\n\n  This is politics. This is a human institution. This is Government. I \nfeel those 14 Senators who reached this agreement--13 of my great \ncolleagues who reached this agreement--took one of the most contentious \nissues in recent years off the table. Hopefully, they took it off for \nthe remainder of this Congress. I feel as though we took it off for the \nremainder of the Congress because I sat in those rooms, I talked to my \ncolleagues, and I know the high level of trust we have with one \nanother.\n  This entire agreement is based on trust. It is an example that \namazing things can happen when Senators talk to each other--just talk \nto each other. I feel that is why the people of Arkansas sent me to \nWashington, to try to be a bridge builder, to try to be a peacemaker, \nto try to find common ground on a wide variety of issues that are best \nfor Arkansas and best for the Nation and, in some cases, best for the \nworld.\n  Senators here in Washington, unfortunately, in the last few years \nhave gotten into the habit of talking about each other and not talking \nto each other. I hope one of the results that comes from this agreement \nis a new spirit of bipartisanship, a new commitment that we can reach \nacross party lines, reach across the aisle, to try to work together to \nsolve the challenges that are facing America.\n  There are many sensible voices in the Senate. Many, many, many--in \nfact, all--have reasonable minds. And one thing I found a little bit \nhumorous, some of the press coverage about this agreement was that they \nsaid these were moderates who reached this agreement. Let me tell you, \nsome were moderates, but many in this group were not moderates, and \nthey would be offended if we called them moderates. In fact, I heard a \nnumber of them say ``I don't ever want to be considered a moderate,'' \nfor one reason or another. But they demonstrated a spirit of \nbipartisanship that I think should be applauded.\n  Sometimes when you make a compromise, you are taking the easy way \nout. But this was a compromise that required courage. This compromise \nrequired a lot of courage on behalf of all my colleagues, especially--\nespecially, might I underline--the seven Republicans who entered into \nthis agreement. It was very hard for Democrats and Republicans to do. \nBut I will tell you, I know my seven Republican colleagues who did \nthis, who demonstrated their trust, not just of each of us but of this \ninstitution, demonstrated a lot of courage. I take my hat off to them \nin appreciation.\n  Two more points I would like to make on this issue.\n  First, I need to thank three people; that is, my wife Jill, my son \nAdam, and my daughter Porter. For all I know, they may be watching \nright now. It is getting pretty close to bedtime around our house. But \nthey made the sacrifice, too, so I could be part of this Senate and be \nup here away from home. But also, Dad was not home a lot in the last \nfew days because I was here trying to work through this agreement as \nbest I could and trying to get this done. So I thank them.\n  But in a broader sense, I did this agreement for them because I was \nvery concerned that when you looked at the nuclear option, if that \ntrigger was pulled, you had a nuclear winter that would follow. I was \nvery concerned that the Congress, particularly the Senate, would not \nget very much done this session.\n  I thought that would be a huge disservice to the American people. I \nthought it was time for reasonable minds to come together to try to \nwork something out. In fact, in the Book of Isaiah, it says: ``Come \nnow, let us reason together.'' And maybe that should be something we \nshould take to heart. The people of our States, every State in the \nUnion, only get to send two Senators to Washington.\n\n[[Page S6001]]\n\n  I think they expect us to exercise good judgment and exercise our \ndiscretion and also, from time to time, exercise courage to try to do \nthe right thing.\n  So I commend my 13 colleagues who entered into this agreement. They \ntook a lot of time and made a lot of sacrifice, and it took a lot of \ncourage. Many of them have taken a lot of criticism for doing this. I \nwant to say publicly that I thank them and I appreciate them and I am \nproud of them for what they did.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, before our friend from Arkansas leaves the \nfloor, let me also say, if his children are watching, they should be \nvery proud of their father. I have had the privilege of serving with \nthe Senator's father. In fact, we sat next to each other as I arrived \nhere as a freshman Senator. The Pryor and Dodd families go back for \nsome time.\n  I want you to know that what you and your 13 colleagues did last \nweek--and nobody can say for certain where this is going to lead, but \nyou have given this institution an opportunity to continue its \ntradition of providing the one place in Government where all voices can \nbe heard. That is not true in anyplace in the executive branch, \nnecessarily, or the judicial branch. And even in the legislative \nbranch, in the other body, the majority rules.\n  The Senate is the one place where all voices must be listened to. \nBecause of what you and our 13 other colleagues--6 other Democrats and \n7 Republicans--were willing to sit down and try to fashion, we have \nbeen given a chance to live up to the longstanding, historic traditions \nof this place in which we have been privileged to have been elected to \nserve. There have been 1,884 of us in 218 years who were chosen by our \nStates to represent their interests and the Nation in the Senate. I can \njust say to my friend from Arkansas, you will be involved in a lot of \nissues during what I hope is a long career for you here in the years \nahead. You will look back, and there will only be a handful of moments \nthat will stand out, and I am willing to predict that what you, \nSenators McCain, Nelson, Lieberman, Collins, Byrd, Warner, Graham, \nSnowe, DeWine, Landrieu, Salazar, Chafee, and Inouye have done will \nremain one of the important memories. You will look back and think of \nthe things you have been involved in and, hopefully, the list will be \nlong.\n  As one Senator who was not involved in the negotiations you went \nthrough but was watching them carefully--and again, we cannot say with \ncertainty where it is going to lead--I commend you and history will \ncommend you for what you are doing. I love the idea that you did it for \nyour family and your children. They will look back with pride on the \nservice of their father.\n  Mr. President, we went through a little bit of a turmoil here. \nObviously, coming in the wake of this negotiation, I suppose some \npeople's eyebrows may be raised, wondering how can we do that \ncompromise and then end up with an awkward situation on the Bolton \nnomination, which became contentious for a few minutes. I will add my \nvoice to that.\n  My fervent hope is that people will not misunderstand the intentions \nof 24 Senators, and others, when we raised the question going back to \nApril 11 about certain information. All of my colleagues are not \nfamiliar with all of the details of the case, although the Presiding \nOfficer was very much a part of the discussion we have had over the \nlast couple of months. Whether we are for or against the nomination, \nthe point I was trying to make is that an institution--the Senate--has \na right to certain information when it involves a pertinent matter \nbefore it.\n  It has been a historic struggle between the executive and legislative \nbranches. There is always that tension between these two branches of \nGovernment over access to information. Regardless of one's political \naffiliation, whether you are in the majority or the minority, no matter \nwhat administration is in the White House, my experience over 2\\1/2\\ \ndecades, serving under every imaginable configuration, is that it is \nalways healthy to insist on information that the institution thinks is \nimportant for its consideration of a matter--be it substantive or the \nexecutive branch calendar.\n  I want to say to my colleagues, those who have gone through this \nprocess of negotiations that avoided the constitutional crisis \nregarding extended debate, what happened here in the last few hours is \nnot in any way disruptive of what occurred during those negotiations. \nIt is my strong hope and desire that the information we seek will be \nforthcoming in the next few days, that the committees can analyze it \nall, and when we return to this body after the break, the matter of \nJohn Bolton can come before this body and we will have an up-or-down \nvote on the nomination, as it should be. It is my strong desire that \nthat be the outcome.\n  This was not intended, in any way, to engage in a filibuster but \nstrictly to determine whether this institution would say to the \nexecutive branch, respectfully: This is information we believe we need. \nWe are asking you to provide it in an orderly way to those Members who \nare entitled to this information--the chair of the Intelligence \nCommittee, the ranking Democrat, the chair of the Foreign Relations and \nranking Democrat--for them to determine whether there is relevancy to \nthis information as it pertains to this nomination.\n  Again, I thank the majority leader. It probably doesn't help his \ncause to hear this, but Bill Frist made a serious effort over the last \ncouple of days, not that he necessarily even supported the request, but \nhe certainly conveyed the request in a serious way to leaders within \nthe executive branch. I thank him for that. He didn't have to do that, \nand he did. I regret that the administration didn't reply in an orderly \nway, which could have avoided all of this in the last 48 hours. I hope \nthey will take this seriously. I say to my friends on the majority \nside, having been in your shoes in other administrations, it can \nhappen.\n\n  There is always this tension between these two branches of Government \nabout information. We need to be clear about it. We have a \nconstitutional responsibility, where appropriate, to seek information \nthat is important for our consideration.\n  So it is my fervent hope that we go away for a few days and \nrecognize, as so eloquently Senator Salazar said, speaking about his \nfather, a World War II veteran, insisting upon being buried in his \nuniform, that we recognize those who have given a lot more to provide \nthe freedoms we enjoy as Americans, that we are very much living up to \nwhat they fought and died for over this Memorial Day break as we \nrecognize their contributions. They fought and died for exactly what we \nare doing here.\n  This doesn't happen miraculously. A democracy is won by each and \nevery generation in this country. There is no guarantee that it exists \nin perpetuity. Each generation of Americans will confront, one way or \nanother, a challenge to our democratic values and principles. \nCertainly, the generation that fought and died for this country over \nthe years has proven that categorically.\n  We are going to be challenged as well from time to time. So I \nfervently hope--and Members who have served with me know I am the least \ncomfortable with getting involved in opposing a nominee. The only \ntrouble I have gotten into in nominations is when I have been for \nnominees to the disappointment of colleagues on this side. I was told I \nhad no business to be for John Ashcroft and John Tower. I am not \ncomfortable not being for somebody. I took the position I did, and I \nhope we can resolve this matter over the next few days and get back to \nthe business of voting up or down and move on to other business that is \nimportant to our constituents.\n  I was heartened to hear that Democrats and Republicans were able to \nwork out differences on an energy bill. That is going to be exciting to \ndeal with; it is an issue in which our constituents are interested. I \nwould be remiss in not recognizing the Presiding Officer in the \ntremendous work he has done, along with Senator Jeffords and Senator \nReid and Senator Baucus. There is a lot of work in front of you. Those \nare the issues we need to work together on here. So while there may be \nsome bruised feelings right away over a vote we just took, I hope we \ncan put those behind us and resolve the\n\n[[Page S6002]]\n\nmatter and get about doing the business the people sent us here to do.\n  To my colleagues, I wish them a healthy, happy, and safe Memorial \nDay, and I look forward to seeing them on our return here and moving \nforward with the business at hand.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator from Alaska is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am sorry that our colleague from \nArkansas has left the floor because I was sitting there listening to \nhis comments and his recognition and acknowledgements of the 14 \nSenators who worked on the compromise this past week and all the \nefforts they had made.\n  I commend him and all the others of that group and all those who \nencouraged us as a body, as Senators--not as Republicans, not as \nDemocrats but as Senators--to move forward so that we could get through \nwhat I certainly believe was a great impasse in this body, to work \nthrough the issues, to get us to the point where we cannot only move \nthrough the President's judicial nominees, but that we can do the rest \nof the work with which the Senate is tasked.\n  The good Senator from Connecticut has just mentioned the Energy bill \nand the Transportation bill--these issues the country is waiting for, \nthe country is asking for, and the work that is incumbent upon us as a \nbody to get to.\n  So I am pleased that we are at the point where we are, not spending \nhours on the floor today to discuss nuclear options or constitutional \noptions, but that we are talking about the work before us as we look \nforward to these upcoming months. I do see a sense of compromise that \nwill be necessary if we have any plans at all to accomplish that which \nI think this country expects us to do.\n  I am pleased that we have gotten through to this point. I do \nrecognize the bump in the road we just had this afternoon, but I \nbelieve that with the same amount of determination that got us to a \nresolve on the judicial nominees, we will be able to do the work of the \ncountry.\n\n\n                                  BRAC\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise this evening for just a few \nminutes to talk about the upcoming BRAC and the impact we are seeing in \nmy State of Alaska, up in the interior, in the communities of Fairbanks \nand North Pole. They call this the golden heart of the State of Alaska.\n  The people of Alaska are strong and very consistent supporters of a \nstrong national defense. They are even stronger supporters of the men \nand women who serve in our military and their families. In a State \nwhere support for our servicemen and servicewomen and their missions is \nboth given and constant, the golden heart of Alaska probably beats \nstrongest in the areas of Fairbanks and North Pole.\n  So on the morning of May 13--Friday the 13th, oddly enough--the \npeople of the interior of Alaska awoke to the news that the Department \nof Defense had proposed to realign Eielson Air Force Base. Under the \nterms of this realignment, all of the Air Force active-duty operations \nwould be transferred elsewhere. The realignment would cause the \nrelocation of about 2,800 Air Force personnel and 3,300 dependents. It \nwould cause the loss of 4,700 jobs, both military and civilian jobs, \nwithin the Fairbanks area. It would mean the full transfer of A-10 and \nF-16 aircraft to bases in the lower 48. It would wreak havoc on the \nlocal economy and force major changes upon the Fairbanks North Star \nBorough School District.\n  To the people of interior Alaska, they do not look at this as a \nrealignment. It sounds to them, to us, exactly like a closing.\n  Two weeks after the fact, the people of interior Alaska are still \nscratching their heads and wondering why, what is going on here, what \nhas happened up here? General Billy Mitchell prophesied back in 1935. \nHe said:\n\n       In the future, he who holds Alaska holds the world.\n\n  General Mitchell characterized Alaska as the most important strategic \nplace in the world, and this is as true today as it was in 1935.\n  Alaska is closer to the European and Pacific theaters by air than \nperhaps any other place in North America. Our armed services can deploy \nforces from Alaska to Asia much more quickly than units on the west \ncoast of the United States. And if future developments limit overseas \nbasing, Alaska will be even more critical in America's ability to \nrespond to a crisis within a specific area of responsibility.\n  Yet 2 weeks after we learn of this news, the Air Force cannot--or \nwill not--tell the people of Fairbanks why. Immediately after the BRAC \nlist was released, my staff contacted appropriate staff members in the \nOffice of Legislative Liaison for the Secretary of the Air Force. We \nasked for a copy of the entire administrative record which supports \ntheir recommendation to realign Eielson.\n  For the better part of 2 weeks, there was no response to that \nrequest. Then suddenly this week, we get an e-mail from an Air Force \nlegislative liaison saying the material could not yet be provided \nbecause it is undergoing what they call security review. The Air Force \nlegislative liaison could not hazard a guess on when the material would \nbe released.\n  They are still in no position to explain to me or to the people of \ninterior Alaska why a base that we thought was of such strategic \nimportance to our Nation's defense would become little more than a \nrefueling station for fighter aircraft based somewhere else.\n\n  The people of interior Alaska deserve to know why, and I certainly \ndeserve to know why. The answers to these questions are more than just \nacademic interest. On June 15, the Base Realignment and Closure \nCommission will conduct a hearing on the recommendations pertaining to \nEielson Air Force Base. The community has enlisted the president of the \nUniversity of Alaska, retired Army MG Mark Hamilton to take the lead in \npresenting its case. The community is working very hard at this moment \nto put together a very thoughtful and well-researched presentation.\n  At this point, we are less than 30 days, a couple of weeks from the \ndate upon which that presentation, that do-or-die presentation, must be \ndelivered to the BRAC Commission. And yet still the Air Force cannot \nrelease the detailed analysis which supported their recommendations.\n  This is unfair to the community that has offered nothing but \nunconditional love and support for the military. It goes beyond \nconscionable.\n  So I have joined with Senator Snowe from Maine, as well as other \ncolleagues, to tell the Defense Department that their lack of candor \nwith the community that will suffer under the BRAC process has worn \nthin. I am proud to join with Senator Snowe and other colleagues to \nsponsor legislation that requires the Department of Defense to turn \nover the records supporting its BRAC recommendations and particularly \nthe information supporting its conclusions as to the military value of \nthe bases on the list.\n  We expect through this legislation that this information will be \nprovided to the Congress within 7 days of the passage of the \nlegislation. If the Defense Department cannot do this, then the \nlegislation requires that the BRAC process should stop.\n  Also this evening, I signed onto a letter to Secretary Rumsfeld, \ncosigned by a number of my colleagues who are expressing the same \nconcern, seeking full justification for base closures in their areas. I \nwould like to read one paragraph of this letter:\n\n       The failure of the Department of Defense to provide all of \n     the justification data used to recommend closing or \n     realigning installations in a timely fashion is anything but \n     ``fair, open or equitable.'' The Department of Defense has \n     had over two years to review and collect this data and people \n     associated with the installations selected foreclosure should \n     have at a minimum two weeks to review prior to any BRAC \n     hearings or site visits. Sufficient time to review this data \n     is necessary to ensure they can make an appeal based on the \n     criteria established by the Department of Defense.\n\n  Again, yet one more effort from Senators, from those who are \nconcerned about the effect that BRAC closures will have on our \nrespective communities, a request for information, a request for the \ndata that is supposed to be provided to us. We have to sign on to \nletters, we have to sign on to introduce legislation saying you must do \nthis within this time period or the close BRAC process stops. We should \nnot have to be going to these measures to get the information.\n  The BRAC commission process was never intended to be a rubberstamp of\n\n[[Page S6003]]\n\nthe Department of Defense recommendations. The Congress intended that \nit be an open process, a thoughtful process, but most importantly an \nintellectually rigorous process.\n  While the economies of many of our communities are at stake, this is \nnot the most important reason that we have a BRAC process. This process \nis intended to assure the Congress and the people that our national \nsecurity objectives are not compromised in the quest to save money. We \nknow the BRAC process is well underway. It is high time that the \nDefense Department shed some sunlight on the reasons for their \nrecommendations. The good people of interior Alaska should not be left \nin the position of defending the future of Eielson Air Force Base on \nJune 15 with both hands tied behind their back, and they should not \nhave to be burning the midnight oil in the hours leading up to that \nhearing studying material that should have been provided weeks earlier. \nThey do not deserve it, we do not deserve it, and our Nation's security \ncertainly deserves better than this.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allen). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this Sunday the people of Lebanon will go \nto the polls to vote in their first truly free election in three \ndecades. Since 1990, Lebanon has been occupied by Syrian forces, but \nthis spring the people of Lebanon made history. On March 8, hundreds of \nthousands of people descended upon Martyrs Square in Beirut, Lebanon's \ncapital, and inaugurated what has become known around the world by \npeople who viewed it as the Cedar Revolution.\n  For 2 weeks the word spread from city to city and to the countryside. \nIt was clear that freedom was on the march. On March 18, 10 days later, \na crowd of 1.5 million people, nearly half of the Lebanese population, \ngathered in that very square, Martyrs Square, to demand, to insist \nupon, the withdrawal of Syrian troops and its intelligence apparatus \nfrom Lebanon.\n  These brave and proud citizens of all ages, religions, and \nethnicities stood shoulder to shoulder waving their nation's flag in \nsolidarity. Together, with the support of freedom-loving democracies \neverywhere, they brought an end to Syrian occupation. In less than 2 \nmonths, 20,000 Syrian troops pulled out of the country. It was an \nastonishing wave of events broadcast on television sets and computer \nscreens around the globe.\n  Lebanon now joins the list of fledgling democracies taking their \nfirst bold steps into the future. All of this could not have happened \nwithout tremendous courage on the part of the Lebanese people. The \ndetermination and vision of one man, President Bush, made it possible. \nHis commitment to democracy and unwavering belief in the fundamental \nequality of all human beings has wrought remarkable change indirectly, \nsuch as in Lebanon, and more directly around the world. Democracy is \ntaking root in even the most inhospitable of lands.\n  By America's words and our deeds, we are emboldening those who seek \nfreedom and peace. It is an unprecedented moment in the history of the \nMiddle East.\n  I realized that yesterday as the President of the Palestinian \nAuthority, Mahmoud Abbas, was in our office in this Nation's Capitol. \nWe discussed the future and the hope and the opportunity. As noted \nscholar and Middle East expert Fouad Ajami says:\n\n       The entrenched systems of control in the Arab world are \n     beginning to give way.\n\n  Indeed, it is the autumn of the dictators.\n  I mention Lebanon in part because it has been on my mind the last 4 \nweeks. It was about 4 weeks ago that I and a delegation had the \nopportunity, the privilege, of traveling to Lebanon during our April \nrecess. While in Beirut, I had the opportunity to walk through that \nsquare, Martyrs Square. I met with leaders of the Cedar Revolution. \nThey represented a diversity of parties and religious sects--Christian, \nDruze, and Muslim. These leaders were well versed in the requirements \nfor a successfully functioning democracy. In particular, they discussed \nthe needs to restore transparency and accountability, the rule of law, \nto secure an independent judiciary and to build, to construct, to \nreconstruct their economy so that the Lebanese people maintain a stake \nin the future. Their commitment to freedom, to the rule of law, and \ndemocratic governance was truly inspiring.\n  There are many challenges ahead. We share the concern that Syrian \nintelligence officials have not fully withdrawn from Lebanon. We also \nknow that this election will not, in any shape or form, be perfect. Few \nelections in times of transition are. But seeing firsthand the \ndetermination of the Lebanese people was truly inspiring. I came away \noptimistic that this moment will lead to a new age of freedom and \ndemocracy for the Lebanese people.\n  In the words of Vaclav Havel, I urge the people of the region:\n\n     to never forget these days full of solidarity, hope and \n     common quest for freedom and truth.\n\n  To the Lebanese people:\n\n       It may be a long and difficult road, but please have faith \n     that the destination is well worth the journey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/26/senate-section/article/S6003-2", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6003]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            SENATOR AND ERMA BYRD's 68TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, on another issue, an issue that was \ndiscussed by several of my colleagues, most notably Senator Stevens, \nour distinguished colleague from Alaska, the President pro tempore, I \nrise to honor now a very special day in the life of one of our most \nrespected and venerable colleagues.\n  On Sunday, the distinguished senior Senator, Robert Byrd, celebrates \nhis 68th wedding anniversary with his beloved wife and high school \nsweetheart Erma Ora James.\n  The courtship is well known to our colleagues. It is hard to do it \nfull justice, but I will give it a try. The two met in Raleigh County \nover 7 decades ago, where Erma's father had been transferred from \nVirginia to work in the coal mines. Senator Byrd had a friend who \nbrought pocketfuls of gum and candy to school, and each day the young \nRobert Byrd would wait at the schoolhouse door and ask his friend for a \nfew pieces of candy. He put them in his pocket and at the first \nopportunity he would present the candies to Erma as a love offering.\n  Senator Byrd has said he wasn't really sure if his Erma knew that she \nwas his sweetheart, but she must have found out because the couple \nultimately was married in 1937. The day after their wedding, Senator \nByrd gave his new bride his wallet which contained several hundred \ndollars that, over the days and weeks and months, he had saved. He told \nher that she would be the head of their family finances forever. To \nthis day, Senator Byrd doesn't carry a wallet.\n  He has said that Erma has been his anchor all these years. They are \ntruly blessed to have one another, their family, and a lifetime of \nshared memories.\n  The Bible says:\n\n       A man will leave his father and mother, and be united to \n     his wife, and they will become one flesh.\n\n  For nearly 7 decades, Senator Byrd and his lovely wife Erma have \nlived up to the ideal of marriage. I commend them. I admire them. And I \nwish them both a very happy 68th anniversary.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have had a number of conversations the \nlast couple of days with the distinguished majority leader about this \nissue of stem cell research. Dr. Frist--and I say Dr. Frist because it \nrelates to this matter--indicated he was going to study\n\n[[Page S6004]]\n\nthis during the break. I think that is very important.\n  We have the opportunity to work together on legislation--I don't mean \nhe and I, I mean Democrats and Republicans in the Senate. Earlier this \nweek, the House voted to expand the President's stem cell research \npolicy. Passage of the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act was a victory \nfor millions of Americans who suffer from deadly diseases and for their \nfamilies. It was also a victory for bipartisanship. This bill shares \nthe same level of bipartisanship and support here in the Senate that it \ndid in the House.\n  Senators Harkin and Specter, who are champions of medical research, \nhave worked hard on this issue. Senators Feinstein, Hatch, Kennedy, and \nSmith have also been leaders on this bill.\n  I hope when we return from recess, the distinguished majority leader \nwill have had an opportunity to look at this and we can take some time \nto do this. What I do not want on this bill is to have it offered to \nDefense authorization or something such as that. I think it would be \nbetter if we had freestanding legislation on this. It can be done in a \nrelatively short period of time. I certainly hope so.

BYRD'S 68TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it is not often we get the time to just \ncome to the floor to talk about friendships and about what it means to \nbe friends in the Senate. I wish to take some time today to talk about \nmy friend, the former majority leader, former chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, and longtime friend, Senator Byrd.\n  It just so happens that we have spent a lot of time together. I \nremember so well one great trip to London when we went there for the \nBritish-American Parliamentary Conference where we had a great deal of \ntime to talk about the past and our own personal lives.\n  But I have come to the floor today to ask the Senate to join me in \noffering congratulations to my good friend and colleague, Senator \nRobert Byrd, and his wife Erma, who, on Sunday, will celebrate 68 years \nof marriage. This is an anniversary few of us will ever see, and as far \nas I can tell--I have checked with the Historian--no Senator has ever \nhad the opportunity to celebrate 68 years of marriage. As a matter of \nfact, my oldest son Walter and his wife Debbie will celebrate 23 years \nof marriage on the same day, this Sunday.\n  Those of us in the Senate have relied greatly upon Senator Byrd's \nknowledge and love of history. With just a few short days remaining \nbefore their anniversary and because we will probably not be in session \ntomorrow, I think it is appropriate to return the favor and ask the \nSenate to reflect a moment on Robert and Erma's history together as \nhusband and wife.\n  Robert Byrd and Erma James grew up together on the schoolyard of Mark \nTwain High School in West Virginia. They were high school sweethearts, \nalthough Senator Byrd has said himself he is ``not sure if [Erma] knew \nshe was my sweetheart.'' They were. And they were married on May 29, \n1937.\n  Over the years, their family has grown, as Senator Byrd likes to say, \n``into a brood of fine people.'' Today, they are proud parents of two \ndaughters and have known the joy of six grandchildren and six great-\ngrandchildren.\n  For 68 years, Senator and Mrs. Byrd have shown us what it means to \n``love, comfort, honor, and keep for better or worse, richer or poorer, \nin sickness and in health.'' Their story has been called ``one of the \ngreat American romances.''\n  Every year, in May, Senator Byrd comes to the floor to reflect on the \nmeaning of Mother's Day and honor the Nation's mothers. His great \nspeeches often mention Erma, the wonderful home she has made for him \nand their children, and the joy he takes in his family.\n  Two years ago, when Erma was sick, Senator Byrd stood up during an \nappropriations debate and told us he was going home. And I quote what \nhe said at that time:\n  There are only two duties that will exceed my duties in the Senate, \none is my duty to God and the second is to my family. I think my duty \nis to my wife.\n  Now, these moments are a great reminder to those of us who are \nmarried. We have married in this life, and we must do our best to keep \nthe promises we made long ago.\n  I have had the honor to be married twice myself. One of the reasons I \nam here today is I remember the great comfort Senator Byrd gave to me \nwhen I lost my first wife. He has assisted me and my family in many \nways. I also remember when he came to the floor and spoke of my first \nchild in my second marriage and really extolled the concept of marriage \nat that time.\n  After 68 years, Erma and Robert still have the deep and abiding \nfriendship that began in Beckley, WV; the love of their children, \ngrandchildren, and great-grandchildren; and the respect of all of us in \nthe Senate. I know of no other Senator who has celebrated over 50 years \nof service in Congress, and as I said before, there is no other Senator \nwho could say he celebrated 68 years of marriage. It is an overwhelming \naccomplishment and really a credit to both Robert and Erma.\n  Earlier this month, in his annual Mother's Day address, Senator Byrd \nreflected on the early days of his marriage to Erma. He said:\n\n       Nearly seven decades ago, we were the rankest of amateurs \n     at marriage and parenthood.\n\n  This Sunday, our good friend and his wife will have proven they are \nnow experts in both categories. My wife Catherine and I wish them the \nbest.\n  Senator Byrd has often marked significant events by submitting works \nof poetry for the Record. I wish I had his capability for remembering \npoems and works of great art. But today, I offer a poem by the great \nAlaskan poet, Robert Service, and I offer it in honor of Senator and \nMrs. Byrd's 68 years together. Robert Service's poem is entitled ``Home \nand Love,'' and it goes like this:\n     Just home and love! The words are small\n     Four little letters unto each;\n     And yet you will not find in all\n     The wide and gracious range of speech\n     Two more so tenderly complete:\n     When angels talk in heaven above,\n     I'm sure they have no words more sweet\n     Than home and love.\n\n     Just home and love! It's hard to guess\n     Which of the two were best to gain;\n     Home without love is bitterness:\n     Love without home is often pain.\n     No! Each alone will seldom do;\n     Somehow they travel hand and glove:\n     If you win one you must have two,\n     Both home and love.\n\n     And if you've both, well then I'm sure\n     You ought to sing the whole day long:\n     It doesn't matter if you're poor\n     With these to make divine your song.\n     And so I praisefully repeat,\n     When angels talk in heaven above,\n     There are no words more simply sweet\n     Than home and love.\n\n  I ask the Senate to remember to congratulate my good friend on 68 \nyears of marriage.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise toady to congratulate a member of our \nSenate family who is nearing an amazing milestone in life--68 years of \nmarriage.\n  On My 29, 1937, the Valedictorian of Mark Twain High School married \nhis sweetheat--a coal miner's daughter--in West Virginia. That \nvaledictorian was Senator Robert Byrd. The coal miner's daughter was \nErma Ora James. On Sunday, they will mark 68 years together.\n  It is an incredible achievement and a testament to their love and \ncommitment.\n  Look how far they've come. They have seen their lives move from the \nhills of West Virginia to the highest levels of government. Senator \nByrd has gone from gas station attendant to\n\n[[Page S6005]]\n\nmeat cutter to welder to United States Senator.\n  But--it's important to note--Senator Byrd has never hidden the secret \nof his success. If you talk to him, he will give credit to whom credit \nis due.\n  He said it right here on the Senate floor in May of 2000 days before \nhis 63rd anniversary. He said: ``I have to frankly say that what little \nI have amounted, if it is anything much, I owe for the most part to \n[Erma].''\n  Well Erma, the people of West Virginia and the United States owe you \na debt of gratitude for all you've done for your husband and for giving \nus his time for so many years.\n  I've said before, Senator Byrd is a mentor of mine.\n  I have had the good fortunate of serving with him in the Senate since \n1986. In these 19 years, I've gotten to know Senator Byrd and Erma \nwell. They are a wonderful couple, delightful individuals, and I am \nhonored to call them both friends.\n  Senator Byrd and Erma have no doubt seen many changes over their 68 \nyears of marriage--none bigger than the size of their family. They have \ntwo daughters--Mona and Marjorie--and over a dozen grandchildren and \ngreat grandchildren.\n  Of course, no one can talk about Mr. and Mrs. Robert Byrd without \nrecalling how they came to be together. He used sweets to get to her \nheart.\n  In school, a young Robert Byrd used to take sweets from a fellow \nclassmate but he wouldn't eat them. He would store them up and give \nthem to Erma when he met her in the hall. Years later he would say: \n``That's the way you court a girl--with another boy's bubble gum.''\n  I have said many times that the Members of this Chamber are a family. \nAnd what an amazing example of family we have in Senator Byrd and Erma.\n  For 68 years of marriage, they have set a high standard for us all. \nIt is a tribute to their love for each other, and for the rich, \nproductive life they have enjoyed.\n  I congratulate them once again and pray for many more years of \nhappiness together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/26/senate-section/article/S6005-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6005]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              MEMORIAL DAY\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this coming Monday, Americans across the \nNation will hang flags at their doors and place small flags and flowers \non the gravesites of loved ones and soldiers in a tradition that \nstretches deep into history, perhaps back to the advent of warfare.\n  The selection of the last Monday in May is unique to the United \nStates, but remembering and honoring those fallen in battle is deeply \ningrained in the human heart. On this day, these sons and fathers, \nuncles and brothers and, more recently, daughters and mothers, aunts \nand nieces are family members to us all. Lost to us too early, their \nimages remain frozen in time, young faces trying to look stern in crisp \nuniforms. Their sacrifices on battlefields from the Argonne to Tripoli, \nPearl Harbor to Iwo Jima, Porkchop Hill to Hamburger Hill, Kabul to \nBaghdad have kept the Nation safe and carried the American ideals of \nliberty and democracy across the surface of the globe.\n  This week, as the Senate struggled and ultimately overcame an arcane \nbut fundamental challenge to our constitutional system of checks and \nbalances, we have, I believe, honored the memory of all of those \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines. They defended the Nation and the \nConstitution from without; a bipartisan group of Senators this week \ndefended it from within, thank God.\n  I rejoice that 14 Senators could rise above partisan politics to \nunderstand and preserve the carefully crafted balance of powers \ninscribed in our Constitution. Without the Constitution, the millions \nof lives and billions of dollars spent over the years on our Nation's \ndefense, the flower of our youth and our hard-earned treasure, would \nhave gone for naught. Our form of Government, acknowledging the might \nof the majority but protecting the rights of the minority, balancing \npopulous States against States with smaller populations, preserving the \nvoice and will of the people as the ultimate check against the rise of \na tyrant king, that is our greatest treasure. It is the preservation of \nour form of Government that merits committing our young to the bloody \nhorrors of battle.\n  It is perhaps appropriate, in this context, that the Senate's battle \nis concluded just before Memorial Day, which originated after our \nNation's most divisive and bloody war ever fought on our home soil. The \nCivil War pit over 2.2 million Union soldiers against just over 1 \nmillion Confederate soldiers, resulting in almost 600,000 deaths, a \nthird in battle and the rest from war's accompanying furies of disease \nand privation. It is a tribute to the heart's powers of healing that \nsoon after the war, individuals and communities could put aside their \ndifferences in the graveyard and simply mourn their losses together.\n  Over 42 million American patriots have risked their lives for our \nNation since the Revolutionary War. Over 17 million war veterans, of \namong over 25 million veterans of military service, live among us \nstill. I salute them all, and thank them and their families for their \nbravery and their patriotism.\n  Of the 42 million Americans who saw battle during their military \nservice, over 650,000 died in battle. That is 650,000 families who \nreceived the terrible news that their loved one had been killed. In \nWorld War II, the tragic news often came by telegram, and Americans \nlearned to dread the sight of those envelopes.\n  As of May 23, 2005, in connection with Operation Iraqi Freedom, 1,623 \nfamilies have answered the door to the solemn faces of two officers \nwhose hard duty it is to report the tragic news that another life has \nbeen lost. Another 186 families have gotten the same sad news coming \nfrom Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. My prayers go out to \nthese families. There are no words that can console the grieving heart \nat times like these. The widow's flag, folded with care after a \nmilitary ceremony, offers little comfort. But these brave men and \nwomen, and the families they leave behind, are part of a long chain of \nsacrifice and grief that firm the resolve of the Nation. Never should \nwe forget their service to the Nation and the Constitution. Never \nshould we squander their sacrifice on momentary partisan advantages \nthat erode the integrity of the Constitution and, in turn, the \ncontinued health and vitality of our form of government.\n  On this Memorial Day, and on every Memorial Day, I urge Americans to \nput out their flags and to honor the fallen. I further urge them, in \nthe spirit of those first Memorial Days, to put aside partisanship in \nfavor of true patriotism, and to love and preserve our Nation and our \nConstitution in a lasting tribute to those who have given their lives \nin its defense.\n  As is my custom on these occasions, I would like to close with a \npoem.

Mr. President, I rise to memorialize in the Record of \nthe Senate the name of a great educator in the State of Georgia. Two \nweeks ago at the commencement exercises of Kennesaw State University in \nKennesaw,\n\n[[Page S6006]]\n\nGA, a lady by the name of Dr. Betty Siegel announced at the end of that \ncommencement her retirement as president of Kennesaw State University \nafter 25 years of service.\n  One might think in listening to that, well, that is a nice \naccomplishment, but is that so significant? I will talk for a minute \nabout how significant this woman's life and her contributions have \nbeen.\n  Twenty-five years ago there were not many women presidents of any \ncolleges or universities in the United States of America. In fact, \nBetty Siegel became the first president of a public university in the \nhistory of the university system of Georgia. She took the leadership of \na small, urban campus, nonresidential, known as Kennesaw State College, \nwith students numbering 4,000, handing out a handful of degrees, most \nall to computer learners.\n  As Dr. Siegel announced her retirement 2 weeks ago, she leaves a \nuniversity with 18,000 students, third only to the University of \nGeorgia and Georgia State University in population in our State, \ngranting multiple degrees and a forerunner in our State in nursing, in \neducation, in family business, in leadership, and in ethics.\n  Betty Siegel graduated from Wake Forest with an undergraduate degree \nand went to the University of North Carolina for her master's and \ndoctorate from Florida State. She taught, she became a dean, throughout \nthe southeastern United States. But when she was tapped, it was not \nonly the right person for the time, it was the best decision possible. \nShe broke the glass ceiling for women presidents at universities and \ncolleges in Georgia because now we have many. She was the forerunner.\n  She built an urban university that was nonresidential and commuter \ninto a combination commuter and residential university of renown and \nrespect all over the United States.\n  While she did it, she did just a few other things. She got appointed \nto five corporate boards because of her contribution, her intellect, \nher knowledge, and her breadth and depth. She became president of a \nChamber of Commerce. How many times have you heard of a college \npresident or university president going on to be the president of a \nlocal community Chamber of Commerce? This happens to be the second \nlargest Chamber of Commerce in the State of Georgia. But that is how \nremarkable Betty Siegel is.\n  I also mentioned in my remarks earlier that Kennesaw was the leader \nin leadership and ethics. They are because Betty Siegel found a way, \nthrough corporate and private donations, to endow a chair and build a \nschool committed to leadership in ethics, in business, and in public \nlife.\n  Through her commitment to understand the strength of small business \nand the fact that it is the heart of American employment, she founded, \nin our State, at her university, a division of family business, second \nto none, that today is the resource for families who try to make those \ntransitions from one generation to the next, to make the transition \nfrom small business to medium-sized business to large business, or to \nseek the guidance that is so unique for small family businesses. And \nKennesaw State University is that institution.\n  But I want to tell you something about Dr. Betty Siegel.\n  Retirement is not quite the appropriate announcement because she has \nnever retired from her commitment in her life to young people and to \ntheir education, and she will not now. Because when asked, after her \nannouncement--within minutes--well, what are you going to do? She said: \nI am going to teach. I am going to work with young people. I am going \nto try to make their lives better.\n  After making that announcement, she spent the next week overnight in \na dorm with students, asking how she could advise the next president to \nmake the services of Kennesaw State University even better for the \nstudents who will enter in the fall of 2005 and go on to 2006.\n  It gives me a great deal of pleasure and it is a privilege to \nrecognize on the Senate floor the contributions of Dr. Betty Siegel to \nthe children of Georgia, her contributions to higher education, the \nceiling she broke for women in academics in our State, and, most \nimportantly, all of her continuing capacity to helping and teaching our \nyoung people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/26/senate-section/article/S6006-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6006]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                       specialist travis anderson\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to take a moment to remember \none of our fallen heroes, a young man from my home State and my native \nSan Luis Valley, SPC Travis Anderson.\n  Specialist Anderson was killed in Iraq on May 13, 2005. He was 28 \nyears old and a native of Hooper, CO, a small town of 123 not much \ndifferent from where I grew up in the San Luis Valley.\n  A terrorist car bomb struck his HumVee, killing him and wounding \nseveral fellow soldiers in the vehicle with him. All of us were \nfortunate to be blessed by his life and we are all saddened by his \nloss. He exemplified courage, discipline and patriotism, some of the \nfinest qualities that we prize in Colorado and across this Nation.\n  Specialist Anderson--``Loopie'' to his family and friends and \n``Cowboy'' to his fellow soldiers in Bravo Company, 3rd Infantry \nDivision--was the kind of man that makes all of Colorado proud.\n  His family and friends remember that Travis was a rambunctious \nyoungster. He went on to work as a farmer and ranch hand in Montana and \nNevada. He worked hard to earn his high school diploma and even \ndefeated the hantavirus, which at one point reduced him to a mere 100 \npounds.\n  But after those horrible hours on 9/11, Specialist Anderson heard a \nhigher calling, one above his own self interest, and he enlisted in the \nArmy at 26. In the Army, he flourished into a man of discipline and \ninitiative.\n  He had the admiration and respect of his fellow soldiers and \nsuperiors. ``Sometimes I wish we had a whole platoon of him,'' said SSG \nJeremy Schultz, who served with Specialist Anderson in Iraq. Don't we \nall; don't we all.\n  Specialist Anderson of the Army's 2nd Battalion, 7th Infantry \nRegiment, 1st Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division was training with the \nSpecial Forces when he was killed earlier this month. He was awarded \nthe Bronze Star posthumously. He came from humble beginnings and \naspired to quiet greatness with an even greater heart.\n  President John F. Kennedy once said, ``Every area of trouble gives \nout a ray of hope, and the one unchangeable certainty is that nothing \nis certain or unchangeable.'' SPC Travis Anderson exemplified this in \nhis mission of service to his nation. He will be missed by all those \naround him and he and his family will remain in our prayers. And to his \nfamily and friends, I say, on behalf of a grateful nation: thank you \nfor sharing Travis with us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/26/senate-section/article/S6006-2", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6006-S6007]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MEMORIAL DAY 2005\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the significance of \nMemorial Day and to remember the Americans it commemorates. In just a \nfew days, we will come together as a Nation to pay tribute to the \ncourageous men and women who fought and died for our country. Too often \nwe take for granted the freedoms we, as Americans, enjoy, too often we \nforget those who gave their lives to secure this liberty.\n  America has honored its fallen soldiers with a Memorial Day, \nsometimes called Decoration Day, since the Civil War. Though we are \ngrateful to these heroes each and every day, it was recognized that we \nshould set aside 1 day in particular, the last Monday in May, to be \nespecially mindful of the brave soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines \nwho paid the ultimate price for their fellow citizens.\n  During a time when we continue to lose more of our friends, family \nand neighbors in combat overseas, I am especially mindful of the \nsacrifices made by our men and women in the military. I served in World \nWar II, and I have seen firsthand the bravery and selflessness that is \na common thread in our military personnel. Though I was lucky enough to \nreturn home, not a day passes when I do not think of my comrades who \nwere not as fortunate, and I am eternally grateful to them.\n  On this earnest occasion, I would like to draw attention to what we \ncan do for those veteran soldiers still with us so that we do not \ndisrespect the sacrifices made by those we have lost. We must provide \nfull funding for veterans' health care. Every year the President sends \nforward his budget proposal to\n\n[[Page S6007]]\n\nCongress, and every year we go through the same struggle to get VA \nhealth care the money it needs to adequately serve its veteran \npatients. We must change the way funds are allocated so that all of our \nveterans are guaranteed the care they so clearly deserve.\n  I want the 115,000 veterans who choose to make Hawaii their home to \nbe assured that they will receive the services they have earned. The \nnearly 18,000 veterans who avail themselves of VA health care on Oahu, \nthe Big Island, Kauai, and Maui should not have to worry if resources \nfor doctors and nurses will materialize next year. The reservists and \nguardsmen who are deployed for the current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan \nalso must receive the care they need upon their return. And the fact \nthat a whole population of veterans is denied care because VA does not \nhave adequate funding is shameful.\n  Memorial Day is a day of both sorrow and joy. We mourn those we have \nlost in battle, and we celebrate the freedoms we currently enjoy thanks \nto those brave individuals. As we gather together over the long weekend \nto celebrate this important holiday, let us make sure to take a moment \nto remember and thank those who lost their lives in order to secure our \nfutures. Then, for the rest of our tenure in Congress, let us not \nwaiver from the commitments made to these brave men and women in terms \nof programs, services and benefits.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/26/senate-section/article/S6007-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6007]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              MEMORIAL DAY\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, Memorial Day is a day of mixed emotions: \nsorrow for the families whose sons and daughters have given their lives \nfor our country, coupled with universal pride in the great Americans \nwho for generations and particularly today teach us the full meaning of \nservice and sacrifice. The courage and bravery of our young men and \nwomen fighting overseas continues to inspire all of us, and indeed \ninspire the free world and those yearning for freedom.\n  America's fallen soldiers shouldered a responsibility greater than \nany of us will ever know. Their families, their units, and their nation \ndepended on them, and they answered the call of duty with selflessness \nand devotion. Our soldiers did not shirk from this responsibility, and \nall the uncertainty, danger and honor that came with it. Their families \nremember them as special sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, \nhusbands and wives, and cherished friends. Their Nation remembers them \nas special citizens. Grown men will touch their names etched on granite \nwalls and will today weep for fallen comrades who gave their lives so \nthat others can live.\n  In this time of war, and in memory of our fallen heroes, we must be \nmindful to do everything in our power to keep our troops safe as they \nkeep us safe. We must do better to take care of their families, who \nsacrifice in ways too many to count.\n  While we can never repay our Nation's debt to families who have made \nthe ultimate sacrifice, we must always remember the legacy of their \nfallen sons and daughters: a safer and freer world. On this Memorial \nDay, I believe it appropriate to take a small step in that direction by \nrecognizing in the record those exceptional individuals from \nMassachusetts who this year gave their lives, and earned the eternal \ngratitude of the American people:\n  Arredondo, Alexander S., Lance Corporal, USMC, 25-Aug-2004--Randolph, \nMA; Connolly, David, S., Major, USA, 6-Apr-2005--Boston, MA; \nCunningham, Darren J., Staff Sergeant, USA, 30-Sep-2004--Groton, MA; \nDepew, Cory R., Private, USA, 04-Jan-2005--Haverhill, MA; Desiato, \nTravis R., Lance Corporal, USMC, 15-Nov-2004--Bedford, MA; Farrar Jr., \nAndrew K., Sergeant, USMC, 28-Jan-2005--Weymouth, MA; Fontecchio, Elia \nP., Gunnery Sergeant, USMC, 04-Aug-2004--Milford, MA; Fuller, Travis \nJ., 1st Lieutenant, USMC, 26-Jan-2005--Granville, MA; Gavriel, \nDimitrios, Lance Corporal, USMC, 18-Nov-2004--Haverhill, MA; Johnson, \nMarkus J., Private, USA, 1st Class, 01-Jun-2004--Springfield, MA; Lusk, \nJoe F.

He told his troops that they could beat the Viet Cong by \nusing the guerrillas' own mobile, hit-and-run tactics. ``We are going \nto do what they do but just do it better,'' he said. `` We out-gee the \nG.''\n  ``Out-geeing the G'' was the heart and soul of Colonel Hackworth's \nbrand of soldiering.\n  Sadly, Colonel Hackworth was not able to ``out-Gee'' the enemy this \ntime.\n  Colonel Hackworth began his military career just up the coast from \nTijuana--in Santa Monica, CA.\n  At the age of 10, after Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor, he worked as \na shoeshine boy at a military post there where a group of soldiers \nadopted him as a mascot. They had a special uniform made for him to \nwear. Both his parents died before his first birthday.\n  At this point in his life, Colonel Hackworth said: ``I knew my \ndestiny. Nothing would be better than to be a soldier.''\n  You can't utter the name David Hackworth without also saying the word \nsoldier in the same breath. He was a ``soldier's'' soldier.\n  He was a soldier from the day he put on that special uniform in Santa \nMonica to the moment he died. He may have taken off his uniform after \npublicly denouncing the Vietnam war on national TV in 1971, but he \ncontinued to soldier until the very end of his life.\n  I know that Colonel Hackworth was a highly respected combat veteran. \nI know he distinguished himself as a leader of troops in the field in \nKorea and Vietnam. I know he was awarded a large number of combat \ndecorations for valor.\n  Colonel Hackworth was a true American hero.\n  But I do not want to leave my colleagues with a false impression.\n  I did not know Colonel Hackworth when he was fighting wars and \nwinning medals for valor. I have only read about that part of his life. \nI did not meet him until much later--after he had started a new career.\n  I came to know Colonel Hackworth after he became a reporter and began \ncovering the Pentagon.\n  He was still a soldier all right--but a different kind of soldier.\n  Colonel Hackworth had become what I would call a brave-hearted \nsoldier for the truth.\n  When I met him, he had taken off his uniform. He was fighting a \ndifferent kind of war. He was a soldier in civilian clothes. But he \nstill had a mission. He wanted to bring truth, justice, and \naccountability to military headquarters--the Pentagon. He wanted to \nshed some light on what he perceived as gross incompetence and \ncorruption on the part of some senior officers.\n  He was a contributing editor and reporter for Newsweek Magazine and \nsyndicated columnist.\n  Colonel Hackworth and I shared a small piece of common ground--\nwatchdogging the Pentagon.\n  From the moment when I was first elected to the Senate, I have worked\n\n[[Page S6008]]\n\nvery hard to ferret out fraud, waste, and abuse at the Pentagon and \nstop it. I do it because I don't want to see a single tax dollar \nwasted.\n  Colonel Hackworth attacked the very same problem but from a different \nangle.\n  As in everything he did, he always looked at a problem from a common \nsoldier's perspective.\n  As I said, his main concern was incompetence and corruption among \nsome senior officers in the Pentagon. He called them ``perfumed \nprinces.'' These were some of the same officers he saw come and go in \nVietnam. They came to Vietnam to get their ``tickets punched.'' They \ngot their ``tickets punched'' by commanding a battalion or brigade for \na shortened tour of duty before rotating home to the Pentagon for \npromotion.\n  To the hardcore soldier like Colonel Hackworth, ``ticket punching'' \nin Vietnam translated into unnecessary casualties on the battlefield. \nThe wasting of one soldier's life produced real fury inside this man. \nHe could not--and would not--tolerate it.\n  One illustrative incident, which occurred in Vietman, is described in \nhis book ``About Face.''\n  During a very intense combat operation, a ``perfumed prince'' riding \nin a helicopter overhead issued an order to a unit under Colonel \nHackworth's command--without Colonel Hackworth's knowledge or approval. \nThat order resulted in a significant loss of life in one of Colonel \nHackworth's units.\n  Colonel Hackworth believed that those casualties were avoidable and \nunnecessary.\n  When he returned to home base, he sought out that officer, put a 45 \ncaliber weapon to his head, and threatened to kill him if he ever did \nanything like that again.\n  That is Colonel Hackworth's own account of what happened on that day \nso long ago.\n  Colonel Hackworth loved his troops above all else and would go to any \nlength to protect them from harm and abuse.\n  His lifelong commitment to the common soldier was the driving force \nbehind the stories he produced as a reporter with Newsweek and other \npublications.\n  In Colonel Hackworth's mind, the terrible loss of life in Vietnam had \nits origins in a disease that he set out to cure--the gross \nincompetence and corruption--that he perceived at the highest echelons \nin the Pentagon.\n  Colonel Hackworth was determined to wipe it out and right a wrong.\n  Over the years, we collaborated on a number of investigations. The \none I remember best is the one involving Air Force General Joseph Ashy \nin 1994-95.\n  Colonel Hackworth conducted his own investigation. He gathered the \nfacts and the documents. I, in turn, referred Colonel Hackworth's \nallegations to the inspector general, IG, for review.\n  This is what Colonel Hackworth reported in the press:\n\n       General Ashy flew himself, his aide and family cat from \n     Italy to Colorado aboard a 200-seat Air Force plane; he flew \n     his wife round-trip on an Air Force VIP aircraft from \n     Colorado to Washington; and he made palatial renovations at \n     his headquarters.\n\n  The IG concluded that General Ashy's ``wasteful escapades'' cost the \ntaxpayers $424,602.00.\n  Colonel Hackworth found out about General Ashy's ``escapades'' from \none of his beloved soldiers who was denied a seat--and free ride home--\non Ashy's airplane.\n  Colonel Hackworth's comments were as follows:\n\n       The taxpayers got ripped-off for almost a half a million \n     bucks by a member of our military elite and virtually nothing \n     is being done about it. . . . The Air Force spinmeisters lied \n     through their teeth about what General Ashy did. . . . \n     Besides being a blatant waste of money, this incident is \n     about deception and the art of diffusing responsibility. . . \n     . Ashy was fined a mere $5,020.00 and continues to have four \n     stars and his finger on the nuclear button.\n\n  General Ashy wrote out a check for the fine and sent it to Air Force \nHeadquarters on June 26, 1995. However, instead of depositing his check \nat the bank, the check was stashed in a safe in Air Force Secretary \nSheila Widnall's office--for what I suspect was permanent safekeeping. \nAt my request, the IG began making new inquiries and the check finally \nwent to the bank on September 15, 1995.\n  This great American soldier told us--in ``plain old English''--what \nhe expected from the top brass at the Pentagon. He expected them to \nlead by example. If they failed his leadership and integrity test at \nheadquarters, he believed they would fail on the battlefield.\n  His pronouncements were blunt, for sure. They were almost always \nharsh and sometimes coarse. But they always conveyed an important \nlesson tempered by battlefield experiences. So I listened and learned. \nHis opinions on the Pentagon brass had credibility in my book. He had \nput them to the ultimate test on so many distant battlefields. That was \ngood enough for me.\n  The lessons taught by this great American soldier are lessons that \nwill stand the test of time. Setting the example has been the most \npowerful element of leadership since the beginning of time. Colonel \nHackworth kept going back to those enduring principles. As a Nation, we \nmust do the same. We must rely on those ideas. They are too important \nto be forgotten. They must be followed.\n  Colonel Hackworth was a constant and forceful reminder of just how \nimportant those principles really are.\n  The memory of Colonel Hackworth and all that he stood for lives on in \nour hearts and minds.\n  Colonel Hackworth has left us. His remains will be laid to rest in \nArlington National Cemetery on May 31. But he will not be forgotten. He \nwill never fade away.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/26/senate-section/article/S6008-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6008-S6009]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     COLONELONEL DAVID H. HACKWORTH\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a true \nAmerican hero, COL. David H. Hackworth, who spent his last years in \nConnecticut. Colonel Hackworth was one the most legendary and highly \ndecorated soldiers of the U.S. Army. As Memorial Day approaches, there \nis no better time to remember the sacrifices, courage and tactical \ngenius of this legendary soldier who spent more than half a century \nfighting on the world's most dangerous battlefields. As World War II \nwas coming to a close, a 14-year-old David Hackworth lied about his age \nto join the Merchant Marine and a year later joined the U.S. Army--\nspending the next 26 years fighting our nation's battles. A true \nleader, ``Hack'' as he was known, received a battlefield commission in \nKorea to become the Army's youngest captain and was promoted in Vietnam \nto the Army's youngest full colonel. Three times he was nominated for \nthe Medal of Honor. His decorations are numerous and include the Army \nMedal of Valor, the Distinguished Service Cross, ten Silver Stars, \neight Bronze Stars and the United Nations Peace Medal. But the awards \nof which he was proudest are his eight purple hearts and the Combat \nInfantryman's Badge. Mr. President, As you know, there is only one way \nto get this badge: serve 90 days in a front-line infantry unit under \nfire and survive.\n  In just one example of his bravery, Colonel Hackworth got out on the \nstrut of a helicopter to drag to safety his men who were pinned down \nand facing certain death. It is no wonder, Colonel Hackworth has so \nmany supporters.\n  But these statistics do not capture the Colonel Hackworth, the \niconoclastic straight talker, who lead from the front and spoke from \nhis heart. One of the most telling stories about Colonel Hackworth's \nleadership was his transformation of the 4/39 Infantry Battalion from a \ndemoralized outfit into an effective counter-insurgency fighting force \nthat routed enemy units in the jungles of Vietnam. Colonel Hackworth's \ntraining methods and tactics were so successful, he wrote them down in \na book ``The Vietnam Primer'' that is still read by commanders today.\n  GEN. Hal Moore, the coauthor of ``We Were Soldiers Once and Young,'' \ncalled him ``the Patton of Vietnam,'' while General Creighton Abrams, \nthe last American commander in that disastrous war, described him as \n``the best battalion commander I ever saw in the United States Army.''\n  Gruff and full of purple prose, Colonel Hackworth ran afoul of the \nArmy's top leadership and retired following a confrontation in which he \nsaid in 1971 that the Vietnam War was hopeless. Often called the \nchampion of the common soldier, ``Hack'' spoke truth to power. After \nleaving the service, Colonel Hackworth launched himself into new \ncareers as a journalist, businessman, restaurateur and best-selling \nauthor as\n\n[[Page S6009]]\n\nhe cast his sharp and experienced eye on the military-industrial \ncomplex. He always cast a glaring spotlight on concerns when the \n``grunts'' were not getting the equipment they needed to do their jobs.\n  I extend my deepest condolences to Colonel Hackworth's wife, Eilhys \nEngland, and his many children, step-children, grandchildren and step-\ngrandchildren. But of all the tributes I know will come Colonel \nHackworth's way, I think the tribute he would appreciate most will be \nfrom the average soldier whose loyalty he earned in combat and whose \nwelfare became his life's cause in his retirement, for he knew they are \nthe men and women who are out on point securing our Nation's freedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/26/senate-section/article/S6009-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6009]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  A 35-year-old gay man was walking to his Boston home when three young \nmen approached him, knocked him to the ground, and repeatedly kicked \nhim in the face. Although he was yelling for help and near several \nhomes, no one came to his aid. The perpetrators fled and left the \nvictim with multiple contusions and internal bleeding in his face. \nNeither possessions nor money was stolen.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/26/senate-section/article/S6009-2", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6009]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 REPEALING D.C.'S LOCAL GUN SAFETY LAWS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, legislation has been introduced that would \nrepeal nearly every gun safety law in the District of Colombia. Sadly, \nthe bill was introduced during the celebration of National Police Week \nand just days after 153 law enforcement officers who died in the line \nof duty in 2004 were honored at the National Law Enforcement Officers \nMemorial.\n  The misnamed ``District of Colombia Personal Protection Act'' would \nrepeal local laws in Washington, DC that ban the sale and possession of \nunregistered firearms, require firearm registration, impose commonsense \nsafe storage requirements, and ban semiautomatic weapons in the \nDistrict. Should this bill become law, those who live and work in our \nNation's capital as well as tourists and other visitors would face a \ngreater threat of gun violence.\n  In a statement last week, DC Mayor Anthony Williams said, ``I am \nincensed by any congressional proposal that uses District residents as \npawns. I am incensed by any proposal that assaults Home Rule. And I am \nincensed by any proposal that is an insult to the memory of the people \nwho have died in this city due to gun violence--in particular the three \nchildren who have died from gun violence this year.''\n  Instead of interfering in local affairs in Washington, DC, the Senate \nshould focus its energies on legislation on improving the safety of the \nfamilies and communities across the Nation. The Senate has yet to \nconsider several common sense gun safety measures during this Congress. \nAmong these are proposals that would reauthorize the 1994 assault \nweapons ban, prohibit the sale of the Five-Seven armor-piercing \nhandgun, and help investigators working to prevent attacks by \nterrorists using high powered weapons. I urge the Senate to take up and \npass these bills to make our Nation safer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/26/senate-section/article/S6009-3", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6009-S6010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CONGRATULATIONS TO ROBERT FOUST\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I want to pay tribute to an \nexceptional member of my staff who is retiring at the end of this month \nafter 33 years of service to the Senate.\n  Bob has worked in the Senate for a period of 40 years, starting as an \nintern in the 1960s, and then working full time for Senator Claiborne \nPell for 19 years from 1970 to 1989. After taking 2 years to travel the \nworld, it was my great good fortune that Bob volunteered to join my \nstaff in the spring of 1991.\n  At the time, Bob told me he was looking to complete 20 years of \nSenate service. I do not think either he or I thought that he would be \nwith me for 14 years. But I could not be more pleased that Bob decided \nto stay.\n  During his tenure in my office, he has worked on education, veterans, \nand international affairs issues. His work on all these issues has been \noutstanding. On veterans and education issues, in particular, he has \ndeveloped a long list of legislative victories both small and large.\n  Bob has a gift for seeing legislative opportunities. One example I \nwill never forget involves the V-chip. For years, I had heard from \nparents, educators, health care professionals and religious leaders \nabout their concerns regarding the influence of television violence on \nyoung people. In response, Bob helped me form a steering committee of \ninterested individuals and organizations to talk about possible \napproaches to help shield children from gratuitous violence on \ntelevision. And we developed V-chip legislation. During the debate on \nthe 1996 telecommunications bill, I offered my amendment to require \nthat the V-chip be included in TVs so that parents would have the \nability to block out violent shows. When I offered the amendment, the \nso-called experts told us not to push forward--that the amendment \ncouldn't pass. But Bob advised me to move forward. And when the roll \nwas called, the amendment passed by a strong 73 to 26 margin, and was \nthen enacted into law.\n  Bob's attention to North Dakota's veterans has paid off in greatly \nimproved facilities around the State. When Bob learned that the VA was \nconsidering closing VA facilities that were not up to current \nstandards, he alerted me and helped me lead the fight for a $12 million \nrenovation at the Fargo VA Medical Center. These renovations, which \nwill be finished later this year, have dramatically improved the \nfacility for our veterans. Bob has also been very concerned about the \nlong travel times facing the many North Dakota veterans who live in \nrural areas. From his first day in the office, he pushed hard to expand \nservices for rural veterans through the Community Based Outpatient \nClinics, CBOCs. To date, as a result of Bob's hard work, we have \nsecured three CBOCs at Minot, Grafton and Bismarck. And the VA's CARES, \nCapital Assets Realignment for Enhanced Services, Commission has \napproved five new clinics at Williston, Jamestown, Devils Lake, Grand \nForks AFB, and Dickinson. Finally, Bob has had great compassion for the \nmost vulnerable among our veterans--homeless veterans--and has \nconstantly looked for ways to help them. Most recently, he worked with \nCentre, Inc. in Fargo to shepherd through a $1.6 million grant to \nrenovate a facility that will house a 48-bed shelter for homeless \nveterans.\n  On education, he was constantly looking for ways to help North \nDakota's teachers, whether it was bringing information technology to \nclassrooms or advocating for appropriate implementation of the No Child \nLeft Behind Act. Bob conceived of the Rural Education Achievement \nProgram and built a coalition that helped me enact this important \nlegislation during the 106th Congress. Almost 80 percent of North \nDakota school districts have 600 students or less. Under the REAP \nprogram, small, rural school districts are entitled to consolidate \nfunding from Federal education programs to make more efficient use of \nthe funds. In the first 3 years of the REAP program, more than 270 \nNorth Dakota schools benefitted from approximately $2.7 million in \nfunding.\n  Bob's commitment to education also carried over to the intern \nprogram. As he had in Senator Pell's office, Bob volunteered to \ncoordinate my Washington intern program. Bob devoted significant time \nand effort to ensuring that interns in my office had a terrific \nlearning experience. In fact, Bob's example has inspired dozens of \nformer interns to seek careers in public service. Interns from 10, 20 \nand even 30 years ago stop by frequently just to say hello\n\n[[Page S6010]]\n\nand let Bob know what they are doing now.\n  But Bob's importance to me and my office cannot be captured by simply \ncataloguing his many accomplishments. During his time working in the \nSenate, Bob Foust has been the consummate professional. He stayed in \nconstant touch with North Dakota leaders on the issues he covered. Time \nafter time, he would learn of a problem and immediately go to work \nfinding a solution. If Federal services were not being delivered \neffectively, Bob would work with the agency to make sure North Dakotans \ngot the services they deserved. If a Federal program did not work for \nNorth Dakota, Bob would draft legislation to fix the problem, and work \ntirelessly until the Conrad amendment was signed into law.\n  Finally, and most importantly, Bob Foust is an outstanding person. He \nhas worked quietly and tirelessly behind the scenes to make things \nhappen, and was always happy to divert all the credit to others. He has \nbeen tremendously loyal, tremendously dedicated, and a passionate \nadvocate for the people of my State. He has never forgotten that he is \nworking for the American taxpayer. And he has been a good friend and a \nmentor to others on staff.\n  With extraordinary gratitude for his years of service, I wish Bob \nwell as he moves on to the next stage in his life and career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/26/senate-section/article/S6010-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6010-S6011]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, during the floor debate on the recently \npassed bankruptcy bill, an important letter from a number of medical \nand law professors regarding the high number of debtors who are forced \ninto bankruptcy due to the cost of health care was discussed on \nnumerous occasions. The letter was addressed to Senator Grassley and \npoints out a number of the professors' concerns with the findings of \nthe U.S. Trustee Program related to medical debt.\n  Since it is such a valuable document, it is important that this \nletter be printed in the Record so that all people have access to it. \nMr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                February 14, 2005.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: Thank you for distributing a copy of \n     the letter from the Office of Legislative Affairs with the \n     summary sheet on the medical debt findings from the U.S. \n     Trustee Program. Because each of us has devoted some years of \n     scholarly research to the questions about families in \n     financial trouble because of medical debts, we have been \n     asked to review this letter. We know that you are deeply \n     concerned about the families who file for bankruptcy in the \n     aftermath of a serious medical problem, and we are glad to \n     help in any way we can. We are also very glad that you have \n     encouraged the U.S. Trustee Program to produce additional \n     data related to this issue. Like earlier studies that also \n     used petition and schedule data to explore the role of \n     medical debt in bankruptcy, these data provide further \n     evidence of the large number of families that are facing \n     financial collapse following a serious medical problem. \n     Because of limitations in the data used, however, these \n     findings also significantly underreport both the breadth and \n     impact of medical bankruptcies.\n       The U.S. Trustee sample is limited only to Chapter 7 cases. \n     In part because of time lost from work due to illness, \n     accidents and layoffs, on average, these families have an \n     annual median income of about $19,000. This means that the \n     average medical debt identified by the U.S. Trustee (average \n     $5000 for those with medical debt) is quite substantial for \n     many families trying to cope with medical problems. Earlier \n     reports from the U.S. Trustee's Chapter 7 data and \n     independent studies are consistent with the finding that \n     debts owed directly to medical providers appear in a \n     significant portion of the sampled cases and that the \n     amounts can be quite substantial.\n       As helpful as these data may be, however, we are reminded \n     that they document only a small portion of the financial \n     difficulties facing families in the aftermath of serious \n     medical problems. As early as 1991, researchers recognized \n     that they could not rely on petition and schedule listings to \n     determine the amount of medical debt families incurred. \n     Petition data, like the kind used by the Office of the U.S. \n     Trustee, exclude:\n       Prescription medications, which are charged on credit cards\n       Doctors visits, rehabilitation treatments, and other \n     services charged on credit cards\n       Medical supplies, crutches; needles, and the like that are \n     charged on credit cards\n       Hospital bills that are charged on credit cards\n       Second mortgages that people have put on their homes to pay \n     off hospital bills and other medical expenses\n       Cash advances, bank overdrafts and payday loans that people \n     have incurred to pay for medical services when they are \n     delivered or to pay off medical bills that are outstanding\n       Third party specialty lenders that some hospitals now steer \n     their patients toward when those patients are unable to pay\n       In addition, in our extensive work with court records we \n     have observed that even very sophisticated debtors do not \n     always list the original creditor on an account. Studies are \n     finding high rates of debt collector usage among medical \n     providers, and some collectors may have received assignment \n     of the debt. The petition data, however, necessarily conceal:\n       Medical debts assigned to collectors that may be listed \n     under the collectors' or the collecting attorneys' names, \n     which may bear no medical reference whatsoever.\n       Medical debts for which the debtor has been sued and an \n     attorney is now attempting to collect, for which the debtor \n     lists the name of the attorney\n       The petition data also exclude other expenses that bear \n     down on the families, including:\n       Medical expenses that families struggled to pay off, \n     bankrupting themselves in the process by getting behind in \n     mortgage, car payments, and other necessary expenses.\n       Direct but non-medical expenses of illness or injury, suh \n     as the labor and material costs of building a ramp onto a \n     home to make it wheelchair accessible, or the travel costs \n     associated with transporting a critically ill child to a \n     specialty facility.\n       Debts owed to providers that patients and their families \n     omit from schedules (and thus generally are not discharged) \n     out of fear of losing medical care.\n       Lost income of a sick person (or a caregiver), which may be \n     a major factor in medical-related bankruptcy.\n       Debts for Chapter 13 filers, who were omitted from the U.S. \n     Trustee report, but who also have reported a high rate of \n     medical-related bankruptcy.\n       The petition data also omit data about some of the most \n     pressing questions in health care policy debates. Petition \n     data do not capture systematic information on insurance \n     status, which is relevant to understanding the range of \n     families at risk of health-related financial disaster \n     including but not limited to bankruptcy. Similarly, petition \n     data have no information on the diagnoses of the ill or \n     injured people and the types of care and drugs they need, \n     all of which are relevant to recognizing the magnitude of \n     the problem.\n       Because the petition data provide so little information \n     about medical bankruptcy, experienced empirical researchers \n     in this field have come to realize surveying the debtors \n     themselves is crucial to getting accurate data. The 2001 \n     Consumer Bankruptcy Project study is the most extensive study \n     to date on this issue. It used written questionnaires, court \n     filing data, and detailed follow-up telephone interviews, a \n     combination that offers a much richer understanding of how \n     medical problems affect family finances. The survey \n     instruments were designed to capture more accurately the \n     direct costs of care by asking questions about medical debts \n     within the prior two years of filing, or since illness onset, \n     rather than being focused exclusively on what bills are \n     identifiable as of the date of the bankruptcy petition.\n       When Mr. Moschella listed all the factors considered in the \n     study recently reported in Health Affairs, describing it as \n     using ``very broad definitions'' to describe medical \n     bankruptcies, he did not make it clear that we reported the \n     range of results that reflected inclusion or exclusion of \n     various factors. He thus gave the impression we lumped them \n     all together as ``medical bankruptcies.'' In fact, to \n     accommodate the variety in the ways a ``medical bankruptcy'' \n     might be defined, the recent Health Affairs paper reports a \n     range from 46.2% to 54.5%--for the estimated percentage of \n     bankruptcy filers affected by medical problems based on the \n     2001 study. The calculations of those numbers are explained \n     in detail, and information is available to make other \n     combinations. As the data from additional rounds of follow-up \n     telephone interviews are analyzed, we will be able to offer \n     an even more in-depth picture of these families' financial \n     circumstances and the role of illness or injury.\n       Again, we extend our thanks to you for encouraging the \n     development of additional data relevant to medical-related \n     bankruptcy. We are prepared to assist your office in any way \n     to evaluate these data or to consider policy changes to help \n     families that currently are devastated financially by serious \n     acute or chronic medical problems in their households.\n           Yours truly,\n       Dr. David Himmelstein, Associate Professor of Medicine, \n     Harvard Medical School.\n       Dr. Teresa Sullivan, Professor of Sociology, The University \n     of Texas at Austin, and Executive Vice Chancellor for \n     Academic Affairs, The University of Texas System.\n       Professor Elizabeth Warren, Leo Gottlieb Professor of Law, \n     Harvard Law School.\n       Dr. Steffie Woolhandler, Associate Professor of Medicine, \n     Harvard Medical School.\n       Professor Melissa Jacoby, Associate Professor of Law, \n     School of Law, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n       Dr. Deborah Thorne, Assistant Professor of Sociology, Ohio \n     University.\n\n[[Page S6011]]\n\n       Professor Jay Lawrence Westbrook, Benno C.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nmillions of Americans of Asian and Pacific heritage for their \nsignificant contributions and service to strengthen this great Nation, \nand to join the Nation in celebrating Asian Pacific American Heritage \nMonth.\n  First, I would like to take this opportunity to recall the pioneers \nof Asian Pacific American Heritage Month. Through their vision and \nleadership, Frank Horton, Norman Y. Mineta, Daniel Inouye, and Spark \nMatsunaga successfully empowered Asian and Pacific Islander Americans \nby establishing a period of celebration that recognized the many \ncontributions Asian and Pacific Islanders have made for over a century.\n  They chose May to commemorate Asian Pacific Heritage Month because \nthat is when the first Japanese immigrants came to the United States in \n1843. It is also the anniversary of the completion of the \ntranscontinental railroad in 1869.\n  This year's theme for Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, \n``Liberty and Freedom for All,'' honors the remarkable accomplishments \nAsians and Pacific Islanders from all walks of life have made to their \ncommunities.\n  I want to pay particular tribute to the thousands of Asian Americans \nserving in our armed forces and thank them for their invaluable service \nfor defending our country and securing freedom abroad.\n  The Asian American tradition of U.S. military service can be traced \nback as far as the War of 1812, and our country is grateful for the \nmilitary service of more than 300,000 Asian Pacific American veterans.\n  We are particularly indebted to the famous ``Go for Broke'' 442nd \nregimental combat team of Japanese American soldiers of World War II. \nThe 442nd regiment was the most highly decorated unit in American \nmilitary history--with more than 21 Medal of Honor winners, including \nmy dear colleague, U.S. Senator Inouye.\n  In spite of the discrimination and racism of those tumultuous times, \nthese Asian American service members performed above and beyond the \ncall of duty.\n  I also want to take a moment and honor the memory of one of the Asian \nAmerican community's greatest political leaders and a trusted colleague \nof mine, U.S. Representative Robert Matsui.\n  As a youth, Bob Matsui and his family were interned at Tule Lake Camp \nfor more than three years during World War II, but Bob overcame these \nchallenges to go on and pursue a distinguished career in public \nservice. One of Bob's most significant legacies was his work prompting \nthe U.S. government to make amends with Japanese Americans who were \ninterned during World War II. It was due to Bob's dedication and \nperseverance that the U.S government finally issued a formal apology \nfor the Japanese-American internment program and also provided due \ncompensation to the victims of this policy.\n  In tribute to his outstanding achievements, Senator Boxer and I \nhelped name the Federal courthouse in Bob's hometown of Sacramento in \nhis honor. His work and his legacy will be fondly remembered and he \nserves as a shining example of the extraordinary achievements of Asian \nand Pacific Islander Americans.\n  This year, the Asian American community also saw the passing of the \ncivil rights leader, Fred Korematsu. Mr. Korematsu's defiance of the \nill-conceived Japanese internment policy during World War II was an \nincredibly courageous act. His challenge of the Japanese internment \npolicy made its way to the U.S. Supreme Court, the highest court in the \nland. In recognition of his courageous actions, President Clinton \nawarded Mr. Korematsu the highest civilian honor, the Presidential \nMedal of Freedom, in 1998.\n  Mr. Korematsu and Bob Matsui are testaments to the remarkable display \nof courage, will, and determination of millions of Asian Americans to \nsucceed in our country despite personal hardships and at times, \ndiscrimination.\n  Currently, Asian Pacific Islander Americans constitute one of the \nfastest growing minority communities in the United States, and I am \nproud to recognize the State of California as home to the greatest \nnumber of Asian Pacific Islander Americans. There are over 13 million \nAsian Pacific Islander Americans in the nation with more than 4.5 \nmillion living in California.\n  With this wealth of Asian American diversity, our State is enriched \nby many famous ethnic enclaves such as San Francisco's Chinatown, \nWestminster's Little Saigon, and the City of Artesia's Little India. In \nfact, the second largest populations of Filipino, Korean, and \nVietnamese in the world are located in California.\n  In this congressional session, I am hoping to help preserve some of \nthe unique Asian American immigration history in my State. Senator \nBoxer and I have introduced legislation to help provide Federal funding \nfor the Angel Island Immigration Station, known as the ``Ellis Island \nof the West.''\n  The Angel Island Immigration Station, a national historic landmark, \nwas the entry point for over 1 million immigrants from 1910-1940, \nincluding approximately 175,000 Chinese immigrants. Angel Island is a \nprecious part of our Nation's history and tells the story of many \npeople who came to America to make a better life for their families.\n  As we join the Nation in celebrating the rich and diverse Asian and \nPacific Island cultures during Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, \nwe are not only recognizing many notable achievements, but we are also \nreminded of the struggles and sacrifices endured to live and experience \nthe American dream.\n  I am pleased to take this time today to honor the distinguished \naccomplishments of Asian Pacific Americans during this year's Asian \nPacific American Heritage Month.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/26/senate-section/article/S6011-2", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6011-S6013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n  Mr. GREGG.

NATIONAL FOREST CENTENNIAL MONTH\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of one of our \ngreat national treasures. Next week, while the Senate is in recess, we \nwill celebrate 100 years of the San Juan National Forest in my great \nState of Colorado. The people of southwestern Colorado will be \ncelebrating this anniversary, as they should. I rise to underscore that \nI believe all Americans should celebrate this important milestone.\n  The San Juan National Forest was created 100 years ago on June 3, \n1905, through Presidential proclamation by President Theodore \nRoosevelt. When you see it, you know why President Roosevelt set aside \nthis remarkable place. It is located in southwestern Colorado on the \nwestern slope of the Continental Divide in one of America's most \nmagnificent landscapes. The San Juan covers nearly 2 million acres, in \nan area more than 120 miles wide and 60 miles long. This unique scene \nincludes alpine lakes, canyons, rapids, waterfalls, historic mines, and \nbroad variations in elevation including mountain peaks of over 14,000 \nfeet high.\n  Not only is it beautiful, but its rich history is deeply intertwined \nwith the history of this great country. The San Juan was originally the \nhomeland of the Ute Indians as well as an area that was frequented by \nthe Navajo and Apache Tribes as well. Many pioneers who were looking \nfor routes to the West traveled through the San Juan. Some of these \nindividuals remained there establishing mining sites which contributed \nto development and a growing community.\n  The San Juan National Forest benefits the communities of southwestern \nColorado through the supply of timber, minerals, oil and gas, grazing \npastures, recreation, clean water and air and other natural resources.\n  All of these amenities offered by the San Juan National Forest are \nimportant to the quality of life and economic well being of \nsouthwestern Coloradans; this has been the case for the past 100 years, \nit is the case today, and hopefully will be true for the next 100 \nyears.\n  I urge all citizens of Colorado and our Nation to join in the \ncentennial celebration of the San Juan National Forest through the many \nactivities scheduled for June 1-4, 2005, to celebrate this special \nplace and show appreciation for our national forests.\n  Finally, this year also marks the centennial of the U.S. Forest \nService, the Federal agency which manages the San Juan and 154 other \nNational Forests across our country. I want to thank the dedicated men \nand women of our Forest Service for their extraordinary work and \ncontinued commitment to our precious lands.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/26/senate-section/article/S6013-2", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6013-S6014]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL FOSTER CARE MONTH\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, today I rise to bring your attention to \nNational Foster Care Month. As we celebrate this National Foster Care \nMonth, we must remember how far we have come, we must also remember how \nfar we still have to go. In my 27 years as a public servant, I have had \nthe opportunity to meet thousands of children in foster care. I have \npersonally witnessed the sheer joy they find in having a ``forever \nfamily,'' and the utter pain when they do not. I firmly believe that \nthere is no such thing as an unwanted child, merely unfound families. \nLet me tell you a story about one of these extraordinary children. A \nfew years ago, a young woman named Sarah, who spent 14 of her 19 years \nof life in foster care, was asked by a Member of Congress what the word \n``permanency'' meant to her. She said, ``many people in the system \nwrongly think that permanency means staying in one place for a long \ntime, but to me, permanency means having someone to call when I am not \nsure if I should wash my new white skirt with a blue shirt, or to take \nme to Karate lessons, or to cry with me when I break up with my \nboyfriend.''\n  For those of us who have had that kind of permanency in our lives, \nliving without it seems unfathomable. But the fact remains that each \nyear, over 100,000 children in the United States are dreaming of that \nkind of permanency, 25,000 children leave the foster care system \nwithout ever having found it, and almost 600,000 go to bed every night \nwondering if they ever will find it. Every child deserves the \nopportunity to be in a loving family where they are nurtured, \ncomforted, and protected. Adoption gives children who have been \nabandoned, orphaned, or abused a second chance to find happiness in a \nsecure and supportive family.\n  Over the past decade, the number of children being adopted has risen \ndramatically, and according to the 2000 Census Special Report, over 2 \nmillion children today live in adoptive homes. In the last year alone, \nover 6,500 children have been listed on the web page of Adopt US Kids \nand 1,500 of these children have found families through this process.\n  In closing, I would like to share with you something said in the \naward winning book, There Are No Children Here, about foster care \nchildren. ``By the time they enter adolescence, they have contended \nwith more terror than most of us confront in a lifetime. They have\n\n[[Page S6014]]\n\nhad to make choices that most experienced and educated adults would \nfind difficult. They have lived with fear and witnessed death. Some of \nthem have lashed out. They have joined gangs, sold drugs, and, in some \ncases, inflicted pain on others. But they have played baseball and gone \non dates and shot marbles and kept diaries. For, despite all they have \nseen and done, they are--and we must constantly remind ourselves of \nthis--still children.''\n  During National Foster Care Month, I encourage you to log on to \nwww.adoptuskids.org to learn more about the children who are waiting in \nour country and across the Nation for the safe, loving home they \ndeserve. As Mistral said, ``Many things we need can wait, the child \ncannot. To him we cannot say tomorrow. His name is today.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/26/senate-section/article/S6014-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6014]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RESIGNATION OF FTC COMMISSIONER ORSON SWINDLE\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, after over 7 years of service, Orson \nSwindle announced today his resignation as Commissioner of the Federal \nTrade Commission. Mr. Swindle has been dedicated to protecting the \ninterests of the American consumer by promoting competition and \nfairness in the marketplace. He will be sorely missed.\n  Mr. Swindle's accomplishments at the FTC have been numerous, but his \nefforts to promote the vigorous development of the Internet and \ntechnology generally have been particularly important to our Nation's \neconomy. His service with the Commission started shortly after the \nbirth of electronic commerce, and it was thanks in part to Mr. \nSwindle's efforts to keep the Internet free of over-regulation that it \nis now such a robust and widely-used medium of communication, commerce, \neducation, and political participation. All the while, Mr. Swindle has \nfocused his efforts on educating consumers about the new online world \nin order to build their confidence in and knowledge of the Internet. He \nhas also ensured that industry understands the need to self-regulate \neffectively or face the credible threat of Government interference and \naggressive enforcement.\n  I commend Mr. Swindle and thank him for his outstanding service to \nthis country, and I deeply hope that he will continue to build on his \nlong and distinguished career as a public servant. Our Nation benefits \ngreatly from the work of individuals such as Orson Swindle, whom I am \nproud to call my friend. He stands as an example for us all of \ncommitment, achievement, and sacrifice on behalf of our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/26/senate-section/article/S6014-2", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6014-S6015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    THE NATIONAL ALL SCHEDULES PRESCRIPTION ELECTRONIC REPORTING ACT\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I take a moment to bring attention to an \nimportant step that was taken yesterday in the Senate Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions. On Wednesday morning, the HELP \nCommittee unanimously passed S. 518, the National All Schedules \nPrescription Electronic Reporting Act, a bill designed to help states \ncombat the growing scourge of prescription drug abuse and diversion.\n  I begin by thanking Senator Enzi, our chairman, for his excellent \nsupport in bringing this bill, the National All Schedules Prescription \nElectronic Reporting Act, before the committee for consideration. I \nalso thank and commend the bill's original cosponsors, Senators \nKennedy, Durbin, and Dodd, and their staffs, for contributing to the \nproductive, bipartisan process of developing this legislation.\n  The abuse and diversion of prescription drugs is a tremendous public \nhealth issue for our nation, and a growing one. An epidemic that first \nattracted public notice as a regional crisis has now spread to touch \nevery kind of community, from major cities to the smallest rural \nhamlet. Prescription drugs now rank second only to marijuana in the \nincidence of abuse. Over 31 million American adults and adolescents \nhave, at one time, abused pain relievers, and the number of first-time \nabusers has increased 336 percent since 1990.\n  As appalling as the numbers are, we can not permit them to obscure \nthe human tragedy of drug abuse and dependence, or the toll that drug \ndiversion takes on communities. In the case of individuals who become \naddicted to prescription medications, the addicted too often fall from \nthe productive ranks of society into unemployment, disability, \nhospitalization, or even death. They may be drawn into criminal \nactivities that lead to incarceration. Their families and communities \nsuffer along with them. Those who engage in drug diversion feed an \ninsidious black market that makes dangerous drugs available to \nchildren, as well as adults. On a societal level, taxpayers bear much \nof the expense of abused or illegally diverted drugs, and, \nsubsequently, of treating the medical consequences of misuse and \naddiction.\n  I find particularly concerning the recent Partnership for a Drug-Free \nAmerica finding that prescription medications are emerging as the most \nrapidly growing category of drugs abused by America's teenagers. \nAccording to this national study, released April 21st, approximately \none in five teenagers--that is over 4 million kids nationally--has \nabused prescription painkillers, and 37 percent report that close \nfriends have done so. Another 10 percent of teens have abused \nprescription stimulants, such as Ritalin. Surveys show that this dismal \npattern is driven by, according to teens' own assessment, ease of \naccess.\n  The establishment, by the states, of programs to monitor \nprescriptions for controlled substances can help curb inappropriate, \nillegal access to these potentially dangerous drugs. At the present \ntime, 20 states have operating prescription drug monitoring programs. \nIn general, monitoring programs collect, from dispensers, a basic set \nof information on prescriptions that are issued for controlled \nsubstances. In the most effective programs, providers, including \nphysicians and pharmacists, may request the prescription histories of \ntheir patients, permitting them to avoid providing controlled \nsubstances to ``doctor shoppers'' seeking multiple prescriptions to \nfeed addiction or for diversion to the black market.\n  These monitoring programs, appropriately designed, not only help \nhealthcare providers to better deliver appropriate, effective treatment \nof pain and other conditions that require the use of ``scheduled'' \ndrugs, but also provide an important tool that permits doctors to \nidentify and, if appropriate, refer for treatment patients whose \nprescription history suggests that they are at high risk of addiction.\n  In addition, they offer an opportunity to repair the physician-\npatient relationship in the face of a growing addiction problem that \nhas created an atmosphere in which physicians fear that prescribing \n``high risk'' medications could inadvertently injure patients or lead \nto civil or criminal liability or professional discipline. This \nsituation has created yet another class of victims, patients who are \nfinding it too difficult to obtain timely, effective treatment for pain \nand other legitimate medical needs. Much to their credit, physicians \nhave recognized the tremendous potential here and have been the leading \nadvocates for national legislation supporting the broader adoption of \nwell-designed prescription drug monitoring programs.\n  I would like to particularly commend the American Society of \nInterventional Pain Physicians, and Dr. Laxmaiah Manchikanti, their \nCEO, for the tremendous effort they have put forth to educate members \nand the public regarding the need for this legislation. ASIPP has, in \nrecent days, been joined in their strong advocacy for the NASPER bill \nby the American Society of Anesthesiology and the American Osteopathic \nAssociation, and I expect that others will soon follow. Those \nphysicians who have stepped forward to advocate for a balanced and \neffective solution to this problem are truly acting in a manner \nconsistent with the highest ideals of the medical profession.\n  The bill we are considering today, National All Schedules \nPrescription Electronic Reporting Act, establishes a federal grant \nprogram, to be administered by the Department of Health and Human \nServices, that would support both the creation of new state programs \nand the improvement of existing ones. Participating programs would be \ndesigned according to a ``best practices'' model, and would adopt \napplicable health information technology standards.\n  It also addresses the important barriers that continue to hamper the \nfull\n\n[[Page S6015]]\n\nrealization of these programs' potential: the fact that there are not \nenough of them, and in a time when patients regularly cross state lines \nseeking treatment, existing program can not yet effectively share \ninformation across state lines.\n  This bill provides states with the resources and guidance they need \nto make important progress toward minimizing the abuse and diversion of \nprescription medications while ensuring patients' access to timely, \neffective treatment, and I urge you to join us in supporting it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/26/senate-section/article/S6015-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              NINTH ANNUAL WORLD CONGRESS IN AMMAN, JORDAN\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, next week, from June 2-6, 2005, the \nCenter for Civic Education will host the Ninth Annual World Congress on \nCivic Education in Amman, Jordan. Nearly 200 civic education leaders \nwill attend this event, representing 58 countries and 28 U.S. States.\n  The purpose of the World Congress is to share information about the \nbest practices and materials developed through Civitas: An \nInternational Civic Education Exchange Program, an authorized program \nof the No Child Left Behind Act. The program addresses the full range \nof civic education activities. These include the development of \neducational policy, standards, curricular frameworks, and materials, as \nwell as teacher education, classroom implementation, and research and \nevaluation.\n  One program developed through Civitas is Project Citizen, a middle \nschool level program on public policy in the United States. Project \nCitizen is now being used in more than fifty countries, and is one of \nthe most effective programs in promoting the development of a political \nculture supportive of democratic values, principles, institutions, and \nparticipation.\n  Another important component of Civitas is the series of exchanges \namong leaders in civic education in the United States and those in \nemerging and established democracies worldwide. The purpose of the \nexchanges is for civic education leaders to learn from and assist each \nother in improving education for democracy in their home nations.\n  Therefore, I think it is an important step that for the first time \nthe World Congress on Civic Education will be hosted in the Middle \nEast. Joining the Center for Civic Education in hosting this year's \nWorld Congress is Arab Civitas--a regional network of nine Arab \ncountries in the Middle East--and the Jordanian Center for Civic \nEducation Studies.\n  Arab Civitas, which is funded through the Middle East Partnership \nInitiative at the State Department, administers a program of \ncitizenship education in elementary and secondary schools in the Middle \nEast. Civic educators in Jordan, Egypt, the West Bank, Lebanon, \nTunisia, Morocco, Algeria, Yemen, Bahrain, and recently Saudi Arabia, \nwork with the Center for Civic Education through Arab Civitas. The goal \nof the program is to help students understand and respect the core \nconcepts of freedom and democracy such as free expression, pluralism \nand the rule of law, and human rights.\n  As the chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations \nSubcommittee on Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs, it is my strong \nbelief that many of the conflicts and problems in the world, and \nparticularly in the Middle East, could be lessened by strong \ninvestments in education. I am particularly supportive of education \nprograms which seek to improve tolerance and understanding of others. \nThus, the theme of this year's congress is of particular interest to \nme: Advancing Peace and Stability through Active Citizenship.\n  Mr. President, I think we can all agree that this is exciting work \nthat the Center for Civic Education is accomplishing. Its work in \nstrengthening democracy, and promoting tolerance and moderation, in the \nUnited States and throughout the world, is admirable. I hope and expect \nthe attendees will have a successful Ninth Annual World Congress on \nCivic Education.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/26/senate-section/article/S6015-2", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             DEAF WEST THEATER PRODUCTION OF ``BIG RIVER''\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I recently had the pleasure of \nattending a truly unique theater production at Ford's Theater--a \nproduction that is a testament to the Positive impact of Federal \nfunding of the arts. The Deaf West Theater production of Big River: The \nAdventures of Huckleberry Finn, in conjunction with the Roundabout \nTheater Company and the Mark Taper Forum, utilizes American Sign \nLanguage and a cast of hearing and deaf actors working seamlessly \ntogether to, tell this classic Mark Twain story. The exceptional \nquality of this production was recognized with a 2004 Tony Honor for \nExcellence in the Theater.\n  This production of Big River is a superb example of how the \nperforming arts can lead by example, in this case, by offering a \ndramatic example of people who bridge the gap between the deaf and \nhearing communities. Deaf and hearing actors are an integral part of \nthe show. Deaf and hearing audiences have an equal opportunity to enjoy \nthe production. And the perspective of deaf culture is seamlessly \nintegrated into the performance.\n  Federal funding was critical in achieving these important goals. \nAuthorization for grant funding of deaf theater has been in Federal \nlaw, in one form or another, since 1967. In the case of the current \nproduction of Big River, grants from the U.S. Department of Education's \nOffice of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services supported the \ntraining of deaf actors in the show, allowed the production to reach \nnational audiences through touring, and helped to fund educational \noutreach.\n  I understand that our distinguished majority leader, Senator Frist, \nrecently saw the production, and was as dazzled by it as I was. So I \nencourage all of our colleagues, their families, and staffs to go see \nBig River, which will be at Ford's Theater until June 4. And I also \nencourage my colleagues to join with me in working to restore funding \nto keep Deaf West's work alive for audiences in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/26/senate-section/article/S6015-3", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6015-S6016]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HONORING NEW IBERIA MAIN STREET\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, today I rise to honor a city from \nmy home State of Louisiana and am delighted to recognize its \nachievement before this body.\n  The City of New Iberia, LA, was recently selected by The National \nTrust for Historic Preservation to receive a 2005 Great American Main \nStreet Award. New Iberia won this prestigious award because of its \nsuccessful downtown revitalization. In addition to being recognized as \none of only five winning communities nationwide, New Iberia is the only \ncommunity in Louisiana to ever receive this distinction. As a champion \nof sustainable and quality community development, I can personally \nattest to this well-deserved honor. New Iberia's Main Street creates a \nunique sense of place through the beauty of its architecture, \nlandscaping, and natural integration with Bayou Teche. The residents of \nNew Iberia identify with this special place, and it contributes to the \nquality of life and sense of community pride shared by them.\n  Founded in 1779, New Iberia was a prosperous antebellum community \nthat matured into a modern city. By the mid 1960s, New Iberia's Main \nStreet began experiencing decline typical of many communities in the \nUnited States at that time. Recognizing the role of Main Street in the \nlife of a community, New Iberia's business leaders, elected officials, \nand citizens started a progressive downtown revitalization effort known \nas Operation Impact in the early 1970s. This focus on Main Street \ncontinued, and in the 1990s, New Iberia further enhanced its efforts by \ninitiating an officially designated Main Street Program. The unified \ncommitment, hard work, and enthusiasm of the people of New Iberia over \nnearly 40 years has reestablished their downtown as a vibrant nucleus \nof culture, commerce, and tourism. It has also fittingly earned them \nnational acclaim.\n  In the few years since the Main Street Program began in New Iberia, \nthe city has seen over 115 new businesses established, over 420 new \njobs created, and more than $19 million in private investment with \ntotal investment exceeding $24 million.\n\n[[Page S6016]]\n\n  Downtown development and Main Street revitalization efforts have \ncontributed significantly to building safer communities, stronger \neconomies, and better quality of life across America. New Iberia, LA, \nis a superb example of how these cooperative efforts can improve \ncommunities. Today, I give the people of New Iberia my thanks and \npraise.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/26/senate-section/article/S6016-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6016]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nRECOGNITION OF THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ORDINATION OF REV. MONSIGNOR \n                          STANLEY E. MILEWSKI\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to call my colleagues' \nattention to plans to honor a distinguished religious leader in \nMichigan, Monsignor Stanley Milewski. Monsignor Milewski will be \nhonored at a special service of thanksgiving followed by a dinner \nreception on Sunday, June 5, 2005, on the St. Mary's Orchard Lake \nSchools campus. The tribute will mark his 50th anniversary as a Polish-\nAmerican diocesan priest.\n  Since his ordination into the priesthood on June 4, 1955, by Cardinal \nEdward Mooney in Detroit, Monsignor Milewski has been an important part \nof the history of the Polish pastoral ministry in Michigan and in the \nUnited States. Monsignor Milewski has earned the respect and admiration \nof people throughout Michigan and across the United States, and is \nespecially admired by the approximately three-quarters of a million \npeople of Polish descent who are part of the Archdiocese of Detroit, \nbecause of his devotion to service and confident leadership through \nyears of ministry.\n  Born in Detroit to Polish immigrants on November 30, 1929, Monsignor \nMilewski received his primary and secondary education in Catholic \nparochial schools in Detroit. He earned his undergraduate degree from \nSt. Mary's College of Orchard Lake and completed graduate studies at \nSt. John's Provincial Seminary in Plymouth, MI, and at SS. Cyril and \nMethodius Seminary in Orchard Lake. SS. Cyril and Methodius Seminary \nenjoys the distinction of being the only Polish seminary in the United \nStates and was founded in Detroit in 1885. Monsignor Milewski was \nawarded an honorary doctorate degree from Alliance College in \nPennsylvania and an honorary doctorate of theology degree from Madonna \nUniversity in Livonia, MI. He was later appointed to the faculty of the \nOrchard Lake Schools in January 1957, and his responsibilities have \nincluded procurator-treasurer, teacher, athletic director, and vice \nrector. He served as chancellor of the Lake Orchard Schools from 1977 \nto 2000.\n  Monsignor Milewski's appointments include the Prelate of Honor of His \nHoliness John Paul II on March 20, 1990, Honorary Canon of the Diocese \nof Plock, and Honorary Canon of the Diocese of Lomza. In addition to \nthe many recognitions and awards he has received, Monsignor Milewski \nwas honored to have the Pope visit the 120-acre Orchard Lake Schools \ncampus in 1969. Of that visit, Monsignor said, ``From that point on, I \nreally got to know what a great man he was and what a tremendous memory \nhe had.'' He recalls how the Pope once remarked that the seminary at \nOrchard Lakes was the most beautiful Polish seminary in the world. The \ncampus includes the John Paul II center, a museum of artifacts and \nphotos.\n  I know my colleagues join me in congratulating Monsignor Milewski on \nhis faithfulness to his calling and on his many achievements in the \npastoral ministry. I am pleased to express my sincere appreciation to \nhim on his 50th anniversary and to wish him many more years of good \nhealth and happiness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/26/senate-section/article/S6016-2", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6016]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO CHARLIE WALKER\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to pay tribute today to an \noutstanding public servant, educator, and communicator, Charlie Walker. \nCharlie is retiring after a distinguished 40-year career in teaching \nand government service at the local, State and Federal levels, most \nrecently as director of government affairs for the Baltimore District, \nU.S. Army Corps of Engineers. I extend my personal congratulations and \nthanks for his many years of dedicated service and contributions to the \nAmerican people.\n  Born in Charleston, WV, Charlie spent much of his youth and career in \nBaltimore, MD. He was a graduate of Clifton Park Junior High and \nBaltimore's City College, one of the oldest and finest public high \nschools in the country. He won scholarships to Towson State Teachers \nCollege, now Towson University, where he excelled academically and in \nhis extracurricular activities, selected to serve not only as president \nof the Phi Alpha Theta Honorary Society in history but also as a \nmanager of three sports teams--soccer, wrestling, and track. Upon \ngraduation in 1963, Charlie taught for 3 years in Baltimore's secondary \nschools and then enrolled in West Virginia University to earn a \nmaster's degree in history. In 1966, Charlie enlisted in the U.S. Army \nand served for a 3-year period in Vietnam and at the Walter Reed Army \nMedical Center. He returned to West Virginia University to obtain a \nPh.D. in history, and worked in various and progressively responsible \npositions in local, State and Federal Government, including service as \nan historian and public affairs officer with the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers, an aide to the mayor of Baltimore and a research analyst \nwith the Library of Congress.\n  In 1987, Charlie Walker was tapped to lead the public affairs office \nof the newly established Maryland Department of the Environment, and it \nwas in this position that I first had the opportunity and privilege of \nworking closely with Charlie. A highly skilled communicator and \nmanager, Charlie assembled a terrific team to promote the initiatives \nof the new department and to protect and restore the quality of \nMaryland's air, water, and land resources. Charlie and his team set a \nstandard for outreach and responsiveness that few, if any, agencies \nhave been able to match. He served in this position until 1991 when he \nwas recruited, as government affairs officer for the Baltimore \nDistrict, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, to help the district restore \nrelations and responsiveness with the Congress and other levels of \ngovernment. Over the past 14 years, Charlie has been a trusted adviser \nto six district engineers, and the principal point of contact for \nMembers of Congress and our staffs from the Five States and the \nDistrict of Columbia, which encompass the Baltimore District's \njurisdiction.\n  With his in-depth knowledge, political astuteness, and a dedication \nto public service that is second to none, Charlie has remained a \nconstant force in moving the Army Corps of Engineers' programs and \nservices forward. He is well known, widely respected, and well liked, \nnot only among the staff at the Baltimore District but throughout the \nU.S. Army Corps of Engineers and beyond. He is the core of the Corps. \nHis advice is constantly sought for improving communications and \nrelations with the press, the public and with elected officials at all \nlevels of government. Over the years, he has inspired great loyalty in \nthe members of the Baltimore District staff and affection from the \ncountless others with whom he has worked. He will be sorely missed by \nthose of us who have had the pleasure of working with him.\n  Throughout the course of his career, Charlie has received numerous \nhonors including the Commander's Award for Civil Service, Governor's \nSalute to Excellence Award, and the Maryland Department of the \nEnvironment Award for Outstanding Public Service. In addition to his \npublic service, Charlie has volunteered a great deal of time and energy \nserving on the numerous organizations, including the Phi Alpha Theta \nHistory Society, the Society of American Military Engineers, and the \nBaltimore Council on Foreign Affairs.\n  It is my firm conviction that public service and teaching are among \nthe most honorable callings. They demand the very best, most dedicated \nefforts of those who have the opportunity to serve their fellow \ncitizens. Throughout his career Charlie Walker has exemplified a \nsteadfast commitment to meeting this demand. I want to extend my \npersonal congratulations and thanks for his many years of hard work and \ndedication and wish him well in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/26/senate-section/article/S6016-3", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6016-S6017]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO JESSIE HALE DOWNS\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Today, with a great sense of honor and respect, \nI rise to pay tribute to Mrs. Jessie Hale Downs for\n\n[[Page S6017]]\n\nher humane and charitable service to the city of Birmingham, AL.\n  In 1944, Mrs. Hale and her husband, Jimmie Hale, cofounded the \nDowntown Jimmie Hale Mission in Birmingham. These two individuals \nfounded this mission to help rescue scores of individuals from \nhomelessness and addiction. On November 17, 1944, Jimmie Hale died, \nleaving his young wife widowed and expecting their first daughter in \nJanuary of 1945.\n  The death of her husband left her with nothing, so Mrs. Hale was \ntaken in by a friend, and 2 months later she gave birth to a daughter. \nLater, Jessie married a man who had been aided by the Jimmie Hale \nMission, Joe Downs. Unfortunately, he never overcame his addiction and \nafter 2\\1/2\\ years of marriage and the birth of a daughter, he left the \nfamily.\n  Nevertheless, Jessie Hale Downs remained resolve in her dedication to \nthe Jimmie Hale Mission, and she refused to let her late husband's \ndream die. Mrs. Downs is gifted with a great sense of leadership and a \nspirit of love for humanity. She served as the executive director of \nthe Mission for 46 years and even today travels to churches and civic \nmeetings to share the story of the Jimmie Hale Mission and what they \nhave to offer.\n  Because of her unwavering dedication to the Mission, which began as a \nlone storefront chapel ministering to the men on the streets of \ndowntown Birmingham, the Mission has now expanded into a six-facility, \nholistic-approach ministry in central Alabama committed to helping \npeople break the chains of addiction and homelessness.\n  While Jimmie Hale envisioned the ministry, Jessie Hale Downs saw the \nMission to fruition. Now, at the age of 88, Mrs. Downs is the matriarch \nand heartbeat of the Jimmie Hale Mission. I would like to offer thanks \nfor a life lived to serve the less fortunate. The community of \nBirmingham and the State of Alabama are better off because Mrs. Jessie \nHale Downs has lived among us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/26/senate-section/article/S6017-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6017]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        STANDING SOUTH DAKOTANS\n\n Mr. THUNE.

Mr. President, I pay tribute and congratulate Mr. \nMatth Toebben of Northern Kentucky, who was recently honored with one \nof the ``Movers and Shakers'' awards for the Greater Cincinnati area. \nMr. Toebben's life accomplishments and dedication to Commonwealth of \nKentucky have given me reason to be proud.\n  I believe Mr. Toebben to be the embodiment of the American Dream. \nAfter immigrating to the United States from Borger, Germany in 1953 \nwith only $10 to his name, he used all of his money to buy a train \nticket to Cincinnati. Upon arrival in the area, Mr. Toebben took up not \nonly one job, but two jobs as a carpenter for a Ft. Wright home builder \nin Northern Kentucky. He worked both night and day saving as much money \nas he could. This quickly paid off and by 1955, only 2 years after his \narrival to the United States, Mr. Toebben started his own business, \nToebben Builders and Developers.\n  The ``Movers and Shakers'' award of Northern Kentucky is an annual \naward presented to honor those within the Greater Cincinnati region who \nstand as an example for all. It is presented by the Kentucky Enquirer, \nthe Sales and Marketing Council of Northern Kentucky, The Home Builders \nAssociation of Northern Kentucky and The Kentucky Post.\n  As a Senator from Kentucky, I commend Mr. Toebben for his hard work \nand dedication. I hope that he will serve as an inspiration to the \ncitizens of Kentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/26/senate-section/article/S6017-3", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6017]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/26/senate-section/article/S6017-4", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6017]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/26/senate-section/article/S6017-5", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6017]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:34 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2566.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nauthorizing replenishment of funds to three of the five multilateral \ndevelopment banks, as requested by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. \nIn addition, this legislation includes a long list of reform measures, \nintended to bring about transparency and accountability at all of the \nMDBs--the World Bank, the African Development Bank, the Asian Bank, the \nInter-American Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and \nDevelopment.\n  The World Bank, was the first MDB to be established in 1944, followed \nby the African Development Bank, 1964 and the Asian Development Bank, \n1966. The shared original purpose of the three banks was to encourage \neconomic development and reduce poverty in geographic regions impacted \nby the respective institutions.\n  I support the original operating purpose of the banks. However, I am \ndeeply concerned that massive amounts of funds are not utilized as \noriginally intended, due to diversion of those funds.\n  In 2003, I received information from credible sources within the MDBs \nalleging corruption on various fronts. As a result, I instructed staff \nof the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to commence collecting \ninformation on the anti-corruption strategies, and successes of each \nbank.\n  Based on the initial findings, I launched an investigation, reviewing \ncorruption at the banks and their efforts to combat it. To date, I have \nchaired four hearings and sent letters of inquiry regarding individual \nprojects to the bank presidents. Committee staff have interviewed \nscores of NGO representatives, bank insiders, academics and others, and \nhave visited problem projects in six countries. Far too often, projects \nintended to boost economic development are derailed, and the poor \nsuffer, unable to realize projected benefits in quality health care, \nclean water and education.\n  While the United States is one of dozens of donors, the financial \ncontribution of American taxpayers over the years to these three \ninstitutions alone\n\n[[Page S6024]]\n\nexceeds $30 billion. The Congress has an obligation to our own \ncitizens, as well as the intended beneficiaries of MDB projects, to \npress for transparency and accountability in the banks' operations.\n  Through adoption of the package of reforms I propose, the United \nStates would set an example for other donor countries, encouraging \ntheir officials to also press for transparency and accountability.\n  I am pleased there is good news to report. The World Bank has \nembarked on an anti-corruption voluntary cooperation initiative, based \nin part on the Pentagon's anticorruption efforts. In addition, leading \ngovernment officials from Italy, Spain and other countries have \ncontacted the Committee, asking for more information about our review, \nand comparing strategies on ways of improving bank transparency. \nFinally, we have witnessed incremental improvements of greater \ntransparency among the banks as a result of the Committee's ongoing \nwork.\n  However, there is more to accomplish. This substantive package of \nreforms is based on our findings to date, and the input of many who \nsupport the original stated purpose of the multilateral development \nbanks.\n  The Committee's oversight work continues, with the goal of enduring \nresults.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1129\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Development Bank Reform and \n     Authorization Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States has strong national security and \n     humanitarian interests in alleviating poverty and promoting \n     development around the world.\n       (2) The World Bank, the African Development Bank, the Asian \n     Development Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and \n     Development, and the Inter-American Development Bank leverage \n     the resources that the United States and other donors can \n     devote to such goals.\n       (3) Contributions from the United States and other donors \n     to the multilateral development banks must be well managed so \n     that the mission of such banks is fully realized and not \n     undermined by corruption. Bribes can influence important bank \n     decisions on projects and contractors and misuse of funds can \n     inflate project costs, cause projects to fail, and undermine \n     development effectiveness.\n       (4) Officials of the World Bank have identified corruption \n     as the single greatest obstacle to economic and social \n     development. Corruption undermines development by distorting \n     the rule of law and weakening the institutional foundation on \n     which economic growth depends.\n       (5) Officials of the World Bank have determined that the \n     harmful effects of corruption are especially severe on the \n     poor, who are hardest hit by economic decline, are most \n     reliant on the provision of public services, and are least \n     capable of paying the extra costs associated with bribery, \n     fraud, and the misappropriation of economic privileges.\n       (6) In hearings before the Foreign Relations Committee of \n     the Senate, it was demonstrated that--\n       (A) significant multilateral development bank funding has \n     been lost to corruption and it is difficult to ascertain such \n     amount precisely, in part because the multilateral \n     development banks have not implemented procedures to \n     calculate such amounts, either in the aggregate or on a \n     country basis;\n       (B) the multilateral development banks are taking action to \n     address fraud and corruption but additional measures remain \n     to be carried out;\n       (C) the capability of anti-corruption mechanisms are not \n     consistent among the multilateral development banks and \n     divergences in anti-corruption policies exist that may hinder \n     coordination on fighting corruption;\n       (D) weaknesses in whistleblower policy and practice exist \n     at the multilateral development banks, to varying degree, \n     that impede anti-fraud and anti-corruption efforts;\n       (E) greater transparency is necessary to provide effective \n     development aid;\n       (F) the Secretary of the Treasury encourages anti-\n     corruption efforts at the multilateral development banks and \n     reviews loans made by such banks, however, the United States \n     has limited ability to investigate the misuse of funds from \n     such banks; and\n       (G) in some cases, the countries bearing the cost of \n     prosecuting corruption related to the multilateral \n     development banks are the countries that can least afford \n     such costs, for example, the Government of Lesotho incurred \n     considerable expense, despite competing priorities, such as \n     those arising from an HIV/AIDS rate of more than 25 percent \n     in that country, to investigate and prosecute fraud and \n     corruption related to a project that received funding from \n     the World Bank and the World Bank did not contribute money \n     towards the prosecution or investigation.\n       (7) The General Accounting Office issued a report in 2001 \n     that evaluated the external audit reporting of the African \n     Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the European \n     Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the Inter-\n     American Development Bank and a report in 2000 that evaluated \n     the internal controls of the World Bank, and recommended \n     measures to strengthen such audit reporting and controls.\n       (8) The International Financial Institutions Advisory \n     Commission (also known as the ``Meltzer Commission'') \n     concluded in 2000, among other things, that--\n       (A) pressure to lend for lending's sake is built into the \n     structure of the multilateral development banks;\n       (B) although several of the multilateral development banks \n     recognize this problem and have called attention to the need \n     for change, there is, at most, weak counterbalance to the \n     pressure to lend; and\n       (C) the multilateral development banks' systems for project \n     evaluation, performance evaluation, and project selection \n     must be improved, and that such evaluation should be a \n     repetitive process spread over time, including many years \n     after final disbursement of funds.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to authorize the exchange of certain Federal land \nwithin the State of Idaho, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Idaho Land \nEnhancement Act of 2005. Simply put, this legislation directs the \nSecretaries of Agriculture and Interior to exchange land with the State \nof Idaho involving key parcels of land from the Boise Foothills to \nNorth Idaho.\n  The proposed exchange is exceptional in many respects. First, the \nconcept for the proposed land exchange originated from a local \nconservation effort led by the city of Boise and local conservation \ngroups including the Idaho Conservation League. Since the late 1960's \nthe issue of conserving the Boise Foothills has been a significant \nconcern of the community. Conservation efforts have continued to grow \nin support within the community, culminating in May 2001 with the \ncitizens of Boise, in one of the highest voter turnouts in city \nhistory, electing to tax themselves in order to provide funding to \nsecure permanent public open space in the Boise Foothills.\n\n[[Page S6028]]\n\n  Next, the collaboration between the city of Boise, the State of \nIdaho, the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management has \nproduced an agreement that has yielded a proposal benefiting the \nState's endowment beneficiaries while addressing the common threats of \nfire and hazardous fuels, invasive species, habitat fragmentation and \nunmanaged recreation associated with urban interface with Federal \nlands. The proposal uses both Bureau of Land Management and Forest \nService land to balance an exchange with Idaho State Endowment lands on \nan equal value basis.\n  Last, the process has been open, transparent, and has wide support \nthroughout the State. The city of Boise has facilitated public \nmeetings, provided opportunities for public comment, and has made the \nmaps of the exchange available to the public. The City has met with all \nof the affected tribes and counties. In addition, the multi-agency \ngroup completed evaluations of timber values, minerals, cultural \nresources, water rights, legal access, wildlife, fisheries, vegetation, \nhydrology, wetlands, threatened and endangered species, and specific \nhabitat. The evaluations show that no major environmental effect will \noccur as a result of the exchange. In fact, The Nature Conservancy \nindependently reviewed the data and compared it to their eco-regional \nplanning efforts and concluded that the exchange has ``limited \npotential to impact biodiversity values'' and they support the \nexchange.\n  The city of Boise has made a substantial investment of local property \ntax dollars in the facilitation of this land exchange package. This \nexchange will complete a statewide collaborative process that \nrepresents a legacy of local, State and Federal cooperation benefiting \nland management interests throughout the State.\n  This exchange will enhance land in both the northern and southern \nparts of the State. It is an example of how local, State, and Federal \npartners can come together to collaboratively develop an exchange in \nwhich the public and the land are the ultimate beneficiaries.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COLEMAN (for himself, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. DeWine, Ms. Snowe, \n        Mr. Cochran, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Bayh, and Mr. Smith):\n  S. 1132. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act, the Employee \nRetirement Income Security Act of 1974, and the Internal Revenue Code \nof 1986 to require that group and individual health insurance coverage \nand group health plans provide coverage for treatment of a minor \nchild's congenital or developmental deformity or disorder due to \ntrauma, infection, tumor, or disease; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to be introducing the \nbipartisan Treatment of Children's Deformities Act. I am pleased to be \njoined by many of my friends and colleagues, including Senators \nLandrieu, DeWine, Snowe, Cochran, Vitter and Bayh.\n  Imagine being a parent with a child who has a cleft lip and palate or \nanother more severe congenital facial deformity that requires \nreconstructive surgery to achieve a sense of normalcy and function. Now \nimagine receiving a letter from your insurance carrier that states the \nfollowing:\n\n       The reviewer determined that although the procedures listed \n     above would enhance the appearance of the patient, the \n     procedures listed are not necessary to correct a functional \n     disorder and therefore do not meet the criteria for benefits \n     as outlined in the medical plan.\n\n  Unfortunately, there are numerous examples of children and families \naround the country that have been confronted with this kind of heart \nwrenching situation. Examples of congenital deformities include cleft \nlip, cleft palate, skin lesions, vascular anomalies, malformations of \nthe ear, hand, or foot, and other more profound craniofacial \ndeformities. It is essential for children with these problems to \nreceive timely surgical care in order to have a chance at leading \nnormal, healthy, happy lives. And yet, an increasing number of kids go \nwithout life changing treatment because treatment is regarded as \n``cosmetic'' or ``non-functional.''\n  It's unfortunate that legislation is necessary. However, this \nlegislation will ensure that children who are born with a congenital \ndeformity--whether a cleft lip and palate or a more severe deformity--\nreceive the reconstructive surgery they need to achieve a sense of \nnormalcy and function.\n  According to the March of Dimes, 150,000 newborns suffer from birth \ndefects each year. Of the 150,000 born, approximately 50,000 require \nreconstructive surgery. Although surgeons are able to correct many of \nthese problems, an increasing number of these children are denied \naccess to care by the labeling of the procedures as ``cosmetic'' or \n``non-functional'' in nature.\n  A common Federal definition of reconstructive surgery, based on the \nAmerican Medical Association's definition, will help clarify coverage \nnationally and reduce the delay for children in need of surgery.\n  It is essential for children with these problems to receive timely \nsurgical care in order to have a chance at leading normal, healthy, and \nhappy lives. Also, many times these surgeries are best performed while \nchildren are young and their bodies can more readily recover and \nrespond to the corrective surgery.\n  The Treatment of Children's Deformities Act differentiates between \ncosmetic and reconstructive surgery.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of Energy to develop and \nimplement an accelerated research, development, and demonstration \nprogram for advanced clean coal technologies for use in coal-based \ngeneration facilities and to provide financial incentives to encourage \nthe early commercial deployment of advanced clean coal technologies \nthrough the retrofitting, repowering, replacement, and new construction \nof coal-based electricity generating facilities and industrial \ngasification facilities; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, today I am introducing S. 1133, the Clean \nCoal Research, Development, Demonstration, and Deployment Act of 2005. \nI am proud to have Senators Rockefeller and Specter as cosponsors of my \nbill. This comprehensive clean coal technology legislation will help \nprovide for a new era for coal. I have looked into the past; I \nrecognize the enormous challenges that are before us; and I see coal's \nfuture.\n  The bill authorizes important programs at the Department of Energy as\n\n[[Page S6030]]\n\nwell as provides a major package of targeted federal energy tax \nincentives. It supports a research and development program and tax \nincentives to encourage the use of advanced coal technologies at coal-\nfired power plants. The bill also promotes a major investment in a \nnational industrial gasification program. It is a balanced and \nfinancially sound proposal, and it recognizes that there are new \nhorizons opening for coal.\n  The Byrd-Rockefeller-Specter bill works to balance these ever \nexpanding opportunities in a very reasonable and responsible way. We \nmust move forward with the development and deployment of advanced power \ngeneration and carbon capture and sequestration technologies. Coal also \nhas a future in producing chemicals, alternative transportation fuels, \nand other important products for use in the economy. My legislation can \nbegin to initiate that effort.\n  There are those who have wanted to push coal aside like stove wood \nand horse power as novelties from a bygone era. But we cannot ignore \ncoal as part of the solution to our future energy challenges. Over the \npast several years, I have been diligently assembling a set of \nproposals that can provide a comprehensive approach for the near- and \nlong-term viability for coal, both at home and abroad. It is time that \nwe reexamine the opportunities for coal, and let the past be our guide \nto the future.\n  Mr. President, I hope other Senators will review S. 1133, and I urge \nthem to cosponsor this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BENNETT (for himself and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 1135. A bill to authorize the exchange of certain land in Grand \nand Uintah Counties, Utah, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am pleased to be able to re-introduce \nthe Utah Recreational Land Exchange Act of 2005, together with my \ncolleague Senator Hatch. Legislation was introduced in the previous \nCongress to lay the groundwork for our efforts in the 109th Congress.\n  This legislation will ensure the protection of critical lands along \nthe Colorado River corridor in southeastern Utah and will help provide \nimportant funding for Utah's school children. In Utah we treasure the \neducation of our children. A key component of our education system is \nthe 3.5 million acres of school trust lands scattered throughout the \nState. These lands are dedicated to the support of public education. \nRevenue from Utah school trust lands, whether from grazing, forestry, \nsurface leasing or mineral development, is placed in the State School \nFund. This fund is a permanent income producing endowment created by \nCongress upon statehood to fund public education. Unfortunately, the \nmajority of these lands are trapped within federal ownership patterns \nthat make it impossible for responsible development. It is critical to \nboth the State of Utah and the Bureau of Land Management, BLM, that we \nconsolidate their respective lands to ensure that both public agencies \nare permitted to fulfill their mandates.\n  The legislation we are introducing today is yet another chapter in \nour State's long history of consolidating these State lands for the \nfinancial well being of our education system. These efforts serve a \ndual purpose as they help the Federal land management agencies to \nconsolidate Federal lands in environmentally sensitive areas that can \nthen be reasonably managed. We see this exchange as a win-win solution \nfor the State of Utah and its school children, as well as the \nDepartment of the Interior as the caretaker of our public lands.\n  Beginning in 1998 Congress passed the first major Utah school trust \nland exchange which consolidated hundreds of thousands of acres. Again \nin 2000, Congress enacted an exchange consolidating another 100,000 \nacres. I was proud to playa role in those efforts, and the bill we are \nintroducing today is yet another step in the longjoumey toward giving \nthe school children the deal they were promised in 1896 when Utah was \nadmitted to the Union.\n  The School Trust of Utah currently owns some of the most spectacular \nlands in America, located along the Colorado River in southeastern \nUtah. This legislation will ensure that places like Westwater Canyon of \nthe Colorado River, the world famous Kokopelli and Slickrock biking \ntrails, some of the largest natural rock arches in the United States, \nwilderness study areas, and viewsheds for Arches National Park will be \ntraded into Federal ownership and for the benefit of future \ngenerations. At the same time, the school children of Utah will receive \nmineral and development lands that are not environmentally sensitive, \nin locations where responsible development makes sense. This will be an \nequal value exchange, with approximately 40,000 acres exchanged on \neither side, with both taxpayers and the school children of Utah \nreceiving a fair deal. Moreover, the legislation establishes a \nvaluation process that is transparent to the public, yet will ensure \nthe exchange process occurs in a timely manner.\n  This legislation represents a truly collaborative process. We have \nconvened all of the players to give us input into this legislation: \nlocal government, the State, the recreation community, the \nenvironmental community and other interested parties. At the same time \nwe are working closely with the Department of Interior. We introduced \nthis bill in the 108th Congress in order to initiate some discussion of \nmoving forward with this exchange proposal. Since that time, some \nchanges have been made in an effort to improve this legislation. We \nremain receptive to additional changes that might make further \nimprovements. The State has been working with all of these groups over \nthe past year at a grass-roots level to address concerns. We look \nforward to working with the appropriate committees and the Department \nof Interior toward a successful resolution of this proposed exchange.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support our efforts to fund the \neducation of our children in Utah and to protect some of this Nation's \ntruly great lands. I urge support of the Utah Recreational Land \nExchange Act of 2005.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. McCain, and Mr. Allen):\n  S. 1137. A bill to include dehydroepiandrosterone as an anabolic \nsteroid; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, recently, the problem of steroid abuse \nhas been getting a great deal of media attention. While this publicity \nhas helped to raise public awareness about the dangers of illegal \nsteroids, recent studies indicate that more and more young people are \ntaking these drugs to improve their performance, appearance, or self \nimage. In fact, some recent studies indicate that as many as 5 percent \nto 7 percent of students, even as young as middle school, admit to \nusing illegal steroids.\n  Even more widespread among adolescents, however, is the use of over-\nthe-counter supplements. Many young people are turning to \n``supplements'' as an alternative to illegal steroids, mistakenly \nbelieving that because they are sold over the counter, they must be \nsafe. However, many of these over the counter ``supplements'' actually \nproduce the same dangerous effects on the body as illegal steroids. \nSome, even become steroids in the bloodstream.\n  Last year, the President signed into law the Anabolic Steroid Control \nAct of 2004, which added 18 anabolic steroid precursors to the list of \nanabolic steroids that are classified as controlled substances. Yet as \nI speak, on the shelves of health stores across the country, sits one \nanabolic steroid that can be bought by anyone, at any age, without the \nneed of a doctor's prescription.\n  Dehydroepiandrosterone, or DHEA, is an anabolic steroid that once \ningested, the body turns into testosterone. DHEA like all other \nsteroids, may cause a number of long term physical and psychological \neffects, including: heart disease, cancer, stroke, liver damage, severe \nacne, baldness, dramatic mood swings, aggression etc. In fact, DHEA is \nalready banned by the Olympics, the World Anti-Doping Agency, the \nNational Collegiate Athletic Association, the National Football League, \nthe National Basketball Association, and Minor League Baseball, yet it \nactually enjoys special protections under the Anabolic Steroid Control \nAct.\n  In an effort to keep all potentially dangerous steroids out of the \nhands of unsuspecting consumers and children, I am pleased to introduce \nlegislation\n\n[[Page S6031]]\n\ntoday that would add DHEA to the list of controlled substances under \nthe Anabolic Steroid Control Act. This legislation will eliminate the \nspecial exemption granted to DHEA, thereby treating it as every other \nsubstance in the steroid family.\n  With the dramatic rise in the use of steroids among our nation's \nyouth, now is the time to act to curb this increasingly growing \nproblem. Just like all other anabolic steroids, DHEA should not be \navailable over the counter, but only under a doctor's supervision. I \nencourage my colleagues to join in support of this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1137\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. INCLUSION OF DEHYDROEPIANDROSTERONE.\n\n       Section 102(41)(A) of the Controlled Substances Act (21 \n     U.S.C. 802(41)(A)) is amended--\n       (1) in the matter preceding clause (i), by striking \n     ``corticosteroids, and dehydroepiandrosterone'' and inserting \n     ``and corticosteroids'';\n       (2) by redesignating clauses (x) through (xlx) as clauses \n     (xi) through (xlxi), respectively; and\n       (3) by inserting after clause (ix) the following:\n       ``(x) dehydroepiandrosterone (androst-5-en-3b-ol-17-\n     one);''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM:\n  S. 1139. A bill to amend the Animal Welfare Act to strengthen the \nability of the Secretary of Agriculture to regulate the pet industry; \nto the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Pet Animal \nWelfare Statute of 2005 (PAWS). The introduction of this important \nanimal welfare legislation demonstrates my continued interest in humane \ntreatment of animals. As the proud owner of a German Shepherd, it is \ndisturbing to see the number of high volume breeders who are careless \nand disregard their responsibilities to care properly for their \nanimals.\n  Across the United States, there are more than 3,000 commercial dog-\nbreeding facilities that are licensed to operate by the United States \nDepartment of Agriculture (USDA). Owners of these facilities are \nrequired to comply with the rules and regulations of the Animal Welfare \nAct (AWA), which sets forth standards for humane handling and \ntreatment. USDA inspections are also required to ensure compliance with \nAWA standards.\n  Unfortunately, enforcement of AWA has not effectively stopped the \ninhumane treatment of animals within the pet industry. Because the AWA \nonly covers breeders and others who sell at wholesale, many puppy mill \nowners have successfully avoided AWA requirements by selling directly \nto the public. The ability to use the Internet as a marketing tool for \ndirect sales has only made selling directly to the public more \nprevalent and popular. Because USDA can only regulate wholesalers under \nthe AWA, it has very limited authority to oversee the care and \nconditions of animals in these facilities.\n  PAWS addresses this growing problem. PAWS would regulate breeders who \nraise seven or more litters of dogs or cats each year. This threshold \ntest would differentiate those breeders who raise animals in mass \nnumbers from those who are hobby breeders.\n  In addition, this broad ranging legislation would cover importers and \nother non-breeder dealers who sell more than 25 dogs or cats per year, \nstrengthen USDA's enforcement authority, and assure USDA access to \nsource records of persons who acquire dogs for resale. Finally, PAWS \nexpands the USDA's authority to seek injunctions against unlicensed dog \nand cat dealers.\n  The term ``puppy mill'' is not new to many people, be it pet owners, \nconsumers, animal welfare advocates, inspectors or just casual \nobservers. Puppy mills are large breeding operations that mass-produce \npuppies for commercial sale with little regard for the humane handling \nand treatment of the dogs. Breeding and raising dogs without respect to \nthe animal's welfare guarantees bad results for the unknowing owner, \nand for the health of the dog and her puppies. For dogs, puppy mill \nconditions can mean overcrowded cages, lack of protection from weather \nconditions, and an overall lack of veterinary care.\n  The benefits of regulating commercial breeders and sellers are \nobvious. PAWS addresses the commerce in pets from many different \nangles, including imports, large direct sellers, Internet sellers, \nenforcement tools, and source records. As a member of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee and Chairman of the Subcommittee on Research, \nNutrition and General Legislation, the subcommittee with jurisdiction, \nI am prepared to work aggressively to advance this legislation. I urge \nmy colleagues to join Senator Durbin and me in supporting this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Pet Animal \nWelfare Statute, PAWS, along with my colleague, Senator Santorum.\n  For more than three decades, Congress has given the responsibility of \nensuring minimum standards of humane care and treatment of animals to \nthe U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA, under the Animal Welfare Act, \nAWA.\n  The current guidelines within the AWA do not go far enough to protect \npuppies at large breeding facilities; they merely ensure the provision \nof water and food, and that is inadequate. The AWA has been largely \nineffective because of weak enforcement procedures and limited \nresources. Another severe limitation of the current AWA is that it does \nnot regulate overseas breeders who submit their animals to deplorable \nconditions before exporting them to the United States, leaving many \nimported animals with diseases and behavioral disorders. PAWS \nstrengthens the AWA to better control the practices of puppy breeding \nin large facilities, addresses cruel puppy treatment and places \nstricter regulations on overseas breeders.\n  In large breeding facilities, puppies are often kept in cramped, \ndirty cages; sometimes stacked on top of each other; exposed to the \nelements in extreme cold and heat; forced to breed too frequently; and \ndeprived of adequate food, water, veterinary care, and any semblance of \nloving contact. In fact, current law allows many of these breeders to \nevade all federal oversight.\n  This inhumane treatment has a direct bearing on the physical and \nmental health of dogs in these facilities. Often, after these puppies \njoin a family, they turn out to have serious health and behavioral \nproblems that cause them pain, cause their owners great distress, and \nrequire expensive medical care.\n  I believe PAWS will address these problems by filling gaps in the \ncurrent law and encouraging stronger enforcement by USDA to crack down \non chronic violators. The bill also applies to cats.\n  PAWS requires that any commercial hreeder who sells seven or more \nlitters of dogs or cats directly to the public in a year must be \nlicensed by the USDA. The statute also allows the USDA to obtain the \nidentity of breeders, a measure that would help the USDA to address \ninhumane treatment. PAWS extends the suspension period for facilities \nwith AWA violations from 21 days to 60 days and provides the USDA with \ndirect authority to apply for injunctions.\n  I've heard from many of my constituents in Illinois who are deeply \nconcerned about the puppy mill problem and want this legislation \nenacted. PAWS is supported by national organizations, including the \nHumane Society of the United States, the American Kennel Club, Doris \nDay Animal League, and the Animal Welfare Institute.\n  I am pleased that we have obtained additional funds for USDA to \nimprove its enforcement of the AWA. This piece of legislation will \ncomplement those ongoing efforts by strengthening USDA's authority to \ncrack down on the bad actors.\n  PAWS will ensure that any commercial dog breeder licensed by the \nFederal Government is meeting basic humane standards of care. We owe at \nleast this much to the animals that have earned the title ``man's best \nfriend.'' This safety net for dogs and cats will protect pets and the \nconsumers who care about them against the poor treatment practices of \nthe worst dealers: the ones who provide no\n\n[[Page S6032]]\n\ninteraction; the ones who violate industry norms against over-breeding; \nthe ones who repeatedly violate the law governing humane care. The good \ndealers, however, should be recognized for the value they bring to pet \nlovers everywhere.\n  Currently, the good dealers suffer at the hands of the bad ones, the \nones who give the industry a bad reputation. This bill will help draw a \nclear distinction in favor of the good dealers. I thank my colleagues \nfor their attention to this issue, and I urge their support for the Pet \nAnimal Welfare Statute.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COCHRAN (for himself, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Chambliss, and Mr. \n        Roberts):\n  S. 1141. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Homeland Security to \nregulate ammonium nitrate; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, fertilizers provide essential nutrients \nto the food we eat. Without fertilizer, roughly one-third of the \nworld's people would go hungry. Ammonium nitrate fertilizer is an \neffective source of nitrogen that all crops need to grow. Thousands of \nAmerican farmers value its use in certain applications including cool \nweather fertilization and other low-till cropping systems. Thus, the \ncontinued availability of ammonium nitrate fertilizer to U.S. farmers \nhas economic, agronomic and environmental benefits to farmers and \nsociety as a whole.\n  At the same time, the April 1995 attack on the Alfred P. Murrah \nFederal Building in Oklahoma City showed America that this highly \nvaluable fertilizer can be subject to adulteration and misuse by \ncriminals intent on engaging in acts of terror.\n  After the Oklahoma City tragedy, Congress enacted legislation calling \nfor a study on the feasibility and practicability of imposing controls \non certain precursor chemicals, including ammonium nitrate. Congress \nrecognized that it is simply not possible for the agriculture community \nto guarantee against the criminal misuse of ammonium nitrate or for any \ncommunity to guarantee that the thousands of everyday products that can \nbe converted to criminal use will not be misused by those with the \nintent and capability to do so.\n  Over the past 10 years, the security landscape has continued to \nchange. The agriculture community and the fertilizer industry recognize \nthat more needs to be done to strengthen the controls regarding the \nhandling and purchase of ammonium nitrate fertilizer in order to ensure \nAmerican farmers continue to have access to this valued input. Today, \nwith my colleague from Arkansas Mr. Pryor, my colleague from Georgia \nMr. Chambliss, and my colleague from Kansas Mr. Roberts, I am pleased \nto introduce legislation that provides a practical and workable \nsolution to enhance the secure handling of ammonium nitrate ensuring \nthat ammonium nitrate remains available for agricultural use.\n  The legislation is entitled ``The Secure Handling of Ammonium Nitrate \nAct of 2005.'' It calls for Federal and State cooperation to secure \nammonium nitrate fertilizer. It requires any person who produces, \nstores, sells, or distributes ammonium nitrate to register their \nfacility with their State department of agriculture and to maintain \nrecords of sales or distribution of the product. Additionally, it \nrequires all purchasers of ammonium nitrate to register with their \nState department of agriculture.\n  We believe these requirements are necessary measures to help provide \nadditional security for ammonium nitrate fertilizer and will not unduly \nburden agriculture professionals or farmers who use ammonium nitrate. \nFurthermore, we believe this important legislation will effectively \nenhance ongoing security measures and help to keep ammonium nitrate out \nof the hands of those who wish to harm our Nation.\n  I urge Senators to support this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1141\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Secure Handling of Ammonium \n     Nitrate Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

STATE LAW PREEMPTION.\n\n       This Act preempts any State law (including a regulation) \n     that regulates the handling of ammonium nitrate to prevent \n     the misappropriation or use of ammonium nitrate in violation \n     of law.\n\n     SEC. 9. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as are \n     necessary to carry out this Act.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I stand today in support of legislation \nthat will better protect our homeland by securing the trade and \nhandling of ammonium nitrate. While ammonium nitrate is well known in \nthe agriculture community to be an important fertilizer, it has also \nbecome a common ingredient in creating highly explosive bombs like the \none used in the unforgettable April 1995 bombing attack of the Alfred \nP. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. A little more \nthan a month ago, we reflected on the tenth anniversary of this tragic \nmoment in our nation's history. Despite the enormous potential for \nmisuse if in the wrong hands, the purchase and use of ammonium nitrate \nis still largely unregulated by the federal government. It is our hope \nthat we can reduce this potential for misuse. By better securing the \ntrade and handling of this chemical, we will make it more difficult for \nindividuals and groups to misuse the chemical and threaten the lives of \nAmericans. The purpose of our legislation is to protect our homeland \nfrom future threats and attacks that may be similar in nature to that \nof the Oklahoma City Bombing while still ensuring that law abiding \ncitizens can use this valuable fertilizer for agricultural activities.\n  Fertilizer provides essential nutrients to the food we eat by \nproviding an effective source of nitrogen that all crops need to grow. \nI recognize the importance of fertilizer to our Nation's farming \ncommunity, and that is why I believe that we must continue the \navailability of ammonium nitrate fertilizer to farmers in order to \nmaintain the economic, agronomic and environmental benefits that this \nproduct provides. I also understand the negative impact of that \nfertilizer can have on our people if misused by criminals intent on \nengaging in acts of terror.\n  Since the 1995 Oklahoma City tragedy, many studies have been \nconducted by the Federal Government to determine the feasibility and \npracticability of imposing controls on certain precursor chemicals, \nincluding ammonium nitrate. In addition, the fertilizer industry and \nthe Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) created the \n``America's Security Begins with You'' ammonium nitrate security \ncampaign in 1995 as an effort to minimize possible misuse of ammonium \nnitrate fertilizer. These studies and campaigns have both led to show \nthat it is impossible for the agricultural community to guarantee \nagainst the criminal misuse of ammonium nitrate under current laws and \nregulations and that more can and should be done to protect against \nthis threat.\n  The agricultural community and the fertilizer industry both recognize \nthat more can and should be done to strengthen the controls regarding \nthe handling and purchase of ammonium nitrate fertilizer in order to \nensure American farmers continue to have access to this valued input. I \nbelieve that the Federal government must do its part in helping to \nassure that ammonium nitrate fertilizer stays in the hands of \nagricultural professionals and encourage all who handle this chemical \nto protect their community and America by establishing effective \nsecurity measures.\n  I am proud to join my colleague from Mississippi, Senator Cochran, in \nintroducing this legislation along with Senator Chambliss and Senator \nRoberts. I believe it provides a very practical and workable solution \nto enhance the secure handling of ammonium nitrate and ensure that \nammonium nitrate remains available for agricultural use. ``The Secure \nHandling of Ammonium Nitrate Act of 2005'' calls for a federal and \nstate cooperation to secure ammonium nitrate fertilizer. It requires \nthe Department of Homeland Security to enter into cooperative \nagreements with state departments of agriculture to ensure that any \nperson who produces, stores, sells, or distributes ammonium nitrate \nregisters their facility and maintains records of sales or distribution \nof the product. As such, purchasers of ammonium nitrate would also be \nrequired to register with their state's department of agriculture.\n\n  My colleagues and I agree that these requirements are necessary \nmeasures that provide additional security for ammonium nitrate \nfertilizer and will not unduly burden agriculture professionals or \nfarmers who use this product. Furthermore, we firmly believe that this \nlegislation will effectively enhance ongoing security measures by \nhelping to keep ammonium nitrate out of the hands of those who wish to \nharm our Nation.\n  I thank the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, as well as the\n\n[[Page S6034]]\n\nChairmen of the Agriculture and Intelligence Committees for their \nleadership on this issue, and I urge my colleagues in the Senate to \nsupport this important legislation.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I would like to echo the comments of \nthe senior Senator from Mississippi regarding the ``Secure Handling of \nAmmonium Nitrate Act of 2005.'' The importance of ammonium nitrate \nfertilizer to the agricultural industry cannot be understated. However, \nits use in acts of terror has led the industry and public alike \nsearching for a way to further secure the handling and use of ammonium \nnitrate. I believe this legislation accomplishes that goal. If passed, \nthis bill will help us to track both where this fertilizer is, and who \nis in possession of it. The answers to both of these very important \nquestions will further ongoing efforts to keep our Nation safe from \npeople who may wish to do it harm. I feel this legislation provides \nadditional security for ammonium nitrate while maintaining its \nviability as an agricultural fertilizer.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself, Mr. Graham, Mr. Allen, Mr. Durbin, \n        and Mr. Lautenberg):\n  S. 1142. A bill to provide pay protection for members of the Reserve \nand the National Guard, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, over 50 years ago, Sir Winston Churchill \nuttered the immortal words, ``never in the field of human conflict has \nso much been owed by so many to so few.'' Although Prime Minister \nChurchill was referring to the selfless and courageous effort of the \nRoyal Air Force in their defeat of the Germans in World War II, I would \nlike to argue that these words apply equally to the men and women \nfighting to preserve democracy in Iraq and Afghanistan. These men and \nwomen are not only making it possible for each and every one of us to \ngo about our daily lives under the blanket of safety and freedom to \nwhich Americans have become accustomed, but they are also striving to \nbring these benefits to people who have never had them before.\n  If you have had the opportunity to spend time with these men and \nwomen, as I have, you quickly observe that they embody everything good \nabout America. Their patriotism, their unyielding commitment to serve \ntheir country, their selflessness and their sacrifice should serve as \nexamples to us all. Perhaps what amazes me most, is that although these \nmen and women are prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice for their \ncountry, they ask for little in return from it. It is therefore \nincumbent on us to recognize the debt we owe to them, and honor it.\n  Today there are 80,000 members of the National Guard and our Reserve \narmed forces serving bravely in the war on terror. In addition, close \nto 89,000 members of the Guard and Reserve have been activated in \nanticipation of being sent to Iraq, Afghanistan, or any other place \ntheir country calls on them to serve. While deployed, these citizen \nsoldiers are asked, in a moment's notice, to leave their families, \ntheir jobs, and their communities behind, causing tremendous stress on \nthe home front and in the workplace.\n  While having a loved one in harm's way is reason for stress alone, \nmany of the families of these men and women have the added stress of \ntrying to fill the void left. Many families have lost the main bread \nwinner when a Guardsmen or Reservist gets deployed. As a result, they \nhave trouble paying bills, the rent, the mortgage, or medicine for \ntheir children.\n  The primary reason these families cannot make ends meet is because \nfor Guardsmen and Reservists military pay is often less than civilian \npay. We call that the ``pay gap.'' According to the most recent Status \nof Forces Survey of Reserve Components, 51 percent of our citizen \nsoldiers take a pay cut when they get deployed and 11 percent of them \nlose more than $2,500 per month.\n  We ask these men and women to make so many sacrifices on our behalf. \nI think that it is time that we be willing to make one in return. The \nleast we can do is to help these families find relief from the \nfinancial woes caused by this gap. To help do this, my colleagues \nSenator Graham, Senator Allen, Senator Durbin, and myself are pleased \nto introduce the Helping Our Patriotic Employers at Helping our \nMilitary Employees Act of 2005. We call the bill by its nickname: HOPE \nat HOME. Our guard and reserve families have enough to worry about when \na loved one gets called away, the least we can do is relieve some of \nthe financial worry by encouraging employers to make up the pay gap. \nLet me describe for my colleagues how this legislation works.\n\n  HOPE at HOME will give a 50 percent tax credit to the thousands of \nemployers around the country who have taken the patriotic step of \ncontinuing to pay the salary of their guard and reservists employees \nwho have been called to active duty. There are literally thousands of \nemployers out there who already take this noble step--they do it \nvoluntarily, selflessly and at great sacrifice. The HOPE at HOME Act \nhonors that sacrifice.\n  HOPE at HOME will also encourage companies that cannot afford to make \nup the pay-gap an incentive to do it. One survey found that only 173 of \nthe Fortune 500 companies make up the pay gap. If the wealthiest \ncompanies cannot afford to help their active duty employees, imagine \nhow difficult this is for smaller companies. HOPE at HOME will allow \ncompanies large and small to do the patriotic thing and reward those \nemployees who are serving to keep us all free.\n  HOPE at HOME will also give small patriotic employers additional tax \nrelief if they need to hire a worker to temporarily replace the active \nduty Guardsmen or Reservist. In addition, the bill clarifies the tax \ntreatment of any pay-gap payments to make income tax filing easier for \nour Guard and Reservists.\n  A moment ago, I mentioned that thousands of employers make up the \npay-gap for their employees. There is one employer, however, and it \nhappens to be the Nation's largest, that does not make up the pay gap: \nUncle Sam. The Federal Government, which should set the bar for \npatriotism in our country, does not do its part to help citizen \nsoldiers. Senator Durbin has been a leader in this area, so our bill \nincludes language that he has been fighting to require the Federal \nGovernment to make up the pay gap. We cannot ask the private sector to \ndo more than they are doing if the Federal Government is not willing to \nstep up and do its part for our military men and women.\n  This is not only the right thing to do, it is the smart thing to do. \nToday our Nation relies on the Guard and Reserve to meet our armed \nforces needs more than at any other time in our history. At times in \nthe war on terror, forty-percent of our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan \nwere citizen soldiers. Many of them performed multiple tours of duty or \nfound their duties extended.\n  All of the experts tell us that our need for our Guard and Reserve \ntroops will only get greater. In the post-Cold War world, we have \ndrastically reduced our standing Army from 800,000 in 1989 to \napproximately 482,000 today, a 40 percent decrease. The number of \ndeployments has increased by over 300 percent. The Guard and Reserve \nhave made it possible to meet these challenges. We still find ourselves \nstretched thin, but without the Guard and Reserve we would never be \nable to meet our obligation as guardians of freedom in the World.\n  But this over-reliance on the Guard and Reserve is starting to have a \ntoll on our ability to recruit and retain these men and women. The \npercentage of Army Reserve personnel who plan to remain in the military \nafter their tour of duty ends fell from 73 percent to 66 percent over \n2004. The top reasons for leaving the Guard and Reserve, according to \nthe Status of Forces Survey of Reserve Components, are family stress, \nthe number and lengths of deployments, income loss, and conflict with \ncivilian employment.\n  We are beginning to have recruitment problems as well for our \nstanding military. Back in February, the Army and the National Guard \nand Reserve recruited 3,824 soldiers, but this was only 69 percent of \ntheir monthly goal. The numbers went up in March, but still fell short \nby 12 percent of the goal.\n  HOPE at HOME recognizes that a soldier who is worrying about how his \nor her family is paying the bills is not focusing on the mission at \nhand. A soldier who is worrying about whether the family is paying the \nrent, is not going\n\n[[Page S6035]]\n\nto reenlist. And every time one of our soldiers leaves, our Nation \nloses the experience and service of a highly trained, capable \nprofessional. We need to make every effort to keep our citizen soldiers \nin service to their country. HOPE at HOME is a first step to addressing \nour military's larger recruitment and retention issues.\n  During the Cold War we built our strength on having the biggest, best \nequipped standing army in the World. Now our military gathers its \nstrength from a large reserve of qualified men and women in the Guard \nand Reserve who are ready to fight at a moment's call. We will lose \nthat strength if we do not give our Guardsmen and Reservists and their \nfamilies HOPE at HOME.\n  I hope my colleagues will join Senators Allen, Graham, Durbin and \nmyself in supporting the HOPE at HOME Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1142\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide Federal assistance to States and local \njurisdictions to prosecute hate crimes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, hate crimes are a violation of everything \nour country stands for. They send the poisonous message that some \nAmericans deserve to be victimized solely because of who they are. \nThey're basically acts of domestic terrorism. Hate crimes have an \nimpact far greater than the impact on their individual victim. They're \ncrimes against entire communities, against the whole Nation, and \nagainst the fundamental ideals on which America was founded.\n  The vast majority of Congress agrees. Last year, Senator Smith and I \noffered the same measure. The Senate passed it as an amendment to the \nDefense Authorization Bill by a nearly 2-1 bi-partisan vote of 65-33. \nBy a vote of 213-186, the House instructed its conferees to support it \nin the conference report on the bill. Unfortunately, House leaders \ninsisted that the provision be dropped in conference. This week, \nSenator Smith and I are introducing the identical bill.\n  The provision is supported by a broad coalition of law enforcement \nand civil rights groups, including the National Sheriff's Association, \nthe International Association of Chiefs of Police, the Anti-Defamation \nLeague, and the National Center for Victims of Crime, and I'm \noptimistic the bill would have the same broad support it did before. \nThose who commit hate crimes prey on the vulnerable and terrorize them, \nbecause they can't protect themselves. If our Nation stands for \nanything, it's to protect the vulnerable.\n  We know that hate crimes are a serious problem that continues to \nplague us. According to FBI statistics, over 9,000 people were victims \nof hate crimes reported in the United States in 2003. That's almost 25 \npeople victimized a day, every day, based on their race, religion, \nsexual orientation, ethnic background, or disability. Sadly, these \nF.B.I. statistics show only part of the problem, because many hate \ncrimes go unreported. The Southern Poverty Law Center, a nonprofit \norganization that monitors hate groups and extremist activity, \nestimates that the actual number of hate crimes committed in the United \nStates each year is closer to 50,000.\n  Congress can't ignore the problem. Our bill will strengthen the \nability of Federal, State, and local governments to investigate and \nprosecute these vicious and senseless crimes. Current Federal law, \nobviously isn't adequate to protect our citizens.\n  It contains excessive restrictions requiring proof that victims were \nattacked because they were engaged in certain ``federally protected \nactivities.'' It doesn't include violence committed because of person's \nsexual orientation, gender, or disability. It covers only hate crimes \nbased on race, religion, or ethnic background.\n  The federally protected activity requirement is outdated, unwise, and \nunnecessary. In June 2003, three men saw 6 Latino teenagers in a family \nrestaurant on Long Island. The teenagers, 3 boys and 3 girls, between \n13-15 years old, knew each other from church and baseball teams. They \nwere there together to celebrate the birthday of one of the girls, \nwhose parents made her take her 13 year old sister along as \n``chaperone.'' A parent dropped them all off in his mini-van and \npromised to pick them up after dinner and a movie. But, moments after \nleaving, he received a panicked phone call from one of the children, \ntelling him they'd been attacked.\n  As the group entered the restaurant, three men were leaving the bar, \nafter drinking there for hours. For no apparent reason, they assaulted \nthe teenagers, pummeling one boy and severing a tendon in his hand with \na sharp weapon. During the attack, the men screamed racial slurs and \none identified himself as a skinhead. The children, who had never \nexperienced anything like this, have been traumatized ever since.\n  Two of the defendants were tried under current Federal law for \ncommitting a hate crime and were acquitted. The Jurors said they \nacquitted them because the government had not proved the attack took \nplace because the victims were engaged in a federally protected \nactivity--using the restaurant.\n  The bill we introduce today eliminates the federally protected \nactivity requirement. Under this bill, these defendants who walked out \nof the front door of the courthouse free that day would almost \ncertainly have left in handcuffs through a different door.\n  The bill also recognizes that hate crimes are committed against \npeople because of their sexual orientation, their gender, and their \ndisability. Current Federal law didn't protect gay campers in Honolulu \nfrom attempted murder when their tents were doused\n\n[[Page S6038]]\n\nwith a flammable liquid and set on fire because they were gay.\n  It didn't protect Brandon Teena, in Humboldt, NE who was raped and \nbeaten by two male friends when they discovered that he was living as a \nmale but was anatomically female. The local sheriff refused to arrest \nthe offenders, and they later shot and stabbed Brandon to death.\n  Current law did not protect a 23-year-old mentally disabled man in \nPort Monmouth, New Jersey who was kidnapped by 9 men and women and \ntortured for three hours before being dumped in the woods because he \nwas disabled.\n  Our bill will close all these flagrant loopholes. In addition to \nremoving the federally protected activity requirement and expanding the \nclass of protected people:\n  The bill protects State interests with a strict certification \nprocedure that requires the Federal Government to consult with local \nofficials before bringing a Federal case.\n  It offers Federal assistance to help State and local law enforcement \ninvestigate and prosecute hate crimes in any of the categories.\n  It offers training grants for local law enforcement.\n  It amends the Federal Hate Crime Statistics Act to add gender to the \nexisting categories of race, religion, ethnic background, sexual \norientation, and disability.\n  A strong Federal role in prosecuting hate crimes is essential for \npractical and symbolic reasons. In practical terms, the bill will have \na real world impact on actual criminal investigations and prosecutions \nby State and Federal officials.\n  The presence or absence of the ``federally protected activity'' \nrequirement frequently determines whether state and local resources \nmust be used to prosecute these crimes or whether the Federal \nGovernment can bring its full weight to bear on the case.\n  Hate crime investigations tend to be expensive, requiring \nconsiderable law enforcement legwork and extensive use of investigative \ngrand juries. State officials regularly seek federal assistance in \nbringing hate crime offenders to justice under current law. This bill \nexpands the opportunity for the Justice Department to provide that \nsupport.\n  Our bill fully respects the primary role of State and local law \nenforcement in responding to violent crime. The vast majority of hate \ncrimes will continue to be prosecuted at the state and local level. The \nbill authorizes the Justice Department to assist state and local \nauthorities in hate crimes cases, it authorizes Federal prosecutions \nonly when a State does not have jurisdiction, or when it asks the \nFederal Government to take jurisdiction, or when it fails to act \nagainst hate-motivated violence.\n  In other words, the bill establishes an appropriate back-up for State \nand local law enforcement to deal with hate crimes in cases where \nstates request assistance, or cases that would not otherwise be \neffectively investigated and prosecuted.\n  The symbolic value of the bill is equally important. Hate crimes \ntarget whole communities, not just individuals. They are intended to \nsend messages of fear that extend beyond the moment and beyond the \nindividual victim of the attack. Attacking people because they are gay, \nor African-American, or Jewish, or any other criteria in the bill is \nbigotry at its worst. Hate crimes are designed to de-humanize and \ndiminish, and we must say loud and clear to those inclined to commit \nthem that they'll go to prison if they do.\n  The vast majority of us in Congress recognized the importance of \nmaking that statement last year. This year, we can make the statement \neven louder, by turning this bill into law.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, as I have done so many times before, I rise \ntoday to speak about the need for hate crimes legislation and to \nintroduce the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act of 2005. I first \nsponsored this bill with my colleague, Senator Kennedy, in 1999 and \nagain in 2001 and 2003.\n  In the Senate, this legislation passed as an amendment to the \nCommerce, Justice, State appropriations bill in 1999 and the Defense \nDepartment authorization bill in 2000 and 2004, but removed in \nconference in each case. In 2003, it was introduced as an amendment to \nthe Foreign Relations Authorization Act, but did not pass due to a \nprocedural vote. Clearly, hate crimes legislation has strong support in \nthe Senate.\n  Senator Kennedy and I are reintroducing this bill again today because \nthe need for Federal hate crimes legislation is greater than ever. The \nhigh prevalence of hate crimes is staggering. Every day there is \nanother America that is attacked or even murdered in an act solely \nmotivated by hate.\n  Hate crimes tear at the very fabric of our Nation by intimidating \nentire groups of Americans and creating fear across communities. No one \nin America should be victimized because of who they are, how they look, \nor what religion they worship. And the Federal Government should be \nable to come to the aid of those who have been wronged and protect \nvictims.\n  Since 1969, Federal law has permitted prosecution of hate crimes \nmotivated by race, religion, national origin, or color, if the victim \nwas engaging in one of six ``Federally protected'' activities. It has \nbecome clear that the statue needs to be amended--and that is what our \nlegislation does. Our legislation would expand on current laws to \nencompass sexual orientation, gender and disability. It would enable \nFederal prosecutors to pursue hate crimes cases where local authorities \noften lack the resources or the ability to prosecute such crimes.\n  Nobel laureate Eli Wiesel once said: ``To hate is to deny another \nperson's humanity.'' As a Nation that serves as the beacon of justice, \nfreedom and liberty everywhere, we simply cannot tolerate violence \nagainst our own citizens based on their race, color, religion, or \nnational origin. No matter how far the United States has come and the \nprogress we have made in protecting American's civil rights, much work \nremains. We cannot fight terror abroad and bow down to terror at home.\n  This legislation is a symbol that can become substance. As I have \noften said, the law is a teacher, and we should teach our fellow \nAmericans that bigotry will not be tolerated. Our government must have \nthe ability to persuade, to pursue, and to prosecute when hate is the \nmotive of violence against another American, no matter their race, \nsexual orientation, religion, disability, or gender. By changing the \nlaw, I truly believe we can change hearts and minds as well.\n  I urge my colleagues to help me to change the hearts and minds and to \nmake it widely known that we live in a society and a country that does \nnot tolerate those who impose on the civil rights of others simply \nbecause they are different.\n  This year, Congress needs to act. I look forward to President Bush \nsigning this legislation into law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 1146. A bill to require the Federal Trade Commission to monitor \nand investigate gasoline prices under certain circumstances; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, in March 2000, I introduced legislation to \ndeal with the high price of gasoline. At the time, the price of \ngasoline had reached a startlingly high $2.15 per gallon in California. \nToday, gasoline prices on average in California are $2.43 per gallon, \n13 percent higher. The problem is getting worse, not better, and so \ntoday I am reintroducing my bill to control the manipulation of \ngasoline prices.\n  We have heard that higher gasoline prices are due solely to higher \ncrude oil prices. I just do not buy it.\n  According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, from January \n17 through April 11, the cost of crude oil rose 10.8 percent. During \nthe same time period, the average retail price of gasoline in the \nUnited States rose 24.9 percent. Something is not right.\n  Look at the profits that are being pocketed by the big oil companies. \nCompared to the same time last year, oil companies' first-quarter \nprofits are dramatically higher.\n  Look at the number of mergers and acquisitions in the industry over \nthe past several months. The continued consolidation only reduces \ncompetition and increases energy costs.\n  Look at the refiners that may be taking plants off-line at will for \n``routine\n\n[[Page S6039]]\n\nmaintenance,'' which is reminiscent of the electricity crisis when \ngenerators took their plants off-line for ``routine maintenance'' in \norder to artificially increase prices.\n  My legislation will shed light on manipulation and hopefully curtail \nit.\n  The bill requires the Federal Trade Commission to automatically \ninvestigate the gasoline market for manipulation anytime average \ngasoline prices increase in any State by 20 percent in a period of 3 \nmonths or less and remain at that level for 7 days or more.\n  Market manipulation would include, but it is not limited to, \ncollusion or the creation of artificial shortages such as unnecessarily \ntaking refineries off-line. In determining the trigger, the gasoline \nprice used would be the Energy Information Agency's weekly pricing of \nregular grade gasoline. A report on the FTC's investigation would be \ndue to Congress 14 days after the price trigger.\n  Under the bill, the FTC would be required within 2 weeks of issuing \nthe report to hold a public meeting to discuss the findings. If the \nfinings indicate that there is market manipulation, then the FTC would \nwork with the State's attorney general to determine the penalties.\n  If the findings indicate that there is no market manipulation, then \nthe U.S. Department of Energy must officially decide, within 2 weeks, \nthe Strategic Petroleum Reserve should be used in order to ease prices \nand stabilize supply.\n  We need to deter market manipulation. Otherwise, we risk serious \nprice gouging with no accountability to consumers. My legislation \noffers a reasonable standard for an investigation and a reasonable time \nframe in which to complete that investigation. I believe the threat of \nthese investigations and the public light that would be shed on the \nsystem will keep gasoline prices down.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Baucus, Mr. \n        Burns, Mr. Schumer,  Mr. Bunning, and Ms. Cantwell):\n  S. 1147. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor the expensing of broadband Internet access expenditures, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation that \nwould accelerate the deployment of advanced broadband internet access \ntechnologies in rural and underserved regions. This bipartisan \nlegislation is very similar to bills that I have introduced in the last \nseveral Congresses. I want to thank Senators Snowe, Baucus, Burns, \nSchumer, Cantwell, and Bunning for co-sponsoring this bill.\n  The convergence of computing and communications has fundamentally and \nforever changed the way Americans live and work. Individuals, \nbusinesses, schools, libraries, hospitals, and many others share \ninformation through computer networks. We shop online. Some of us work \nat home, or in other locations, using networked computers to interact \nwith our colleagues and associates. Distance learning and telemedicine \nprovide important services in remote locations. In our personal lives \nwe look to our networked computers for entertainment and to communicate \nwith family and friends. These trends are accelerating dramatically.\n  A decade ago, telephone-based low-bandwidth services met most of our \nlimited data communications needs. Today this technology is obsolete. \nMost businesses and many individuals find that they require the ability \nto transmit information much faster, using what is commonly known as \nbroadband communications. Several technologies compete to provide \ncustomers with broadband communications. Among the most prominent are \noptical fiber, wireless, digital-subscriber lines, cable modems, power \nline transmission, and satellites.\n  Indeed, as the need for faster services compounds, the technologies \nmust be improved and even the definition of broadband communications \nmust be revised and updated. The now-obsolete telephone-based systems \ntransmit data at up to 56 thousand bits per second. Today, internet \nservice providers commonly install first generation broadband systems \nthat transmit data at rates between 256 thousand bits per second and 4 \nmillion bits per second. But we can now see clearly that these current-\ngeneration systems will be superseded by second-generation systems, \nalready being installed in a few areas, which operate at data rates of \nup to 30 million bits per second. In other countries, services that \ntransmit and receive data at 100 million bits per second are already \navailable to individuals. Some industry experts predict that within 5 \nto 10 years there will be a substantial demand for systems that operate \nat 1 billion bits per second.\n  Despite the industry downturn over the past few years, America's \ntelecommunications providers are working to make higher speed \ncommunications more widely available. Progress is fastest, and the \nbusiness case for investment is most attractive, in affluent urban and \nsuburban areas, especially newly developing areas. Rural areas are less \nfortunate. Low population densities, rugged terrain, and other factors \nmake these areas difficult and expensive to serve. Similarly, the \nbusiness case for providers to invest in underserved areas, mostly low \nincome areas, is generally weak.\n  As was the case with electric power and telephone systems in the 20th \ncentury, financial incentives will be necessary to assure the extension \nof broadband communications infrastructure into rural and underserved \nregions. These incentives will also provide a substantial benefit to \nthe American economy. In the same way that extending electric power \nsystems into rural areas stimulated a new demand for electric \nappliances and other products, the wider availability of broadband \ncommunications will stimulate electronic commerce and new commercial \nservices.\n  For my State of West Virginia, and other rural and low income States, \nthe availability of advanced communications systems will allow \nresidents to participate in the 21st century economy and have access to \nthe economic and cultural benefits of urban living while retaining \ntheir cherished rural values and lifestyles.\n  The consequences of failing to act are serious. Businesses in \ninfrastructure-rich regions will prosper at the expense of those in \nrural and underserved regions. New businesses will locate where the \ninformation infrastructure is strong. The migration of jobs to urban \nand affluent areas will accelerate and tax revenue in rural and \nunderserved areas will continue to decline. Residents of West Virginia \nand other rural states will continue to be at an economic and \neducational disadvantage. The ``digital divide'' will widen and the gap \nbetween ``have'' and ``have-not'' regions will expand.\n  Decisions on how this country chooses to deploy information \ntechnology have the power to fundamentally transform the future of \nrural America. I firmly believe, and I am sure this view is shared by \nmany of my colleagues, that rural communities deserve the same \nopportunities as their wealthier urban and suburban counterparts. We \nmust make a commitment to them now, while there is still time, that \ntheir communications infrastructure will not always be a generation or \nmore behind that of urban and suburban areas.\n  My bill would provide incentives for broadband deployment by allowing \nproviders, under certain conditions, to treat their investments in \nbroadband technologies as current-tax-year expenses. Under my \nlegislation, the incentives provided by this bill would be \ndifferentiated to favor investments in technologies that will continue \nto meet communications needs further into the future.\n  Half of investments in systems that permit data to be received at \nrates of 1.0 million bits per second and transmitted at rates of 128 \nthousand bits per second would qualify. This is a substantial incentive \nto provide residents of rural and underserved areas the capabilities \nalready enjoyed by individuals and businesses in urban and suburban \nareas.\n  Investments in systems that permit data to be received at 22 million \nbits per second and transmitted at 5 million bits per second would \nfully qualify. This more powerful incentive challenges internet service \nproviders to provide the capabilities that they have already begun to \nintroduce in urban and suburban areas. Forward-looking\n\n[[Page S6040]]\n\nproviders will use this opportunity to invest in technologies that can \nbe upgraded further as the demand grows.\n  Americans believe strongly in equal opportunity. This bill is just \none part of an effort to make sure that all Americans have equal access \nto modern communications systems and the opportunities that those \nsystems are bringing in the 21st century.\n  I hope that the Members of this body will support this important \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1147\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \npermit direct payment under the medicare program for clinical social \nworker services provided to residents of skilled nursing facilities; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, in honor of Older Americans' Mental \nHealth Week, I rise today to introduce the Clinical Social Work \nMedicare Equity Act of 2005. I am proud to sponsor this legislation \nthat will ensure that clinical social workers can receive Medicare \nreimbursements for the mental health services they provide in skilled \nnursing facilities. Under the current system, social workers may not be \npaid for services they provide. Psychologists and psychiatrists, who \nprovide similar counseling, are able to separately bill Medicare for \ntheir services. Congressmen Stark and Leach are introducing a companion \nbill today in the House of Representatives.\n  Since my first days in Congress, I have been fighting to protect and \nstrengthen the safety of our Nation's seniors. Making sure that seniors \nhave access to quality, affordable mental health care is an important \npart of this fight. I know that millions of seniors do not have access \nto, or are not receiving, the mental health services they urgently \nneed. Nearly 6 million seniors are affected by depression, but only \none-tenth ever gets treated. According to the American Psychiatric \nAssociation, up to 25 percent of the elderly population in the United \nStates suffers from significant symptoms of mental illness and among \nnursing home residents the prevalence is as high as 80 percent. These \nmental disorders, which include severe depression and debilitating \nanxiety, interfere with the person's ability to carryout activities of \ndaily living and adversely affect their quality of life. Furthermore, \nolder people have a 20 percent suicide rate, the highest of any age \ngroup. Every year nearly 6,000 older Americans kill themselves. This is \nunacceptable and must be addressed.\n  As a former social worker, I understand the role that social workers \nplay in the overall care of patients and seniors. This bill protects \npatients across the country and ensures that seniors living in \nunderserved urban and rural areas, where clinical social workers are \noften the only available option for mental health care, continue to \nreceive the treatment they need. Clinical social workers, much like \npsychologists and psychiatrists, treat and diagnose mental illnesses. \nIn fact, clinical social workers are the primary mental health \nproviders for nursing home residents and also seniors residing in rural \nenvironments. But unlike other mental health providers, clinical social \nworkers cannot bill directly for the important services they provide to \ntheir patients. Protecting seniors' access to clinical social workers \ncan help make sure that our most vulnerable citizens get the quality, \naffordable mental health care they need and deserve. This bill will \ncorrect this inequity and make sure clinical social workers get the \npayments and respect they deserve.\n  Before the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, clinical social workers \nbilled Medicare Part B directly for mental health services provided in \nnursing facilities to each patient they served. Under the Prospective \nPayment System, services provided by clinical social workers are \nlumped, or ``bundled,'' along with the services of other health care \nproviders for the purposes of billing and payments. Psychologists and \npsychiatrists, who provide similar counseling, were exempted from this \nsystem and continue to bill Medicare directly. This bill would exempt \nclinical social workers, like their mental health colleagues, from the \nprospective payment system, and would make sure that clinical social \nworkers are paid for the services they provide to patients in skilled \nnursing facilities. The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits \nImprovement and Protection Act addressed some of these concerns, but \nthis legislation would remove the final barrier to ensuring that \nclinical social workers are treated fairly and equitably for the care \nthey provide.\n  This bill is about more than paperwork and payment procedures. This \nbillis about equal access to Medicare payments for the equal and \nimportant work done by clinical social workers. It is about making sure \nour Nation's most vulnerable citizens have access to quality, \naffordable mental health care. The overarching goal we should be \nstriving to achieve for our seniors is an overall improved quality of \nlife. Without clinical social workers, many nursing home residents may \nnever get the counseling they need when faced with a life threatening \nillness or the loss of a loved one. I think we can do better by our \nNation's seniors, and I'm fighting to make sure we do.\n  The Clinical Social Work Medicare Equity Act of 2005 is strongly \nsupported by the National Association of Social Workers and the \nAssociation for Geriatric Psychiatry. I also want to thank Senators \nStabenow, Bingaman, Murray, Corzine, Johnson, and Inouye for their \ncosponsorship of this bill. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to enact this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nletters of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         National Association of Social Workers--Political Action \n           for Candidate Election,\n                                     Washington, DC, May 25, 2005.\n     Senator Barbara Mikulski,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Mikulski: I am writing on behalf of the \n     National Association of Social Workers (NASW), the largest \n     professional social work organization with over 153,000 \n     members nationwide. NASW promotes, develops, and protects the \n     affective practice of social work and social workers. NASW \n     also seeks to enhance the well being of individuals, \n     families, and communities through its work, service, and \n     advocacy.\n       NASW strongly supports the Clinical Social Work Medicare \n     Equity Act of 2005, which will end the unfair treatment of \n     clinical social workers under the Medicare Part B Prospective \n     Payment System (PPS) for Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNFs).\n       Section 4432 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 authorized \n     the creation of the PPS, under which the cost of a variety of \n     daily services provided to SNF patients is bundled into a \n     single amount. Prior to PPS, a separate Medicare Part B claim \n     was filed by the\n\n[[Page S6043]]\n\n     provider for each individual service rendered to a patient. \n     Congress made this change in an attempt to capitate the \n     rapidly rising costs of additional patient services delivered \n     by Medicare providers to SNF patients, with the precise \n     target being physical, occupational, and speech-language \n     therapy services. However, Congress recognized that some \n     services, such as mental health and anesthesia, are best \n     provided on an individual basis rather than as part of the \n     bundle of services. Thus, the following types of providers \n     are specifically excluded from the PPS: physicians, clinical \n     psychologists, certified nurse-midwives, and certified \n     registered nurse anesthetists. Unfortunately, due to an \n     unintentional oversight during the drafting process, clinical \n     social workers were not listed among the aforementioned \n     providers in the legislation.\n       In 1996, Department of Health and Human Services Inspector \n     General June Gibbs Brown published a report entitled ``Mental \n     Health Services in Nursing Facilities''. The purpose of the \n     report was to describe the types of mental health services \n     provided in nursing facilities and identify potential \n     vulnerabilities in the mental health services covered by \n     Medicare. One critical finding of the report was 70% of \n     nursing home respondents stated that permitting clinical \n     social workers and clinical psychologists to bill \n     independently had a beneficial effect on the provision of \n     mental health services in nursing facilities. The Clinical \n     Social Work Medicare Equity will maintain this beneficial \n     effect on SNF patients by ensuring the continuation of direct \n     Medicare billing by clinical social workers for mental health \n     services rendered to SNF patients.\n       Your efforts on behalf of mental health patients and \n     professional social workers nationwide are greatly \n     appreciated by our members. We thank you for your strong \n     interest in and commitment to this important issue as \n     demonstrated by your sponsorship of the Clinical Social Work \n     Medicare Equity Act. NASW looks forward to working with you \n     on this and future issues of mutual concern.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    David Dempsey,\n     Manager, Government Relations and PACE.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          American Association for\n\n\n                                         Geriatric Psychiatry,\n\n                                       Bethesda, MD, May 25, 2005.\n     Hon. Barbara Mikulski, \n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Mikulski: On behalf of the American \n     Association for Geriatric Psychiatry (AAGP), I am writing to \n     endorse the ``Clinical Social Work Medicare Equity Act of \n     2005.''\n       AAGP is a professional membership organization dedicated to \n     promoting the mental health and well-being of older people \n     and improving the care of those with late-life mental \n     disorders. AAGP's membership consists of 2,000 geriatric \n     psychiatrists, as well as other health professionals who \n     focus on the mental health problems faced by senior citizens.\n       This legislation would permit direct payment under the \n     Medicare program for clinical social worker services provided \n     to residents of skilled nursing facilities. The numbers of \n     mental health professionals available to treat older adults, \n     including residents of nursing homes, are already inadequate, \n     and as the baby boom generation ages, the needs will only \n     increase. Clinical social workers constitute a crucial \n     component of the team of mental health professionals who are \n     able to deliver this care, and assuring that they are able to \n     bill for their services in the same way as psychiatrists and \n     psychologists is not only fair but also necessary if nursing \n     home residents are to have access to the mental health care \n     they need.\n       AAGP commends you for your introduction of this important \n     legislation, and we look forward to working with you towards \n     its enactment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Christine M. de Vries,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n                                S. 1148\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Clinical Social Work \n     Medicare Equity Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PERMITTING DIRECT PAYMENT UNDER THE MEDICARE PROGRAM \n                   FOR CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKER SERVICES PROVIDED TO \n                   RESIDENTS OF SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 1888(e)(2)(A)(ii) of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395yy(e)(2)(A)(ii)) is amended by \n     inserting ``clinical social worker services,'' after \n     ``qualified psychologist services,''.\n       (b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 1861(hh)(2) of the \n     Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x(hh)(2)) is amended by \n     striking ``and other than services furnished to an inpatient \n     of a skilled nursing facility which the facility is required \n     to provide as a requirement for participation''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to items and services furnished on or after the \n     date that regulations relating to payment for physicians' \n     services for calendar year 2005 take effect, but in no case \n     later than the first day of the third month beginning after \n     the date of the enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ISAKSON (for himself and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 1149. A bill to amend the Federal Employees' Compensation Act to \ncover services provided to injured Federal workers by physician \nassistants and nurse practitioners, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise and join Senator \nKennedy in introducing the Improving Access to Workers' Compensation \nfor Injured Federal Workers Act.\n  One of Congress's biggest challenges year in and year out is \nproviding access to affordable quality healthcare for the American \npeople. Today, I am pleased to announce that Senator Kennedy and I have \nfound an opportunity to provide injured Federal workers with a better \nsystem of reimbursable healthcare for their workers compensation \nclaims.\n  Physicians assistants and nurse practitioners are vital contributors \nto our healthcare system. Together, they provide economical quality \nmedical care to the American people. Unfortunately, however, they are \ncurrently not recognized in the current FECA statute. When Federal \nworkers' compensation claims are signed by NPs or PAs, the Federal \nGovernment denies these claims. With the introduction of this bill, \nSenator Kennedy and I want to correct this hurdle to economical medical \ncare.\n  The need for this straightforward legislation is clear. In some rural \narea health clinics, NPs and PAs are the only full-time providers of \nmedical care. Likewise, NPs and PAs may be the only healthcare \nprofessionals on-site after hours at local clinics.\n  These professions are regulated by all States and are covered \nproviders within Medicare, Tri-Care, and nearly all private insurance \nplans. Indeed, many Federal workers already regularly receive medical \ncare from NPs and PAs through their Federal Employee Health Benefits \nPlan. NPs and PAs are also employed by the Federal Government, \nincluding the Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of State, \nDepartment of Defense, and the Public and Indian Health Services. In \nfact, most State workers' compensation programs cover NPs and PAs as \nreimbursable providers.\n  Again, I thank Senator Kennedy for his cooperation in ensuring cost-\neffective quality medical care is available to injured Federal workers.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today, with my distinguished colleague \nSenator Isakson, I am pleased to introduce the Improving Access to \nWorkers' Compensation for Injured Federal Workers Act.\n  Our federal employees serve the American public. Day in and day out, \nthey keep our homeland secure, protect our environment, and oversee and \ncare for those in need. They ensure the safety of our food and our \nmedicines, deliver our daily mail, and undertake countless other duties \nthat, while they sometimes go unnoticed, should never be taken for \ngranted.\n  More than two-and-a-half million of these workers are covered by the \nFederal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA). In addition to compensating \nworkers for lost wages, FECA provides medical treatment to Federal \nworkers injured on the job, to help them return to health and to work \nquickly.\n  FECA is an effective and fair compensation system. This bill will \nmake it even better by expanding it to cover services provided by nurse \npractitioners and physician assistants. This will protect many workers \nwho are now without access to needed care when a job-related injury \nstrikes.\n  Nurse practitioners and physicians' assistants play growing role in \nmedical care, with more than 100,000 nurse practitioners and 46,000 \nphysicians' assistants across the country. They provide crucial \nservices--diagnosing and treating illnesses, ordering and interpreting \ndiagnostic and laboratory tests and educating and counseling patients \nand families. In many States they can also prescribe medications.\n  Nurse practitioners and physicians' assistants provide these top \nquality services in a cost-effective way. The Department of Health and \nHuman Services reports that an office visit to see a nurse practitioner \ncosts 10 percent to 40 percent less than comparable services from a \nphysician, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics calls physicians' \nassistants ``cost-effective and\n\n[[Page S6044]]\n\nproductive members of the healthcare team.''\n  While their impact is felt throughout our nation, these care \nproviders play a particularly important role in rural and low-income \nurban areas, which are often underserved by doctors. In fact, in some \nrural areas, an injured Federal worker may be required to travel more \nthan one-hundred miles to see a physician and receive care that is \ncovered under FECA. This bill would expand Federal workers' service \noptions to include physicians' assistants or nurse practitioners who \nare more likely to be located nearby.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill and \nrecognizing the invaluable work done by our Federal employees and the \nhigh-quality cost-effective care provided by nurse practitioners and \nphysicians' assistants.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON:\n  S. 1150. A bill to increase the security of radiation sources, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the Dirty Bomb \nPrevention Act of 2005, which I am introducing today in the Senate, and \nCongressman Markey is introducing in the House.\n  Since September 11, we have increased our focus on dirty bombs, and \nrightly so.\n  Most Americans are not aware of how common this radioactive material \nis in our country. Often we think of warheads or rods used in nuclear \nreactors. However, we use less radioactive materials in positive ways \nin our hospitals, research laboratories, food irradiation plants, oil \ndrilling facilities, airport runway lighting, and even in smoke \ndetectors.\n  And although these materials have beneficial uses, the fact is that \nsome of them, in the hands of a terrorist, could be used to make a \ndirty bomb that could be used to contaminate a wide area in New York \nCity or in many other places across the country.\n  According to the Federation of American Scientists, ``material that \ncould easily be lost or stolen from U.S. research institutions and \ncommercial sites could contaminate tens of city blocks at a level that \nwould require prompt evacuation . . . Areas as large as tens of square \nmiles could be contaminated at levels that exceed recommended civilian \nexposure limits. ``\n  Even if such contamination caused by a dirty bomb did not pose severe \nhealth threats, efforts to determine the extent of contamination and \nclean it up would be both expensive and disruptive.\n  And we know that radiation sources are numerous in the United States. \nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) reports that about 157,000 \ngeneral and specific licenses have been issued authorizing the use of \nradioactive materials for industrial, medical, and other uses. About \n1.8 million devices containing radioactive sources have been \ndistributed under these licenses.\n  And we know that some of these sources get lost or stolen. A 2003 GAO \nreport found that since 1998, there have been more than 1,300 incidents \nwhere radiation sources were lost, stolen or abandoned.\n  While not all of these sources and incidents present potential dirty \nbomb threats, it's clear that we need to do a better job.\n  This legislation fills in remaining gaps to enable the U.S. to more \neffectively control radiation sources.\n  First, the bill would give the Nuclear Regulatory Commission the \nauthority and the mandate to control Radium-226 and other naturally \noccurring radioactive materials that for historical reasons have \nremained outside of federal control.\n  Radium-226 is of particular concern, as it is on the list of \nradiation sources that the United States has agreed to control as part \nof adhering to the International Atomic Energy Agency Code of Conduct \non the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources.\n  Radium-226 was used in medicine, starting early in the 20th century. \nIts use increased until the 1950s, when there were more than 5,000 \nradium users in the U.S. Since then, its use declined, and we don't \nhave a good handle on what is left out there. Because it is naturally \noccurring, it has stayed out federal regulatory net. So we need to give \nthe NRC the authority to go out and get control of it.\n  Second, the bill requires the NRC to develop within 6 months of \nenactment a ``cradle-to-grave'' tracking system to ensure that we know \nwhere radiation sources of concern are at all times. That's just common \nsense, and if FedEx can do it, I think we ought to be able to do it for \nmaterials that could be used in a dirty bomb.\n  Third, the bill requires the establishment of import and export \ncontrols for radiation sources. This is obvious--we need to know what's \ncoming and going as part of our efforts to control these materials.\n  These 3 provisions are fundamental steps that we know we need to take \ntoday to reduce the risk that radioactive materials will fall into the \nwrong hands.\n  But the bill also looks forward in several ways.\n  First, the bill requires an inter-agency task force on radiation \nsource protection to make periodic recommendations to Congress and the \nNRC about the safety and security of radiation sources. That way we \nwill know how we're doing, and what we need to do in the future.\n  Second, the bill requires a National Academy of Sciences study of \nwhether some current industrial uses of radiation sources could be \nreplaced with non-radioactive or less dangerous radioactive materials. \nAs I stated early on, there are many beneficial and necessary uses of \nradioactive materials, such as in medicine.\n  But there are some cases where use of radioactive materials can be \nreplaced with newer technologies. Just to give one example, some steel \nmills have been replacing nuclear process gauges with other \ntechnologies.\n  By exploring other opportunities to reduce the use of radioactive \nmaterials where possible and appropriate, we can shrink the pool of \nradioactive materials that are available to make a dirty bomb in the \nfuture.\n  So I hope we can take action on this legislation soon. Here in the \nSenate I will be working with my colleagues to see whether we can \ninclude this legislation in a nuclear plant security bill that the \ncommittee will be marking up in June.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1150\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for a program to accelerate the reduction \nof greenhouse gas emissions in the United States by establishing a \nmarket-driven system of greenhouse gas tradeable allowances, to limit \ngreenhouse gas emissions in the United States and reduce dependence \nupon foreign oil, to support the deployment of new climate change-\nrelated technologies, and ensure benefits to consumers; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator \nLieberman today in introducing an amended version of the Climate \nStewardship Act, which we introduced in February.\n  The legislation we submit today incorporates the provisions of S. \n342, the Climate Stewardship Act of 2005, in its entirety, along with a \nnew comprehensive title regarding the development and deployment of \nclimate change reduction technologies. This new title, when combined \nwith the ``cap and trade'' provisions of the previously introduced \nbill, will promote the commercialization of technologies that can \nsignificantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, mitigate the impacts of \nclimate change, and increase the Nation's energy independence. And, it \nwill help to keep America at the cutting edge of innovation where the \njobs and trade opportunities of the new economy are to be found.\n  In fact, the ``cap and trade'' provisions and the new technology \ntitle are complementary parts of a comprehensive program that will \nallow us to usher in an new energy era, an era of responsible and \ninnovative energy production and use that will yield enormous \nenvironmental, economic, and diplomatic benefits. The ``cap and trade'' \nportion provides the economic driver for existing and new technologies \ncapable of supplying reliable and clean energy and making the best use \nof America's available energy resources. Because of the multiple \nbenefits promised by this comprehensive program, we expect that the new \nbill will attract additional support for the vital purposes of the \nClimate Stewardship Act. We simply need the political will to match the \npublic's concern about climate change, the economic interests of \nbusiness and consumers, and American technological ingenuity and \nexpertise.\n  Our comprehensive bill sets forth a sound course toward a productive, \nsecure, and clean energy future. Its provisions are based on the \nimportant efforts undertaken by academia, Government, and business over \nthe past decade to determine the best ways and means towards This \nenergy future. Most of these studies have shared two common findings. \nFirst, significant reductions in greenhouse gases--well beyond the \nmodest goals of our bill--are feasible over the next 10 to 20 years \nusing technologies available today. Second, the most important \ntechnological deployment opportunities to reduce emissions over the \nnext two decades lie with energy efficient technologies and renewable \nenergy sources, including solar, wind, and biofuels. For example, in \nthe electric power sector, which accounts for one-third of U.S. \nemissions, major pollution reductions can be achieved by improving the \nefficiency of existing fossil fuel plants, adding new reactors designs \nfor nuclear power, expanding use of renewable power sources, and \nsignificantly reducing electricity demand with the use of energy-saving \ntechnologies currently available to residential and commercial \nconsumers. These clean technologies need to be promoted and that is \nwhat spurs our action today.\n  Before describing the details of this legislation, I think it is \nimportant to talk about what has occurred since the Senate vote on this \nissue in October 2003. For example, the scientific evidence of human-\ninduced climate change has grown even more abundant. But just since \nFebruary of this year, when I highlighted the results of the Arctic \nClimate Impact Assessment, even more startling evidence about the \nArctic region has been revealed. In a recent Congressional briefing, \nDr. Robert Corell, chair of Arctic Climate Impact Assessment, presented \nrecent data indicating that climate change in the Arctic is occurring \nmore rapidly than previously thought. Annual average arctic \ntemperatures have increased at\n\n[[Page S6047]]\n\ntwice the rate of global temperatures over the past several decades, \nwith some regions increasing by five to ten times the global average.\n  The latest observations show Alaska's 2004 June-July-August mean \ntemperature to be nearly 5 degrees Fahrenheit, 2.8 degrees Celsius, \nabove the 1971-2000 historic mean, and permafrost temperature \nincreasing enough to cause it to start melting. Dr. Corell said the \nGreenland ice sheet is melting more rapidly than thought even 5 years \nago, and that the climate models indicate that warming over Greenland \nis likely to be up to three times the global average, with warming \nprojected to be in the range of 5 to 11 degrees Fahrenheit, 3 to 6 \ndegrees Celsius, which will most certainly lead to sea-level rise. \nThese are remarkable new scientific findings.\n  It isn't surprising that just this past Tuesday, indigenous leaders \nfrom Arctic regions called on the European Union to do more to fight \nglobal warming and to consider giving aid to their peoples, saying \ntheir way of life is at risk. Global warming is said to be causing the \narrival in the far north of mosquitoes bearing infectious diseases. And \nin Scandinavia, more frequent rains in the winter are causing sheets of \nice to develop on top of snow, causing animals to die of hunger because \nthey cannot reach the grass underneath.\n\n       We are not asking for sympathy, said Larisa Abrutina of the \n     Russian Association of Indigenous Peoples of the North. We \n     are asking each country in the world to examine if it is \n     truly doing its part to slow climate change.\n\n  The efforts taking place globally to address climate change have \ngained even greater prominence. For example, British Prime Minister \nTony Blair has made climate change one of his top two issues during his \nPresidency of the G8. Mr. Blair's commitment to addressing climate \nchange should be commended. He has chosen to take action and not to \nhide behind the uncertainties that the science community will soon \nresolve. The Prime Minister made it clear in a January speech at World \nEconomic Forum in Davos as to his intentions when he said:\n\n     . . . if America wants the rest of the world to be a part of \n     the agenda it has set, it must be a part of their agenda too.\n\n  The top two issues that Prime Minister Blair has chosen to deal with \nare climate change and poverty in Africa. It is interesting to note \nthat a recent article in the New York Times highlighted the connection \nbetween the two issues. The article highlights that a 50-year-long \ndrying trend is likely to continue and appears to be tightly linked to \nsubstantial warming of the Indian Ocean. According to Dr. James \nHurrell, a scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research:\n\n     . . . the Indian Oceans shows very clear and dramatic warming \n     into the future, which means more and more drought for \n     southern Africa. It is consistent with what we would expect \n     from an increase in greenhouse gases.\n\n  It appears that Mr. Blair's two priorities are quickly becoming one \nenormous challenge.\n  In its September 2004 issue, The National Geographic devotes 74 pages \nlaying out in great detail the necessity of tackling our planet's \nproblem of global warming. In an introductory piece, Editor-in-Chief \nBill Allen described just how important he thinks this particular \nseries of articles is:\n\n       Why would I publish articles that make people angry enough \n     to stop subscribing? That's easy. These three stories cover \n     subjects that are too important to ignore. From Antarctica to \n     Alaska to Bangladesh, a global warming trend is altering \n     habitats, with devastating ecological and economic effects. . \n     . This isn't science fiction or a Hollywood movie. We're not \n     going to show you waves swamping the Statue of Liberty. But \n     we are going to take you all over the world to show you the \n     hard truth as scientists see it. I can live with some \n     canceled memberships. I'd have a harder time looking at \n     myself in the mirror if I didn't bring you the biggest story \n     in geography today.\n\n  The articles highlight many interesting facts. Dr. Lonnie Thompson of \nOhio State University collects ice cores from glaciers around the \nworld, including the famed snows of Kilimanjaro, which could vanish in \n15 years. According to Dr. Thompson, ``What glaciers are telling us, is \nthat it is now warmer than it has been in the past 2,000 years over \nvast areas of the planet.'' Many of the ice cores he has in his freezer \nmay soon contain the only remains of the glaciers from which they came \nfrom.\n  Highlighted quotes from the articles include: Things that normally \nhappen in geologic time are happening during the span of a human \nlifetime. The future breakdown of the thermohaline circulation remains \na disturbing possibility. More than a hundred million people worldwide \nlive within 3 feet of mean sea level. At some point, as temperatures \ncontinue to rise, species will have no room to run. The natural cycles \nof interdependent creatures may fall out of sync. We will have a better \nidea of the actual changes in 30 years. But it is going to be a very \ndifferent world.\n  Global warming demands urgent action on all fronts, and we have an \nobligation to promote the technologies that can help us meet the \nchallenge. Our aim has never been simply to introduce climate \nstewardship legislation. Rather our purpose is to have legislation \nenacted to begin to address the urgent global warming crisis that is \nupon us. This effort cannot be about political expediency. It must be \nabout practical realities and addressing the most pressing issue facing \nnot only our nation, but the world. We believe that our legislation \noffers practical and effective solutions and we urge each members \ncareful consideration and support.\n\n  I will include for the Record a more detailed description of the \nvarious components of the new technology title. However, I do want to \ndescribe some of the key provisions designed to enhance innovation and \ncommercialization in key areas. These include zero and low greenhouse \ngas emitting power generation, such as nuclear, coal gasification, \nsolar and other renewables, geological carbon sequestration, and \nbiofuels:\n  The bill directs the Secretary of Commerce, through the former \nTechnology Administration, which would be renamed the Innovation \nAdministration, to develop and implement new policies that foster \ntechnological innovation to address global warming. These new \ndirectives include: developing and implementing strategic plans to \npromote technological innovation; identifying and removing barriers to \nthe research, development, and commercialization of key technologies; \nprioritizing and maximizing key federal R programs to aid innovation; \n(establishing public/private partnerships to meet vital innovation \ngoals; and promoting national infrastructure and educational \ninitiatives that support innovation objectives.\n  It also authorizes the Secretary of Energy to establish public/\nprivate partnerships to promote the commercialization of climate change \ntechnologies by working with industry to advance the design and \ndemonstration of zero and low emission technologies in the \ntransportation and electric generation sectors. Specifically, the \nSecretary would be authorized to partner with industry to share the \ncost, 50/50, of ``first-of-a-kind'' designs for advanced coal, nuclear \nenergy, solar and biofuels. Moreover, each time that a utility builds a \nplant based on the ``first-of-a-kind engineering'' design authorized by \nthis bill, a ``royalty'' type payment will be paid by the utility to \nreimburse the original amount provided by the Government.\n  After the detail design phase is complete, the Secretary would be \nable to provide loans or loan guarantees, Up to 80 percent, for the \nconstruction of these new designs including three nuclear plant designs \ncertified by the NRC that would produce zero greenhouse gas emissions; \nthree advanced coal gasification plants with carbon capture and storage \nthat make use of our abundant coal resources while storing carbon \nemissions underground; three large scale solar energy plants to begin \nto tap the enormous potential of this completely clean energy source; \nand three large scale facilities to produce the clean, efficient, and \nplentiful biofuel of the future--cellulosic ethanol.\n\n  The loan program will be administered by a Climate Technology \nFinancing Board, whose membership will include the Secretary of Energy, \na representative from the Climate Change Credit Corporation, as would \nbe created in the bill, and others with pertinent expertise. Once each \nplant is operational, the private partner will be obligated to pay back \nthese loans from the government, as is the case with any construction \nloan.\n\n[[Page S6048]]\n\n  I think it is important to be very clear about this ambitious, but \nnecessary, technology title. We intend that much, if not all, of the \ncosts of the demonstration initiatives, along with the loan program, \nwill be financed by the early sale of emission allowances through the \nClimate Change Credit Corporation under the cap and trade program, so \nthat industry and the market will foot much of the bill, not the \ntaxpayers. And, as I already mentioned, the bill requires that any \nFederal money used to build plants will be repaid by the utility when \nthe plant becomes operational.\n  Finally, the bill contains a mechanism requiring utilities to pay \nreimbursement ``royalties'' as they build plants based on zero and low \nemission designs created with Federal assistance. These funding \nprovisions are more fair and certain than requiring taxpayers to cover \nthe entire costs of these programs and depending upon future \nappropriations. But there will be some costs involved. That is why it \nis important to weigh these expenditures against the staggering cost of \ninaction on global warming. I think we will find more than a justified \ncost-benefit outcome.\n  In addition to promoting new or underutilized technologies, the bill \nalso includes a provision to aid in the deployment of available and \nefficient energy technologies. This would be accomplished through a \n``reverse auction'' provision, which would establish a cost effective \nand proven mechanism for Federal procurement and incentives. Providers' \n``bids'' would be evaluated by the Secretary on their ability to \nreduce, eliminate, or sequester greenhouse gas emissions.\n  The ``reverse auction'' program would be funded initially by the \ntaxpayers but eventually would be funded by the proceeds from the \nannual auction of tradeable allowances conducted by the Climate Change \nCredit Corporation under the cap and trade program.\n  I want to clarify that this bill doesn't propose to dictate to \nindustry what is economically prudent for their particular operations. \nRather, it provides a basis for the selection and implementation of \ntheir own market-based solutions, using a flexible emissions trading \nsystem model that has successfully reduced acid rain pollution under \nthe Clean Air Act at a fraction of anticipated costs--less than 10 \npercent of the costs that some had predicted when the legislation was \nenacted. That successful model can and must be used to address this \nurgent and growing global warming crisis.\n  The ``cap and trade'' approach to emission management is a method \nendorsed by Congress and free-market proponents for over 15 years after \nit was first applied to sulfur dioxide pollution. Applying the same \nmodel to carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases is a matter of good \npolicy and simple, common sense. It is an approach endorsed by industry \nleaders such as Jeffrey Immelt, CEO of General Electric, one of the \nlargest companies in the U.S.\n  Moreover, using the proven market principles that underlie cap and \ntrade will harness American ingenuity and innovation and do more to \nspur the innovation and commercialization of advanced environmental \ntechnologies than any system of previous energy-bill style subsidies \nthat Congress can devise.\n  Three decades of assorted energy bills prove that while subsidies to \npromote alternative energy technologies may sometimes help, alone they \nare not transformational. In the 1970s, Americans were waiting in line \nfor limited supplies of high priced gasoline. We created a Department \nof Energy to help us find a better way. Yet today, 30 years later, we \nremain wedded to fossil fuels, economically beholden to the Middle East \nand we continue to alter the makeup of the upper atmosphere with the \never-increasing volume of greenhouse gas emissions. Our dividend is \ncontinued energy dependence and global warming that places our nation \nand the globe at enormous environmental and economic risk. Not a very \ngood deal.\n  Cap and trade is the transformational mechanism for reducing carbon \ndioxide emissions, protecting the global environment, diversifying the \nNation's energy mix, advancing our economy, and spurring the \ndevelopment and deployment of new and improved technologies that can do \nthe job. It is indispensable to the task before us.\n  The Climate Stewardship and Innovation Act does not prescribe the \nexact formula by which allowances will be allocated under a cap and \ntrade system. This should be determined administratively through a \nprocess developed with great care to achieve the principles and \npurposes of the Act. This includes assuring that high emitting \nutilities have ample incentives to clean up and can make emission \nreductions economically and that low emitting utilities are treated \njustly and recognized for their efficiency. Getting this balance right \nwill not be easy, but it can and must be done.\n  The fact remains that, if enacted, the bill's emission cap will not \ngo into effect for another 5 years. In the interim there is much that \nthe country can and should do to promote the most environmentally and \neconomically promising technologies. This includes removing unnecessary \nbarriers to commercialization of new technologies so that new plants, \nproducts, and processes can move more efficiently from design and \ndevelopment, to demonstration and, ultimately, to the marketplace. \nAgain, without cap and trade, these efforts will pale, but the new \ntechnology title we propose will work hand in glove with the emission \ncap and trade system to meet our objectives.\n  As I mentioned, the new title contains a host of measures to promote \nthe commercialization of zero and low-emission electric generation \ntechnologies, including nuclear, clean coal, solar and other renewable \nenergies, and biofuels.\n  I want to take some time to address the bill's nuclear provisions. \nAlthough these provisions are only part of the comprehensive technology \npackage, I am sure they will be the focus of much attention.\n  I know that some of our friends in the environmental community \nmaintain strong objections to nuclear energy, even though it supplies \nnearly 20 percent of the electricity generated in the U.S. and much \nhigher proportions in places such as France, Belgium, Sweden and \nSwitzerland--countries that aren't exactly known for their \nenvironmental disregard. But the fact is, nuclear is clean, producing \nzero emissions, while the burning of fossil fuels to generate \nelectricity produces approximately 33 percent of the greenhouse gases \naccumulating in the atmosphere, and is a major contributor to air \npollution affecting our communities\n  The idea that nuclear power should play no role in our energy mix is \nan unsustainable position, particularly given the urgency and magnitude \nof the threat posed by global warming which most regard as the greatest \nenvironmental threat to the planet.\n  The International Energy Agency estimates that the world's energy \nconsumption is expected to rise over 65 percent within the next 15 \nyears. If the demand for electricity is met using traditional coal-\nfired power plants, not only will we fail to reduce carbon emissions as \nnecessary, the level of carbon in the atmosphere will skyrocket, \nintensifying the greenhouse effect and the global warming it produces.\n  As nuclear plants are decommissioned, the percentage of U.S. \nelectricity produced by this zero emission technology will actually \ndecline. Therefore, at a minimum, we must make efforts to maintain \nnuclear energy's level of contribution, so that this capacity is not \nreplaced with higher emitting alternatives. I, for one, believe it can \nand should play an even greater role, not because I have some \ninordinate love affair with splitting the atom, but for the very simple \nreason that we must support sustainable, zero-emission alternatives \nsuch as nuclear if we are serious about addressing the problem of \nglobal warming.\n  I would like to submit for the record a piece written by Nicholas \nKristof of the New York Times. Mr. Kristof made the following \nobservation: ``It's increasingly clear that the biggest environmental \nthreat we face is actually global warming and that leads to a \ncorollary: nuclear energy is green.'' He goes on to quote James \nLovelock, a British scientist who created the Gaia principle that holds \nthe earth is a self-regulating organism. He quoted Mr. Lovelock as \nfollows:\n\n\n[[Page S6049]]\n\n\n       I am a Green, and I entreat my friends in the movement to \n     drop their wrongheaded objection to nuclear energy. Every \n     year that we continue burning carbon makes it worse for our \n     descendents. Only one immediately available source does not \n     cause global warming, and that is nuclear energy.\n\n  I have always been and will remain a committed supporter of solar and \nrenewable energy. Renewables hold great promise, and, indeed, the \ntechnology title contains equally strong incentives in their favor. But \ntoday solar and renewables account for only about 3 percent our energy \nmix. We have a long way to go, and that is one of the objectives of \nthis legislation--to help promote these energy technologies.\n  I want to stress nothing in this title alters, in any way, the \nresponsibilities and authorities of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. \nSafety and security will remain, as they should, paramount in the \nciting, design, construction and operation of nuclear power plants. And \nthe winnowing effect of the free market, as it should, will still \ndetermine which technologies succeed or fail in the market place. But \nthe idea that a zero-emission technology such as nuclear has little or \nno place in our energy mix is just as antiquated, out-of-step and \ncounter-productive as our continued dependence on fossil fuels. Should \nit prevail, our climate stewardship and clean air goals will be \nvirtually impossible to meet.\n  The environmental benefit of nuclear energy is exactly why during his \ntenure, my friend, Morris Udall, one of the greatest environmental \nchampions the United States has ever known, sponsored legislation in \nthe House, as I did in the Senate, to develop a standardized nuclear \nreactor that would maximize safety, security, and efficiency. The \nDepartment of Energy has done much of the work called for by that \nlegislation. Now it is time for the logical next steps. The new title \nof this legislation promotes these steps by authorizing Federal \npartnership to develop first of a kind engineering for the latest \nreactor designs, and then to construct three demonstration plants. Once \nthe demonstration has been made, free-market competition will take it \nfrom there. And the bill provides similar partnership mechanisms for \nthe other clean technologies, so we are in no way favoring one \ntechnology over another.\n  No doubt, some people will object to the idea of the Federal \nGovernment playing any role in helping demonstrate and commercialize \nnew and beneficial nuclear designs. I have spent 20 years in this body \nfighting for the responsible use of taxpayer dollars and against \nporkbarrel spending and corporate welfare. I will continue to do so.\n  The fact remains that fossil fuels have been subsidized for many \ndecades at levels that can scarcely be calculated. The enormous \neconomic costs of damage caused by air pollution and greenhouse gas \nemissions to the environment and human health are not factored into the \nprice of power produced by fossil-fueled technologies. Yet it is a cost \nthat we all bear, too often in terms of ill-health and diminished \nquality of life. That is simply a matter of fact.\n  It is also inescapable that the ability to ``externalize'' these \ncosts places clean competitors at a great disadvantage. Based on that \nfact, and in light of the enormous environmental and economic risk \nposed by global warming, I believe that providing zero and low emission \ntechnologies such as nuclear a boost into the market place where they \ncan compete, and either sink or swim, is responsible public policy, and \na matter of simple public necessity, particularly, as we enact a cap on \ncarbon emissions.\n  The Navy has operated nuclear powered submarine for more than 50 \nyears and has an impressive safety and performance record. The Naval \nReactors program has demonstrated that nuclear power can be done \nsafely. One of the underpinning of its safety record is the approach \nused in its reactor designs, which is to learn and build upon previous \ndesigns. Unfortunately for the commercial nuclear industry, they have \nnot had the opportunity to use such an approach since the industry has \nnot been able to build a reactor in over the past 25 years. This lapse \nin construction has led us to where we are today with the industry's \naging infrastructure. As we have learned from other industries, this in \nitself represents a great risk to public safety.\n\n  I want to close my comments on the nuclear provisions with two \nthoughts. A recent article in Technology Review seems particularly \npertinent to those with reservations about nuclear power. It stated:\n\n       The best way for doubters to control a new technology is to \n     embrace it, lest it remain in the hands of the enthusiasts.\n\n  This is particularly sage advice because, frankly, the facts make it \ninescapably clear--those who are serious about the problem of global \nwarming are serious about finding a solution. And the rule of nuclear \nenergy which has no emissions has to be given due consideration.\n  Mr. President, don't simply take my word regarding the magnitude of \nthe global warming problem. Consider the National Academy of Sciences \nwhich reported in 2001 that:\n\n       Greenhouse gases are accumulating in the Earth's atmosphere \n     as a result of human activities, causing surface air \n     temperatures and subsurface ocean temperatures to rise. \n     Temperatures are, in fact, rising. The changes observed over \n     the last several decades are likely mostly due to human \n     activities. . . .\n\n  Also consider the warning on NASA's website which states:\n\n       With the possible exception of another world war, a giant \n     asteroid, or an incurable plague, global warming may be the \n     single largest threat to our planet.\n\n  Consider the words of the EPA that\n\n       Rising global temperatures are expected to raise sea level, \n     and change precipitation and other local climate conditions. \n     Changing regional climate could alter forest, crop yields and \n     water supplies. . . .\n\n  And, let's consider the views of President Bush's Science Advisor, \nDr. John Marburger who says that,\n\n       Global warming exists, an we have to do something about it, \n     and what we have to do about it is reduce carbon dioxide.\n\n  Again, the chief science advisor to the President of the United \nStates says that global warming exists, and what we have to do about it \nis to reduce carbon dioxide.\n  The road ahead on climate change is a difficult and challenging one. \nHowever, with the appropriate investments in technology and the \ninnovation process, we can and will prevail. Innovation and technology \nhave helped us face many of our national challenges in the past, and \ncan be equally important in this latest global challenge.\n\n  Advocates of the status quo seem to suggest that we do nothing, or \nnext to nothing, about global warming because we don't know how bad the \nproblem might become, and many of the worst effects of climate change \nare expected to occur in the future. This attitude reflects a selfish, \nlive-for-today attitude unworthy of a great nation, and thankfully, not \none practiced by preceding generations of Americans who devoted \nthemselves to securing a bright and prosperous tomorrow for future \ngenerations, not just their own.\n  When looking back at Earth from space, the astronauts of Apollo 11 \ncould see features such as the Great Wall of China and forest fires \ndotting the globe. They were moved by how small, solitary and fragile \nthe earth looked from space. Our small, solitary and fragile planet is \nthe only one we have and the United States of America is privileged to \nlead in all areas bearing on the advance of mankind. And lead again, we \nmust, Mr. President. It is our privilege and sacred obligation as \nAmericans.\n  I ask unanimous consent an editorial from the New York Times be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 12, 2005]\n\n           Nuclear Power Has Become a Green Source of Energy\n\n                         (By Nicholas Kristof)\n\n       If only one thing used to be crystal clear to any \n     environmentalist, it was that nuclear energy was the \n     deadliest threat this planet faced. That's why Dick Gregory \n     pledged at a huge antinuke demonstration in 1979 that he \n     would eat no solid food until all U.S. nuclear plants were \n     shut down.\n       Gregory may be getting hungry.\n       But it's time for the rest of us to drop that hostility to \n     nuclear power. It's increasingly clear that the biggest \n     environmental threat we face is actually global warming, and \n     that leads to a corollary: Nuclear energy is green.\n       Nuclear power, in contrast to other sources, produces no \n     greenhouse gases. President Bush's overall environmental \n     policy gives me the shivers, but he's right to push ahead for \n     nuclear energy. There haven't been any successful orders for \n     new nuclear plants since 1973, but several proposals for new \n     plants are now moving ahead--and that's good for the world we \n     live in.\n\n[[Page S6050]]\n\n       Global energy demand will rise 60 percent during the next \n     25 years, according to the International Energy Agency, and \n     nuclear power is the cleanest and best bet to fill that gap.\n       Solar power is a disappointment, still accounting for only \n     about one-fifth of 1 percent of the nation's electricity and \n     costing about five times as much as other sources. Wind is \n     promising because its costs have fallen 80 percent, but it \n     suffers from one big problem: Wind doesn't blow all the time. \n     It's difficult to rely on a source that comes and goes.\n       In contrast, nuclear energy already makes up 20 percent of \n     America's power, not to mention 75 percent of France's. A \n     sensible energy plan must encourage conservation--far more \n     than Bush's plans do--and promote things like hybrid vehicles \n     and hydrogen fuel cells. But for now, nuclear power is the \n     only source that doesn't contribute to global warming and \n     that can quickly become a mainstay of the grid.\n       Is it safe? No, not entirely. Three Mile Island and \n     Chernobyl demonstrated that, and there are also risks from \n     terrorists.\n       Then again, the world now has a half-century of experience \n     with nuclear power plants, 440 of them around the world, and \n     they have proved safer so far than the alternatives. \n     America's biggest power source is now coal, which kills about \n     25,000 people a year through soot in the air.\n       To put it another way, nuclear energy seems much safer than \n     our dependency on coal, which kills more than 60 people every \n     day.\n       Moreover, nuclear technology has become far safer through \n     the years. The future may belong to pebble-bed reactors, a \n     new design that promises to be both highly efficient and \n     incapable of a meltdown.\n       Radioactive wastes are a challenge. But burdening future \n     generations with nuclear wastes in deep shafts is probably \n     more reasonable than burdening them with a warmer world in \n     which Manhattan is under water.\n       Right now, the only significant U.S. source of electricity \n     that does not involve carbon emissions is hydropower. But \n     salmon runs have declined so much that we should be ripping \n     out dams, not adding more.\n       What killed nuclear power in the past was cold economics. \n     Major studies at MIT and elsewhere show that nuclear power is \n     still a bit more expensive than new coal or natural gas \n     plants, but in the same ballpark if fossil fuel prices rise. \n     And if a $200-per-ton tax were imposed on carbon emissions, \n     nuclear energy would become cheaper than coal from new \n     plants.\n       So it's time to welcome nuclear energy as green (though not \n     to subsidize it with direct handouts, as the nuclear industry \n     would like). Indeed, some environmentalists are already \n     climbing onboard. For example, the National Commission on \n     Energy Policy, a privately financed effort involving \n     environmentalists, academics and industry representatives, \n     issued a report in December that favors new nuclear plants.\n       One of the most eloquent advocates of nuclear energy is \n     James Lovelock, the British scientist who created the Gaia \n     hypothesis, which holds that Earth is, in effect, a self-\n     regulating organism.\n       ``I am a Green, and I entreat my friends in the movement to \n     drop their wrongheaded objection to nuclear energy,'' \n     Lovelock writes, adding: ``Every year that we continue \n     burning carbon makes it worse for our descendents. Only one \n     immediately available source does not cause global warming, \n     and that is nuclear energy.''\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend and \ncolleague Senator John McCain to introduce a second version of our \nClimate Stewardship Act with improvements--the Climate Stewardship AND \nInnovation Act (CSIA).\n  In the computer age, we might call this Climate Stewardship 2.0. In \nthis new version we take the time-tested strengths of the Climate \nStewardship Act--like the emissions cap and trade program--and add new \nfeatures to spur innovation and lead us into a 21st Century energy \neconomy that prizes zero- or low-carbon emission technologies.\n  And we do all this with market-driven programs that will promote a \ncompetition for efficient technologies and that don't drain the federal \nbudget.\n  Let me start with the basics.\n  Climate change is real and its costs to the economy will be \ndevastating if we don't act.\n  Consider this very real example: 184 Alaskan coastal villages already \nneed to be relocated because their land and infrastructure are being \ndestroyed by advancing seas and warmer temperatures that are melting \nthe permafrost.\n  It will cost more than $100 million to relocate just one of these \ntowns.\n  What would be the price if we needed to do the same for New Orleans, \nMiami, or Santa Cruz, California?\n  SwissRe, North America's leading reinsurer, projects that climate \ndriven disasters could cost global financial centers more than $150 \nbillion per year within the next ten years.\n  The original Climate Stewardship Act asked the American people and \nbusinesses to reduce their carbon emissions to 2000 levels--which were \nquite close to today's levels by the end of the decade.\n  All we are saying is ``Don't make the problem worse! Do no further \nharm.''\n  Our proposal--then and now--will reduce carbon emissions by putting a \nprice on them with a cap and trade policy similar to the one used so \nsuccessfully in the Clean Air Act of 1990 which reduced acid rain.\n  Simply put, a business that doesn't reach its emissions target can \nbuy emissions credits from those under the target.\n  And, by the way, at the time we debated the acid rain program, \nindustry estimated it would cost $1,000 a ton to comply and would ruin \nthe economy. Today those emissions credits sell for between $100 and \n$200 a ton.\n  America's innovators found a way to make it work for the economy and \nthe environment--twin challenges that can and must move together in \nconcert, not conflict.\n  Because ``cap-and-trade'' creates a price for greenhouse emissions, \nit exposes the true cost of burning fossil fuels and will drive \ninvestment toward lower-emitting technologies.\n  If we are going to meet the challenge of climate change, while making \nsure that our economy remains strong, we need a program that gives \nbusiness and industry both a push and pull.\n  The push will come from requiring business and industry to cut their \ngreenhouse gas pollution; the pull from giving them incentives to \ninnovate, along with financial support for bringing the best \ninnovations forward.\n  There are many actions we can take today to meet the targets set in \nour original bill, ranging from increasing the efficiency of our \noperations, to boosting the use of renewable energy, for which so many \nstates are now admirably pushing. But to advance beyond this goal and \nmaintain emissions reductions in the future with a growing economy, we \nwill need to push both innovation and the deployment of climate \nfriendly technologies that already exist.\n  While we're on the subject of technology and investment, I want to be \nsure that everybody sees that our emissions trading market itself will \nunleash a multi-billion dollar flow of capital into technology and \ninnovation. Our opponents insist that everybody see the emissions \nreduction requirements of this bill as costs. The truth is that these \nso-called costs are vital investment flows necessary to bring about \ninnovation, invention and technological change in an era where our \nclimate, our economy and even our national security depend on our \nability to wean ourselves from our dependence on oil, so much of which \nis imported from unstable regions in the world.\n  Because technological change and innovation are so important for both \nclimate change and energy independence, our bill creates a dedicated \npublic sector mechanism for ensuring that some of that investment flow \nis directed at the technologies we need--including, for example, \nbiofuels and clean ways of burning coal, to name just two examples from \na potentially open-ended menu of climate-friendly technology choices.\n  The new bill we are introducing today helps assure that the most \nimportant and efficient technological alternatives are supported. We do \nnot pick winners or losers. That's for the market to do. Our bill is \ntechnology neutral, but does make sure that if there are barriers to \ndeveloping or using new technologies, the resources are available to \nknock those barriers down.\n  This bill provides support for first-of-its-kind innovation or early-\nadoption of new energy technologies with minimal cost to the federal \nbudget.\n  Instead of turning to the taxpayer, our bill uses a self-funding \nmechanism by empowering the Secretary of Energy to use some of the \nmoney generated through the purchase of emissions credits, funneled \nthrough a new public corporation our bill creates, to help bring \ninnovations to market. And this is not small change. It is a \nsubstantial multibillion dollar contribution every year.\n  Mr. President, this kind of public sector support has many \nencouraging precedents.\n  From the telegraph to the Internet, it was the timely intervention of \nthe\n\n[[Page S6051]]\n\nfederal government that helped bring new technologies to market.\n  And, if we don't help bring these new low-carbon or zero-carbon \ntechnologies to market, we will be buying them from the nations that \ndo.\n  We only need look at the popular hybrid cars--low-emitting vehicles \nthat consumers have shown they want by the long waiting lists that \nexist to buy them. And then remember that American manufacturers must \nlicense this technology from Japan.\n  Our bill also ensures that assistance is provided to help with the \ntransition to new technology and energy production with programs to \nreduce consumer costs, to help dislocated workers and communities, and \nto substantially support the deployment of climate friendly technology \nand energy production.\n  We also know that some regions--like my State of Connecticut--and \nbusinesses like DuPont, BP, and Kodak have already acted pro actively \nand are working to reduce emissions on their own. We commend these \nactions. Even more important, our bill ensures that credit will be \ngiven to them for their good work.\n  Just a few months ago, the head of the international panel on climate \nchange, Dr. R. Pachauri, said that ``we are already at a dangerous \npoint when it comes to global warming. . . . Immediate and very deep \ncuts in greenhouse gases are needed if humanity is to survive.''\n  Let me repeat those last words, ``If humanity is to survive.''\n  When I quoted Dr. Pachauri on this floor in February, I reminded the \nSenate that the Bush Administration lobbied heavily for Dr. Pachauri's \nappointment to the IPCC leadership because it considered him a more \ncautious and pragmatic scientist.\n  I quote him today because his warning words are so clear and strong.\n  Global warming is truly one of the great challenges of our age--a \nchallenge where the Heavens and the Earth meet.\n  It is a challenge of Biblical proportions--to meet God's call in \nCorinthians to be ``stewards'' of His mysteries--and in Genesis to go \nforth and ``replenish the earth'' to both work and guard the garden.\n  If we don't take these simple steps now--steps that are well within \nboth our technological and financial grasp--the generations to come \nwill rightfully look back at us with scorn and ask why we acted so \nselfishly . . . why we cared only for our own short-term profits and \ncomforts . . . and why we left them a world environment in danger. We \nmust act on our vision of a better future, a future that is most \ndefinitely within our reach.\n  That is what Senator McCain and I are convinced our CSIA will do.\n  We put forth this innovation and technology proposal to start a \nconversation here in the Senate with colleagues whose support we need \nto get to a majority, and to provide some ideas for how to accelerate \nand build a climate friendly future. We hope that our colleagues will \njoin us in this conversation so we can put forth--and pass--the best \nproposal possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Smith, and Ms. \n        Collins):\n  S. 1152. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \neliminate discriminatory copayment rates for outpatient psychiatric \nservices under the Medicare Program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Medicare \nMental Health Copayment Equity Act of 2005 with my colleagues, Senator \nJohn Kerry, Senator Gordon Smith, and Senator Susan Collins.\n  Briefly, our bill would correct a serious disparity in Medicare \npayment policy for mental health treatment. Medicare beneficiaries \ntypically pay 20 percent of the cost of covered outpatient services, \nincluding doctor's visits, as a ``copayment'' or coinsurance, and \nMedicare pays the remaining 80 percent. But Medicare law imposes a \nspecial limitation for outpatient mental health services which requires \npatients to pay a much higher copayment, 50 percent. As a result, \nMedicare beneficiaries pay two and a half times as much--50 percent \ncoinsurance--for treatment of any mental disorders.\n  Our bill will eliminate the disparity in payment by reducing this \ndiscriminatory copayment over a 6-year period, starting in 2006, from \nthe current 50 percent to the standard 20 percent. This means that, in \n2012, patients seeking outpatient treatment for mental illness will pay \nthe same 20 percent copayment that is required of Medicare patients \ntoday who receive outpatient treatment for other illnesses. The goal of \nour bill is ultimately to achieve ``copayment equity'' for Medicare \nmental health services.\n  Let me give an example of the current disparity in copayments. If a \nMedicare patient sees a doctor in an office for treatment of cancer, \nheart disease, or the flu, the patient must pay 20 percent of the fee \nfor the visit. But if a Medicare patient sees a psychiatrist, \npsychologist, social worker, or other professional in an office for \ntreatment of depression, schizophrenia, or any other type of mental \nillness, the patient must pay 50 percent of the fee. What sense does \nthis make?\n  Indeed, our bill has a larger purpose, to help end an outdated \ndistinction--between treatment of physical and mental disorders--and to \nensure that Medicare beneficiaries have equal access to treatment for \nall their health conditions. Perhaps this disparity would not matter so \nmuch if mental disorders were less prevalent. But the Surgeon General \nhas told us otherwise.\n  A landmark report of the Surgeon General in 1999 emphasized the \nimportance of access to treatment for mental disorders. The Surgeon \nGeneral found that mental illness was a leading cause--second only to \ncardiovascular diseases--of otherwise healthy years of life lost to \npremature death or disability. The Surgeon General found that the \noccurrence of mental illness among older adults is widespread, with a \nsubstantial portion of the population aged 55 and older--almost 20 \npercent--experiencing specific disorders that are not a part of \n``normal'' aging.\n  Older Americans also have the highest rate of suicide in the country, \nand the risk of suicide increases with age. In fact, in the State of \nMaine, the suicide rate for seniors is three times as high as the rate \nfor adolescents. It is not surprising, therefore, to find that \nuntreated depression among the elderly has substantially increased \ntheir risk of death by suicide.\n  Another sad irony involves individuals with disabilities. Medicare is \noften viewed as health insurance for people over age 65 but it also \nprovides health insurance for those with severe disabilities. The \nsingle most frequent cause of disability for both Social Security and \nMedicare benefits is mental disorders--affecting almost 1.4 million of \n6 million Americans who receive Social Security disability benefits. \nYet, Medicare pays far less for the critical mental health services \nneeded by these beneficiaries than it does for medical treatment for \ntheir physical disabilities.\n  However, the good news is that, today, there are increasingly \neffective treatments for mental illness. The majority of people with \nmental disorders who receive proper treatment can lead productive \nlives. Congress should remove disincentives that inhibit access to \nmental health services so that those seeking treatment for these \ndisorders do not have to face financial barriers to care. It is time to \nremove stigmas and overcome the lack of understanding of mental \ndisorders by equalizing Medicare copayment requirements for mental \nhealth services.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with me and bring Medicare payment \npolicy into the 21st century.\n  I would also like to submit letters from the American Psychiatric \nAssociation and the Mental Health Liaison Group, 36 national \norganizations supporting this legislation, and I ask unanimous consent \nthat these letters of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             American Psychiatric Association,\n\n                                      Arlington, VA, May 26, 2005.\n     Hon. Olympia Snowe,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. John Kerry,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Snowe and Senator Kerry: Later today you will \n     receive a letter, initiated by the American Psychiatric \n     Association, from some 35 members of the Mental Health \n     Liaison Group (MHLG) thanking you for your leadership in \n     again introducing legislation to phase out Medicare's \n     discriminatory 50 percent coinsurance.\n\n[[Page S6052]]\n\n       We are of course a cosigner of the MHLG letter, but I \n     wanted to add my own personal thanks for your tireless \n     efforts to end 40 years of discrimination against patients \n     seeking outpatient mental health services under Medicare Part \n     B. It should be simply unacceptable to compel such patients \n     to pay 50 percent of the cost of their care out of their own \n     pockets. The real ``winners'' under your legislation are \n     patients.\n       I also wish to specifically acknowledge the hard work and \n     dedication of Sue Walden, Heather Mizeur, and Aaron Jenkins \n     of your staffs. You are each extremely well served by their \n     efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             James H. Scully, Jr.,\n     Medical Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  Mental Health Liaison Group,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 26, 2005.\n     Hon. Olympia Snowe,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. John Kerry,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Snowe and Kerry: The undersigned \n     organizations in the Mental Health Liaison Group, \n     representing patients, health professionals and family \n     members, are pleased to support your legislation, the \n     Medicare Mental Health Copayment Equity Act. Under your \n     legislation, Medicare's historic discriminatory 50 percent \n     coinsurance for outpatient mental health care would be \n     reduced over six years to 20 percent, bringing the \n     coinsurance into line with that required of Medicare \n     beneficiaries for other Part B services.\n       Simply put, current law discriminates against Medicare \n     beneficiaries who seek treatment for mental illness. This \n     affects elderly and non-elderly Medicare beneficiaries alike \n     when they seek mental health care. According to the 1999 U.S. \n     Surgeon General's report on mental health, almost 20 percent \n     of elderly individuals have some type of mental disorder \n     uncommon in typical aging. In addition, elderly individuals \n     have the highest rate of suicide in the U.S., often the \n     result of depression. The Surgeon General's report states, \n     ``Late-life depression is particularly costly because of the \n     excess disability that it causes and its deleterious \n     interaction with physical health. Older primary care patients \n     with depression visit the doctor and emergency rooms more \n     often, use more medication, incur higher outpatient charges, \n     and stay longer at the hospital.''\n       The 50 percent coinsurance requirement also is unfair to \n     the non-elderly disabled Medicare population. Because many of \n     these individuals have severe mental illnesses combined with \n     low incomes and high medical expenses, a 50 percent \n     coinsurance obligation is a serious patient burden. For \n     elderly and non-elderly Medicare beneficiaries alike, \n     Medicare is a critical source of care. Your legislation to \n     ensure that Medicare beneficiaries needing mental health care \n     incur only the same cost-sharing obligations as required of \n     all other Medicare patients would end the statutory \n     discrimination against Medicare beneficiaries seeking \n     treatment for mental disorders.\n       Thank you for your leadership in addressing this important \n     issue for the nation's 40 million Medicare patients.\n           Sincerely,\n       Alliance for Children and Families; American Academy of \n     Child and Adolescent Psychiatry; American Association for \n     Geriatric Psychiatry; American Association of Children's \n     Residential Centers; American Association of Pastoral \n     Counselors; American Association of Practicing Psychiatrists; \n     American Group Psychotherapy Association; American Managed \n     Behavioral Healthcare Association; American Mental Health \n     Counselors Association; American Occupational Therapy \n     Association; American Psychiatric Association; American \n     Psychiatric Nurses Association.\n       American Psychoanalytic Association; American Psychological \n     Association; American Psychotherapy Association; Anxiety \n     Disorders Association of America; Association for the \n     Advancement of Psychology; Association for Ambulatory \n     Behavioral Healthcare; Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law; \n     Children and Adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity \n     Disorder; Clinical Social Work Federation; Clinical Social \n     Work Guild; Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance; Eating \n     Disorders Coalition for Research, Policy & Action.\n       Ensuring Solutions to Alcohol Problems; International \n     Society of Psychiatric-Mental Health Nurses; NAADAC, The \n     Association for Addiction Professionals; National Alliance \n     for the Mentally Ill; National Association for Children's \n     Behavioral Health; National Association for Rural Mental \n     Health; National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and \n     Associated Disorders (ANAD); National Association of Mental \n     Health Planning & Advisory Councils; National Association of \n     Protection and Advocacy Systems; National Association of \n     Psychiatric Health Systems; National Mental Health \n     Association; and Suicide Prevention Action Network USA.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 1154. A bill to extend the Acadia National Park Advisory \nCommission, to provide improved visitor services at the park, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Acadia \nNational Park Improvement Act of 2005. This legislation takes important \nsteps to ensure the long-term health of one of America's most beloved \nnational parks. It would increase the land acquisition ceiling at \nAcadia by $10 million; facilitate an off-site intermodal transportation \ncenter for the Island Explorer bus system; and extend the Acadia \nNational Park Advisory Commission.\n  In 1986, Congress enacted legislation designating the boundary of \nAcadia National Park. However, many private lands were contained within \nthe permanent authorized boundary. Congress authorized the Park to \nspend $9.1 million to acquire those lands from willing sellers only. \nWhile all of that money has now been spent, rising land prices have \nprevented the money from going as far as Congress originally intended.\n  There are over 100 private tracts left within the official park \nboundary. Nearly 20 of these tracts are currently available from \nwilling sellers, but the park does not have the funds to purchase them. \nMy legislation would authorize an additional $10 million to help \nacquire these lands. Since these lands already fall within the \ncongressionally authorized boundary, this effort would ``fill in the \nholes'' at Acadia, rather than enlarging the park.\n  My legislation will also facilitate the development of an intermodal \ntransportation center as part of the Island Explorer bus system. The \nIsland Explorer has been extremely successful over its first 5 years. \nThese low-emission propane-powered vehicles have carried more than 1.5 \nmillion riders since 1999. In doing so, they removed 424,000 vehicles \nfrom the park and reduced pollution by 24 tons.\n  Unfortunately, the system lacks a central parking and bus boarding \narea. As a result, day use visitors do not have ready access to the \nIsland Explorer. My legislation would authorize the Secretary of the \nInterior to provide assistance in the planning, construction, and \noperation of an intermodal transportation center in Trenton, ME. This \ncenter will include parking for day users, a visitor orientation \nfacility highlighting park and regional points of interest, a bus \nboarding area, and a bus maintenance garage. This center, which will be \nbuilt in partnership with the Federal Highway Administration, U.S. \nDepartment of Transportation, Maine Department of Transportation, and \nother partners, will reduce traffic congestion, preserve park resources \nand the visitor experience, and ensure a vibrant tourist economy.\n  Finally, my legislation would extend the 16-member Acadia National \nPark Advisory Commission for an additional 20-year period. This \ncommission was created by Congress in 1986 and is currently due to \nexpire in 2006. That would be a mistake. The commission consists of \nthree Federal representatives, three State representatives, four \nrepresentatives from local towns on Mount Desert Island, three from \nadjacent mainland communities, and three from adjacent offshore \nislands. These representatives have provided invaluable advice relating \nto the management and development of the Park. The commission has \nproven its worth many times over and deserves to be extended for an \nadditional 20 years.\n  Acadia National Park is a true gem of the Maine coastline. The park \nis one of Maine's most popular tourist destinations, with nearly 3 \nmillion visitors every year. While unsurpassed in beauty, the park's \necosystem is also very fragile. Unless we are careful, we risk \nsubstantial harm to the very place that Mainers and Americans hold so \ndear.\n  In 11 years, Acadia will be 100 years old. Age has brought both \nincreasing popularity and greater pressures. By providing an extra $10 \nmillion to protect sensitive lands, expanding the highly successful \nIsland Explorer transportation system, and extending the Acadia \nNational Park Advisory Commission, this legislation will help make the \npark stronger and healthier than ever on the occasion of its centennial \nanniversary.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my cosponsorship to \nthe Acadia National Park Improvement Act of 2005. For those of you who \nhave not had the good fortune to visit one of the crown jewels in the \nNational Park system, Acadia National Park, the first national park \nestablished east of the\n\n[[Page S6053]]\n\nMississippi, is located on the rugged coast of Maine, encompassing over \n47,000 acres that follow the shoreline, go up mountains of sheer \ngranite, dotted with numerous lakes and ponds, diverse habitats that \ncreate striking scenery and make the park a haven for wildlife and \nplants. This past Earth Day was celebrated by one of my staff members \nalong with devotees of the Park on the South Ridge Trail of Cadillac \nMountain, the highest point on the U.S. Atlantic coast, on the same \nground where the Wabanaki Indians walked over 6,000 years ago. They \ncalled the surrounding Mount Desert Island Pemetic, ``the sloping \nland''.\n  Acadia National Park certainly covers a land of contrast and \ndiversity, with a variety of freshwater, estuarine, forest and \nintertidal resources and is one of the most visited Parks in the \nnational park system, and rightfully so, as it offers magnificent views \nfrom Cadillac Mountain that sweep down 1,530 feet to the rocky coast \nand ocean below. Besides its natural beauty, the Park brings in $130 \nmillion a year into the State's economy.\n  It is because of the great beauty of the Park and its scenic views \nthat I have continued my efforts to achieve cleaner air for the area \nand for the entire State. The pristine Park is, unfortunately, a good \nexample of how the State is affected by dirty air that blows in from \naway, estimated to be around 80 percent, that is affecting both the air \nwe breathe and our ability to enjoy the natural beauty of the 47,000 \nacres of the Park.\n  I am a devoted fan of the Island Explorer bus system, whose clean \npropane-powered vehicles offer visitors and residents free \ntransportation to hiking trails, the unique carriage roads, the island \nbeaches and for in-town shopping. It is estimated that the Island \nExplorer buses took the place of an estimated 300,000 vehicles during \nthe last four years, and prevented the release of 24 tons of nitrogen \noxide and volatile organic compounds from car exhaust. I understand \nthat other national parks are considering using the positive benefits \nof the Island Explorer system as a transportation model for parks all \naround the country. A great deal of thanks should go to the surrounding \ntowns and to L.L. Bean for financing this successful system that helps \nto make the air cleaner and adds to our enjoyment of the activities the \nPark provides.\n  The legislation introduced today will help the Park in three specific \nareas; one, it will help the Park by extending the Acadia National Park \nAdvisory Commission for 20 years giving local residents the opportunity \nfor input into the management of the Park; two, it will increase the \nauthorized ceiling for land acquisition funding by $10 million to $28 \nmillion to realize the sharp rise in real estate prices so that \nproperties from willing sellers within the Park's boundaries can be \nincluded into the Park; and, three, the legislation will allow the Park \nto locate an intermodal center outside of park boundaries off of Mt. \nDesert Island to give even more assistance to the one road entering and \nexiting the Park by alleviating auto traffic to and on the island and \nto achieve cleaner air.\n  I will continue to take actions for additions within the Park \nboundaries, for local input into the management process, for a better \npublic transportation system for the Island that will create a \nhealthier environment, and better support the Park's ecological \nprotections. I look forward to continue working with the people of Mt. \nDesert Island, the Park's Supervisor, and the Friends of Acadia, a \ndevoted, independent philanthropy that has raised $15 million in \nprivate endowments for the Park, on issues important to all of us for \nthe preservation of the beautiful landscape, the ocean's coastline, and \nfor environmental improvements in Acadia National Park, the very place \nwhere the first light of day shines on our glorious Nation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Allard, Mr. \n        Bunning, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Craig, Mr. \n        Crapo, Mr. DeMint, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Graham, Mrs. \n        Hutchison, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Isakson, Mr. McCain, Mr. Santorum, \n        Mr. Sessions, Mr. Sununu, Mr. Talent and Mr. Thune):\n  S. 1155. A bill to establish a commission to conduct a comprehensive \nreview of Federal agencies and programs and to recommend the \nelimination or realignment of duplicative, wasteful, or outdated \nfunctions, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nCommission on the Accountability and Review of Federal Agencies, CARFA, \nAct with over 20 original cosponsors.\n  This is an important measure that I have been developing and \nadvocating over the past few years. CARFA's premise is simple: Members \nof Congress need a tool that will help them use taxpayer dollars more \nefficiently.\n  Members of Congress need a tool like CARFA because the special \ninterest in keeping a program alive is almost always more powerful than \nthe general interest to realign or even end a Federal program.\n  A good example of this is tobacco. While there is a general interest \nin discouraging smoking--and while we spend many taxpayer dollars to \nthis end--there is also strong special interest pressure to keep \ntaxpayer tobacco subsidies alive. Thus, the Federal Government both \nsubsidizes and discourages tobacco.\n  CARFA is the tool that would give members a chance to advance the \ngeneral interest. CARFA would take all Federal Government agencies and \nprograms--both discretionary and entitlement--and put them under the \nreview of a bipartisan commission. Members of the commission would be \nappointed by both majority and minority leaders in both House of \nCongress and by the President.\n  The commission would review Federal agencies and programs in order to \npresent draft legislation to the Congress that would realign or \neliminate duplicative, wasteful, inefficient, outdated, irrelevant, or \nfailed agencies and programs.\n  Each House of Congress would get one vote on the draft legislation--\nup or down--without amendment.\n  CARFA would create a new approach to increase the efficiency of the \nFederal Government by giving the general interest a stronger voice in \nthe system. For example, there might be a program that is important to \nmy home State of Kansas that would be cut by the proposed legislation, \nbut I only get one vote and there are a variety of other programs that \nI really do think need to be eliminated.\n  Since I only have one vote, I can justify voting for the measure when \nI go back home by showing to my constituents that there were a number \nof other programs that needed to be realigned or cut. Thus, CARFA makes \nthe overall goal of balancing the Federal budget more achievable.\n  We need CARFA now more than ever. The Federal Government spends \n$2,292,000,000 per year on discretionary and mandatory spending. That \nis a lot of money. My Kansas constituents often say: ``I don't mind \npaying my taxes, but make sure my hard-earned money is well spent.'' At \na time when Federal spending is at an all time high, topping $20,000 \nper household, we owe our constituents the accountability that would \nresult from CARFA.\n  Last year, we had a bipartisan hearing on CARFA, at which all \nwitnesses supported the CARFA concept. We have incorporated some of the \nsuggestions made at that hearing, and I believe this year's version of \nCARFA is even better.\n  I am pleased that the Senate is already on record supporting the \nCARFA concept through Section 502 of this year's budget resolution, and \nit is my hope that we will be able to work with leadership to see CARFA \nbecome a reality this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 1156. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \nthe credit period for electricity produced from renewable resources at \ncertain facilities, to extend the credit for electricity produced from \ncertain renewable resources, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill, S. 1156, \nto extend and enhance a provision in the Internal Revenue Code that \ngives tax incentives for the production of electricity from renewable \nresources.\n\n[[Page S6054]]\n\n  The legislation I am introducing today is central to our Nation's \ngoal of achieving energy independence, which is at the heart of the \nenergy bill that will soon be considered by the Senate. The Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources has included in its energy bill a \nrenewable energy title that directs the Federal Government ``to the \nextent economically feasible and technically practicable'' to implement \nprograms that will produce at least 7.5 percent of the electricity from \nrenewable sources by 2013.\n  The Senate Committee on Finance, on which I serve, will soon consider \nan energy tax bill to complement the bill from the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee. The legislation I am introducing today is designed \nto provide incentives to help us reach this level of renewable energy \nproduction.\n  Specifically, my bill would amend the Internal Revenue Code to extend \nthe Section 45 production tax credit for electricity produced from \nrenewable resources for facilities placed in service before January 1, \n2011, pursuant to a written binding contract in effect on December 31, \n2007. This extension is designed to take into account the extended \nlength of time it takes for many renewable energy facilities, \nparticularly geothermal facilities, to be built.\n  In addition, my bill would provide for a 10-year credit period for \nall renewable energy sources covered by this tax credit. Current law \nallows a 10-year credit period for certain renewable sources, such as \nwind, but only a 5-year credit period for other renewable sources, such \nas geothermal. This results in an uneven playing field under current \nlaw that tilts investors toward certain renewable energy resources over \nothers. This represents poor energy policy and it represents poor tax \npolicy.\n  I believe this disparity in credit periods undermines the development \nof all of our renewable energy resources and thereby inhibits our goal \nof energy independence. This legislation would equalize the tax credit \nperiod for all renewable resources and even up the playing field.\n  I would like my colleagues to know more about the importance of our \nNation's vast supply of geothermal energy resources. Geothermal is a \nclean, renewable energy resource that presently contributes over 2,718 \nmegawatts to the U.S. energy supply. Renewable energy, excluding \nhydroelectric, makes up 2 percent of U.S. energy consumption; of that 2 \npercent, geothermal energy accounts for .44 percent, solar .06 percent \nand wind 1 percent. Geothermal technology is used in commercial, \nindustrial and residential application in 26 States.\n  However, geothermal energy generation has not been fully exploited. \nAccording to the U.S. Department of Energy, there is almost 25,000 \nmegawatts of undeveloped geothermal energy production potential in the \nUnited States. This is enough power to serve more than 22 million \nhomes. Furthermore, this is an energy source that is not subject to the \nprice and supply volatility of fossil fuels. Our energy policy should \nnot overlook this potential or sell short its potential.\n  My home State of Utah has an abundance of high and low temperature \ngeothermal resources that this bill would allow to be economically \ndeveloped. For example, a new 36 megawatt geothermal plant near Cove \nFort, UT, is scheduled to be under construction by the spring of 2006 \nwith completion expected by the end of 2007. Without this legislation, \nit is unlikely that this plant, as well as others around the Nation, \nwould be able to be built. That would be very unfortunate.\n  The area around Cove Fort has one of the largest, proven geothermal \nresources in the Nation. There are 3,000 contiguous acres of leased \nland associated with the project now on the drawing boards. At 2,000 \nfeet underground, the geothermal resource there is relatively shallow \nand is considered by most geologic experts to be one of the largest \nunderground hot water reservoirs in North America. A leading geothermal \nengineering company recently issued a report indicating that the Cove \nFort hot water resource can support and sustain power production in \nexcess of 100 megawatts.\n  Utah is but one State with geothermal resources that can help lead \nour Nation toward energy independence. Other States with considerable \ngeothermal resources include Nevada, California, Montana, Washington, \nOregon, Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, \nArizona, New Mexico, Texas, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Louisiana, \nHawaii, and Kansas. We need to get the process of developing these \nresources started, and the bill I am introducing today would make sure \nthat happens.\n  This legislation would provide the necessary boost to the development \nof our geothermal energy resources as well as all other renewable \nenergy resources available to our Nation. I urge my colleagues to join \nme by cosponsoring this bill.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1156\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. EXTENSION AND MODIFICATION OF CREDIT FOR PRODUCING \n                   ELECTRICITY FROM RENEWABLE RESOURCES.\n\n       (a) Extension of Credit Period for Electricity Produced at \n     Certain Facilities.--Subparagraph (B) of section 45(b)(4) of \n     the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to read as \n     follows:\n       ``(B) Credit period.--In the case of any facility described \n     in subsection (d)(3)(A)(ii) placed in service before October \n     22, 2004, the 5-year period beginning on October 22, 2004, \n     shall be substituted for the 10-year period in subsection \n     (a)(2)(A)(ii).''.\n       (b) Extension of Credit.--Subsection (d) of section 45 of \n     the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to qualified \n     facilities) is amended by striking ``January 1, 2006'' each \n     place it appears and inserting ``January 1, 2008''.\n       (c) Binding Contracts for Facilities.--Subsection (d) of \n     section 45 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n     ``For purposes of this subsection, a facility shall be \n     treated as placed in service before January 1, 2008, if such \n     facility is placed in service before January 1, 2011, \n     pursuant to a written binding contract in effect on December \n     31, 2007, and at all times thereafter before such facility is \n     placed in service.''.\n       (d) Effective Date.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), the \n     amendments made by this section shall apply to electricity \n     produced and sold after the date of the enactment of this \n     Act, in taxable years ending after such date.\n       (2) Subsection (a).--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall apply to electricity produced and sold after December \n     31, 2004, in taxable years ending after such date.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Akaka, and Mr. Lautenberg):\n  S. 1158. A bill to impose a 6-month moratorium on terminations of \ncertain plans instituted under section 4042 of the Employee Retirement \nIncome Security Act of 1974 in cases in which reorganization of \ncontributing sponsors is sought in bankruptcy or insolvency \nproceedings; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the bill we are introducing today is \nurgently needed to protect the pension benefits of workers across \nAmerica.\n  A decent retirement in today's world depends on Social Security, \nprivate pensions, and private savings. But today's working families \nfind their retirement severely threatened. President Bush wants to \nprivatize Social Security. Private savings are at an all-time low, and \nnow private pensions are in great jeopardy, too.\n  This challenge has been brought home all too clearly by United \nAirlines' recent announcement that it intends to end its pension plans \nand turn them over to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. The \npensions of over 120,000 workers are at stake. Over $3 billion in their \nbenefits are not guaranteed by the corporation, and the future pensions \nthey have been promised will be lost as well.\n  These hard-working Americans include thousands of flight attendants \nlike Patrice Anderson, who have made only a modest wage throughout \ntheir working lives and for whom ``the possible loss of hundreds of \ndollars a month in old age changes a dignified retirement into a \nsubsistence-level retirement.''\n  The loss is particularly painful because so many of the employees \nhave accepted lower pay or given back wages and other benefits in order \nto keep their pension plans. Marilyn King of California worked for \nUnited for 25 years. She says: ``I used to be proud of working for \nUnited. Now, I am embarrassed and angry. I am angry that we\n\n[[Page S6055]]\n\ntook 25 percent in pay cuts, that we gave other concessions; and then \nour COO and CEO get their bonuses and perks.''\n  We have heard from families and workers across the country. In \nMassachusetts, Kevin Creighan and his wife Cathy Hampton in Lynn have \nspent a lifetime with United, ``working hard, earning a living, and all \nalong expecting a pension.'' They hoped to retire in 7 years, with a \ncombined 70 years of loyal service between them. Now, if they want the \nretirement they were promised by the United Airlines pension plan, they \nwill have to work for an additional 15 years.\n  George Raymond of Arizona retired at the age of 60 after 38 years. He \nwrites that because of this pension termination, he will not be able to \nafford his medical bills. Richard Myer of California retired after 32 \nyears as a United pilot, and now he has to go back to work and sell his \nhome to support his children and his elderly father-in-law.\n  Americans who work hard and play by the rules should not be \nvictimized by these broken promises. No wonder they feel betrayed. They \nshare the view of Robert Lamica of Virginia, who says, ``I kept my \npromise to United for 36 years by working in rain, snow, heat, and \nwhatever else nature would throw our way . . . My back and knees have \nbeen destroyed along with my ability to get another job . . . We need \nnot be left on the curb just because United can.''\n  These loyal men and women cannot turn back the clock and make \ndifferent decisions. But Congress can stop that clock and reach a fair \nsolution.\n  This legislation we are introducing will prevent bankrupt companies \nfrom abandoning their pension plans for the next 6 months.\n  Our action will also ease the growing threat to all defined benefit \npension plans. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation estimates that \nif it takes over the remaining airline defined benefit pension plans, \n90 percent of the claims it must cover will come from airline companies \nor steel companies, even though such plans include only 5 percent of \nthe employees covered by the corporation. The legislation will buy time \nfor us to develop real solutions for the serious problems of these \nailing industries.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this bill. We owe it to \nall these hard working Americans whose retirement has been put at risk.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Smith, Mr. Schumer, \n        Mr. Crapo, Mr. Lott, Mr. Kyl, and Mrs. Lincoln):\n  S. 1159. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \npermanently extend the subpart F exemption for active financing; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill, S. 1159, \nto make permanent a provision under subpart F of the Internal Revenue \nCode regarding active financial services income earned abroad. I am \njoined in this effort by my colleagues Senators Baucus, Smith, Schumer, \nCrapo, Lott, Kyl, and Lincoln. Under current law, the provision will \nexpire at the end of next year.\n  This legislation would ensure that U.S. financial services firms and \nU.S. manufacturing companies with financial services operations are \nsubject to U.S. tax on income from their active overseas financial \nservices operations only when such earnings are sent home to the U.S. \nparent company. As my colleagues know, this is the treatment provided \nunder the U.S. tax law for other active business income earned \noverseas. Our legislation simply extends, on a permanent basis, the \nexpiring provision that ensures this same treatment for the financial \nservices industry.\n  The permanent extension of this provision is critically important in \ntoday's global marketplace. Over the last few years, the financial \nservices industry has seen technological and global changes that have \naltered the very nature of the way these corporations do business, both \nhere and abroad. The U.S. financial industry is a worldwide leader that \nplays a pivotal role in maintaining confidence in the international \nmarketplace and positively contributes to the U.S. international trade \nbalance. We believe it is essential that our tax laws not impose anti-\ncompetitive burdens on this important U.S. industry.\n  If we allow the active financial services provision to lapse, U.S. \ncompanies would have to pay both local tax and current U.S. tax on the \nfinancial services income they generate overseas. While some of this \ndouble taxation is often alleviated by the foreign tax credit, we all \nknow that this system works imperfectly. The result is that U.S. firms \nend up with a cost that is not borne by their European and Asian \ncompetitors, because companies based in these areas do not face current \nhome country taxation on financial services income. In an industry \nwhere companies compete on price and a few basis points can mean the \ndifference between getting the business or losing it to a competitor, \nthe imposition of this additional tax cost on U.S.-based companies \nwould translate into a competitive disadvantage for U.S. companies and \na competitive advantage for their foreign counterparts. Given the \nthousands of U.S. jobs at stake, many of them in Utah, we do not \nbelieve our tax policy should allow this to happen.\n  While this provision may seem far removed from the average Utahn or \nthe average American, I can assure you that this is not true. For \nexample, the Salt Lake City area serves as the headquarters location \nfor the banking operations of American Express Centurion Bank and \nAmerican Express Bank, FSB, which are important parts of the worldwide \nAmerican Express Card system. Salt Lake City is also the headquarters \nof American Express Travelers Cheques, with its Utah facility servicing \nTravelers Cheques clients on a worldwide basis. Thousands of Utahns are \nemployed by these companies.\n  These businesses are tied to the international marketplace through \nthe competitive strength of the American Express global franchise. For \nAmerican Express and other U.S. companies to compete on par with their \nforeign competitors, the U.S. tax rules need to provide fair and \nequitable treatment of their overseas operations. To the extent foreign \ncompetitors can take business away from U.S. firms because of an uneven \nplaying field, U.S. jobs are at risk.\n  The bill we are introducing today would provide equitable and \nconsistent tax treatment for this important component of our economy. \nMaking this provision permanent would provide American companies much-\nneeded stability. The current provision has been renewed several times, \nmost recently for 5 years in the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act \nof 2002. Our ``on-again, off-again'' habit of extensions prevents U.S.-\nbased firms from competing fully in the global marketplace by \ninterfering with their ability to make business decisions and plan on a \nlong-term basis. The permanent extension of this subpart F provision \nwould ensure that the U.S. financial services industry is on a \ncompetitive footing with their foreign-based competitors and would \nprovide tax treatment that is consistent with the tax treatment \naccorded other U.S. businesses.\n  The Congress and the administration took an important step toward \nmodernizing our international tax rules with the enactment of the \nAmerican Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The legislation we introduce today \nfurthers that act's goals of ensuring that American firms can compete \nin the 21st century economy.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important bill and ask that the \ntext of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1159\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PERMANENT EXTENSION OF SUBPART F EXEMPTION FOR \n                   ACTIVE FINANCING.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 954(h)(9) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 is amended by striking ``and before January 1, \n     2007,''.\n       (b) Conforming Amendments.--Section 953(e)(10) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``and before January 1, 2007,'', and\n       (2) by striking the second sentence thereof.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Hatch, in introducing legislation to make permanent \nthe subpart F provision for active financial serviced income earned \nabroad.\n\n[[Page S6056]]\n\n  The legislation we are filing today is identical to a bill we filed \nin the 107th Congress. Since then, this exemption has been temporarily \nextended but that will expire at the end of next year. This exemption \nensures that the active financial services income earned abroad by U.S. \nfinancial services companies, or U.S. manufacturing firms with a \nfinancial service operation, is not subject to U.S. tax until that \nincome is brought home to the U.S. parent company.\n  By making this provision permanent, our legislation will put the U.S. \nfinancial services industry on an equal footing with its foreign-based \ncompetitors, which do not face current home country taxation on active \nfinancial services income. I will tell my colleagues that this bill is \nabout jobs in Montana, and in each of our States. In fact, one of these \ncompetitive U.S. financial services companies employs hundreds of \nMontanans in Great Falls alone, so the health of that company is \ncritically important to my constituents.\n  American financial services companies successfully compete in world \nfinancial markets. We need to make sure, however, that the U.S. tax \nrules do not change that situation and make them less competitive in \nthe world arena. This legislation will extend a provision that I \nbelieve preserves the international competitiveness of U.S.-based \nfinancial service companies, including finance and credit companies, \ncommercial banks, securities firms, and insurance companies. This \nprovision also contains appropriate safeguards to ensure that only \ntruly active businesses benefit.\n  As my colleagues have heard year after year, the active financial \nservices provision is critically important in today's global economy. \nOur U.S. financial services industry is a global leader playing a \npivotal role in maintaining confidence in the international \nmarketplace. It is a fiercely competitive business. And U.S.-based \ncompanies would surely be disadvantaged with an additional tax burden \nif we allow this exemption to lapse. Through our network of trade \ntreaties, we have made tremendous progress in gaining access to new \nforeign markets for this industry in recent years. Our tax laws should \ncomplement, rather than undermine, this effort.\n  The temporary nature of the active financial services provision, like \nother expiring provisions, denies U.S. companies the stability enjoyed \nby their foreign competitors. It is time to make permanent this subpart \nF active financial services provision in order to allow U.S. business \ncompanies to make business decisions on a long-term basis. I ask my \ncolleagues to join us in supporting this legislation, providing \nconsistent, equitable, and stable tax treatment for the U.S. financial \nservices industry.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Sununu):\n  S. 1128. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for increased rebates under the medicaid program for \nprescription drugs that are directly advertised to consumers, to \nrequire other Federal programs purchasing or reimbursing for such drugs \nto establish payment and reimbursement mechanisms that reduce the costs \nof those drugs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, the cost of medicine is a matter of \nconcern to every Senator. Today, Senator Sununu and I have introduced \nlegislation to take a fresh approach to holding down the cost of \nmedicines in our country. Under our bipartisan legislation, the Federal \nGovernment would pay less for pharmaceuticals that are advertise when \nthe Federal Government buys those medicines for Medicaid, the Veterans' \nAdministration, the Department of Defense, and the Public Health \nService.\n  One can barely turn on the television or open a magazine these days \nwithout getting the hard sale on a hot new medicine. There is no doubt \nthat medical science is making miracles for our citizens who need help \nwith their health. For that, we are, of course, grateful. But the \nadvent of advertising for prescription drugs presents pitfalls as well, \nnot just for patients but for every American taxpayer.\n  Senator Sununu and I introduced our legislation today because as the \nmarketing gets savvier, the Federal Government needs to get smarter and \ncontain costs wherever possible for these popular and expensive drugs. \nThe fresh approach that Senator Sununu and I unveil today will amp up \nthe Government's purchasing power on prescription drugs that are \nadvertised directly to consumers. The Pharmaceutical Advertising and \nPrudent Purchasing Act will reduce drug costs for the beneficiaries of \nMedicaid and other Federal programs. It will ease the burden on States \nstruggling to stretch their health care dollars through Medicaid, and \nit will lower the overall costs for taxpayers footing the bill for \nthese advertised drugs.\n  When a drug company figures the price of a pill, it passes along the \nadvertising costs to consumers. Right now, Medicare and Medicaid pay \nthat cost like any other consumer. But it is time to take the \nadvertising costs out of the equation for taxpayer funded programs. The \nFederal Government, of course, gives drug companies a tax break for \nadvertising which, of course, every other American company gets for its \nbusiness expenses. There is no need for a double subsidy. There is a \nneed for more prudent purchasing of prescription drugs by the Federal \nGovernment. If that is going to happen, the changes in the \npharmaceutical market that have been caused by the explosion of \nadvertising cannot be ignored any longer.\n  I do not have to tell our colleagues that drug advertising in the \nUnited States is an immense and growing industry. The Wall Street \nJournal reported last week that the pharmaceutical industry spent \nnearly $4.5 billion on advertising to consumers. The penetration of \nthis advertising may be more than most people realize. A recent Kaiser \nFamily Foundation poll found that 90 percent of Americans had seen or \nheard an advertisement for prescription drugs. Today, more and more \nAmericans can go to their doctor and ask to have a medication they have \nseen advertised on TV, in a magazine, on the radio or on the Internet. \nOf course, that is what is happening.\n  There is a proven direct connection between the advertising of drugs \nand a big uptick in the rate of prescriptions written for them. Take a \nlook at the 10 most advertised drugs in the United States. That is \n2003, and I would guess that few Americans would say they have not \nheard of any of these drugs.\n  On each of these drugs, at least $100 million was spent in 2003 alone \non direct consumer advertising. The advertising works. A study \npublished in the April issue of the Journal of the American Medical \nAssociation demonstrates the link. Researchers sent actors to doctors' \noffices to complain of mild depression. Those who mentioned seeing an \nad were five times more likely to get a prescription for an \nantidepressant as those who simply described their supposed symptoms \nwithout talking about a drug ad they had seen. It is no wonder the \nheavily advertised drugs make up most of the top 10 medicines \nprescribed under Federal health programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and \nothers. Take a look.\n\n  These are the 10 drugs on which Medicare spends the most total money \nfor outpatient care. Nine are advised directly to consumers.\n  Here are the 10 drugs on which Medicaid spends the most money. Four \nof the ten are advised directly to consumers. The next 4 drugs, Nos. 11 \nthrough 14, are advertised as well. It is the view of Senator Sununu \nand I that the Federal Government is one consumer that does not need to \nreceive advertising from the drug companies.\n  The Federal Government is buying medicine for a lot of people with a \nlimited pool of funds. It is vital to get a handle now on the \nconnection between advertising and increased sales and to insist on \nmore prudent purchasing.\n  Our legislation does just that. It makes the Government a more \nprudent purchaser in a straightforward way. It will require Medicaid \nand other vital programs under Health and Human Services and the \nVeterans' Administration to get a discount that cuts out the \nadvertising costs figured in each pill. In Medicaid, this would be done \nby adjustments in the Medicaid rebate program. That is an existing \nprogram that requires a pricing agreement between drug manufacturers \nand the Federal Government for any drug to be sold through the Medicaid \nprogram.\n  The Health and Human Services Secretary and the VA Secretary will \nalso\n\n[[Page S6057]]\n\nbe able to negotiate reduced prices for other Federal programs such as \nthe Public Health Service, programs administered by the Indian Health \nService, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense \nand the Defense Health Program.\n  This is smart and effective spending. It ends the spending of \ntaxpayer dollars to fund advertising that has already received a tax \nbreak. It is a commonsense step, the kind of common sense that is all \ntoo uncommon when the Federal Government buys drugs.\n  Our legislation will address another issue that speaks both to the \ntaxpayers' interests and the health of patients in these programs. When \nadvertised drugs are purchased, it is not enough to make sure the price \nis right, although that is important. It is vital the drug is right for \nthe patient's particular problem. Taxpayer dollars should buy drugs \nthat will work best for patients by a doctor's best judgment. Just \nbecause a patient recognizes a drug's name enough to request it from \ntheir provider does not mean it is the best medicine.\n  More and more drug companies are treating doctors as a middleman they \nwish to skip. They make a lot more money if patients, without medical \ndegrees, are encouraged to start writing their own prescriptions, \nwhether the drug is the right one or not. Medicare, Medicaid, and other \nFederal programs have a charge to keep for their patients and a trust \nto maintain with American taxpayers. They should not be exploited \nfinancially by the pharmaceutical ``flavor of the month.''\n  I close by expressing my thanks to the Senator from New Hampshire. \nThis is a bipartisan approach that is going to hold down the cost of \nmedicine for taxpayers in our country. It will be a benefit to \nbeneficiaries certainly at a time when the Medicaid Commission is \ntrying to find responsible savings. We ensure that we take the time to \nstudy how this approach would work for other programs such as Medicare. \nAnd because I see my friend in the Chamber, I will wrap up simply by \nsaying that it is time to take out a sharp pencil and eliminate the \nhidden costs for taxpayers from advertised drugs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Madam President, I am pleased to join Senator Wyden in \nthe introduction of this legislation, which is a good-faith effort to \ntry to find that fresh approach Senator Wyden talked about, a fresh \napproach to deal with costs in health care, specifically in those areas \nwhere the Federal Government is directly purchasing pharmaceuticals: in \nthe VA, where we have a very large direct purchase program that exists \ntoday, and within Medicaid, where both the Federal Government and the \nStates are directly involved in purchasing and negotiating the pricing \nof drugs.\n  We are focusing on direct-to-consumer advertising. This is an area \nwhere activity and cost have exploded over the last 6 or 7 years. Since \n1997, when the Federal Government changed the regulations associated \nwith direct-to-consumer advertising, we have seen advertising outlays \nfor pharmaceuticals go from a little bit over $1 billion to nearly $5 \nbillion per year this year. Those costs, as any costs would be, are \npassed on to consumers. In the case of these programs where the Federal \nGovernment is purchasing the pharmaceuticals in the VA and in Medicaid, \nthat means that the cost, the impact, is disproportionately felt by the \ntaxpayer.\n  This is an effort to try to find a way to reduce those costs, to give \nthe Federal Government the power to make a distinction, as they \nnegotiate prices--to make a distinction between those drugs that are \nadvertised directly to consumers or marketed directly to consumers and \nthose that are not, and to provide discounts to those companies or \nthose drugs that avoid the additional costs of advertising.\n  This advertising, as I say, is expensive. The cost is passed on to \ntaxpayers in these particular programs. I think there are also a lot of \nquestions about the value that a flood of advertising might provide.\n  We have all been inundated by different types of advertisement, on TV \nor in magazines. It is costly, as I mentioned, but it also carries with \nit some risk of overutilization; of, in some cases, encouraging or \nleading consumers to believe that they need or would benefit by a \nparticular medicine when it is not necessarily the best approach for \nthem.\n  In some cases it is clear this advertising has been used to drive \nconsumers away from lower priced generic drugs. I think this is one of \nthe most problematic areas, and that has been seen and discussed at \nsome length in the States, in their Medicaid programs.\n  This legislation presents an opportunity to get our hands around the \ncost issue, to fund some important studies, to take a closer look at \nquestions of overutilization and the substitution I described. It \nrepresents a good start, I think, opening the debate with this \ndiscussion about dealing directly with health care costs in areas of \nthe Federal Government as the principal purchaser.\n  There may be other options. In fact, Senator Wyden and I talked about \na few other approaches that are not included in this legislation. I \nthink I can speak for the Senator from Oregon when I say we look \nforward to talking to our colleagues about other ideas that might be \nout there. We look forward to sharing ideas and information with \nproducers themselves who, I hope, are willing to look at ways to help \nsave the consumers money, help save taxpayers money, and help deal with \ndirect-to-consumer advertising in a more responsible way.\n  We are going to do a Medicaid bill this year in the Senate. While we \nalso deal with some issues at HHS and the VA in this bill, certainly \nthe costs associated with Medicaid and our recommendations with regard \nto Medicaid are a central part of the bill. I will work with Senator \nWyden and any of my interested colleagues to try to include and capture \nsome of these ideas in Medicaid legislation this year.\n  It is a great opportunity to look at the issue of health costs and \ndrug costs in a fresh way, in a different way. I very much appreciate \nthe work Senator Wyden has done in helping to craft this legislation \nand his willingness to lend his strong support, as a longstanding and \nmore senior Member than I, as a member of the Senate Finance Committee, \nand as a Member of the Senate on the other side of the aisle.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/26/senate-section/article/S6057-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6057-S6058]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 157--CONGRATULATING CARRIE UNDERWOOD FOR WINNING THE \n   ``AMERICAN IDOL'' TELEVISION PROGRAM AND THANKING HER FOR BEING A \n                          POSITIVE ROLE MODEL\n\n  Mr. COBURN (for himself and Mr. Inhofe) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Con. Res. 40\n\n       Whereas, on May 31, 2003, at Wawel Royal Castle, Krakow, \n     Poland, President George W. Bush declared that ``today I \n     announce a new\n\n[[Page S6059]]\n\n     effort to fight proliferation called the Proliferation \n     Security Initiative. The United States and a number of our \n     close allies, including Poland, have begun working on new \n     agreements to search planes and ships carrying suspect cargo \n     and to seize illegal weapons or missile technologies. Over \n     time, we will extend this partnership as broadly as possible \n     to keep the world's most destructive weapons away from our \n     shores and out of the hands of our common enemies'';\n       Whereas, since May 2003, more than 60 countries have \n     indicated their support for the Proliferation Security \n     Initiative;\n       Whereas, in September 2003, 11 countries agreed to and \n     published the Proliferation Security Initiative Statement of \n     Interdiction Principles, which, among other things, \n     identifies specific steps for effectively interdicting \n     shipments of weapons of mass destruction, their means of \n     delivery, and related materials and for preventing \n     proliferation facilitators, brokers, and middlemen from \n     engaging in this deadly trade;\n       Whereas the Proliferation Security Initiative has led to \n     the negotiation of bilateral ship boarding agreements \n     designed to facilitate the interdiction of weapons of mass \n     destruction, their means of delivery, and related materials, \n     including agreements with the Governments of Panama, Liberia, \n     and the Marshall Islands;\n       Whereas, United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540, \n     proposed by President Bush and adopted unanimously by the \n     Security Council on April 28, 2004, calls on all countries to \n     take cooperative action to prevent trafficking in weapons of \n     mass destruction, their means of delivery, and related \n     materials;\n       Whereas the actions of the United States and its \n     Proliferation Security Initiative partners Germany and Italy \n     contributed to the interdiction of the ship ``BBC China'', a \n     commercial ship carrying centrifuge components for Libya's \n     illicit nuclear program, en route to Tripoli, and also \n     contributed to the constructive decision made by the \n     Government of Libya on December 19, 2003, to acknowledge its \n     illegal weapons of mass destruction programs and its \n     agreement to eliminate its weapons of mass destruction and \n     long-range missile programs and rejoin the international \n     community by eliminating all elements of its chemical and \n     nuclear weapons programs, declaring all nuclear materials and \n     activities to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), \n     eliminating ballistic missiles with a range greater than 300 \n     kilometers with payloads of 500 or more kilograms, accepting \n     international inspections to ensure Libya's complete \n     adherence to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, signing \n     the Additional Protocol, eliminating all chemical weapons \n     stocks and munitions and acceding to the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention, and allowing immediate inspections and monitoring \n     to verify all of these actions;\n       Whereas the Report of the United Nations Secretary-\n     General's High Level Panel on Threats, Challenges, and \n     Changes finds that ``[r]ecent experience of the activities of \n     the A.Q. Khan network has demonstrated the need for and the \n     value of measures taken to interdict the illicit and \n     clandestine trade in components for nuclear programs'';\n       Whereas the same Report also welcomes ``the voluntary \n     Proliferation Security Initiative, under which more and more \n     states are cooperating to prevent illicit trafficking in \n     nuclear, biological and chemical weapons'';\n       Whereas, acknowledging that existing non-proliferation \n     agreements and export control regimes are necessary but no \n     longer sufficient, the Secretary-General of the United \n     Nations has stated: ``I applaud the efforts of the \n     Proliferation Security Initiative to fill a gap in our \n     defenses'';\n       Whereas the United States and many of its Proliferation \n     Security Initiative partners have conducted 14 ground, air, \n     maritime, and tabletop interdiction exercises over the last 2 \n     years, beginning with the Australian-led exercise Pacific \n     Protector in September 2003; and\n       Whereas multiple countries have now participated in and \n     observed air, land, and sea interdiction training exercises, \n     in particular the October 2004 Team Samurai exercise, in \n     which Japan, the United States, Australia, and France \n     contributed operational assets and Canada, Cambodia, Germany, \n     Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, \n     Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Singapore, Spain, \n     Sweden, Thailand, Turkey, and the United Kingdom participated \n     as observers, and most recently in Exercise Ninfa '05, a \n     joint maritime and ground interdiction exercise led by \n     Portugal: Now, therefore be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the President is to be commended on the occasion of the \n     second anniversary of the creation of the Proliferation \n     Security Initiative for its broadening membership, increasing \n     international support, and successful operational training \n     and exercises;\n       (2) all the governments of countries coordinating and \n     cooperating in intelligence sharing, training exercises, and \n     legal agreements with the United States under the \n     Proliferation Security Initiative, in particular the meetings \n     of the PSI Operational Experts Group, are to be commended for \n     their support in the global effort to prevent the \n     proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, their means of \n     delivery, and related materials;\n       (3) the Proliferation Security Initiative constitutes an \n     important tool for coordinating diplomatic, law enforcement, \n     customs, intelligence, and military capabilities against the \n     illicit trade in weapons of mass destruction, their means of \n     delivery, and related materials;\n       (4) all countries must work together, particularly under \n     the auspices of the committee established pursuant to \n     operative paragraph 4 of United Nations Security Council \n     Resolution 1540, popularly called the ``1540 Committee'', to \n     further the implementation of the provisions of Resolution \n     1540 relating to the international legal bases for continued, \n     aggressive enforcement of all agreements, treaties, and \n     regimes that aim through interdiction activities to end the \n     illicit trade in weapons of mass destruction, their means of \n     delivery, and related materials;\n       (5) the governments of all responsible countries should \n     endorse the PSI Statement of Interdiction Principles and \n     cooperate actively to interdict and disrupt illicit trade in \n     weapons of mass destruction, their means of delivery, and \n     related materials; and\n       (6) as evidenced in the historic December 19, 2003, \n     decision of Libya to acknowledge and convert or dismantle its \n     illegal weapons of mass destruction programs, the \n     Proliferation Security Initiative can provide significantly \n     enhanced enforcement of and adherence to the Treaty on the \n     Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done at Washington, \n     London, and Moscow July 1, 1968, and entered into force March \n     5, 1970 (commonly known as the ``Nuclear Non-Proliferation \n     Treaty''), the Convention on the Prohibition of the \n     Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical \n     Weapons and on Their Destruction, with Annexes, done at Paris \n     January 13, 1993, and entered into force April 29, 1997 \n     (commonly known as the ``Chemical Weapons Convention''), the \n     Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production \n     and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin \n     Weapons and on Their Destruction, done at Washington, London, \n     and Moscow April 10, 1972, and entered into force March 26, \n     1975 (commonly known as the ``Biological Weapons \n     Convention''), the safeguards system of the International \n     Atomic Energy Agency, and the commitments and control lists \n     of the Missile Technology Control Regime, the Australia \n     Group, and the Nuclear Suppliers Group.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/26/senate-section/article/S6059-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6059-S6060]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n            committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN.

Mr. President, I rise today to address the consideration \nof H.R. 3, the Highway bill, in conference between the Senate and the \nHouse, and to engage the majority leader and Chairman Inhofe in a \ncolloquy. It has come to my attention that the version of H.R. 3 passed \nby the House contains changes to the Small Business Act, which is under \nthe exclusive jurisdiction of the small business committees in both \nchambers. Section 1821 of H.R. 3 as passed by the House would extend \nthe benefits of the Historically Underutilized Business, HUBZone, \nprogram to non-metropolitan areas designated as Difficult Development \nAreas, DDAs, by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, but \nonly if these DDAs are located in states and territories outside the \ncontinental United States. The HUBZone program exists to generate \nmarket-based development solutions in economically distressed areas by \nproviding federal contracting advantages to small businesses which \nlocate in HUBZones and employ HUB Zone residents.\n  The HUBZone contracting program is codified in the Small Business Act \nand is administered by the Office of Government Contracting and \nBusiness Development of the Small Business Administration. While the \nHUBZone provision was not included in the Senate version of H.R. 3, had \nthe provision in the House bill proceeded through the Senate committee \nprocess, I would have certainly exercised my prerogatives as the \nCommittee Chair.\n  Although I am not requesting a formal appointment as a conferee, I \nwould like to ask my distinguished colleagues, the majority leader and \nthe chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, \nto commit that no change to the Small Business Act or any program \nrelating to the SBA will be negotiated or agreed to in the Highway bill \nconference without my consent as the Chair of the Senate Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship.\n\n[[Page S6061]]\n\n  Mr. FRIST. The Senator from Maine, the distinguished chair of the \nSmall Business Committee, is correct that while the vast majority of \nthe Highway bill does not concern the Small Business Act or the Small \nBusiness Administration, the Highway bill conferees should secure the \nconsent of the Chair of the Senate committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship before making any changes to legislation or programs \nwithin that committee's jurisdiction.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I am grateful to the chair of the Small Business \nCommittee for her concern about the interests of small business. As \nchairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and the \nmanager of the Highway bill on the part of the Senate, I agree that the \nSenate conferees on the Highway bill will secure the Senate Small \nBusiness Committee's consent before negotiating or agreeing to any \nchanges to the Small Business Act or to any program relating to the \nSmall Business Administration.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank Chairman Inhofe and the majority leader for their \ncommitment and support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/26/senate-section/article/S6061-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6061]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF JANICE R.

LA FOLLETTE, SR., POST OFFICE BUILDING''\n\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs be discharged from further \nconsideration of H.R. 1760 and the Senate proceed to its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1760) to designate the facility of the United \n     States Postal Service located at 215 Martin Luther King, Jr., \n     Boulevard in Madison, Wisconsin, as the ``Robert M. La \n     Follette, Sr., Post Office Building.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. 1760, which \nwould name a Post Office in Madison, WI as the ``Robert M. La Follette, \nSr. Post Office Building.'' This passage of this legislation is timely, \ncoming shortly before what would have been La Follette's 150th birthday \nnext month.\n  Robert La Follette was born into a farming family in Primrose, WI, on \nJune 14, 1855. After graduating from the University of Wisconsin in \nMadison, he served as the District Attorney for Dane County. He would \ngo on to serve the State of Wisconsin as a Congressman, the Governor, \nand a U.S. Senator. Throughout his career, he fought on behalf of the \npeople, not the politics. He truly embodied the ``fighting'' spirit of \nthe people of Wisconsin.\n  As Governor, La Follette instituted direct primary elections, \nallowing the people to choose their representatives, rather than having \nthe party leaders chose them. His reform efforts in the State, and his \nexcellent speaking style, placed him in the national spotlight. In \n1906, La Follette joined the U.S. Senate, where he would remain until \nhis death in 1925.\n  It was as a U.S. Senator that La Follette truly launched a national \nprogressive movement. He protested the corruption of government and the \ninfluence of large corporations on political leaders. He argued in \nfavor of women's suffrage, worker's rights and racial equality. He \nfought for economic and social reform to remove power from the few and \nplace it in the hands of the many.\n  La Follette's fighting spirit and drive for reform have prevented him \nfrom falling out of the Naion's consciousness. Nowhere is this truer \nthan in Wisconsin, the State he served so tirelessly for more than 30 \nyears. His legacy is alive in the people of Wisconsin, who so often \nembody his pioneering spirit of reform. His legacy is alive in the \nUnited States Senate, where we continue to fight for honesty in \npolitics. For all these reasons, I urge my colleague to join me in \nsupport of H.R. 1760, to commemorate the legacy, and celebrate the life \nof Robert ``Fighting Bob'' La Follette.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent the bill be read a third time and \npassed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any \nstatements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 1760) was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/26/senate-section/article/S6064-3", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6064-S6065]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE OKLAHOMA INDEPENDENT PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, today I rise in support of this resolution \nrecognizing the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association on its 50th \nanniversary and also recognizing its members' vital contribution to the \noil and gas industry of the United States.\n  The Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association--OIPA--was founded by \nRoy Woods on January 13, 1955. Roy Woods and other founders possessed \nthe leadership and vision to establish a unified voice for independent \ncrude oil and natural gas producers.\n  The founders were independent oil and natural gas producers, and its \nmembership still comprises independents, both large and small.\n  OIPA is my State's largest oil and gas advocacy group, representing \nover 1,500 member companies in the crude oil and natural gas \nexploration/production industry, as well as affiliated businesses. OIPA \nis also a member of the Independent Petroleum Association of America.\n  OIPA's mission is to enhance and protect the ability of Oklahoma's \nindependent oil and natural gas producers to conduct their business and \nto ensure a strong energy supply.\n  OIPA is a proactive and diverse organization striving to provide a \nbroad range of services to its members and the industry it supports.\n  OIPA has worked successfully on behalf of Oklahoma independent \nproducers on State and national issues, advocating for State and \nnational governmental policies that protect and enhance the Oklahoma \nindependent producers' ability to do business.\n  Most recently, I have worked with OIPA in the introduction of the \nNatural Gas Production Act of 2005--S. 926, which I introduced, that \nwould extend section 29 to include natural gas produced from depths \nbelow 15,000 feet. This bill is strongly supported by OIPA members and \nI thank them for their support.\n  The Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association has been and will \ncontinue to be an invaluable asset in developing and promoting the oil \nand gas industry in the United States.\n  I am introducing this resolution as an expression of my appreciation. \nI congratulate the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association for its \n50-year history and its contributions to the oil and gas industry in \nOklahoma and the United States.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent the resolution be agreed to, the \npreamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be laid on the table \nen bloc, and any statements relating to the resolution be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 159) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 159\n\n       Whereas the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association was \n     founded and incorporated in the State of Oklahoma on January \n     13, 1955;\n       Whereas the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association was \n     founded by independent oil and natural gas producers, and its \n     membership is still comprised of independent producers, both \n     large and small;\n       Whereas the founders of the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum \n     Association possessed the leadership and vision to establish \n     a unified voice for independent crude oil and natural gas \n     producers;\n       Whereas the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association is \n     the largest oil and gas advocacy group in the State, \n     representing over 1,500 member companies in the crude oil and \n     natural gas exploration and production industry and \n     affiliated businesses;\n       Whereas the mission of the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum \n     Association is to enhance and protect the ability of \n     independent oil and natural gas producers in Oklahoma to \n     conduct their business and to ensure energy supply;\n       Whereas the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association is a \n     rarity in State oil and\n\n[[Page S6065]]\n\n     gas associations, with a full-time governmental affairs \n     specialist and a full-time regulatory affairs specialist \n     working with agencies that regulate the oil and gas industry;\n       Whereas the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association is a \n     proactive and diverse organization striving to provide a \n     broad range of services to its members and the industry it \n     supports;\n       Whereas the leaders of the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum \n     Association have worked successfully on behalf of Oklahoma \n     independent producers on State and national issues, \n     advocating for State and national governmental policies that \n     protect and enhance the ability of Oklahoma independent \n     producers to do business; and\n       Whereas the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association will \n     continue to look toward the future by forging alliances \n     within the oil and gas industry and with other organizations \n     devoted to a more prosperous Oklahoma: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the 50th anniversary of the Oklahoma \n     Independent Petroleum Association;\n       (2) congratulates the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum \n     Association for its 50-year history of contributions to the \n     oil and gas industry of Oklahoma and the United States;\n       (3) recognizes that the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum \n     Association has been and will continue to be an invaluable \n     asset in developing and promoting the oil and gas industry in \n     the United States; and\n       (4) directs the Secretary of the Senate to transmit a copy \n     of this resolution to the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum \n     Association as an expression of appreciation and for public \n     display at the 50th annual meeting of the Oklahoma \n     Independent Petroleum Association.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/26/senate-section/article/S6065-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6065]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--S. 1127\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

There will be no rollcall \nvotes on June 6, but Senators are encouraged to come to the floor that \nday to speak on the Brown nomination.\n  As a reminder, cloture was just filed on the Brown nomination and the \nnomination of William Pryor to the Eleventh Circuit. Thus, we will vote \non the cloture motion with respect to the Brown nomination on Tuesday, \nJune 7, at noon.\n  Given the agreement reached this week, I expect cloture to be invoked \nand hope that we can proceed to the confirmation vote on Judge Brown \nearly Tuesday afternoon. I also would like to remind my colleagues that \nwe have time agreements with respect to the nominations of Griffith, \nMcKeague, and Griffin to the circuit courts, as well. It is my \nintention to move to these nominations at an early time, as well.\n  Finally, since we were unable to finish our work on the Bolton \nnomination to be ambassador to the United Nations, we will revisit this \nissue following the break, as well.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
