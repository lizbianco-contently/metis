Mr. President, today the Senate resumes consideration of \nthe nomination of John Roberts to be Chief Justice of the United \nStates. Tomorrow at 11:30 we will vote on this nomination. Again, I \nremind all Senators to be at their desks for that vote. This is among \nthe most significant votes that most of us will cast in our Senate \ncareers, the approval of the nomination of Chief Justice of the United \nStates. We ask Senators to come to the Chamber around 11:20 to be \nseated for the 11:30 vote.\n  Following the confirmation on Judge Roberts, the Senate will take up \nthe Defense appropriations bill. Senators should expect votes on \nThursday, and we will be voting on Friday on the appropriations bill or \nany other legislative or executive items that are cleared for action.\n  I was talking to the Democratic leader to make sure that we are \nvoting on Friday of this week.\n  We also have a continuing resolution that we must act on this week \nbefore the end of the fiscal year. Therefore, I ask that Senators \nadjust whatever plans they have for the weekend or for Friday to \nrecognize that we will be voting. We will not be voting on Monday or \nTuesday in observance of the Jewish holiday. But the Senate will be in \nsession to conduct business and discussing amendments. Those amendments \nwill be stacked for votes on Wednesday. We will notify Senators as to \nwhat time that will be. I encourage Senators to come forward and offer \ntheir amendments as early as possible so we can vote on Wednesday.\n\n\n                         Pandemic Preparedness\n\n  Mr. President, on another issue, an important issue--we have so much \ngoing on in this body with the appropriations bills, and the nomination \ncoming forward, and that is going very well in terms of the discussion \non both sides of the aisle. But there are many other issues as well.\n  I want to focus for a few minutes on an issue I do not believe is \nreceiving the attention it deserves given the risk that is before us.\n  Yesterday, I sent a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary \nMichael\n\n[[Page S10530]]\n\nLeavitt regarding our Nation's pandemic preparedness. The H5-N1 avian \ninfluenza--the name of this particular strain of virus--has spread from \nSoutheast Asia to Russia. It is spreading across the world.\n  If you look at a map and look at that spread, it gives you real \npause--and it should. It threatens to land in Europe. Although you \ncan't say with certainty as you look at that picture of the globe and \nyou see that spread, it will next be in Europe and America, although we \ndon't know what that order will be.\n  It has infected more people and more poultry than any previous \nstrain. If you look at the animal population--it is called the avian or \nbird influenza--it has caused the death or destruction of not just a \nfew million but 160 million birds. That includes what is called the \n``culling'' that goes on. But 160 million birds have died as a result \nof this influenza.\n  It has jumped from animals, the birds and other animals, actually, \nwith a genetic shift to humans. People ask, How many humans have been \ninfected? We do not know exactly, but we have documented 115 confirmed \nhuman cases of this particular H5-N1 influenza.\n  How fatal is it? It is fatal. The mortality rate is very high. Fifty-\nnine people out of the 115 confirmed cases died from this particular \nvirus. It has a very high mortality rate.\n  Just this week, Indonesian health officials reported that yet another \nperson--a young woman age 30--has died from the virus. This follows \nlast week's deaths of two young girls and a boy with very similar \nsymptoms in Jakarta and Samarinda. Since last Monday, Indonesia has put \nitself on an ``extraordinary incident'' status.\n  Experts warn that a global cataclysmic pandemic is not a question of \nif but when. Like an earthquake, or like a hurricane, it can hit any \ntime. When it does, it could take the lives of tens of millions of \npeople.\n  People ask, Is that an overstatement? I don't believe it is. You only \nhave to go back and look at the history. This August, I spent a great \ndeal of time talking to experts around the country on the H5-N1 \ninfluenza virus. In Tennessee, over in Memphis, there is St. Jude's \nChildren's Research Hospital. There is a group of researchers there who \nprobably know more about this particular strain than anybody in the \nworld, led by Dr. Robert Webster at the St. Jude's Children's Research \nHospital. He is one of the leading experts of the H5-N1 strain.\n  He explained in very clear terms that there are 16 families of the \navian influenza. Billions of mutations of the virus are occurring every \nday. It is constantly changing, constantly adapting. With each of these \nlittle mutations, the virus multiplies its odds of becoming \ntransmissible from human to human. It is changing up, to be spread \nthroughout the bird population to the human population. And with just \none little, tiny change, it can be transmitted person to person to \nperson. It is a little bit like pulling the lever on a Vegas slot \nmachine over and over again. If you pull it enough times, the reels \nwill align and hit the jackpot. In this case the jackpot is a deadly \nvirus to which humans have no natural immunity.\n  It is very important right now. Nobody listening to me has a natural \nimmunity to this particular virus. Infected hosts are contagious before \nthey are symptomatic. In other words, anyone walking around who is \ninfectious can spread the disease. They may not have any symptoms. The \nvirus would thus have ample opportunity to spread rapidly throughout \nthe population before it could be detected or appropriately contained--\nbut not symptomatic. You don't know whether it can be contained or know \nto stay away from people.\n  To make matters worse, we lack our best defense. People say, If it \ndoes happen, surely in America or in the world today we have a vaccine, \nand we have a robust antiviral stockpile. If you think you are \ndisposed, or if you are a physician or health personnel and go into a \ncommunity to treat it, do we have enough of the antiviral pill which \nyou can take that will protect you? The answer is no.\n  This particular antiviral pill is Tamifly. I will mention that \nshortly.\n  We don't have enough today for first responders, or doctors and \nnurses who would be taking care of you. The United States of America--\nthe richest country in the world, and the most advanced country in the \nworld--is unprepared in terms of the number of vaccines to treat, as \nwell as the initial antiviral pill or therapy to treat. We do not have \nenough doses of the antiviral Tamifly. It is a drug which is effective \ntoday in the treatment of this particular strain. We have enough to \ntreat about 2 million people--a little over that, 2.3 million people. \nWe have 295 million people in this country and we can treat about 2 \nmillion people--and then that is it.\n  There is only one company located in the United States that produces \nthe influenza vaccine--not the Tamifly, but the vaccine itself. In \ncontrast, Britain, France, and Canada have tens of millions of doses on \norder--that is the Tamifly, the antiviral agent. We have 2 million. \nThey have tens of millions in Britain, France and Canada.\n  Where does the Tamifly come from? It comes from Switzerland. That is \nwhere the manufacturing facility is located.\n  With our weakened domestic manufacturing capacity in this country for \nboth something like Tamifly but especially vaccines--we do not have \nmanufacturing plants to do it--it makes us dangerously dependent on \nother countries and foreign sources.\n  If there is an outbreak in that country and the manufacturing plant \nis there, it is very unlikely they will send doses to the United States \nof America.\n  The vaccine testing today indicates that an H5-N1 vaccine is safe and \nable to generate a robust immune response in healthy adults. That is \ngood. That shows real progress. This data is preliminary, but it \nrepresents a very positive step that progress is being made. That is an \nimportant first step, however, and this is the key: It would take 6 to \n9 months to produce 180 million of what are called monovalent vaccines. \nIf this virus did have that transmission ability, it would be traveling \nand ravaging our population with no vaccine available. Two doses are \nrequired. We could make 180 million. That is enough to treat 90 million \npeople in 9 months. It would take at least a full year to produce \nenough vaccine for the entire country. By that time, because this virus \ncan be transmitted or could be transmitted so easily, the risk is that \ntens of thousands could die.\n  Some ask, why do I use such high figures? We do have a historical \nprecedent. Look back to 1917 and 1918 and the Spanish flu. That \npandemic killed not just tens of thousands but 40 million people \nworldwide. The Spanish flu virus killed 40 million people worldwide, \nthe majority of whom were kids, children, and young adults between the \nages of 10 and 35.\n  Vaccines were available for the 1957 and 1968 flu pandemics, but they \narrived too late and 104,000 people died in the United States alone.\n  Dr. Hitoshi Ashitani at the World Health Organization warns this time \naround the avian flu virus may be impossible to contain. The geographic \nspread is historically unprecedented.\n  So people ask: Well, why are you giving us, Senator Frist, all this \nbad news? What can and should be done? In my letter sent to Secretary \nLeavitt--and I had the opportunity to discuss it with him a little bit \nlast night--I did ask him to finalize the agency's Pandemic Influenza \nResponse and Preparedness Plan. We need a coordinated, comprehensive, \naggressive plan which draws on public health and homeland security, \nforeign policy and defense expertise.\n  The plan should serve a dual purpose: First, to detect, identify, \ncontain, and respond to threats abroad; and, No. 2, to bolster domestic \npreparedness and response capacity. I also urged the Secretary to \npurchase enough additional Tamifly to treat a large portion of the U.S. \npopulation.\n  These are critical first steps, but we have to do a lot more. We need \nto develop a bold vision of how to address this in future threats--\nwhether they are biological weapons or infectious disease, whether they \nare natural, whether they are accidental, or whether they are \ndeliberate.\n  That is why earlier this year I called for a Manhattan Project for \nthe 21st Century to launch an unprecedented collaboration among the \nFederal Government and industry and academia. We must encourage and \nsupport advanced support and development into\n\n[[Page S10531]]\n\nprevention and treatment. We must enable the detection, the \nidentification, and containment of any emerging or newly emerging \nthreat. And we must ensure our domestic ability to manufacture, \ndistribute, and administer the treatments needed to protect the \nAmerican people. This should be a central focus of our national \nattention.\n  As I mentioned in opening, there is a lot going on in our response to \nnatural disaster today. But we need to keep the focus, as well, on the \npotential for this pandemic. Failing to do so risks the public health \nand our national security.\n  In May 2004, the Senate passed Project BioShield and shortly \nthereafter President Bush signed it into law. Project Bioshield builds \non the Bioterrorism Preparedness Act of 2002 and strengthens our \nNation's defenses against the threat of anthrax, botulism, smallpox, \nEbola, or plague, as well as a radiological fallout from a potential \nterrorist attack.\n  Building on the goals of Project BioShield, the leadership has \nintroduced the Protecting America in the War on Terror Act of 2005 \nearlier this year. I applaud my colleague for the steps we have taken \nthus far, and I applaud them for their continued leadership. But we \nhave much more to do. More work remains to be done. We are in a race \nagainst time, and unlike the flu pandemics of the 20th century, we have \nbeen warned.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort to protect the health, \nwell-being, and security of the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). The Senator from the great State \nof Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be \nallowed to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Coal Energy\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I have stated that each day we \nare in session I am going to try to rise in the Senate to speak about \nthe dependent condition we find ourselves in on foreign oil. Some 58 to \n60 percent of our daily consumption of oil comes from foreign shores. \nThis is not a good position for the United States. No matter how much \nwe sounded the alarm bells over the past several years, it is hard to \nshake the powers that be out of our collective lethargy, to break this \nstranglehold that oil has running through our economy. And it has led \nus to our dependence on oil for well over a majority of our daily \nconsumption.\n  That is not a good position to be in for the defense of our country's \ninterests where we have to protect the free flow of oil to all of the \nvery oil-thirsty world. A lot of those sealanes coming out of the \nPersian Gulf region look to the United States for the military \nprotection to keep those lanes open so oil can flow.\n  Clearly, we ought to, after the reminder of Hurricanes Katrina and \nRita, be on the journey quickly to weaning ourselves from the \ndependence on this oil. That means the collective will of this Nation \nto come together in a major project, like a Manhattan Project or an \nApollo Project. In other words, the moonshot of this decade ought to be \nweaning ourselves from dependence on foreign oil, as going to the Moon \nas a result of the Apollo Project was to the decade of the 1960s.\n  Each day I am going to try to chronicle a new technology so that we \ncan do that. Today I will talk about coal gasification, specifically \ncoal-based integrated gasification. It is otherwise called combined \ncycle technology.\n  Our Nation has an abundance of coal. The United States has the \nlargest proven coal reserves of any Nation in the world. At the current \nproduction levels, U.S. coal reserves should last over the next 250 \nyears. That is the good news; the bad news is coal's high carbon \ncontent relative to other fossil fuels so that in the burning of it, it \nreleases significant quantities of carbon.\n  Right now, coal combustion, the burning of coal, accounts for more \nthan one-third of the world's carbon emissions. Those emissions in the \nair is what we do not want.\n  I will never forget being in Beijing, China, in the year 1981 in the \ndead of winter, January of that year. The city of Beijing was shrouded \nin black smog that was a result of the coal dust settling over that \ncity because the primary source of heat was the burning of coal, with \nno attention to the emissions that allowed all of those particulates to \ngo into the air. The last time I visited Beijing, about 2 years ago, \nafter the dead of winter, I must say they have cleaned up their \nenvironment quite a bit, but they still have a ways to go.\n  We know the negatives with regard to burning coal. Now let's look on \nthe positives; that is, coal gasification or coal-based integrated \ngasification combined cycle technology has much lower pollutant \nemissions, and it holds great promise. Only two such plants exist in \nthe United States today. One of them is in my State of Florida. It is \nrun by Tampa Electric Company. I commend TECO for being one of the \nleaders in this country. My State of Florida is going to have another \nIGCC plant--that is coal gasification--by 2011, through the Orlando \ncommission and the Southern Company. I thank those two companies for \nbeing leaders.\n  This is the technology: First, the coal is gasified using a chemical \nprocess rather than just the burning of coal to generate a synthetic \ngas--or what we call a syngas, synthetic fuels--that is mostly composed \nof hydrogen and carbon monoxide. Then that synthetic gas is used to \nfuel a combustion engine, a turbine, and the exhaust heat is employed \nto produce steam for power generation and for gasification. The process \nhas the potential to be both cleaner and more efficient than just the \nburning of coal in a steam boiler which is done to make electricity, \nand it generates considerable waste heat in the traditional burning of \ncoal that then leads to the release of a myriad of undesirable \nemissions.\n  In contrast, coal gasification isolates and collects nearly all of \nthe impurities, including mercury and a large portion of the carbon, \nbefore the combustion. So those things are not going to be emitted into \nthe atmosphere. The coal is gasified with either oxygen or air, and the \nresulting synthetic gas or syngas is cooled, cleaned, and fired in a \ngas turbine, and the hot exhaust from the gas turbine passes through a \nheat recovery steam generator where it produces steam that drives a \nsteam turbine.\n  Theoretically, the steam gasification process can be applied to any \nlow-quality carbonaceous feedstock. The progress in developing this \ntechnology also raises interesting possibilities with respect to the \nfuture of biomass--either alone or in combination with coal--for \nelectricity production. This has a lot of promise.\n  This whole process, called IGCC, could also be utilized for something \ncalled polygeneration. That is co-producing other high-valued products \nin addition to electricity using gasification.\n  Gasification could be used to produce ultraclean synthetic fuels from \ncoal, and biomass. Carbon dioxide capture and storage would have to be \ndeveloped to address the climate change issues coal-based synthetic \nfuels pose.\n  But the long and short of it is, these synthetic fuels are inherently \nsuperior to crude-oil-driven hydrocarbon fuels. This would help us in \nthe transition to more energy-efficient technologies, such as \ncompression-ignition-engine hybrid electric vehicles.\n  We could exploit our country's huge coal reserves in an \nenvironmentally responsible way. The economic and reliability \nchallenges certainly still exist before these kinds of plants become \nmore readily abundant. And the CO2 carbon capture and \nstorage must be perfected.\n  Those are all challenges we must meet. But it is a promising \ntechnology that would provide the United States with an alternative to \nelectricity produced from natural gas and a way to set us on a course \nto wean ourselves from dependence on foreign oil.\n  Mr. President, I will continue to speak out on all of the \nalternatives in which we can try to sever our dependence on foreign \noil.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the nomination of \nJohn Roberts to be Chief Justice of the United States. I speak about \nthis at an exciting time for this country. This will be the 17th person \nto occupy this position. It is a rarity for this position to become \navailable. I love this Nation.\n\n[[Page S10532]]\n\nI love the institutions of this Nation. More, I love the people of this \nNation.\n  I know, as well, that John Roberts does too. I know from the time I \nhave spent talking with him and hearing his comments, that he too loves \nthis Nation. He loves the people of this Nation and he looks forward to \nits greater greatness into the future. I am looking forward to his \nservice.\n  When the Frenchman, Alexis de Tocqueville, whom many of us quote \noften, visited the United States in the 1830s, he wondered how \nAmericans could maintain a genuine representative government when the \nliberty they enjoyed would suggest that the average citizen would be a \npurely self-interested individual. If we were to give them pure \nliberty, they would, he believed, just pursue self-interests. So how \ncould you have a government that would govern when everybody is focused \non their self-interest?\n  He was amazed to find what kept Americans joined together and with \ntheir government was what he called ``habits of the heart.'' By this, \nhe meant that citizens often were concerned about the greater public \ngood, along with their own narrow self-interests. So, while they had \ntheir own self-interests, their hearts pulled them to a greater public \ngood and these ``habits of the heart.'' That led to their participation \nin political discourse, to be involved in their communities, and take \ncare of their fellow citizens.\n  Throughout our history, our ``habits of the heart'' have informed and \ndriven America's conscience. The people knew the colonial system \nstifled freedom, so they rejected the British monarchy and ultimately \nratified the U.S. Constitution. The people knew in their hearts that \nslavery was wrong, and that terrible institution was rightly brought to \nan end. It was difficult, and it was at a terrible cost. And the people \nknew that the legal promise of equal protection was empty without \nracial justice.\n  Throughout the consideration of Judge Roberts' nomination, many of my \ncolleagues have spoken about a particular issue that I want to discuss, \nand its impact and relationship to that habit of the heart. This \nparticular issue, which is at the center of the debate for Judge \nRoberts, is the right to privacy. They also have demanded that Judge \nRoberts adhere in a few cherished cases to stare decisis, that is, the \npractice of letting a precedent stand for the sake of stability in the \nlaw, regardless of whether the precedent reflects the correct \ninterpretation of the law.\n  What is striking about this discussion is that it has not been \nilluminated by what Tocqueville saw in us long ago--those ``habits of \nthe heart'' that make Americans aware of the greater good and of the \njustice due their fellows citizens.\n  To explain what I mean, consider Judge Roberts' confirmation hearing. \nDuring the hearing, Judiciary Committee members spent a lot of time \ndiscussing section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. It was often mentioned \nthat it was critical for Congress to enact a so-called effects test in \norder to eradicate discrimination in voting practices. Under this test, \na neutrally worded law was to be struck down if it diluted the \npolitical preferences of minority voters, even if that effect was \nintentional. If there was an effect where it had a negative impact on \nvoting for minority groups, it was to be thrown out, it was to be \ndeclared unconstitutional, it was a bad effect.\n  It seems to me there is a broader lesson to be learned by discussion \nof an effects test. And I agree with that effects test in the Voting \nRights Act; it is absolutely right. It seems to me there is a broader \nlesson to be learned about the effects test.\n  During the debate on Judge Roberts, some have argued about whether he \nwill vote to affirm or reject abstract legal principles, without really \nconsidering what the real effects of these principles have been. And \nwhen it comes to the right to privacy and stare decisis, the discussion \nof effects has been obscured, if not ignored altogether.\n  The standard argument we have heard is that cases such as Roe v. Wade \nand Planned Parenthood v. Casey have established the right to privacy, \nand that such cases should be maintained for the sake of ``stability'' \nand ``settled expectations.'' Yet both our heads and our hearts tell us \nthat these decisions deserve much more searching scrutiny. This is in \npart because we rightly resist insulated courts short-circuiting \npolitical debates. But it is also because we rightly believe that these \ndecisions and doctrines have all-too-real effects.\n\n  And so it is with the right to privacy. Some of my colleagues have \nargued that this right, which has been interpreted to guarantee a right \nto abortion, has been beneficial to women. They argue the right to \nabortion has ``freed'' them to pursue such goals as full participation \nin the workforce. But there are certain other effects of this right \nwhich should be identified, if we are to have an honest appraisal of \nwhat this right has accomplished, and what it has wrought.\n  I have pointed out repeatedly that in the wake of Roe, 40 million \nchildren have been aborted in America--40 million souls who could have \nbrightened our existence and made their contribution to the habits of \nthe American heart. But even this general result of abortion's cold \nreality masks the specific costs of the Supreme Court's constitutional \nmisadventure in Roe. For it has become clear in recent years that it is \nthe so-called least among us, the disabled, who have paid a \ndisproportionate price as a result of the right established in Roe and \nother cases.\n  Let me give you some examples. According to recent numbers released \nin November of 2004 by the American College of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists, over 80 percent of pregnancies involving a child with \nDown Syndrome were terminated ``by choice'' in the 1980s and 1990s--80 \npercent. Again, that is ``by choice.'' According to the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention, out of over 55,000 pregnant women \nscreened, 83 percent of unborn children are terminated after testing \npositive for cystic fibrosis. Finally, the CDC noted that for spina \nbifida and similar neural tube defects, at least 80 percent of \npregnancies ``were electively terminated.''\n  These particular numbers are astonishing, and not just because they \nrepresent the wholesale destruction of generations of unborn disabled \nchildren. What makes them painfully ironic is that this trend persists \neven in a society that has extended significant protections to the \ndisabled once they are born.\n  A prime example, of course, is the Americans with Disabilities Act of \n1990, which was an historic achievement. I applaud my colleagues, \nSenators Kennedy and Harkin, and my predecessor, Senator Bob Dole, for \ntheir important role in passing this milestone legislation.\n  Deeming the protection of the disabled a ``human rights issue,'' the \nfirst President Bush called the ADA ``the world's first comprehensive \ndeclaration of equality for people with disabilities.'' His successor, \nPresident Clinton, stated on the ninth anniversary of the passage of \nthe ADA that ``For too long, we have encumbered disabled Americans with \npaternalistic policies that prevent them from reaching their potential. \nBut now, we endeavor to empower individuals with the tools they need to \nachieve their dreams.'' I would note that to dream, they have to be \nalive.\n  In enacting the ADA, the Congress explicitly made the following \nfinding, upon which one of the protections of the ADA was based:\n\n       People with disabilities, as a group, occupy an inferior \n     status in our society, and are severely disadvantaged \n     socially, vocationally, economically, and educationally.\n\n  In worthy fulfillment of the promise of the Declaration of \nIndependence that ``all Men are created equal,'' the Congress issued in \nthe ADA a ``clear and comprehensive national mandate for the \nelimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities.'' \nThere were not qualifiers for it. They did not say at certain places or \npoints of time in life. They said this is a ``clear and comprehensive \nnational mandate for the elimination of discrimination against \nindividuals with disabilities,'' period.\n  To enforce this mandate, Congress explicitly ``invoke[d] the sweep of \ncongressional authority, including the power to enforce the Fourteenth \nAmendment and to regulate commerce, in order to address the major areas \nof discrimination faced day-to-day by people with disabilities.''\n  The ADA establishes extensive protections for persons with \ndisabilities. It\n\n[[Page S10533]]\n\nprotects them when they seek employment; it protects them when they \nattempt to use government services; it protects them when they wish to \nuse public transportation; it protects them even when they want to book \na hotel room or seek access to a restaurant; it even protects the \nhearing-impaired and speech-impaired who want to share in the benefits \nof the revolution in telecommunications.\n  Similarly, 30 years ago, Congress passed the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act, IDEA. In the act, Congress found, among \nother things, that ``[d]isability is a natural part of the human \nexperience and in no way diminishes the right of individuals to \nparticipate in or contribute to society.''\n  These are worthy and grand statements of inclusion and support to \npeople with disabilities.\n  The ADA and the IDEA demonstrate that the disabled need and deserve \nthe protection of the law in order to fulfill their potential.\n  Yet ironically, it is when the disabled are most vulnerable--indeed, \ncompletely voiceless--that our society leaves them completely \nunprotected. The laws offer no shelter to them before they are born. In \nthis dangerous legal vacuum has stepped the Supreme Court. In 1973, \njust 2 years before enactment of the IDEA, the Court invented a right \nto abortion--a right which has proven lethal to legions of disabled \nAmericans. And in a cruel jurisprudential twist, it was none other than \nthe 14th Amendment, which Congress invoked in enacting the ADA, upon \nwhich the Supreme Court based the right to abortion.\n  What does it say about our society that we refuse to acknowledge the \ndamaging effects of Roe on the disabled? Where does the path lead when \nwe ignore the habits of our hearts, which demand that we extend our \ncompassion to these Americans? What have we become when we have \njettisoned the unalienable right to life Thomas Jefferson found self-\nevident in favor of the moral and legal quicksand of Roe?\n  The sad experiences of other countries suggest a few unsettling \nanswers to these questions. For example, China recently criminalized \nabortion for the purpose of sex selection. The reason for this is \nrevealed by figures--an effects test, if you will--showing that 119 \nboys are born in China for every 100 girls--119 boys for every 100 \ngirls. This gender gap can be attributed to the combination of the \nCommunist government's one-child policy with a culture that often \nvalues sons more than daughters. So millions of parents have aborted \nbaby girls hoping to have a boy next time. If current trends continue, \nsome experts say that China could have as many as 40 million men who \ncan't find spouses by the year 2020.\n\n  India faces a similar problem. Sex determination has been a serious \nproblem there since the 1970s, when amniocentesis began to be widely \nused to determine the sex of the unborn child. A 1985 survey revealed \nthat 90 percent of amniocentesis centers were involved in sex \ndetermination, with nearly 96 percent of female fetuses aborted. In \nresponse, India outlawed fetal sex determination for sex selection 8 \nyears ago, but prenatal sex determination through ultrasonography \ncontinues.\n  Indeed, the situation has become so dire that the Indian Medical \nAssociation has appealed to the conscience of that country--the habit \nof the heart of that nation--and the world to save baby girls from \nabortion. The association says that up to 2 million baby girls still \nare killed by abortion every year. A former President of the Indian \nMedical Association told the BBC that the situation has led to a \ndemographic imbalance of up to 50 million fewer women in the country \nthan would be expected.\n  This selective destruction of the unborn in other countries has a \ngrim predecessor in American history: the eugenics movement. As Edwin \nBlack has noted in a book called ``War on the Weak'':\n\n       [T]he eugenics movement slowly constructed a national \n     bureaucratic and juridical infrastructure to cleanse America \n     of its ``unfit.'' Specious intelligence tests, colloquially \n     known as IQ tests, were invented to justify incarceration of \n     a group labeled ``feebleminded.'' Often the so-called \n     feebleminded were just shy, too good-natured to be taken \n     seriously, or simply spoke the wrong language or were the \n     wrong color. Mandatory sterilization laws were enacted in \n     some twenty-seven states to prevent targeted individuals from \n     reproducing more of their kind. Marriage prohibition laws \n     proliferated throughout the country to stop race mixing. \n     Collusive litigation was taken to the U.S. Supreme Court, \n     which sanctified eugenics and its tactics. The goal was to \n     immediately sterilize fourteen million people in the United \n     States and millions more worldwide--the ``lower tenth''--and \n     then continuously eradicate the remaining lowest tenth until \n     only a pure Nordic super race remained. Ultimately, some \n     60,000 Americans were coercively sterilized and the total is \n     probably much higher.\n\n  The source of the word ``eugenics'' is very interesting. The very \nword was coined by Francis Galton, the nephew of Charles Darwin. Galton \nbelieved that ``what nature does blindly, slowly, and ruthlessly, man \nmay do providently, quickly, and kindly.'' In 1883, Galton created a \nnew term for this manmade ordering of life. As Black describes it, \nGalton ``scrawled Greek letters on a hand-sized scrap of paper, and \nnext to them put two English fragments he would join into one. The \nGreek word for `well' was abutted to the Greek word for `born' . . . \nand the word he wrote on that small piece of paper was `eugenics'.'' \nWell born.\n  Among the strongest proponents of eugenics was Margaret Sanger. \nSanger advocated for the mass sterilization of so-called ``defectives'' \nand the wholesale incarceration of the so-called ``unfit.'' She \nparticularly supported the sterilization plan of those people she \ndeemed unfit; she believed this plan would lead to the ``salvation of \nAmerican civilization.'' She also argued for sterilization of those who \nwere ``irresponsible and reckless,'' including those ``whose religious \nscruples prevent their exercising control over their numbers.'' For \nthese people, she contended that ``there is no doubt in the minds of \nall thinking people that the procreation of this group should be \nstopped.'' She repeatedly referred to the lower classes as human waste \nnot worthy of assistance, proudly promoting the views that these \n``weeds'' should be ``exterminated.''\n  Sanger went on to found a group that came to be known as Planned \nParenthood, the very same organization which successfully prevailed \nupon the Supreme Court to reaffirm Roe v. Wade in the 1992 case of \nPlanned Parenthood v. Casey. Sanger's legacy still resonates today.\n  Dr. John Harris of Manchester University in England has offered a \nslightly milder formulation than that of Sanger. He has stated that:\n\n       Eugenics is the attempt to create fine healthy children, \n     and that's everyone's ambition. . . . We're not trying to do \n     this through killing people or eliminating individuals, we're \n     trying to do this by making choices about which people will \n     exist in the future.\n\n  Given the experience of other countries with abortion; given our own \nexperience with abortion of the disabled; and given the natural \nrepugnance most people have with the eugenics movement, I would suggest \nto my colleagues that Roe and other related cases simply flunk the \n``effects test'' we have long applied in the context of voting and \nother rights. These cases have carved millions of voices out of our \ncivic core and cannot withstand moral scrutiny, much less an honest \nlegal examination.\n  The right to privacy as it has been extended has not only weakened \nour legal culture; it has made us poorer as a people. It is impossible \nnot to recognize the significant contributions made by those with \ndisabilities who do survive; they help to bring out the humanity in \neach of us, and we are better for it. Every time I see one of these \nbeautiful children, I am reminded of what joy they bring, and what joy \ntheir counterparts might have brought.\n  How can we, as a nation, stand for the principle of equality, that we \nare all blessed to be alive, that we are all capable of great success \nregardless of disability, and that we are a compassionate society, when \nour laws blithely allow the elective termination of more than 80 \npercent of a vulnerable population. It is incomprehensible.\n  Numerous men, women, and children with disabilities have overcome \nadversity and achieved great successes in their lives. I would like to \ntake a few minutes to share a few of their stories.\n  Here is a picture of Abby Loy. I met her last week when she visited \nmy office. She is a beautiful young girl and\n\n[[Page S10534]]\n\nshe has Down Syndrome. She does modeling and was recently featured in a \nbook called ``Common Threads,'' which illustrates the numerous \naccomplishments achieved by people with Down Syndrome. Abby and her \nmother came to Capitol Hill from Michigan last week to promote \nawareness of disability issues and to illustrate Abby's wonderful life \njourney.\n  Look at this beautiful child. This note is from her parents:\n\n       When Abby was born, physicians and social workers informed \n     our family of all of her potential limitations, \n     developmentally and physically. When we asked what Abby's \n     education path might look like, we were told that she would \n     attend special classrooms. Abby has been successfully \n     educated with support in all regular education classes and \n     continues to grow. We felt Abby would prove herself to be \n     much more capable than others believed . . . It continues \n     today.\n\n  Again, that note is from her parents.\n  It is a tough choice when a mother or a spouse gets a diagnosis in \nutero that a child has Down Syndrome; it is agonizing. I know from my \nown thoughts when we were having our children. Yet I ask people to look \nat the beauty of the child and embrace her. If they can't, there are \nother groups and individuals that will. It is a tough choice, but it is \na child, a beautiful child, a child that can accomplish much.\n  I want to show another example. This one is Samuel. I have had Samuel \nin to testify before a subcommittee I chaired last year. I am rather \npartial to the name Samuel myself. In this picture he is catching fish. \nIt doesn't look like a very big fish and the fish doesn't look too \nhappy, but Samuel is sure happy. He has spina bifida, which most \nmedical professionals call a devastating birth defect. These are his \nparents' words:\n\n       Though we were devastated by learning that our unborn son \n     had spina bifida, we wanted to do all we could to improve the \n     quality of his life. Ending it was never an option. Let's see \n     what we can do to improve it. At 21 weeks gestation, Samuel \n     had fetal repair of his spina bifida lesion. Today he is a 5-\n     year old kindergartner. He is imaginative, funny, and \n     compassionate. He can read, swim, and catch even the \n     fastest lizard. He has touched many lives. We are so \n     thankful for him and are eager to see what great things he \n     will accomplish.\n\n  Normally, about 80 percent of children diagnosed with spina bifida \nare terminated and killed in utero.\n  I have a final example. This is a lady who looks at her Down Syndrome \nas an ``up syndrome'' and has started ``Up with Down Syndrome''. She \nhas served on President Clinton's Committee on Mental Retardation. She \nserved three terms from 1994 to 2000, one of the first two members with \na disability to be appointed to this committee. Her name is Ann M. \nForts. She goes around the country and talks with individuals about \nwhat she can do. The second paragraph of a letter she sent to me is \nparticularly striking:\n\n       As I think about my active and happy life on the upside of \n     my Down Syndrome dis``ability'', I find it extremely \n     frightening to think of how vastly different my life would \n     have been if my parents had taken that ill-conceived \n     professional advice when I was born.\n\n  In other words, to put her in some form of an institution rather than \nbringing her home.\n  These are inspirations to all of us. And if you need further \ninspiration, just go talk to Jimmy, the elevator operator right outside \nthe door of the Senate Chamber, who brightens all of our lives.\n  They will not be defeated by their disabilities, and we celebrate \nthem for that. But think about the many more like them, think about the \nmore than 80 percent of the beautiful capable children, similar to \nAbby, Ann, Jimmy, and Samuel, who are never given a chance because \ntheir lives are terminated before they are born.\n  We should not use bland phrases such as ``right to privacy'' or \n``stare decisis'' to disguise the issue at stake with Judge Roberts' \nnomination to be Chief Justice of the United States. We must be \ntruthful with the American people, as well as ourselves, and admit that \nthis confirmation is, at its root, about the most fundamental and basic \nright of all: the right to life.\n  As Americans, it is our duty to protect and defend the weakest among \nus. The duty is not only mandated by our laws but nurtured by our \nconscience and our habits of the heart.\n  With the recent enactment of the bipartisan partial-birth abortion \nban and bills like the Pre-Natally Diagnosed Awareness Act, which I \nsponsored with Senator Kennedy, we have begun heading in the right \ndirection. However there is still significant work to be done.\n  There is still a glaring inconsistency between the life that we deem \nto be worthy of protection under the Constitution, and the life which \nwe do not. The value placed on certain persons and stages of life seems \nto be arbitrarily assigned. The Constitution clearly states in the 5th \nand 14th Amendments that ``no person'' shall be deprived of ``life, \nliberty, or property without due process of law.''\n  ``No person.'' What does that mean? Does it extend to an unborn \nchild? Is an unborn child a person or merely a piece of property? A \nperson is entitled to inalienable rights established under the \nConstitution and laws of the United States. Property can be done with \nas its master chooses. I posed this question to Judge Roberts during \nhis confirmation hearing. Because this issue may come before the Court \nat some point in the near future, he declined to answer directly. But \nthe persistence of this issue simply underlines the importance of each \nSupreme Court vacancy.\n  I will support the nomination of John Roberts to be Chief Justice of \nthe United States. I will do so based in part on his stellar \ncredentials for the position, but also on my hope and my prayer that he \nunderstands what is at stake when the Supreme Court interprets the \npeople's Constitution--not a sterile debate over arcane legal \nprinciples and Latin doctrines but the very habits of our hearts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I pay tribute to my colleague and friend, \nSenator Brownback, for his eloquent speech on behalf of those who are \ndisadvantaged and deserve protection from the law. He made an \noutstanding speech.\n  I rise to express my support of Judge John Roberts in regard to his \nnomination as Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. I know what the \ncommittee has done, and I know what the majority of Senators will \nlikely do, and that is to vote in favor of Judge Roberts. But I also \nbelieve that an openminded individual, applying Kansas common sense, \nwould reach the same conclusion that I have come to hold.\n\n  It is no small event for a Senator to have the opportunity to \nparticipate in the confirmation of a candidate for the position of \nChief Justice of the Supreme Court. Over the course of our Nation's \nhistory, the Senate has come together 155 times to vote on a Supreme \nCourt Justice. This occasion marks the 17th time to confirm a Chief \nJustice. So I am humbled and honored to be part of this moment of \nhistory.\n  The consultation efforts on behalf of the administration with my \nfellow Senate colleagues in regard to this nomination have been \nextensive. That is probably an understatement. The President has made \ngreat efforts to open dialog and to invite input and to reach out to \nMembers of the Senate. His nomination of Judge John Roberts is a solid \nchoice and not one made in isolation.\n  Kansans understand that the words inscribed on our Founding Fathers' \ndocuments are not as delicate and fragile as the paper on which they \nare written. They know that the power behind these ideas is what serves \nas the foundation of our Nation's democratic government.\n  My sense from Judge Roberts is that he, too, rigorously believes in \nthe power of the ideals set forth in the Constitution. As illustrated \nby his record as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC \nCircuit, he adheres to the guidelines outlined in the Constitution. \nSimply put, he walks the talk.\n  After watching Judge Roberts endure--I guess that is the best word \nfor it--over 20 hours of questioning during the nomination hearings, I \nfind myself not only more familiar with his many qualifications, his \nimpressive experiences, but deeply impressed with his character. Judge \nRoberts' respectful demeanor and his personal humility in the face of \nperiodic abrasive questioning from some are exactly the type of \nqualities that a Chief Justice should\n\n[[Page S10535]]\n\npossess. During the question-and-answer portion of the nomination \nhearing, testimonies of his colleagues, former clients, and others who \nattested to his character, Judge Roberts has shown to be a man of high \nintegrity, wisdom, and fairness. This assessment was echoed from those \nrepresenting a broad range of ideologies.\n  Judge Roberts does possess a brilliant legal mind and a thorough \nunderstanding of the law. He performs his duties with a vigor and a \nmeticulous attention to detail that has been noted by all who have \nspoken about him. As a judge, he approaches a case to understand the \nlegal facts involved and the laws that are affected, while avoiding the \ntemptation to fulfill a specific judicial philosophy. His decisions are \nbased on the merits of the law. His record has earned him the highest \nrating from the American Bar Association, the ABA. It is worth \nmentioning that the ABA has often been referred to by my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle and those on this side as well as the \n``gold standard'' for evaluating judges.\n  Most notably, in his opening statement before the Senate committee, \nJudge Roberts stated:\n\n       Judges and Justices are servants of the law, not the other \n     way around.\n\n  And concerning the rule of law, he went on to say:\n\n       It is what we mean when we say that we are a government of \n     laws and not of men. It is that rule of law that protects the \n     rights and the liberties of all Americans. It is the envy of \n     the world. Because without the rule of law, any rights are \n     really meaningless.\n\n  Clearly, Judge Roberts understands that the role of a judge is not to \nrule based on his personal judgments but to adhere to the laws as they \nare written.\n  The role of the third branch under our Constitution is paramount, as \nthe Supreme Court is often referred to as the ``gatekeeper of \ndemocracy.'' The duty to ensure that legislation passed and executed is \nin line with the Constitution is an important check within our \nGovernment. The lifetime appointment provided for in the Constitution \nis an important protection for our Justices to guard against any \npressure in regard to politics. The forward thinking by the authors of \nour Constitution actually provided for the preservation of our \ndemocracy by including these checks and balances between these three \nbranches.\n  Some have expressed concern about Judge Roberts' relatively young age \nto be nominated to such a powerful position. On the contrary, I believe \nthat age will allow for a term of growth and stability for the Court. \nIn my view, his age is of less importance when compared to his style of \njudging. In his response to my colleague, Senator Hatch, he explains \nthat his style is that of a modest judge. He went on to explain that:\n\n       It means an appreciation that the role of the judge is \n     limited, that a judge is to decide the cases before them, \n     they're not to legislate, they're not to execute the laws.\n\n  However, at the same time, we have witnessed judges acting beyond the \nscope of their duties in making decisions that in a representative \ndemocracy are legislative in their jurisdiction. We have seen that all \nacross the country. This what I consider to be abuse of power is a \nsource of tremendous contention, not only with folks from the great \nState of Kansas but with Americans nationwide on too many issues. In \ntoo many cases, we have seen decisions that are contrary to the will of \nthe people. Americans have questioned the rulings on cases ranging from \nthe Boy Scouts of America to the most publicized recent attack on \nprivate property rights. In Kansas, land is gold. And if land is gold, \nfarmland is platinum. We have a healthy respect for property rights in \nmiddle America. Based on his comments, I believe Judge Roberts holds a \nsimilar opinion.\n  Finally, let us not forget that Judge Roberts is currently a judge. \nHe has already experienced the confirmation process for his judgeship \non the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. Let us also remember \nthat the same accolades that led to Senate approval of his nomination \nby unanimous consent--no disagreement, every Senator--are certainly \napplicable as of today.\n  I am hopeful that through the course of debate on this nomination and \nthe next Supreme Court nomination--the next Supreme Court nomination--\nwe can avoid the destructive partisanship that approached the brink of \nabsolutism and ideology, a different criteria in regard to how we \nselect judges. We have a duty to respectfully reflect the great \ntraditions of this Chamber and rise above partisan bickering. We must \nraise the level of civility in our political discourse more so than \never in regard to considering the nomination of judges.\n\n  Our democracy is only as strong as our governmental institutions. \nJudge Roberts will provide a strong pillar of support in the third \nbranch of our Government. That, and for the reasons I have just \nenumerated, is why I will vote in favor of Judge Roberts' nomination to \nbe the 17th Chief Justice of the United States.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson). The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the nomination \nof Judge John Roberts for Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States. Just 1 year ago, I was in the middle of a heated Senate \ncampaign, and one of the most important issues to the voters of South \nCarolina, an issue that came up again and again, was the topic of \njudges. At that time, I promised the people of South Carolina that I \nwould fight for fair judges who would judge based on the facts and the \nlaw, not on their personal political opinions.\n  Americans simply cannot understand how certain judges arrive at \ndecisions such as banning the Pledge of Allegiance or allowing local \ngovernments to take a person's home and give it to a business simply to \ngenerate more taxes.\n  Judge Roberts clearly understands and demonstrated in his hearings \nthat he is the kind of Justice America needs. He is brilliant, fair, \nand independent. He has proven himself to be a person of integrity who \nis committed to equal justice for all Americans.\n  Judge Roberts is eminently qualified. He has earned the American Bar \nAssociation's highest rating of ``well qualified.'' Before being \nunanimously confirmed by the Senate in 2003 to the DC Court of Appeals, \nJudge Roberts had already established an unmatched resume in the legal \nworld. After graduating in the top of his class from Harvard Law \nSchool, he went on to clerk for Justice William Rehnquist and then \nworked as a top aide in President Reagan's Justice Department. In \nprivate and public practice, he argued an amazing 39 cases before the \nSupreme Court, establishing his reputation as one of the Nation's top \nlitigators.\n  During his hearing, Judge Roberts displayed his humble expertise, and \nI believe Americans warmly welcome his approach to the law. Despite \nwhat some Democrats are saying, Judge Roberts was very forthcoming at \nhis hearing in discussing his judicial philosophy, his legal thinking, \nand his views on a judge's proper role within our constitutional \nframework.\n  The Senate was also allowed to review an unprecedented number of \ndocuments from Judge Roberts' service in the Federal Government \nillustrating his judicial philosophy and legal ability. In question \nafter question, Judge Roberts showed an extraordinary knowledge of the \nlaw and its history. Without the use of notes or staff, Judge Roberts \neasily recalled facts from hundreds of years of case law.\n  I was pleased to see during the hearings that Judge Roberts stuck \nstrictly to the Ginsburg rule, choosing not to comment on cases or \nissues that are likely to appear before the Court. In her hearings, \nJustice Ginsburg emphatically declared that she could give ``no hints, \nno forecasts, no previews'' as to how she would decide on future cases. \nShe was right to do so. Judges are expected to be impartial and fair, \nlooking at each case without prejudice. Senators who expected Judge \nRoberts to answer questions that required him to prejudge cases were \nignoring the Code of Judicial Ethics and, I suspect, playing politics \nwith the confirmation process for partisan reasons.\n  Nominees should never compromise their judicial independence and \nability to rule fairly by advocating positions on issues that could \ncome before them. Judges are not politicians. In fact, Judge Roberts \nhimself put it best during the hearings when he said:\n\n       Judges wear black robes because it doesn't matter who they \n     are as individuals. That's\n\n[[Page S10536]]\n\n     not going to shape their decision. It's their understanding \n     of the law that will shape their decision.\n\n  Judge Roberts has earned praise for his conduct during the \nconfirmation hearings, and he has solidified broad, bipartisan support.\n  I believe Judge Roberts deserves a fair up-or-down vote before the \nSupreme Court starts its next session in October. It is important to \nhave a Chief Justice on the bench for the start of the session and to \nhave the Court at full strength.\n  Based on my July meeting with Judge Roberts, based on his \nqualifications and his exemplary performance before the Judiciary \nCommittee, I am confident he will strictly interpret the law and not \nlegislate from the bench.\n  Judge Roberts has all the qualities Americans want in their Chief \nJustice. It is critical that the Chief Justice have the ability to \nlisten to all sides of a debate and work well with each Associate \nJustice. Judge Roberts has clearly displayed his patience, fairness, \nand respect.\n  The votes tomorrow for Judge Roberts will show that an overwhelming \nmajority of Senators agree. The votes tomorrow against Judge Roberts \nwill reveal the Senators who would not support any of President Bush's \nnominees, no matter how qualified they are.\n  I fully support the nomination of Judge Roberts. I will cast my vote \nin his favor for confirmation, and I urge all of my colleagues to \nsupport Judge Roberts as the next Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I rise today, like my colleague who spoke \njust before me, to support the nomination of John Roberts to be the \nChief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. To those who know me, to those \nwho have heard me talk on this subject, this is no great surprise. But \nvoting on a Supreme Court nomination is a very rare task. It is more \nhistoric now, as the Senate will consider a nominee for the top job of \nthe Court.\n  The question I ask today is, Why should America care about this \ndebate? This debate is more significant than a lifetime appointment of \nChief Justice of the Supreme Court.\n  This debate is more significant than the influence that one single \nindividual brings who is chosen. This debate is about future decisions \nthat will affect the lives of every American, that will affect our \nchildren and our children's children. From our civil liberties, to \nproperty rights, to questions of life and death, to safety in \ncommunities, to the very basic freedoms, there is no area in our daily \nlives that is not somehow affected by the judicial decisions of the \nU.S. Supreme Court. The decisions made by the Court today will have a \nlasting effect long after we have gone from this institution. It is \nessential, absolutely essential, that we confirm not only competent, \nimpartial judges, but those who are the very brightest and those who \nare good citizens and understand the task for which they have been \nnominated and confirmed.\n  Over the course of the last several weeks we have all had the \nopportunity to hear from legal experts, from political analysts, about \nJudge Roberts and the chances of the success of his nomination and his \nconfirmation. We have had a process of very detailed hearings where our \ncolleagues, many of whom are lawyers, have asked the most appropriate \nquestions, with a lot of thought, a lot of time to deliver the \nquestions, and we have seen the response of a brilliant lawyer, with no \nnotes, quote case law from years past that appropriately answered the \nquestions that did not affect future cases the Court might hear.\n  Now, I am not a lawyer and perhaps I do not judge Judge Roberts' \nlegal background the same way lawyers might judge it, but I do \nunderstand people. I understand when I meet somebody who is a good \nperson. I have met Judge Roberts. This is a good person. This is an \nindividual in whom America can be proud when they refer to him as Chief \nJustice.\n  A couple weeks ago I had the opportunity to have Judge Roberts in my \noffice. We talked about his background, his life experiences, we talked \nabout our families. I did not quiz him about legal precedent or court \nrulings. I did not present him with hypothetical cases or his position \non hot topics of the day. That, quite frankly, was not the ground I was \nfocused to go on. Personally, as a husband and a father, I wanted to \nknow where Judge Roberts truly stood and if he understood the job he \nhas been asked to do. I wanted to know if he understood the \nresponsibilities not just as a lawyer, not just as a Justice, but as a \nhusband and as a father, and the implications of the decisions he would \nrule on and how they would affect not just his family but in a real way \nthe people of North Carolina.\n  As Senators, we are all responsible for constituencies. I am \nresponsible for more than 8\\1/2\\ million individuals in North Carolina, \nand I wanted to know, quite frankly, if Judge Roberts intends to \npreserve our Nation's constitutional principles by interpreting law, \nnot by making law. I am proud today to tell you, based upon the answers \nhe gave to me in his testimony in front of the Judiciary Committee, I \nam confident he will do just that--interpret the law, not write the \nlaw. Judge Roberts, as every person has heard, has the academic and the \nprofessional credentials to serve not only as a Supreme Court Justice \nbut as Chief Justice.\n  There is something that concerns me today. It concerns me, and it \nshould concern the American people: This vote will not be unanimous. \nThis vote will be far from unanimous based upon the reports from \nSenators. Why? Politics. I am not sure it has ever permeated the \nprocess to the degree it has in this. As we stand here today, with one \nof the brightest nominees, ready to confirm, some in this institution \nare already suggesting the next nominee has no chance. There is not a \nperson who has been nominated. There is a group of names that has been \ntalked about. I might remind Senators that Judge Roberts was never \ntalked about in the group that was purported to come up in the \nPresident's first nomination. Yet some suggest we are going to move the \nbar even farther for the next nominee who comes through.\n  The divisiveness has to stop in this institution. We choose the best \nand the brightest to serve this country. If we consistently move that \nbar, if we consistently dig to find things that no other Congress has \nlooked for, if we are not careful, no one will want that job. If we are \nnot careful, the best and the brightest legal minds in this country who \nwould serve on the bench and serve with distinction, regardless of the \nparty they are from, when they get that call, will say, Mr. President, \nI want to pass. I can't put my family through it. I can't put myself \nthrough it. The risk of doing it is too great to everything around me, \nto make a commitment to serve my country.\n  I ask all of us, what message are we sending to our children when the \nbest and the brightest pass, when they elect not to go through the \nprocess we in this body have control of?\n  This is a defining time for the Senate. This will determine who is \nwilling in the future to actually serve their country and to serve in \none of the single most important areas, the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  I am confident Judge Roberts holds the academic credentials, he holds \nthe professional credentials but, more importantly, I am confident \ntoday that Judge Roberts is a good man. He deserves the support of \nevery Member of the Senate to become the Chief Justice of the U.S. \nSupreme Court.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina yields. The \nSenator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I thank you for the time. It is for me a \nprivilege to speak on behalf of Judge Roberts, but especially because \nwhile I have voted on hundreds of nominations for President Clinton and \nnow at the present time President Bush, this is the first time I will \ncast a vote, an affirmative vote, for a member of the U.S. Supreme \nCourt, and, perhaps, if Judge Roberts lives long enough, the only time \nI will cast one on behalf of the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme \nCourt.\n  It is for that reason that I asked Judge Roberts to come see me. I \nenjoyed a delightful visit with him prior to announcing my affirmative \ndecision to vote for him without qualification, without reservation, or \nany reluctance. He is, in short, a brilliant nominee and I believe he \nwill be a brilliant judge\n\n[[Page S10537]]\n\nwho will make us proud for years and years to come.\n  When I ran for the Senate, I ran as someone with a hat in the \npolitical arena. It is an experience where you state your position, you \nask for votes. That is a fundamentally different exercise than being a \njudge. A judge is not someone who comes as a candidate asking for a \nvote, posturing in any fashion, and playing politics. The nature of the \njudicial branch, even the executive branch, is fundamentally different \nfrom the judicial branch. Ours is to make law. The president is to \nexecute the law. The judge is to interpret that law.\n  When I was running for an election certificate, I was asked \nrepeatedly about how I would judge nominees to the Court. The \nunderlying question was always, what is your litmus test? Do you have a \nsingle issue litmus test? I promised Oregonians that I would have no \nlitmus test and would vote for qualified Democrats and Republicans from \nthe administration that put them forward because I truly believe we \nhave to remember the characteristic distinctions between the roles of \nthese different branches of Government. What I did tell them is that I \nwould judge them by their intelligence, their integrity, and their \ntemperament. By that standard, I am not sure we will ever have the \nprivilege of voting for a nominee who is more intelligent than Judge \nJohn Roberts. His academic credentials are without equal. He is clearly \nqualified by his schooling and by his service in the legal community. \nHis integrity is beyond reproach as well. He has conducted himself \nhonorably. There has been no hint of any kind of scandal that would \ndisqualify him from holding high public office. I like especially the \nfact that he and his wife late in life decided to adopt two beautiful \nchildren. Every parent in America, I think, squirmed when they watched \nthe concerns the Robertses had when President Bush announced his \nnomination--the little boy Jack was fidgeting on a public occasion, and \nall chuckled and recognized the humanity of Judge and Mrs. Roberts, and \nalso related to that experience.\n  When it comes to temperament, I think there are many qualifications \nJudge Roberts has that are evident in his entire life. He is \noverwhelmingly qualified. He has promised fidelity to the law. He has \nsaid:\n\n       My obligation is to the Constitution, that's the oath.\n\n  The quality in his temperament, I think, that was particularly \nmeaningful was the humility he demonstrated in the give and take with \nour colleagues on the Judiciary Committee. The Judiciary Committee is \ncomposed of many very bright men and women, and the back and forth was \nthrilling to watch for someone who loves constitutional law. He went \ninto a heavyweight ring and he came out the champ. I was impressed and \nexpressed that to him.\n  The quality of humility is one that I think bears mentioning. Judge \nRoberts said, in fact, to that committee:\n\n       A certain humility should characterize the judicial role. \n     Judges and justices are servants of the law, not the other \n     way around.\n\n  What he is saying is that judges and justices are bound by the law, \nas we are as individual citizens, and as Members of the Senate we are \nbound by the law, and so are judges. That humility is important in the \nlife of a judge.\n  I remember a great public servant once said:\n\n       Pride is concerned with who is right, humility is concerned \n     with what is right.\n\n  I believe Judge Roberts will be focused on what is right, not who is \nright. The greatest threat Judge Roberts identified to the law is that \nof a judicial branch beginning to act more like a political branch.\n  That is something many of my colleagues have spoken to. It is \nsomething I learned about in law school in a constitutional law class. \nIt is called the political question doctrine. What that doctrine refers \nto is the wisdom that judges need to have, the humility they have to \nnot intersect questions that are in the political arena, part of the \ndiscussion, the debate between we the people about where we want to go. \nSo, instead of reaching over the people and deciding it when the issue \nis ripe for settlement at the ballot box, judges should be restrained \nin overreaching and doing things from on high that, frankly, disturb \nthe body politic here in our country. I believe Judge Roberts will have \nthat kind of restraint, that kind of humility.\n  Judge Roberts made a quote in his opening statement, again without \nnotes; something he feels obviously in his bones and knows in his heart \nand mind. He said:\n\n       The one threat to the rule of law is the tendency on behalf \n     of some judges to take that legitimacy--the legitimacy of the \n     law, and that authority--the authority of the law, and to \n     extend it into areas where they are going beyond the \n     interpretation of the Constitution into where they are making \n     the law. Judges have to recognize that their role is a \n     limited one.\n\n  An aside, Mr. President, I like his metaphor to an umpire.\n\n       Judges have to recognize that their role is a limited one. \n     That is the basis of their legitimacy. Judges have to have \n     the courage to make the unpopular decisions when they have \n     to. That sometimes involves striking down acts of Congress. \n     That sometimes involves ruling that acts of the executive are \n     unconstitutional. That is a requirement of the judicial oath. \n     You have to have that courage.\n\n  What I find in that statement is an understanding of the political \nquestion doctrine. He is saying we have to be humble in most all \ninstances; to respect the rights of the people. But he is also saying \nyou have to have courage to interpret the Constitution in a way that is \nfaithful to it.\n  As Cicero once said:\n\n       We are in bondage to the law so that we might be free.\n\n  I know my time is up, so I yield the floor and urge my colleagues to \nvote in support of Judge Roberts. If you can't vote for him, it is hard \nto know for whom one could vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Under the previous order, the time from 11 a.m. to 12 p.m. shall be \nunder the control of the Democratic leader or his designee. The Chair \nrecognizes the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, tomorrow the Senate will vote on the \nnomination of John Roberts to be the 17th individual to serve as Chief \nJustice of the United States. I have put an enormous amount of \ncontemplation and consideration into my vote on this nomination. Some \nmay wonder why this has been such a difficult decision for me. Clearly \nJudge Roberts is an individual of great accomplishment. He has an \noutstanding educational background and keen legal skills. He is a \nthoughtful, decent, modest person, impressively knowledgeable about \nconstitutional law and the Court.\n  I watched much of the judiciary hearings. I have reviewed briefs and \ncourt decisions written by Judge Roberts. And, thanks to his \ngenerosity, I met with Judge Roberts for more than an hour in my office \nlast week, talking one on one.\n  What I did not find in the hearings or in Judge Roberts' writings or \nin our meeting was a clear indication that Judge Roberts understands \nthe critical role the courts play in protecting the civil rights of \nAmericans and in allowing those who have suffered discrimination to be \nable to seek recourse and affirm their rights in Federal court. I was \nseeking some indication that Judge Roberts understands that the issues \nthat come before the high Court cannot always be viewed with a cool, \nlegal dispassion and detachment, but that the Court and its members \nplay a critical role in protecting the powerless in our country.\n  This is of grave concern to me because the individual who fills this \nSupreme Court vacancy will have the ability to enhance and strengthen \nor undermine and weaken the Americans With Disabilities Act.\n  Judge Roberts' nomination comes at a time when there is a very \nsignificant clash occurring between the Supreme Court and Congress over \nwhether Congress has the authority to require the States to comply with \nantidiscrimination laws. Unfortunately, the law caught at the center of \nthis clash is the Americans With Disabilities Act.\n  As I have deliberated on this nomination, the first and foremost \nquestion in my mind has been this: What kind of Court would the Roberts \nCourt be? Would it be a Court that serves as a refuge of last resort \nfor the powerless in our society? Or, would it be a Court that will \ncontinue down a disturbing path seen in the later years of the \nRehnquist Court, a path that limits the\n\n[[Page S10538]]\n\nability of Congress to pass legislation that provides meaningful \nprotections to individuals, including the 54 million Americans with \ndisabilities?\n  Unfortunately, after carefully reviewing the record and talking with \nJudge Roberts, I am unable to conclude that a Roberts Court would \nguarantee the rights of the powerless and those with disabilities.\n  Earlier this year we celebrated the 15th anniversary of passage of \nthe Americans With Disabilities Act. The ADA, as it is known, prohibits \ndiscrimination in employment against people with disabilities. It \nrequires that the services and programs of local and State governments \nbe accessible and usable by individuals with disabilities. Since its \nenactment, the ADA has provided opportunity and access for 54 million \nAmericans with disabilities who, prior to the law's enactment, \nroutinely faced prejudice, discrimination, and exclusion in their \neveryday lives.\n  As Members of this body know very well, I was the lead sponsor of the \nADA. I championed it because I had seen discrimination against the \ndisabled firsthand, growing up with my brother Frank, who was deaf. \nDuring his childhood, my brother was sent halfway across the State to a \nschool for the ``deaf and dumb.'' He was told his career path would be \nlimited because surely someone who is deaf cannot contribute to \nsociety. Throughout his life, Frank experienced active discrimination \nat the hands of both private individuals and government, and \nthis served to limit the choices before him. Frank's experience was by \nno means unusual, as Congress documented extensively prior to enactment \nof the ADA. As part of the writing of that bill, we gathered a massive \nrecord of blatant discrimination against those with disabilities. We \nhad 25 years of testimony and reports on disability discrimination, 14 \ncongressional hearings, and 63 field hearings by a special \ncongressional task force that were held in the 3 years prior to the \npassage of the Americans With Disabilities Act. We received boxes \nloaded with thousands of letters and pieces of testimony gathered in \nhearings and townhall meetings across the country from people whose \nlives had been damaged or destroyed by discrimination. We had markups \nin 5 different committees, had over 300 examples of discrimination by \nStates. I know; I was there. I was the chairman of the Disability \nPolicy Subcommittee.\n\n  Yet since enactment of the ADA the Court has repeatedly questioned \nwhether Congress had the constitutional authority to require States to \ncomply with the ADA. Amazingly, it questioned whether Congress \nadequately documented discrimination. In 2000, the Supreme Court held \nin a 5-to-4 decision that an experienced nurse at a university \nhospital--who was demoted after being diagnosed with breast cancer \nbecause her supervisor did not like being around sick people--was not \ncovered by the ADA. Why? Because she had the misfortune to work for a \nState hospital.\n  In contrast, last year, by a 5-to-4 decision, the Court held that \nCongress did have the authority to require States to make courthouses \naccessible.\n  This year, the Court will look at whether a State is required to make \na prison accessible. There is no guarantee that the Court will come to \nthe same result. Instead, we could end up with a crazy patchwork where \ncourthouses are accessible, but maybe libraries are not, perhaps \nprisons are accessible, but employment offices are not.\n  When we passed the ADA, we in Congress did not forbid employment \ndiscrimination against the disabled unless they worked for the State. \nWe didn't say some services must be accessible. But that is what the \nCourt has been saying. Talk about judicial activism.\n  I would point out here, in those years when we were developing the \nAmericans With Disabilities Act, my friend Senator Hatch was ranking \nmember on the Judiciary Committee. They had their staffs look to make \nsure we passed the constitutional tests. Attorney General Dick \nThornburgh, a great supporter of the Americans With Disabilities Act, \nhad the Department of Justice look and make sure we were passing \nconstitutional muster. Boyden Gray, in the White House Counsel's \nOffice, looked at it to make sure we passed constitutional muster. \nFifteen Ronald Reagan appointees to the National Council on Disability, \nworking with constitutional law experts, looked at the bill to make \nsure it passed constitutional muster. Yet the Court, by 5-to-4 \ndecisions, is undermining all we did.\n  As a result, 15 years after passage of the ADA, the rights of those \nwith disabilities still hang in the balance. Those rights will be \ndetermined in a very significant way by a potential Roberts Court. As \nChief Justice, Mr. Roberts personally will have a major role in \ndetermining whether the balance swings for or against people with \ndisabilities. If Judge Roberts lends his voice to those on the Court \nwho believe in the rights of States over the rights of people, \nindividuals with disabilities in this country will face enormous \nsetbacks.\n  Judge Roberts was asked many questions at his hearing about \ncongressional power, the ADA, and the rights of the disabled. I posed \nsimilar questions in our meeting. Judge Roberts chose not to answer \nthose questions in any significant or revealing detail. Without some \ngreater assurance that he would give deference to the policies passed \nby Congress, without solid assurance that he would be a defender of the \nability of the less powerful to go to court and have their rights \nvindicated, without those assurances, I am left guessing and \nspeculating, and that is not good enough.\n  Without clear assurances from him personally, I am left only with \nJudge Roberts' paper record and, quite frankly, it is a record that \ndoes not bode well for people seeking to vindicate their rights. In the \ninterests of brevity, let me cite one example from Judge Roberts' \ntenure with the Department of Justice, the 1982 case of Board of \nEducation v. Rowley. In the Rowley case, a trial court ruled that \nFederal law required the State to provide a sign language interpreter \nfor an 8-year-old student who was deaf. The Second Circuit Court of \nAppeals affirmed that decision. The case then went to the Supreme Court \nand the Department of Justice had to decide whether to support the \nstudent and argue in favor of an interpreter, or support the local \nschool board and the State and argue against an interpreter.\n  In a memo to the Attorney General, Judge Roberts said the lower court \ndecisions amounted to an exercise of judicial activism and the lower \ncourts had inappropriately ``substituted their own judgment of \nappropriate educational policy.''\n  This was not the language of a lawyer merely representing the views \nof a client. This was the language of an attorney in a policymaking \nposition at the Department of Justice, suggesting that the Government \nshould have weighed in against the right of a deaf student to have \naccess to an interpreter under the Education of the Handicapped Act, a \npredecessor of today's Individuals With Disabilities Education Act. In \nother words, Judge Roberts thought that this law, the primary Federal \nlaw to ensure that students with disabilities have access to the same \neducational opportunities as all other students, should be interpreted \nnarrowly rather than broadly.\n  That is not the quality I am looking for in a Chief Justice. I want a \nChief Justice who brings a passion for justice to the law; who does not \nlose sight of the real people whose lives and livelihoods are at stake \nin the Court's decisions. Some supporters of Judge Roberts have argued \nthat the Rowley case was more than two decades ago and Judge Roberts' \nviews on statutory interpretation and on the ability of individuals to \nprotect their rights through the courts may have evolved since then. \nBut how are we in this body to know that, particularly when the White \nHouse has failed to provide us with all requested and directly relevant \ndocuments?\n  Of greatest interest to me are the decisionmaking memoranda written \nby Judge Roberts during his tenure as Principal Deputy Solicitor \nGeneral. Again, in his role as Principal Deputy Solicitor General--a \nposition sometimes referred to as a ``political deputy'' because it is \na political appointment--Judge Roberts was not merely representing a \nclient but was involved in crafting the Department's legal positions in \nsome of the most important cases in recent years.\n  During his tenure as Principal Deputy, Judge Roberts argued before \nthe\n\n[[Page S10539]]\n\ncourt that individuals shouldn't be allowed to go to court to enforce \ntheir rights under the Medicaid statute, that children shouldn't have \naccess to courts to enforce their rights under the Adoption Assistance \nand Child Welfare Act, and that courts should take a restrictive view \nof remedies available under title IX and other civil rights laws.\n  Given the decision of the White House to withhold these documents \nfrom the Senate, I am forced to draw my conclusions on what I do know.\n  Before I conclude my remarks, I would like to describe an example of \none of the ``real people'' I referred to earlier, a woman by the name \nof Beverly Jones. Ms. Jones, who testified before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee on Judge Roberts' nomination, has been using a wheelchair \nsince a 1984 traffic accident in 1990, the year we passed ADA. She \ncompleted court reporting school and set out to work as a courtroom \nstenographer in order to support her family. But what she found as she \ntraveled throughout the State of Tennessee was she couldn't get the \njobs in a great majority of Tennessee's courthouses. She was forced to \nchoose between asking complete strangers to carry her into the \ncourthouse or into inaccessible rest rooms or simply turn down \nemployment opportunities. That is an unacceptable choice for a single \nmother supporting two kids.\n  Ms. Jones testified to the committee that she spoke to Federal, \nState, and local officials about the problem of inaccessible \ncourtrooms, but her entreaties were met with indifference, until she \nfiled suit. I would like to quote from Ms. Jones' testimony about her \nexperience because I think it vividly illustrates what is at stake.\n  She said:\n\n       The door that I thought had been opened [with passage of \n     the ADA] was still closed and my freedom to live my dream was \n     still a dream, and turning into a nightmare. Nobody took \n     either me or the law seriously until I and others brought a \n     lawsuit.\n\n  That is what is at stake today--the right of 64 million Americans \nwith disabilities to live their dreams, the right of the powerless in \nour society, the disenfranchised, to turn to the courts to take them \nseriously.\n  Unfortunately, I am not yet persuaded that a Roberts Court would \nprotect these rights.\n  For this reason, I will be voting no on this nomination.\n  Certainly, I bear no personal animosity whatsoever toward Judge \nRoberts. Within this body, there are many people on the other side of \nthe aisle whom I respect, admire, and value as friends. But I don't \noften vote with them because I have a different viewpoint on many \nissues. As I said, in our personal meeting, I found Judge Roberts to be \na very decent, modest individual.\n  I hope the future will prove me wrong about Judge Roberts. I hope he \nproves to be a Justice who recognizes that discrimination in this \ncountry occurs in many areas and that Congress has both the authority \nand the duty to remedy it.\n  Judge Roberts will have an immediate opportunity to do just that. In \nthis upcoming term, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in a case \nthat will once again examine the question of whether Congress had the \nauthority to order States to make public facilities accessible to \npeople with disabilities. Knowing this, during our meeting I tried to \nconvey to Judge Roberts how discrimination against people with \ndisabilities was deeply ingrained across the decades and across the \ncenturies prior to passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act. I \ntalked with him in detail about how prior to passage of ADA people were \ninstitutionalized, segregated, taken from their families, taken from \ntheir communities, excluded from schools, excluded from educational \nopportunities, excluded from employment opportunities, excluded from \nall aspects of daily life, shopping, going to the movies, playing golf, \non and on, simply because of a disability. I explained how people with \ndisabilities were excluded in the same way African Americans were \nexcluded prior to the passage of the Civil Rights Act.\n  In closing, let me quote from Thurgood Marshall in the Cleburne case, \nCity of Cleburne v. Texas. Here is what Justice Thurgood Marshall had \nto say. Here is a sense of real injustice and that something needs to \nbe done about it. This is what Justice Marshall said:\n\n       The mentally retarded have been subject to a ``lengthy and \n     tragic history,'' of segregation and discrimination that can \n     only be called grotesque. . . . A regime of state-mandated \n     segregation and degradation soon emerged that in its \n     virulence and bigotry rivaled, and indeed paralleled, the \n     worse excesses of Jim Crow. Massive custodial institutions \n     were built to warehouse the retarded for life; the aim was to \n     halt reproduction of the retarded and ``nearly extinguish \n     their race.'' Retarded children were categorically excluded \n     from public schools, based on the false stereotype that all \n     were ineducable and on the purposed need to protected \n     nonretarded children from them. State laws deemed the \n     retarded ``unfit for citizenship.''\n\n  That has been the experience for the last 200 years or more in this \ncountry. We stepped in to remedy that with the Americans with \nDisabilities Act.\n  I hope Judge Roberts keeps these things uppermost in his mind and in \nhis heart. Only time will tell.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the nomination of \nJudge John Roberts to be Chief Justice of the United States.\n  I thank my colleague from Iowa for his heartfelt and outstanding \nwords.\n  Votes like this come about so rarely that many Senators have spent \ntheir entire careers in this body without ever having had the \nopportunity to vote on a Chief Justice.\n  And most of us in the Senate today will likely never again vote on a \nnominee to that incalculably important position.\n  That is why I have been troubled about how some have characterized \nthe votes of conscientious Senators in this case--Senators from my \nparty who have struggled with, and deliberated over, Judge Roberts's \nrecord in arriving at their decisions.\n  As will be borne out tomorrow, Democratic Senators have given this \nvote the profound and serious consideration that it deserves.\n  We are not voting monolothically, but rather each according to his or \nher own conscience.\n  And that is what this vote is.\n  It is a question of principle--not of politics, partisanship, or \npositioning, as some have cynically suggested.\n  Democrats have truly struggled with this vote. I know I have. Like \nsome others, I did not make up my mind until late on the night before \nthe committee vote.\n  We are not marching in lockstep, with nary a dissent like my \ncolleagues across the aisle.\n  But while this vote was a close call for many, (Like myself) the next \none may not be.\n  While this nomination did not warrant an attempt to block the nominee \non the floor of the Senate, the next one might.\n  If the President sends us a nominee who, like Janice Rogers Brown, \nbelieves that the New Deal was the triumph of a ``socialist \nrevolution,'' there will be a fight.\n  If the President sends us a nominee who, like Priscilla Owen, was \ncriticized by her conservative colleague--Alberto Gonzalez--for an \n``unconscionable act of judicial activism,'' there will be a fight.\n  If the President sends us a nominee who, like Miguel Estrada, refuses \nto answer any real questions and whose record is not made fully \navailable, there will be a fight.\n  If the President sends us a nominee who is committed to an agenda of \nturning the clock back on civil rights, workers' rights, individual \nautonomy, or other vital Constitutional protections, there will likely \nbe a fight.\n  And it will be a fight without any winners.\n  So, Mr. President, on the eve not only of the confirmation vote on \nJohn Roberts, but also the President's nomination of a replacement for \nthe seat of Justice O'Connor--for more than two decades a pivotal swing \nvote on the High Court--I hope and pray that the President chooses to \nunite rather than divide; that he chooses consensus over confrontation.\n  Now let me return to the vote at hand.\n  This vote should be viewed against a unique--and troubling--\nhistorical backdrop.\n  Many are saying the Senate should not bring ``politics'' into this. \nTheir\n\n[[Page S10540]]\n\nquarrel should be with the President of the United States if they feel \nthat ``politics'' means figuring out a judge's ideological, judicial \nphilosophy. Politics, if you define it as that, was introduced by a \nPresident who vowed that, if given the opportunity, he would name to \nthe Supreme Court Justices in the ``mold'' of Clarence Thomas and \nAnthony Scalia.\n  Given the President's campaign promise and repeated declarations, \nthere is a presumption that any nominee the President sends to the \nSenate is in that ``mold.''\n  The presumption is especially strong--and is particularly hard to \novercome--with a nominee who was carefully vetted, researched, and \ninterviewed at sufficient length by a President who professed a desire \nto nominate people in the mold of Thomas and Scalia; and, with a \nnominee who is eagerly embraced by those groups who support the views \nof Thomas and Scalia and who want to change America through the Courts;\n  The presumption can be rebutted, of course. And the way it can be \nrebutted is through the answering of questions and through the \nproduction of relevant documents. And here, regrettably, there was much \nlacking.\n  To be fair, Judge Roberts did partially rebut the presumption. He \nmade some inroads.\n  Judge Roberts has a keen and impressive intellect. We all know that. \nHis encyclopedic knowledge of the law and eloquent presentation \ncertainly confirmed what his colleagues have said about him--that he is \none of the best advocates, if not the best advocate in the Nation.\n  But being brilliant and accomplished is not the number one criterion \nfor elevation to the Supreme Court--there are many who would use their \nconsiderable talents and legal acumen to set America back. So, while \nlegal brilliance is to be considered, it is never dispositive.\n  In addition, very good lawyers know how to avoid tough questions. \nPeople have said that one of the reasons the nominee was so effective \narguing in the Supreme Court is that he mastered the trick of making \nthe point he wanted to make, rather than answer the question asked.\n  When I reviewed the transcript in the week after the hearings \nconcluded but before we were called on to vote, there was often less \nthan met the ear.\n  There is an obligation of nominees to answer questions fully and \nforthrightly, because they are essential to figuring out a nominee's \njudicial philosophy and ideology--to me, the most important criteria in \nchoosing a Justice.\n  Many of us were disappointed in his failure to answer so many \nquestions and is one of the contributing factors to the no votes that \nwill be cast against Judge Roberts.\n  Add to that the refusal of the administration to allow the Senate to \nexamine important and relevant documents, and we are voting on a hunch. \nSenators voting on the position of Chief Justice should not be \nrelegated to voting on a ``hunch.''\n  We should not be left to guesswork, impressions, and hunches.\n  There was a bit of a game of hide and seek going on--as much as \nSenators tried to seek out his views, many remained hidden away.\n  That is why that I so badly hope that the next nominee will be more \nforthcoming and will answer more questions about his or her legal \nviews, and that all relevant documents will be provided.\n  But, the answering of questions is only a means to an end--it is a \nmeans of finding out what kind of judge, or Justice, a nominee will \nmake.\n  In this case, because there were not enough questions answered or \ndocuments provided, we are still unsure of the answer to the central \nquestion: Who is Judge Roberts?\n  Particularly troubling to me are the eerie parallels between Judge \nRoberts's testimony and then-Judge Thomas's, especially given President \nBush's declaration that he would nominate Justices in the mold of \nJustice Thomas.\n  The echoes of then-Judge Thomas's empty reassurances that he was a \nmainstream jurist are ringing in the ears of every Senator who listened \nto many nearly identical statements from Judge Roberts last week.\n  I was particularly troubled by his answers in two areas--the \nconstitutional right to privacy and the Congress Commerce Clause power \nto protect the rights and improve the lives of the American people.\n  At his hearing, for example, Judge Roberts said that he believes \n``there is a right to privacy protected as part of the liberty \nguarantee in the due process clause.'' At his hearing, then-Judge \nThomas made almost the identical statement. As a Supreme Court Justice, \nhowever, Justice Thomas has repeatedly urged the most narrow \ninterpretation of a privacy interest possible, in Casey, in Lawrence, \nand at every other opportunity.\n  At his hearing, Judge Roberts repeatedly assured the Committee that \nhe had ``no quarrel'' with various Supreme Court decisions on issues of \nprivacy, women's rights, civil rights, education, and other important \nissues. The same assurance in nearly identical words were made by \nJustice Thomas at his hearings, but when given the opportunity to \nconsider those cases with which he had ``no quarrel'' from the bench, \nJustice Thomas voted to overrule.\n  At his hearing, Judge Roberts repeatedly assured the Committee that \nhe had ``no agenda.'' The same assurance was made by Justices Thomas \nand Scalia at their hearings.\n  Besides these concerns about Judge Roberts's views on the right to \nprivacy and on the Establishment Clause, I also was troubled by his \nanswers on the Commerce Clause. I asked him if he would disagree with \nJustice Thomas's extremely narrow, 19th-century, and widely-discredited \nview that Congress may not regulate activities occurring within a State \neven if they have substantial effects on interstate commerce. He \nrefused.\n  There is therefore too serious a chance that Judge Roberts believes \nthat Congress is without power to protect workers' rights, women's \nrights, and the environment on this widely-accepted constitutional \nbasis.\n  We simply did not get definitive answers to these questions at the \nhearings.\n  At the hearings, I gave Judge Roberts every opportunity to distance \nhimself from Justice Thomas's most extreme views. He refused.\n  Now, Senator Cornyn, my good friend from Texas, and others from \nacross the aisle have said that if we can't vote for this nominee who \ncould we vote for? Here is your answer: someone who answers questions \nfully and who makes his or her record fully available; someone who \ngives us a significant level of assurance with some answers and a \nrecord that he or she is not an ideologue;\n  Judge Roberts is clearly brilliant and his demeanor suggests he well \nmight not be an ideologue.\n  But he simply did not make the case strongly enough to bet the farm.\n  There is a good chance--perhaps even a majority chance--that Judge \nRoberts will be like Justice Rehnquist on the bench. We know he will be \nbrilliant, and he could well be--while very conservative--not an \nideologue. That is why I struggled with this decision so long and so \nhard.\n  If he is a Rehnquist, that would not be cause for exultation; nor \nwould it be cause for alarm. The Court's balance will not be altered.\n  But there is a reasonable danger that he will be like Justice Thomas, \nthe most radical Justice on the Supreme Court.\n  It is not that I am certain that he will be a Thomas. It's not even \nthat the chance that he will a Thomas is greater than fifty percent. \nBut the risk that he might be a Thomas and the lack of reassurance that \nhe won't--particuarly in light of this President's professed desire to \nnominate people in that mold--is just not good enough.\n  Because if he is a Justice Thomas, he could turn back the clock \ndecades for all Americans. The Court's balance may be tipped radically \nin one direction and stay that way for too long.\n  I hope he is not a Thomas. But the risk is too great to bear, and it \nexceeds the upside benefit.\n  Because of that risk and its enormous consequences for generations of \nAmericans, I cannot vote yes. I must reluctantly cast my vote against \nconfirmation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, 5 years have passed since the Presidential \nelection of 2000, and legitimate questions\n\n[[Page S10541]]\n\nabout the outcome of that campaign have left too much of America too \ndivided. Legitimate questions about the outcome of that election have \ngiven rise to an ever-growing polarization between so-called red and \nblue States, between liberals and conservatives, and between \nRepublicans and Democrats in the Congress.\n  Despite a somewhat more convincing outcome in the 2004 Presidential \nelection, the divisions caused by the events of 2000 show little sign \nof abating. Having closely observed this widening divide, I now wonder \nwhether Judge Roberts' confirmation will add to the bitterness and \ndistrust of the Federal Government or whether it may serve to remind \nthe people and the lawmakers they elect that we cannot move forward as \na nation if we remain dedicated to tearing each other down.\n  This is my first vote on a nominee to the Supreme Court of the United \nStates, and my obligation as articulated in the Constitution is to \neither consent or not consent to a choice specifically entrusted to the \nelected President of the United States. Some of the policy watchdogs \nthat I respect the most and agree with on so many issues have asked \nwhether I oppose Judge Roberts because he is not one of us, because he \nis too conservative, because he is too young, because he may prove \neffective. He is not whom we would choose, they say. And on that point, \nI am in full agreement.\n  Should the test to confirm a Chief Justice be, he is not one we would \nchoose? I ask my friends to imagine the mess we will have left for our \ncountry if the Senate uses this test and votes solely on the basis of a \nnominee's political beliefs. Friends who a year ago said, We don't want \nideologues appointed to the Supreme Court, now want John Roberts and \nthe next nominee to show up at the witness table to submit to an \nideological litmus test.\n  Here is my message to those friends: A sword forged in ideology in \n2005 can be used against a progressive nominee in 2009 with an equal \ndisregard for the Constitution and the individual.\n  In 2008, I fully intend to work harder than ever before to elect a \nPresident who rejects the dangerous priorities that have led us to war \nin Iraq and an energy policy that is folly, that assures our continued \ndependence on foreign oil. Should this new Democratic President have to \ncontend with a Republican Senate majority, he or she better hope that \nthe judicial nominations in 2005 did not become purely ideology- driven \ncontests. If these debates are purely partisan, our future will include \nconstitutional bedlam whenever a Supreme Court opening occurs while the \nSenate is controlled by the opposition party.\n  I reject the suggestion that a Republican nominee is, per se, \nobjectionable. A number of certainly moderate justices nominated by \nRepublican Presidents certainly belie this claim. The decision each \nSenator must make should be based on the judicial nominee that is \nbefore the Senate, not the one that we wish was before the Senate.\n  To put this into historial perspective under the advice and consent \nresponsibility assigned to the President, the President's judicial \nnominees to the Court have traditionally been given a large degree of \ndeference. For example, in spite of the divisive national debate \nsurrounding gays in the military, universal health care, Travelgate, \nFilegate, and the Whitewater investigation, this deference translated \ninto 96 votes for Justice Ginsburg and 87 votes for Justice Breyer when \ntheir nominations came to a vote before the Senate. Yet these are two \nof the most progressive voices in the over 200-year history of the \nCourt.\n  When I had the opportunity to meet with John Roberts in my office \nthis past August, I pressed him to tell me how he viewed some of the \nissues that have most divided our country. The answers Judge Roberts \ngave me during the hour we spent together left me with the impression \nthat he will be his own man on the Court.\n  Here are my judgments about the individual before the Senate now: \nOne, on the basis of his public testimony, it is hard to see Judge \nRoberts as a man who will walk into the white pillard building across \nthe street and set about tearing apart the fabric of our society; two, \non the basis of his public testimony, it is hard to see Judge Roberts \nas a judicial activist who would place ideological purity or a \nparticular agenda above or ahead of the need for thoughtful reason; \nthree, on the basis of his public testimony, it is hard to see Judge \nRoberts as a divisive, confrontational extremist who would try to \nfurther exploit the divisions in our country.\n  What I saw in his public testimony and in our private meeting is an \nintelligent, thoughtful man, certainly a deeply conservative man with a \ntempered view of the role of Government.\n  At his Judiciary Committee hearings, nothing he said in public \nconflicted with what he had told me in private.\n  In addition to meeting with him, I have scrutinized Judge Roberts and \nhis record closely, considering his Reagan-era documents, reading the \nnews analysis printed in papers across our country and listened to the \nhearings and reviewed the transcripts of them as well. No one disputes \nthat Judge Roberts has a brilliant legal mind. My analysis of his \nrecord leads me to conclude that he is not cut from the same \noriginalist cloth as Justice Thomas and Justice Scalia. He does not \nseem to believe that the words of the Constitution are fossilized, \nleaving only a one-size-fits-all, 18th century remedy for every problem \nthat our society confronts. It is hard not to get the sense that he \nbelieves in limited government.\n  Back in March, I led the effort in the Senate to block attempts to \ndictate a specific medical treatment in Terri Schiavo's tragic case \nbecause I believed the Constitution affords families the right to \ndecide these matters privately. This is an area, in my view, in which \nthe Federal Government has no business intruding. Involving itself in \nthe Schiavo case, Congress was inappropriately meddling and blatantly \nignoring the limits of its constitutional authority.\n  I believe that the Terri Schiavo case is the first of many such end-\nof-life cases that will arrive at the Supreme Court's doorstep. In my \nview, most of these cases will involve one individual and passionately \nheld views. Demographic trends and improvements in medical technology \nassure that there will be many of these cases.\n  Given what is ahead, I felt I had an obligation to examine how Judge \nRoberts saw end-of-life issues in the context of the Constitution and \nwhether he would be willing to manipulate its meaning to authorize \nGovernment intrusion in private family matters. When I met with Judge \nRoberts in August, we discussed end-of-life issues at length, not \nbecause this was a litmus test for me, and I certainly don't believe in \nlitmus tests, but because I thought it was important to carefully \nconsider Judge Roberts' judicial temperament on this critical issue.\n  Judge Roberts did not say how he would have handled the Schiavo case \nor any case before the Court. However, Judge Roberts did say quite a \nbit that made a lot of sense to me and I think would make sense to the \nvast majority of Americans. Judge Roberts agreed that there is a \nconstitutionally based privacy right and that while the scope of the \nprivacy right is still being defined in the context of end-of-life \ncare, he said that when he approached the issue, he starts with the \nproposition that each person has the right to be left alone and that \ntheir liberty interests should be factored in as well.\n  At his hearing, Judge Roberts reiterated his position, stating that a \nright to privacy exists in the Constitution. He stated that privacy is \na component of the liberty protected by the due process clauses of the \n5th and 14th amendments, and he stated this liberty interest is \nprotected substantively as well as procedurally.\n  While discussing the Schiavo tragedy during our August meeting, I \nalso asked him about Congress's authority to legislate a particular \nremedy in a particular case, and Judge Roberts expressed his concern \nabout judicial independence. It was apparent to me Judge Roberts \nunderstands there are constitutional limits to the recent enthusiasm of \nCongress to prescribe particular remedies in a particular end-of-life \ncase.\n  Concerning States rights to regulate medical practice and the scope \nof the 10th amendment, Judge Roberts stated he believed the Framers \nexpected States to do most of the regulating and that they expected \nmost regulation to\n\n[[Page S10542]]\n\nbe State-based. In his view, the basic genius of the Federal system is \nthat it affords different States the ability to approach problems in a \nway that is best suited to meet their different needs, and that \nimposing uniformity across the country would stifle the genius of our \nFounding Fathers.\n  Judge Roberts also told me he attaches great importance to \nlegislative history in interpreting law. He repeated this point several \ntimes during his public hearings. Those who have closely studied former \nAttorney General Ashcroft's challenge to the Oregon physician-assisted \nsuicide law know there is not one word in the Controlled Substances \nAct, the law used to launch the case, indicating the Controlled \nSubstances Act is aimed at or should be used to overturn or undermine \nthe right of States to regulate medical practices within their borders.\n  On the extremely important matter of a woman's right to choose, I \nasked Judge Roberts about Roe. He did not offer specific comments, but \nhis response indicated he would not enter the Court with an ``agenda'' \nand he would respect the Court's precedents. In the public hearings, he \nalso said he personally agreed with the conclusion of the Griswold and \nEisenstat decisions, which held that the privacy right protects the \nright of individuals to use birth control.\n  His opinions on the issues that matter indicate he is intelligent, \nthoughtful, and that he has a tempered view of the role of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Judge Roberts' combination of temperament and intelligence give him \nthe potential to be a conciliatory voice at a divisive time in American \nhistory. He has the skills to reach across the divisions in America to \nshow that justice can be a healing force for the wounds that cut our \nsociety so deeply. He can help to unify the country by building a \nrecord of well-reasoned opinions grounded in the rule of law, not \nideology.\n  He will receive my vote tomorrow to be the next Chief Justice of the \nUnited States.\n  I want to make one final point, Mr. President, a point that is \nimportant to me. There is another vacancy on the Court, and the \nPresident is expected to send forth his nominee soon. My intention to \nvote for Judge Roberts tomorrow should in no way be construed as a \n``weathervane'' for how I might vote on the next nominee. In the past, \nI have not hesitated to vote against several of the President's \nnominees to the courts of appeals when they carried the ideological and \nactivist baggage I believed would be disruptive to our society. If the \nPresident puts forward a nominee to replace Justice O'Connor who is \nunlikely to ably and respectfully fill her shoes, I will vigorously \noppose that nomination.\n  I began by voicing my question about the impact of this nomination on \nthe body politic of our country. Among the many awesome duties of the \nChief Justice, no duty is of greater importance than the duty to unify \nour Nation when Americans find themselves in disagreement. Different \nChief Justices have shouldered this burden with varying degrees of \nsuccess. This ability to unify is what is most sorely needed at this \nmoment in our Nation's history, and I am of the opinion that Judge \nRoberts possesses the nature and the desire to unify the Court and, \nwith it, our Nation. I wish him wisdom, diplomacy, and moderation as he \nprepares to assume this critical role.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time from 12 \np.m. to 1 p.m. will be under the control of the majority.\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I would like to comment a bit on the \nnomination of Judge Roberts. I wish to make a political observation. \nThis is certainly a political body, and the nomination process has \npolitics to it. That is not a bad thing. That is to be expected.\n  From a Republican point of view, this is an easy vote. We are \ninclined to support a President when he is in power making a \nnomination. But that is not always the case, that every Republican \nvotes for every nominee. I expect that will be the case here. Most of \nus on our side of the aisle are pleased with the nominee, someone of \nextraordinary intelligence and legal abilities and seems to be an all \naround good guy who has served his country well in every capacity that \nhe has been called upon to serve. We will all vote en masse. It is an \neasy vote for us.\n  To our Democratic colleagues, it is not so easy. Any time you are in \nthe minority, and the Court being an important part of American life \nand politics, there is a lot of pressure on my Democratic colleagues to \nsay no for different reasons by special interest groups on the left. We \ncertainly have them on the right. Our day will come. If there is ever a \nDemocratic nominee, we will face the same pressure.\n  I would like to compliment my Democratic colleagues. Every one has \ntaken the process seriously. There will be a healthy number of \nDemocratic votes for Judge Roberts. To those who have decided to vote \nfor him, history will judge you well. You have based your votes on the \nqualifications test. You have seen in Judge Roberts someone who loves \nthe law more than politics. Over time, history will judge you well. One \nof the highlights of the Bush administration will be the selection of \nJudge Roberts to be the Chief Justice of the United States.\n  For those who vote no, to a person everyone has struggled with it, \nthought about it, cast your vote. Generally speaking, the debate in \ncommittee and in the Chamber has lived up to the best traditions of the \nSenate. A few months ago, we were at each other's throats, about to \nblow up the place. There is plenty of blame to go around, but we have \nsort of broken that cycle. We have had a confirmation process that is \nin the best tradition of the Senate. We will go forward, and I hope he \ngets a healthy number of votes. It looks as if he will.\n  One thing I wanted to take some time to discuss is some of the \nreasoning given to vote no and make a cautionary tale about some of the \nsuggestions why a ``no'' vote would be appropriate. There seems to be \nsome suggestion that if he does not have an allegiance to a particular \nline of cases, particularly the right of privacy cases centering around \nRoe v. Wade, that you can't vote for him. That one case or that line of \nlegal reasoning is so important that without some commitment on his \npart to uphold Roe v. Wade or the concept of Roe v. Wade, a ``no'' vote \nwould be in order. I would argue that could be applied on our side. \nMost of us are pro-life. I would say 90 percent of the Republican \ncaucus is pro-life. Probably 90 percent of the Democratic caucus is \npro-choice. The country is pretty evenly divided. If we have a litmus \ntest about Roe v. Wade or any other case, that is not doing the \njudiciary a good service because you are putting a judge in a bad spot.\n  Senator Harkin mentioned the Americans with Disabilities Act, \nsomething he should be very proud of. He fought hard to make it part of \nlaw, and we are a better Nation for it. There are some cases involving \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act that will come before the Court. \nSenator Harkin did not think that he could vote yes because he wasn't \nassured that Judge Roberts would uphold the Americans with Disabilities \nAct in a way that he felt comfortable with in that States have been \nexempted from the act. We are all dealing with that issue.\n\n  The only thing I can say about a guarantee with Judge Roberts, if you \nare a conservative and would like to see certain Court decisions \nreversed, if you are a liberal and would like to see certain decisions \nsustained, the one thing I can promise you about Judge Roberts is he is \ngoing to make his decision based on the facts, the briefs, the record \nin the particular case, and the arguments made by litigants. If he \noverturns a precedent of the Court, he will apply the four-part test \nthat has been the historical analysis of how to overturn a standing \nprecedent. He is going to do it in a businesslike fashion. He is going \nto apply the rule of law. If you are looking for an outcome-\ndeterminative judge, someone who is going\n\n[[Page S10543]]\n\nto see things your way before they get your vote, you are going to be \ndisappointed. To be honest, the law is better off for those answers. He \nis not the only one to refuse to bargain his way on the Court.\n  Justice Marshall was asked by Senator McClellan: Do you subscribe to \nthe philosophy expressed by a majority of the Court in Miranda?\n  That is a major league constitutional case in our Nation's history \nwhere police officers have to inform a criminal defendant of certain \nrights they possess under the Constitution. That was a big deal. When \nJustice Marshall was coming along, that case had not been long decided. \nHe said: I cannot answer your question because there are many cases \npending that are variations on Miranda that I will have to pass on if I \nwere confirmed.\n  Senator McClellan: Do you disagree with the Miranda philosophy?\n  Justice Marshall: I am not saying whether I disagree or not, because \nI am going to be called to pass on it.\n  Senator McClellan: You cannot make any comment on any decision that \nhas been made in the past?\n  Justice Marshall answered: I would say that on decisions that are \ncertain to be reexamined in the Court, it would be improper for me to \ncomment on them in advance.\n  I couldn't say it better. This idea that Judge Roberts has been \nevasive, that he will not give you a detailed answer of how he will \ndecide the concept of the right of privacy or how he might rule on \ninterstate commerce clause cases that will certainly come before the \nCourt, he is doing exactly what Justice Marshall did when he was in the \nconfirmation process. He was not going to bargain his way on the Court.\n  Justice Ginsburg gave a very famous quote: I am not going to give you \nhints, any previews, no advisory opinions about matters that I believe \nwill be coming before the Court.\n  If that is your test, that you have to have a guarantee in your mind \nthat a certain line of cases or a legal concept will be upheld or \nstricken down, Judge Roberts is never going to satisfy you. It is good \nfor the country that he not try to do that, just as Justice Marshall \navoided that dilemma.\n  This is a question by Senator Kohl to Justice Souter: What was your \nopinion in 1973 on Roe v. Wade?\n  Justice Souter: Well, with respect, Senator, I am going to ask you to \nlet me draw the line there, because I do not think I could get into \nopinions of 1973.\n  Senator Leahy: You do not have the same sense, to whatever degree you \nconsider privacy in Griswold settled--which is the ability to engage in \nbirth control practices--to whatever extent that is, you do not have in \nyour own mind the same sense of settlement on Roe v. Wade; is that \ncorrect?\n  Justice Souter: Well, with respect, sir, I think that is a question \nthat I should not answer. Because I think to get into that kind of \ncomparison is to start down the road on an analysis of one of the \nstrands of thought upon which the Roe v. Wade decision either would or \nwould not stand. So with respect, I will ask not to be asked to answer \nthat question.\n  He said it better than I read it. Bottom line is, he is telling \nSenator Leahy and Senator Kohl that if you start asking me to compare \none case with another that has viable legal concepts, that could be a \nforeshadowing of how I might rule on matters before the Court, and you \nare putting me in a bad spot and I like not to do that. I can talk \nabout Griswold, but if you ask me to say am I settled about Roe v. Wade \nas I am Griswold, then you are basically getting a preview how I might \nrule on a Roe v. Wade-type scenario.\n  So the idea that Judge Roberts did not want to make such comparisons \nwith the interstate commerce clause is not unknown to the confirmation \nprocess. Justice Souter did not want to go down that road with the \nright of privacy.\n  Judge Roberts was asked probing, hard, clever questions to try to get \nhim to tip his hand. I think what he said was the right answer: I will \nfollow the rule of law. There is a process of how to overturn a case. \nThere is a process of how to decide a case. That process is, you look \nat the facts, you look at the record, you listen to the arguments of \nthe litigants, and you don't prejudge. I think that will serve the \ncountry well.\n  The other concept that is coming into play is what burden does the \nnominee have, what deference should the Senate give to the President, \nwhat is the standard for confirmation. I have always believed that the \nidea that the President's nominee should be given deference by the \nSenate is a longstanding concept in our country. I am not the only one \nwho believes that.\n  There is a lot of information out there from our Democratic friends \nwho have gone down that same road and have come to the same conclusion. \nThere are prominent law professors out there who have suggested that \nthere is a presumption of a nomination by the President that the Senate \nshould give great deference to the Presidential nominee and that our \nadvise-and-consent role does not replace the judgment of the President \nbut simply to see if the person is qualified, has the character and \nintegrity and will wear the robe in the way that is consistent with \nbeing a judge and not turn it into power grab.\n  Professor Michael Gerhardt, who has advised our Democratic friends \nabout the confirmation process established now and in the past, says:\n\n       The Constitution establishes a presumption of confirmation \n     that works to the advantage of the President and his nominee.\n\n  He also said:\n\n       The presumption of confirmation embodied in the \n     Constitution generally puts the onus on those interested in \n     impeding a nomination to mobilize opposition to it.\n\n  So the general idea that the President should be given deference, in \nProfessor Gerhardt's opinion, is accepted in terms of the practice of \nthe Senate.\n  Senator Biden, on past nominations, has said: First, as a Member of \nthe Senate, I am not choosing a nominee for the Court. That is the \nprerogative of the President of the United States and we, Members of \nthe Senate, are simply reviewing the decision he has made. Second: Our \nreview, I believe, must operate within certain limits. We are \nattempting to answer some of the following questions: First, does the \nnominee have the intellectual capacity, confidence, and temperament to \nbe a Supreme Court Justice? Second, is the nominee of good moral \ncharacter and free of conflict of interest that would compromise her \nability--in this case it was Justice Ginsburg--to faithfully and \nobjectively perform her role as a member of the Supreme Court? Third, \nwill the nominee faithfully uphold the laws and Constitution of the \nUnited States of America? We are not attempting to determine whether \nthe nominee will address with all of us--being the Senate--every \npressing social or legal issue of the day. Indeed, if that were the \ntest, no one would pass this committee, much less the full Senate.\n  I could not agree with Senator Biden more. If that is the test, we \nare OK. If it becomes some subjective test where you have to adopt our \nview of a particular line of legal reasoning, then I think you have \nundermined the role of the President, I think you put the Judiciary at \na great disadvantage, and I think you will be starting down a road that \nwill not pay great dividends for the Senate.\n  I argue that whatever votes you cast, let's not create standards that \nwill come back to haunt the judiciary. Let's not put people in a bind, \nin trying to get on the Court, by making decisions or answering \nquestions that will compromise their integrity and violate their \njudicial ethics to get votes.\n  I do not think anybody is intentionally trying to do that, but there \nare some disturbing comments about what the standard should be. There \nhave been a couple of occasions on the Judiciary Committee where people \nhave looked at Judge Roberts and said: Convince me, the burden is on \nyou to convince me you will not do the following or you will do the \nfollowing. I don't think that is helpful.\n  There have been some occasions in the committee where people have \nacknowledged the great intellect of Judge Roberts. His preparation for \nthe job is not in question. I said in committee: If you question his \nintellect, people are going to question yours. He is a genius. There is \nno way of getting around that. He is one of the greatest legal minds in \nthe history of the country, and I think he will be a historic choice by \nthe President.\n  People have suggested: I don't know if he has the real-world \nexperience; I know about your brain, but I don't\n\n[[Page S10544]]\n\nknow about your heart. I suggest it is dangerous for us in the Senate \nto begin judging other people's hearts. That gets to be a slippery \nslope.\n  Senator Wyden's statement, I thought, was dead on point. He \nunderstands the deference the body gives to the President. He pointed \nout, in fact, that Justice Ginsburg and Justice Breyer, two Clinton \nnominees, received 87 votes and 96 votes, respectively. If you start \napplying heart tests, I can tell you that gets to be so subjective and \nso political, and I think it is dangerous for the judiciary and not \nhealthy for the Senate.\n  One of the issues Justice Ginsburg wrote about was the idea that \nprostitution should be a legal activity because to restrict women from \nengaging in prostitution is basically restricting a woman's right to \nengage in commerce.\n  You can agree or disagree, but from my point of view, looking at the \nworld as I know it to be as a former prosecutor and former defense \nattorney who has had some experience in criminal law, if I am using the \nheart test or the real-world experience test, I would argue that from \nthe experiences I have seen as a criminal defense lawyer and as a \ncriminal prosecutor, that prostitution is hell for women; that if you \nreally understood the life of a prostitute, it would not be a good \nbusiness endeavor to uphold. It would be something we would want to \ndeter.\n\n  That is my view based on life as I know it, having been involved in \nthe criminal law business for 20-something years.\n  She said she supported the idea of Federal funding for abortion. If \nyou wanted to try to question someone's heart from a pro-life \nperspective, I think it would be pretty tough to take taxpayers' \ndollars and use them for a procedure that millions of Americans find \nmorally wrong.\n  So if we start going down the road of whether we believe a person \nbefore us has the right heart or the right real-world experiences, then \nyou are taking the objective qualification, intellect, and character \ntest, not an ideologue--which I think is an appropriate thing--and you \nare beginning to put subjective elements in it that will not be good \nfor the judiciary and will not be good for the Senate. I can assure \nyou, if we started looking at those type of tests for Justice Ginsburg \nor Justice Breyer, who was a Democratic staffer, if we started looking \nat their philosophy or trying to judge their heart or having their \nvalue system equate with ours to the point we feel comfortable, then \nthey would not have gotten nearly the votes they did because it is \nclear to me that not too long ago Republicans, during the Clinton \nadministration, overlooked all the differences they had with Ginsburg \nand voted for her 96 to 3 and overlooked all the differences they had \nwith Justice Breyer and gave him 87 votes. It is clear to me that \nDemocrats and President Bush 1's administration overlooked all the \ndifferences they had with Justice Scalia, and he got 98 votes.\n  It has been mentioned that the President has politicized this \nprocess, and there have been all kinds of veiled and direct threats \nabout the next nominee: If you pick so and so, you are going to get a \nfight. If you pick Priscilla Owen, if you pick Janice Rogers Brown, you \nare going to get a fight, bringing back the specter of the filibuster.\n  What did the President do when he ran in his campaign? He talked \nabout the Supreme Court and how important it was to him. He said, \nbasically: If I am the President of the United States, on my watch, I \nam going to nominate well-qualified, strict constructionists to the \nCourt with no litmus test, who will interpret the law and not become \nlegislators themselves. He showed praise and admiration for Scalia and \nThomas.\n  I would argue that something is wrong with the Senate if they can \nvote for someone 98 to 0 and say, If you pick someone like him, they \nare out of the mainstream and desiring a filibuster. How can you go \nfrom 98 to 0, someone similar to the person a decade later, and you \nfilibuster? I would argue that if you do that, it is more about \npolitics than it is about qualifications.\n  I hope we don't do that because the one thing I can assure you, \nknowing the President reasonably well, is that he is going to fulfill \nhis campaign promise. He is going to send over to this body a well-\nqualified, strict constructionist, and to expect anything else, you \nignored the last two elections. We are not going to sit on the \nsidelines and watch the election be overturned because of political \npressure from the left. That is not going to happen.\n  I do expect the President to listen, as he did before he nominated \nJudge Roberts. I expect him to consult, as he did before he nominated \nJudge Roberts. I was very pleased and proud of his pick. I am \nencouraging the President to listen to our Democratic colleagues, \nlisten to us all. But the most encouragement I could give the President \nis: Fulfill your campaign promise. Do what you said you would do when \nyou ran for President. Send us over a well-qualified, strict \nconstructionist conservative with no litmus test attached. If you do \nthat, then you will have done a good service for the American people \nbecause you got elected twice telling them what you are going to do.\n\n  I have about 5 minutes, and I will let my other colleagues speak.\n  There were a couple of other comments about concerns with this \nnominee. It goes back to the memos. This nominee worked for the Reagan \nadministration. He was in his midtwenties, and that has gotten to be a \nbad thing. Working for Ronald Reagan, I think, is a good thing. Justice \nBreyer was a Democratic staffer. No one held that against him. He \nworked for the Democratic side of the aisle in the Senate, and I don't \nremember anyone suggesting that was a bad thing.\n  Presidents pick people they know and with whom they are comfortable. \nClinton was comfortable with Ginsburg, the executive general council \nfor the ACLU, someone we would not have picked. He was comfortable with \nJustice Breyer, a former Democratic staffer, someone this President \nwould not pick. This President picked someone who worked for his dad, \nPresident Bush 1, and Ronald Reagan.\n  There is an argument out there that adopting the Reagan position on \nextending the Civil Rights Act in toto, without a change, that would \nlead to a reverse discrimination test called ``proportionality'' and is \nout of the mainstream. Ronald Reagan won 49 States. If you can win 49 \nStates and be out of the mainstream, I would argue the person saying \nyou are out of the mainstream is out of the mainstream. If you picked \nsomeone similar to Scalia and that would justify a filibuster and the \nguy got 98 votes, there is a disconnect going on here.\n  One of the memos that is in question is a memo that Judge Roberts \nwrote about the Reagan administration's decision to grant amnesty, for \nlack of a better word, to illegal aliens in this country. He was \nwriting a memo to suggest how the President should respond to an \ninquiry by Spanish Today, a Latino, Hispanic newspaper. He talked about \nthe idea that it would be well received in the Hispanic community to \ngrant amnesty. And he said to the effect that Spanish Today would be \npleased that we are trying to grant legal status to their illegal \namigos.\n  Somehow that one phrase has been suggested that this young man, \nworking for the Reagan administration, committed some kind of a wrong \nthat would deny him the ability to be fairly considered for the Supreme \nCourt 20-something years later. I argue, No. 1, that if you read his \nwritings in terms of what he was talking about, it was not meant to be \nslanderous, it was not meant to be a derogatory remark--he answered the \nquestion fully--that it was not meant to be that way at all. That was a \ncommonly used term in the White House, the term ``amigos,'' and he made \na correct observation: that certain Hispanic groups did welcome \nPresident Reagan's decision.\n  Bottom line is, if we are going to take a phrase that a person wrote \nwhen they were 26, and that is going to be a reason to vote no, woe be \nto anybody else coming before this committee. I would not want that to \nbe the standard for me.\n  He never apologized because he did not think he had anything to \napologize about. So this is much ado, in my opinion, about nothing. You \nhave read his writings. He used Latin, French, and Spanish terms all \nover the place. He is kind of a witty guy. You may not like his sense \nof humor, but I think it is given sometimes in that vein. The idea \nabout, you know, more homemakers becoming lawyers, who said we need \nmore homemakers than lawyers--and I\n\n[[Page S10545]]\n\nthink a lot of people agree with that, and his wife happens to be an \nattorney, by the way--taking these phrases out of context and not \nlooking at life in total is not fair. Not one person came before this \nbody or the committee to say Judge Roberts has lived his life in any \nway, shape, or form to demean any group in America or individual. It is \nquite the opposite. He has received praise from everybody he has worked \nwith on both sides of the aisle because he is basically a very good \nman. So I hope we will not make that the standard in the future.\n  Final thoughts. The vote is not in question in terms of confirmation. \nThe process is in question. And that to me is as important as the vote \ntotal. The President is going to get another pick. That is the way it \nhas happened. He has had a lot of things happen on his watch historic \nin nature. Whatever you think about President Bush, whether you like \nhim or not, he has had to deal with some major league events. Let me \ntell you, some will go down good and not so good in history. That is \nthe life of a President. But one thing I can say for certain is that \nhis decision to make John Roberts Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme \nCourt will go down well in history. It will be one of the greatest \nthings he has done as President of the United States because he has \npicked one of the most uniquely qualified men in American history to \nserve on a Court that needs all the unity it can find, and this guy \nwill be a consensus builder. The next one is coming and it is coming \nsoon. There is all kind of jockeying already about what the President \nshould do and what he should not do. I hope and pray we will remember \nthe best traditions of the Senate, that we will listen to the Joe \nBidens of the past, when he informed us that our role is to give \ndeference to the Presidential nominee, look at their character, \nintelligence, and qualifications; that we will remember what Senator \nKennedy said about Justice Marshall: it is not your job, we shouldn't \nhold someone's political philosophy against them. We should look at who \nthey are and what kind of judge they would be, would they be fair.\n  So as the next pick is about to be made, the Senate can fight if we \nwant to or we can recognize that elections matter, we can judge the \nnominees based on their qualifications, integrity, and character, \nwhether they are going to wear the robe in some improper fashion, or we \ncan start putting political tests on the Presidency that will come back \nto haunt everybody and every party. If you want someone such as \nO'Connor--President Clinton did not think 1 minute about replacing \nJustice White with Justice Ginsburg. No one asked him to think about \nthat. This idea that you have to have an ideological match is something \nnew. What is old and stood the test of time is that Presidents get to \npick once they win, and our job is to make sure they pick wisely in \nterms of character, integrity, and qualification. And if we will stick \nto that test and not substitute our political philosophy for that of \nthe President and not require a political allegiance of the nominee to \nour way of thinking about a particular line of cases or a particular \nconcept in law, but judge the entire person, we will have served the \ncountry well. If we get into the mud and start fighting each other over \nthe second pick, because some people don't like how the election turned \nout, then we will set a trend that will come back to haunt this body, \nhaunt all future Presidents, and we will be worse off as a nation.\n  With that, I am going to end with the idea I am optimistic that we \nwill not go down that road, we will give the next nominee the respect \nand deference this nominee has, and we will vote our conscience, and \nthe vote will come and the vote will go. And the worst thing we could \ndo is politicize the judiciary any more than it has been politicized. \nIf you are selected to be on the Supreme Court, there will be millions \nof dollars to run you down and destroy your life, and that is going to \nhappen on both sides of the aisle if we do not watch it. The best thing \nthe Senate can do is use this opportunity to stand up to those people \nwho want to run down somebody and ruin their life unfairly, because our \nday will come as Republicans. If we can unite around the idea we are \nnot going to let special interest groups take over the Senate, the \ncountry will be stronger.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I congratulate my colleague and good friend from South \nCarolina for a fine statement.\n  I also rise today in support of President Bush's nomination of Judge \nJohn Roberts to serve as Chief Justice of the United States.\n  President Bush could not have nominated an individual more qualified \nto be confirmed as the next Chief Justice of the United States. If one \nwere to prescribe the ideal training regimen for a future Chief \nJustice, Judge Roberts' career may well serve as the model.\n  Judge Roberts has interacted with the Supreme Court in nearly every \nconceivable capacity. After law school, he held a prestigious position \nat the Supreme Court as a clerk to Justice William Rehnquist. He then \nwent on to argue 39 cases before the Supreme Court, representing both \npublic and private litigants. He currently serves as a judge on the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit often referred to as the \nsecond highest court in the land.\n  In short, he has worked at the Supreme Court, represented dozens of \nclients before the Supreme Court, and served as a judge on the court \nthat many consider a stepping-stone to the Supreme Court. I cannot \nimagine someone more qualified to now serve as Chief Justice of the \nSupreme Court.\n  After spending considerable time with Judge Roberts the nominee, I \ncame to be equally impressed with John Roberts the man. He is humble, \nunassuming, polite, and respectful. In that respect, he shares the \nvalues of many of my fellow Coloradans.\n  The humility he exudes is reflected in his view on the role of judges \nand the courts. Judge Roberts says:\n\n       [A] certain humility should characterize the judicial role. \n     Judges and Justices are servants of the law, not the other \n     way around.\n\n  He describes himself as a ``modest judge,'' which is evidenced in his \n``appreciation that the role of the judge is limited, that judges are \nto decide the cases before them, they're not to legislate, they're not \nto execute the laws.''\n  This judicial philosophy is imperative to preserving the sanctity of \nthe Constitution that is under attack by a handful of activist judges \nactivist judges who proclaim the Pledge of Allegiance unconstitutional \nand attempt to redefine the institution of marriage. Unlike these \nactivist judges, Judge Roberts will be on the side of Constitution.\n  As a Senator representing Colorado, I also appreciate the uniqueness \nof the issues important to Colorado and the West. The departure of \nJustice O'Connor, and now Chief Justice Rehnquist, marks the loss of a \nWestern presence on the Supreme Court.\n  Earlier this year, I asked President Bush to nominate a judge with an \nunderstanding of issues important to Colorado and the West, such as \nwater and resource law.\n  I asked Judge Roberts about his understanding of Western resource and \nwater law. Judge Roberts acknowledged the loss of the Western presence \non the Court and assured me that he understands the uniqueness to the \nWest of such issues as water, the environment, and public lands.\n  He shared his experience working on several cases in the State of \nAlaska, encompassing issues on rivers, Indian law, and natural \nresources. He also described his practice of traveling to the site of \ncases when he believes it is beneficial to his understanding of the \nfacts. This practice is demonstrative of his commitment to fully \nunderstanding cases from the perspective of both sides.\n  I was pleasantly surprised to learn that he currently has a law clerk \nfrom New Mexico. Law clerks sit at a judge's right hand and are \nintegral in the judge's decisionmaking process. I am hopeful that Judge \nRoberts will continue to surround himself with individuals who have a \nWestern perspective.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee has reviewed Judge Roberts' record \nmore extensively than any previous Supreme Court nominee. The \nAdministration produced more than 76,000 pages of documents related to \nJudge Roberts' distinguished career in public service. Judge Roberts \ntestified for more than 20 hours before the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  During the extensive review process, the country learned a great deal \nabout\n\n[[Page S10546]]\n\nJudge Roberts' fitness to serve on the Supreme Court.\n  We learned about his judicial philosophy, one which is firmly rooted \nin the rule of law and unwavering in its reverence for the \nConstitution. I believe his most telling statement was this:\n\n       I come before the Committee with no agenda. I have no \n     platform. Judges are not politicians who can promise to \n     do certain things in exchange for votes. I have no agenda, \n     but I do have a commitment. If I am confirmed, I will \n     confront every case with an open mind. I will fully and \n     fairly analyze the legal arguments that are presented. I \n     will be open to the considered views of my colleagues on \n     the bench, and I will decide every case based on the \n     record, according to the rule of law, without fear or \n     favor, to the best of my ability, and I will remember that \n     it's my job to call balls and strikes, and not to pitch or \n     bat.\n\n  We learned that Judge Roberts subscribes to ``the bedrock principle \nof treating people on the basis of merit without regard to race or \nsex.'' His belief in these principles is echoed in praise from several \nwomen's and minority groups.\n  The Minority Business Round Table says ``his appointment to the U.S. \nSupreme Court would certainly uphold our core American values of \nfreedom, equality and fairness.''\n  The Independent Women's Forum applauds Judge Roberts as a ``very well \nqualified candidate with a reputation of being a strict interpreter of \nthe law rather than someone who legislates from the bench.''\n  We learned that Judge Roberts recognizes the limitations on the \ngovernment's taking of private property and the role of the legislature \nin drawing lines that the Court should not. The Court in Kelo permitted \nthe transfer of property from one private party to another private \nparty to satisfy the Constitution's ``public use'' requirement, \nessentially erasing this fundamental protection from its text. Judge \nRoberts says the Kelo decision ``leaves the ball in the court of the \nlegislature. . . . [Congress] and legislative bodies in the States are \nprotectors of the people's rights as well. . . . [Y]ou can protect them \nin situations where the Court has determined, as it did 5-4 in Kelo, \nthat they are not going to draw that line.''\n  We learned that Judge Roberts will rely on domestic precedent to \ninterpret the U.S. Constitution, not foreign law. Judge Roberts said, \n``as a general matter . . . a couple of things . . . cause concern on \nmy part about the use of foreign law as precedent . . . . The first has \nto do with democratic theory. . . If we're relying on a decision from a \nGerman judge about what our Constitution means, no President \naccountable to the people appointed that judge, and no Senate \naccountable to the people confirmed that judge, and yet he's playing a \nrole in shaping a law that binds the people in this country.''\n  Given his keen intellect, impartiality, temperament, sound legal \njudgment, and integrity, it is not surprising that Judge Roberts \nenjoyed bipartisan support by the Senate Judiciary Committee. I expect \nthat he will enjoy similar bipartisan support in his confirmation vote \ntomorrow morning.\n  I want to commend President Bush on the unprecedented level of \nbipartisan consultation he engaged in with the Senate prior to this \nnomination. The Constitution grants the power to the President to \nnominate and the Senate to provide advice and consent. Although \nSenators can provide input, the Senate does not co-nominate. When the \nPresident sends forth highly qualified candidates, this body has an \nobligation to the American people to provide a timely up-or-down vote.\n  I commend my colleagues on the respectful hearings and expeditious \nprocess. The Ginsburg Standard was applied to Judge Roberts fair, \nrespectful hearings; no prejudging of cases likely to come before the \ncourt; and a timely, up-or-down vote.\n  With consultations on the next nominee already well under way, and an \nannouncement imminent, I am hopeful that my colleagues will apply the \nsame standards.\n  Judges are not politicians. The Senate debate should reflect that the \njob of a judge is to review cases impartially, not to advocate issues. \nJudges should be evaluated on their qualifications, judicial \nphilosophy, and respect for the rule of law.\n  I am confident that President Bush will send forth a highly qualified \nnominee to replace Justice O'Connor, and I am hopeful that my \ncolleagues will continue to build on the spirit of bipartisanship \nwitnessed during this confirmation process.\n  In conclusion, I cannot imagine a better qualified candidate than \nJudge Roberts to lead this nation's highest Court into the 21st \ncentury. I believe his rhetoric matches his actions.\n  On behalf of the citizens of Colorado, I thank Judge Roberts for his \nwillingness to serve our country. I am hopeful that the fair and \nrespectful hearings accorded to him by this body will serve to inspire \nthe best and the brightest of future generations to make similar \nsacrifices in the name of public service.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to cast a vote in favor of Judge John \nG. Roberts' confirmation as the 17th Chief Justice of the United \nStates.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, after listening to my friend from \nColorado and my good friend from South Carolina, and then to look at \nthe statement that I have, it appears we are all saying about the same \nthing, but we just all haven't had the opportunity to say it yet. I \nwill try to put a little different slant on it.\n  We know the qualifications of this man, Judge Roberts. He has \nconsistently shown me excellence in all aspects of his previous \nacademic and his professional career. He is widely thought of as one of \nthe best legal minds in the country, is highly respected by his \ncolleagues as a fairminded, brilliant, and temperate jurist. He \ngraduated from Harvard College summa cum laude. He did it in only 3 \nyears. He then graduated from Harvard Law School at the top of his \nclass.\n  Less than 3 years ago, Judge Roberts was confirmed by a unanimous \nvote to the DC Court of Appeals, which is often referred to, as my \nfriend from Colorado says, as the second highest court in the land. He \nwas also a partner in the prestigious law firm of Hogan & Hartson. He \nspecialized in U.S. Supreme Court litigation, arguing numerous cases \nbefore the very Court to which we seek to confirm him today. Further, \nhe had an active practice in appellate law.\n  I guess what we look for in the men and women we like to see on the \ncountry's highest Court is pretty much found in all the qualifications \nof Judge Roberts. He had worked in the private sector. He also worked \nin the White House under President Ronald Reagan as Associate Counsel. \nIn addition, he earned a highly prestigious clerkship on the Supreme \nCourt for Chief Justice William Rehnquist--that in 1980 and 1981. Then \nhe was nominated by this President and went before the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  We watched those hearings with a great deal of interest. I speak not \nas a member of that committee or even as an attorney, but what we heard \nmore than anything else--and this is important to my State of Montana--\nis that we will have a qualified, fair, and competent Supreme Court \nJustice. That is important. When questioned on all of those \nqualifications, fairness, and competence, no one challenged any part of \nthose elements. In this respect, Judge Roberts earned the ``well \nqualified'' rating from the American Bar Association, which is the \nhighest rating that association offers. There was no challenge there.\n  He continually impressed my colleagues in the Senate by showing his \nimmense knowledge of the law while reflecting his vast understanding of \nthe rule of law and the importance of precedent. There was no challenge \nthere.\n  What becomes important is that we know that our Supreme Court \nJustices understand their duty is to interpret the law as it is \nreflected in the cases that come before them and refrain from personal \nbiases and from legislating or putting their biases into those cases.\n  He impressed me when he said that he wanted to be the umpire. He \ndidn't want to be the pitcher or the batter; he just wants to call the \nballs and the strikes. I appreciate that. I spent a lot of years on a \nfootball field, and I was one of those who wore the striped shirt. When \nI look back on that game, maybe our judiciary should be a little bit \nlike this great American sports feature of football. When you think \nabout it, 4 old referees--some of them overweight\n\n[[Page S10547]]\n\nwhom I could talk about--go out on a field of 22 young men who are \nhostile, mobile, and bent on hurting each other, and we have very few \nproblems because those striped shirts are the arresting officers, the \njudges, and the penal officers. They do it in 30 seconds, and they do \nit without very many complaints. Thus the discipline of the game: 22 \nyoung men in armor and dead set on winning the contest.\n  Throughout his hearings before the Judiciary Committee, Judge Roberts \nproved over and over that he understands the role of the judiciary as \nan interpreter and not a legislator and why it is important to our \ngovernmental system that our judges across America refrain from \noverstepping their duties. The law is the law. Yes, it can be a subject \nof interpretation, but look how simple our Constitution is. It doesn't \nuse very many big words. They are very simple. There is a lot of \ndifference between the word ``may'' and the word ``shall,'' and you can \ninterpret them.\n  He explained his judicial style during his hearings by saying:\n\n       I prefer to be known as a modest judge . . . It means an \n     appreciation that the role of the judge is limited, that a \n     judge is to decide the cases before them. . . .\n\n  They are not to change it or use their biases to execute a judgment. \nThat is pretty important.\n  When you look at his private life, the values of how he has \nprogressed in his professional life, how he has carried himself and \nwhat is personally important to him--family, being a good husband, a \nprovider--we see all of those values that we Americans hold in very \nhigh esteem.\n  Then we move it over into now what kind of a judge will he be. He was \nquestioned on a lot of social issues that the courts have no business \neven considering. That falls on us, the elected representatives of \nAmerica, and our constituency. What their values are should be \nreflected here. Yet what I heard was questions on human rights.\n\n  It is a wonderful thing, this Constitution we have. The Constitution \nwas not written for groups, it was written for you as the individual. \nIt is your personal Bill of Rights and how we structure our Government \nand the role of each one of those equal entities and how they relate \nand interact with each other--the executive, the judicial, and the \nlegislative.\n  It is important to me and the people I represent that we have judges \non the bench who will not prejudge cases. He may have a bias one way or \nthe other, but what does the law say as it pertains to me as an \nindividual citizen? This judge made his own commitment to listening, to \nhearing both sides of the case, and is committed to a fair and \nreasonable outcome, whether the judge personally likes or dislikes the \neventual results. His approach to the law, simply put, is one of \nrestraint. He is shown not to be an ideologue with an intent of \nimposing his views or his biases on the law.\n  Will he always rule in a way that would be consistent with my \nphilosophy? I would say no. I have a feeling, though, however he rules \nwill be fair, and he will not compromise any of the principles of the \nlaw as written. He explained:\n\n       As a judge I have no agenda, I have a guide in the \n     Constitution and the laws that are precedents to the court, \n     and those are what I apply with an open mind after fully and \n     fairly considering the arguments and assessing the considered \n     views of my colleagues on the bench.\n\n  I am not sure if it is the job to really draw a consensus when you \nhave nine men and women who have strong views of the law and the \nConstitution and maybe would interpret them in many different ways, but \nwhat this man has shown us is strong character, integrity, and his \nimmense knowledge of the law.\n  Uphold the Constitution, which protects us all--and we have heard a \nlot about that lately. People who are maybe short of patience would \ncome up to us and ask, What is taking Iraq so long to get a \nconstitution? I said, You know, it took almost 3 years to put ours \ntogether.\n  I still question: If we had had television and news channels, spin \nmeisters, commentators, and reporters who seemed to inject their bias \nevery now and again into the news, I am not real sure we would have a \nConstitution yet.\n  This man has shown us he has all the qualifications to be a judge, \nespecially a judge on the highest Court in the Nation.\n  On behalf of my constituents in Montana, and from all that I can read \nand all the information I can gather, I strongly urge my colleagues to \njoin me in voting aye on Judge Roberts as Chief Justice of the United \nStates.\n  When the premise was wrong, he wasn't afraid to challenge the \npremise. That is unique when coming before any kind of a committee in a \nlegislative body. That is what impressed me. The premise is assumed \ninstead of factual. That is the importance to all of us when making \njudgments that affect so many of us in our daily lives.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is, indeed, a privilege for me to----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator abstain for a moment.\n  Under the previous order, the time from 1 to 2 p.m. is under the \ncontrol of the Democratic side.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct. I see one of my distinguished colleagues \nrising to be the floor manager of this period of time, but he very \ncourteously said I could open up, if that is approved by the Chair.\n  Mr. President, as I said, it is a great honor for me to first and \nforemost stand on this floor at this great moment in contemporary \nhistory. Tomorrow, this Chamber will, I anticipate, with a strong \nbipartisan vote, exercise its constitutional right of giving consent to \nthe nomination of John Roberts to serve as the next Chief Justice of \nthe United States.\n  I am privileged to know the nominee by virtue of the fact that we \nboth, at different times in our careers, served in a very prestigious \nand revered law firm in our Nation's Capital, the law firm of Hogan & \nHartson. When I joined the firm approximately forty-five years ago, \nNelson T. Hartson was very active in Hogan & Hartson. I had the good \nfortune of being one of his aides-de-camp. Mr. Hartson's philosophy and \nhis standard of ethics permeated that law firm then, as they still do \ntoday.\n  As a consequence of our mutual affiliation with Hogan & Hartson, I \nwas privileged to be asked by Judge Roberts to introduce him when he \nwas nominated by the President to serve on the United States Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. In the 2 years he served \non that court, he established an extraordinarily fine record.\n  I was privileged to once again introduce Judge Roberts to the \nJudiciary Committee some two weeks ago at the start of his confirmation \nhearing to serve in this highest of positions in our land.\n  I would simply say this: As I have come to know this magnificent \nindividual, he is, in my judgment, an unpretentious legal intellectual. \nI say that because he is a man of simplicity in habits. He has a lovely \nfamily. He has a marvelous reputation among colleagues in the legal \nprofession who are both Democrats and Republicans and conservatives and \nliberals. He is admired by all. In that capacity, as an unpretentious \nlegal intellectual, he is, in my judgment, a rare if not an endangered \nspecies here in America for his personal habits and extraordinary \nintellect and for the manner he conducts himself every day of his life.\n  In fact, in the 27 years I have been privileged to serve in the \nSenate, slightly more than 2,000 judicial nominations have been \nsubmitted by a series of Presidents to the Senate for ``advice and \nconsent.'' John Roberts stands at the top, among the finest.\n  I commend our President on making such an outstanding nomination--a \nnomination which will receive strong bipartisan support in the Senate.\n  Just 4 months ago, with the judicial confirmation process stalled in \nthe Senate, and with the Senate on the brink of considering the so-\ncalled nuclear or constitutional option, there was an aura of doubt, at \nthe time, that any Supreme Court nominee would receive a vote \nreflecting bipartisan support.\n\n[[Page S10548]]\n\n  But on May 23, 2005, 14 U.S. Senators, of which I was one, committed \nthemselves, in writing, to support our Senate leadership in \nfacilitating the Senate's constitutional responsibility of providing \n``advice and consent'' in accordance with article II, section 2.\n  In crafting our Memorandum of Understanding, the Gang of 14 started \nand ended every discussion with the Constitution. We discussed how, \nwithout question, our Framers put the word ``advice'' in our \nConstitution for a reason: to ensure consultation between a President \nand the Senate prior to the forwarding of a nominee to the Senate for \nconsideration.\n  Accordingly, in the Gang of 14's Memorandum of Understanding, Senator \nByrd and I incorporated language that spoke directly to the Founding \nFathers' explicit use of the word ``advice.'' That bipartisan accord \nreads as follows:\n\n       We believe that, under Article II, Section 2, of the United \n     States Constitution, the word ``Advice'' speaks to \n     consultation between the Senate and the President with regard \n     to the use of the President's power to make nominations. We \n     encourage the Executive branch of government to consult with \n     members of the Senate, both Democratic and Republican, prior \n     to submitting a judicial nomination to the Senate for \n     consideration.\n       Such a return to the early practices of our government may \n     well serve to reduce the rancor that unfortunately \n     accompanies the advice and consent process in the Senate.\n\n  With respect to the nomination before us today, I believe that the \nPresident has met his constitutional obligations in an exemplary way.\n  In my view, that consultation between the President and individual \nSenators laid a foundation for the confirmation of John Roberts with \nbipartisan support.\n  The Gang of 14's Memorandum of Understanding provided a framework \nthat has helped the Senate's judicial confirmation process. It has \nenabled the Senate to have six up-or-down votes on judicial nominations \nand now the Senate is about to confirm Judge John Roberts.\n  While I thoroughly understand that President Bush didn't choose a \nnominee that some in the Senate might have chosen if they were \nPresident, that is not what the Constitution requires. Indeed, in \nFederalist Paper No. 66, Alexander Hamilton makes it clear that it is \nnot the Senate's job to select a nominee. It is the Senate's \nresponsibility to provide advice to a President on who to nominate and \nthen to grant or withhold consent on that nomination. On the other \nhand, it is the President's responsibility, and solely the President's \nresponsibility, to nominate individuals to serve on our courts. As \nHamilton so clearly wrote:\n\n       It will be the office of the President to nominate, and, \n     with the advice and consent of the Senate, to appoint. There \n     will, of course, be no exertion of choice on the part of the \n     Senate. They may defeat one choice of the Executive, and \n     oblige him to make another; but they cannot themselves \n     choose--they can only ratify or reject the choice of the \n     President.\n\n  In my view, the Senate was given a meaningful opportunity to provide \nits advice to the President, and the President respected the Senate's \nviews when he nominated John Roberts. Soon, the Senate will provide its \nconsent to that nomination.\n  John Roberts' credentials are well-known and of the highest quality.\n  He earned a B.A., summa cum laude, from Harvard College and his law \ndegree, magna cum laude, from Harvard Law School. At Harvard Law \nSchool, he served as managing editor of the Harvard Law Review. \nSubsequent to graduation, Mr. Roberts worked as a Federal law clerk for \nJudge Friendly on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the second Circuit, and \nlater as a law clerk for Justice William Rehnquist on the Supreme \nCourt. He has worked in the Department of Justice, the Reagan \nadministration, the George H.W. Bush administration, and he practiced \nlaw for many years in private practice.\n  But while John Roberts' legal credentials are unquestionably \nimpressive, equally important is the type of person that he is. \nThroughout his legal career, both in public service, private practice, \nand through his pro bono work, John Roberts has worked with and against \nhundreds of attorneys. Those attorneys who know him well typically \nspeak with one voice when they tell you that dignity, humility, and a \nsense of fairness are hallmarks of John Roberts.\n  In my view, all of these traits came across to those of us who \nwatched the hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee. John \nRoberts unquestionably demonstrated a mastery of the law and a \ncommitment to decide cases based upon the Constitution and the law of \nthe land, with appropriate respect and deference to prior Supreme Court \nprecedents. He views his role as one of impartial umpire, rather than \nas one of ideologue with an agenda. He testified to all of this under \noath.\n  To me, all of these qualities--John Roberts' legal credentials and \nhis temperament--represent the embodiment of a Federal judge, \nparticularly a Chief Justice of the United States. And, I am confident \nthat the vast majority of the millions and millions of Americans who \nwatched his confirmation hearings agree.\n  Indeed, the American Bar Association has given John Roberts its \nhighest rating, unanimously finding him ``well qualified'' for this \nposition. And just slightly more than 2 years ago, the Senate \nunanimously confirmed him for a Federal appeals court judgeship by \nvoice vote.\n  Before I conclude my statement in support of this outstanding \nnominee, I would like to highlight a few key facts of Senate history \nand tradition with respect to Supreme Court nominees. I find these \nfacts particularly illustrative.\n  Over the last 50 years, America has seen a total of 27 Supreme Court \nnominees. Six of those nominees received the unanimous consent of the \nSenate by voice vote. Another 15 of those nominees, including seven \ncurrent members of the U.S. Supreme Court, received the consent of the \nSenate by more than 60 votes. In fact, only three nominees to the \nSupreme Court over the course of the last 50 years have failed to \nreceive the consent of the Senate.\n  Chief Justice Rehnquist was confirmed to the Court as an Associate \nJustice in 1971 with 68 votes in support, and later confirmed as Chief \nJustice with 65 votes. John Paul Stevens received the consent of the \nSenate 98 to 0. Justice O'Connor, Justice Scalia, and Justice Kennedy \nwere all confirmed by the Senate unanimously. Justice Souter was \nconfirmed via a vote of 90 to 9. Justice Ginsburg was confirmed by a \nvote of 96 to 3. And Justice Breyer received the Senate's consent by a \nvote of 87 to 9.\n  Like all of these highly qualified Americans who came before him \nseeking Senate confirmation to the Supreme Court, John Roberts has \nearned, over a lifetime, the strong vote of bipartisan support he is \nabout to receive.\n  Mr. President, I will yield the floor to my distinguished colleague \nat this time who will be the manager of this period. I say to my \ncolleague, thank you for participating in the Gang of 14, as we have \nbecome known. Perhaps in the course of our remarks today we can talk \nabout the mission, the challenge of that group, and how, in my humble \njudgment, we did succeed in enabling our leadership to once again put \nin motion the Senate's role in the confirmation of those nominated by \nour President for the Federal judiciary.\n  I think back when there was a great uncertainty about that process, \nand even some thought of invoking certain rules of the Senate by way of \nchange, and how my distinguished colleague from Nebraska and I stood, \nwith others in that group, and were able to lay a foundation which, I \nsay with a deep sense of humility, may well have contributed to our \nbeing here today and casting that historic vote tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I first thank you for the \nopportunity to speak today. And I say to my distinguished colleague \nfrom Virginia, it was a pleasure to get to know you better through the \nGang of 14 in our efforts to bring about advice and consent with the \nWhite House in the nomination process for the Supreme Court.\n  It is always difficult to take either less or more credit than you \ndeserve, but I think in this situation, by working together, we were \nable to bring the Senate into fulfilling its obligation to deal with \nthe confirmation of judicial nominees. It made it possible for us to be \nable to have a nomination and a process that works so well that it will \nnow result in an up-or-down vote on Judge Roberts.\n  The Senator from Virginia is right. There were suggestions that we \nneeded\n\n[[Page S10549]]\n\nto change the rules because of certain practices on the part of certain \nMembers of the Senate that raised doubts about the process, whether we \ncould get up-or-down votes on judicial nominees, particularly appellate \ncourt nominations and perhaps Supreme Court nominees. But by working \ntogether, we found a solution that I believe in very many ways held on \nto the traditions of the Senate that are good but also invoked a \nprocess that has resulted now in what we are going to be able to \naccomplish tomorrow. We were able to refuse to engage in extreme \npartisanship but worked together in partnership to develop a \ncompromise. We paved the way. We preserved the traditions. And I \nbelieve in some respects we have also assisted in leading to the \nhistoric outreach by the White House to an overwhelming number of our \ncolleagues for their input under the advice and consent portion of our \nagreement that we shared with the White House.\n  I personally thank the White House for reaching out. The \nadministration has reached out to many of our Members on several \noccasions. Most recently, I had the pleasure and the privilege of being \ncontacted for my thoughts about the next nominee and the process that \nwould be used there.\n  I think we have also learned not to believe everything we hear about \nthe Senate not being able to accomplish much, the criticism that \nSenators are lost in partisanship and deadlock through the \nunwillingness of people to compromise or be able to work together. I \nbelieve we disproved that theory with this Gang of 14.\n  We have gone through divisive elections. We know America needs to be \nbrought together. We do not seek to further divide ourselves. We need \nto work together. It gave us an opportunity to, in many ways, reduce \nthe partisan tension that was ripping this body to the extent that it \nwas difficult to get anything done, particularly as it might have been \ndifficult to get through the nomination process for the Supreme Court.\n  So it is a pleasure for me to be here on the floor and a real \nprivilege to be associated with my colleague from Virginia. We have \nbeen joined by other members of the Gang of 14 who I know have some \nsimilar thoughts they would like to express.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I might say, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Nebraska was a leader among the Gang of 14. I say to the Senator, \nI guess you might say you were one of the ``Founding Fathers'' of that \ngroup, and modesty prevents you from acknowledging that leadership. We \nare joined on the floor by two of our colleagues. I purposely scheduled \nmy appearance to coincide with members of the Gang of 14 whom I am \nprivileged to be with today.\n  But I think, as the Senator pointed out about the advice and consent \nclause, we, the Gang of 14, want to acknowledge the important \ncontribution of Senator Byrd of West Virginia. He and I sort of \npartnered together to draw up that short paragraph which recognizes and \npoints out the Founding Fathers put the word ``advice'' in the \nConstitution for a specific purpose. As the distinguished Senator from \nNebraska said, indeed, our President fulfilled that. But I wanted to \nacknowledge Senator Byrd's very major participation in our group.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to comment with respect to \nthe Gang of 14. I join my good friend from Nebraska and my good friend \nfrom Virginia and my good friend from Arkansas here today in again \nreminding ourselves as a Chamber that the 14 Members of the U.S. Senate \nwho came together came here to do good. What they decided to do and we \ndecided to do in the formation of that agreement was to transcend \npartisan politics to try to find a common purpose for the benefit of \nthis great institution, the U.S. Senate, and for the benefit of our \nNation.\n  I commend the leadership, particularly of our senior members of that \ngroup of 14 Senators, including the great Senator from West Virginia, \nRobert Byrd, who worked closely with the Senator from Virginia, \nespecially on the advice and consent portions.\n  All of the members of the group were very instrumental in putting the \ncompromise together.\n  I would offer two observations with respect to that process and that \nagreement. The first is, it is my hope, as the newest Member of the \nU.S. Senate, the Senator who still ranks No. 100, that this is a kind \nof template that can be used as our Nation faces difficult issues in \nthe future. We were able to put aside partisan politics to get beyond \nthe gridlock that had existed in this body for some period of time.\n  We must be able, as a Chamber to do the same thing with respect to \nother very difficult issues, such as the Federal deficit or how we \nengage in the recovery of the gulf coast or how we deal with the issues \nof health care, because my involvement in this group was based on the \nfact that I believe it is our responsibility as leaders in our country \nto get about doing the people's business. What was happening was we had \ngotten too involved in this impasse that had been going on for a very \nlong time.\n\n  The second point I wish to make is to underscore the importance of \nthe advice and consent provision of our Constitution. It was Senator \nByrd and Senator Warner who believed it was important to include that \nprovision as part of the agreement. It was in recognition there is a \njoint responsibility between the President of the United States and the \nSenate in the appointment and confirmation of persons to the bench that \nthat advice and consent provision really needed to be part of that \nagreement.\n  From my point of view, it is very important that advice and consent \nprovision of the Constitution be honored because of the fact that, as \nwe make our decisions, it is very important that these decisions, which \nwill have a long-lasting impact on the history of America, be based on \nthe most informed consent possible. The way you get the most informed \nconsent possible is that there be a communication and a free flow of \ninformation between the President and the White House and the members \nof the Judiciary Committee and this body.\n  So I again commend the Senators from Virginia and West Virginia for \nhaving worked so hard on that long weekend to craft language that \nbecame a keystone of this document.\n  Finally, I would say that through this process I also became \ncomfortable with Judge Roberts, recognizing that he is in the \nmainstream of political and, more importantly, legal thought of \nAmerica. I think the Members who were part of this group, led by the \nSenator from Nebraska and the Senator from West Virginia, are also part \nof that mainstream of America.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues from Virginia and Arkansas and \nNebraska.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, one of the things that was surprising to my \nconstituents in Arkansas is that I would actually come to Washington, \nDC, and join a gang. They sometimes wonder what we do up here and why \nwe do it. I am very proud to be part of this gang, with my 13 \ncolleagues who stood tall and exercised some of the best traditions and \nbest judgment that Senators can. One of the lessons we learned through \nthe Gang of 14 process and trying to take the nuclear option off the \ntable--and also trying to get some up-or-down votes on some more \nnominees--is that good things happen when Senators talk to each other.\n  I have learned since I have been in Washington that we spend a lot of \ntime talking about each other and not enough time talking to each \nother. I hope this serves as an object lesson. It shows we can work \ntogether in this political environment. The truth is, we talk about how \nbad things are, and sometimes they do get bad. But basically, we are \nall sent here by our States. Each State gets two Senators. Even the two \nSenators from the same State don't always agree. We don't have to \nagree. But certainly all 100 of us should, as the Book of Isaiah says, \nreason together. We should come together and put the country first and \nput others' interests ahead of our own. We should try to continue to \nwork together and build on not just a bipartisan approach but in many \nways a nonpartisan approach where we look at\n\n[[Page S10550]]\n\nthe challenges facing our country and try to approach those as best we \npossibly can.\n  I know a lot of people around the country and in this Chamber and \nthis city are focused on the next nomination. We haven't even had a \nvote on John Roberts. Nonetheless, a lot of people are concerned about \nthe next nomination. I understand that. In some ways, and rightfully \nso, we should be focused on that. My colleagues have touched on it \nalready. But part of the language Senator Warner and Senator Byrd \ncrafted during this agreement--we all helped in different ways on this \nlanguage and had our thoughts incorporated in the language, but Senator \nByrd and Senator Warner took the lead on the language--is the advice \nand consent portion of the agreement. Basically all we do is encourage \nthe President to take the Constitution literally. When the Constitution \nsays that it shall be with the advice and consent of the Senate, we \ntake that literally. We hope the President will seek our advice.\n  Supposedly either the President or the White House reached out to \nabout 70 of us when we received the John Roberts nomination. That \nworks, and that is very positive. I hope we see that again.\n  Some of my constituents in Arkansas have asked me: Don't you have \nsome anxiety about John Roberts? Gosh, he used to work for the Reagan \nadministration. There are things in his background that various people \ndon't agree with.\n  My response is: Certainly, I have anxiety about John Roberts. I have \nanxiety about any nominee that any President will nominate to the \nSupreme Court. It is a lifetime appointment. There is no question about \nthe influence and the impact that one Supreme Court Justice can have on \nthe American system of justice and on American society. I have anxiety \nabout anybody. I certainly have some about John Roberts. But \nnonetheless, he has the right stuff to be on the Court.\n  I am proud of the courage my colleagues showed in the time when it \nmattered and we came together and worked it out, the Gang of 14.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I am announcing my support for Judge \nJohn Roberts to be Chief Justice of the United States.\n  From the beginning, I told the White House I would like to see a \nnominee that the vast majority of the American people would say, yes, \nthat is the quality of person who ought to be on the Supreme Court. \nWhen the nomination of Judge Roberts was first announced, my initial \nimpression was that he met that test. I had a chance to visit with him \npersonally at some length in my office, and I concluded from that visit \nthat Judge Roberts is exceptional. Not only is he of high intelligence \nand strong character, he also is someone of midwestern values of \nhonesty and decency.\n  I have looked at his record. I find that he is in the judicial \nmainstream. Yes, he is a conservative, but my own belief is that the \nCourt is strengthened by a range of views. I don't think we should have \nall progressives or all conservatives. We need to have people of \ndiffering views and differing backgrounds to make the Supreme Court \nfunction appropriately.\n  When Judge Roberts came to my office, I asked him about his \nassociation with Judge Friendly. He clerked for Judge Friendly. He is \nreported to be very impressed by Judge Friendly's service. I asked him \nwhat impressed him about Judge Friendly. He told me one of the things \nthat most impressed him is that Judge Friendly did much of his own \nwork. He didn't just rely on clerks to do the work. I also asked him \nwhat else impressed him about Judge Friendly.\n  He said: You know, you could not tell whether he was a liberal or a \nconservative, a Democrat or Republican. All you could tell from his \nrulings was that he had profound respect for the law.\n\n  I thought that was a pretty good answer. I went on to ask him: Judge, \nat the end of your service, how would you want to be remembered?\n  He said: I would want to be remembered as a good judge, not as a \npowerful judge but as a good judge.\n  I said to him: What does that mean to you, being a good judge?\n  He said to me: Listening to both sides, putting aside one's personal \nprejudices to rule based on the law. He said: I have a profound respect \nfor the law.\n  In the confirmation hearings, we saw Judge Roberts perform \nbrilliantly. His mastery of the law, his judgment, his demeanor \nconfirmed for me that he is someone who deserves my support.\n  Beyond that, I had a chance to talk to Judge Roberts again on the \nphone last week. I said: Judge, I saw in your confirmation hearings \nthat you said you are not an ideologue.\n  He said: Senator, I can tell you, I do not bring an ideological \nagenda to the court. What I bring is a profound respect for the law.\n  I told him I believed him. I think he is absolutely conservative. \nThat is not disqualifying. I also think he is somebody of extraordinary \ntalent and somebody who will listen to both sides and rule based on the \nlaw. He has a healthy conservatism, believing that the job of a Justice \nis not to make the law but to interpret the law. That is the \nappropriate role for a judge in our system. He has it right with \nrespect to that issue.\n  I believe Judge Roberts has the potential for greatness on the Court. \nRarely have I interviewed anyone in my 19 years who so impressed me \nwith the way their mind works and their basic demeanor. I have \ninterviewed others who struck me as arrogant and pompous and filled \nwith themselves, somebody I would never want to have in a position of \npower over the people I represent. I do not feel that way in the least \nbit about Judge Roberts. He is someone who is steady and even. He is \nsomebody who is thoughtful and quite exceptional.\n  I know there are groups who feel very strongly on one side or \nanother. There are colleagues who have made different judgments. I \nrespect that. But I believe Judge Roberts is the kind of nominee who \ndeserves our support, and he will have mine.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank our distinguished colleague from \nNorth Dakota. That was truly a beautiful set of remarks. It is not just \nthat you indicated that you will cast your vote in support; it was a \nvery thoughtful reflection on a very important responsibility we as \nSenators have.\n  I thank again the Senator from Nebraska, the Senator from Arkansas, \nthe Senator from Colorado. We have been a team together for some time. \nI am delighted to have had the privilege to be here on the floor with \neach of them.\n  In conclusion, I reflect back on, once again, the Federalist Paper \nNo. 66 in which Alexander Hamilton said: It will be the office of the \nPresident to nominate and, with the advice and consent of the Senate, \nto appoint. There will, of course, be no exertion of choice on the part \nof the Senate. They may defeat one choice of the executive and oblige \nhim to make another, but they cannot themselves choose. They can only \nratify or reject the choice of the President.\n  We are on the eve of accepting that choice, giving our consent. \nAgain, in my 27 years in this institution, I cannot recall a more \nhumble and yet enjoyable group I have worked with than these 14 \nSenators. It had been my hope that our distinguished colleague from \nWest Virginia could join us today. I asked him and he said he would if \nhe possibly could. But were he here, we would all stand again and thank \nhim for his guidance as we worked through this situation.\n  I thank my colleague from Nebraska and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from \nVirginia for his wise counsel through the process of bringing together \n13 other colleagues to bring about a confirmation process and \nnomination process that has worked. Now we are on the eve of this \nconfirmation vote on the 17th Chief Justice of the United States. The \nquestion is, what is next? We also have another Supreme Court vacancy \nto fill. I hope the President and the White House will continue to \nreach out and seek the advice of our colleagues so we\n\n[[Page S10551]]\n\ncan face that nomination with the same kind of input we did in the case \nof Judge Roberts.\n  Let me say that the late Senator from Nebraska Ed Zorinsky said on so \nmany occasions that in Washington there are too many Republican \nSenators and too many Democratic Senators and not enough United States \nSenators. I can say as the gang of 14 got together, there were less \nRepublicans and less Democrats than there were United States Senators, \nanxious to work and bring about a resolution to the judicial impasse, \nbut also to pave the way for where we are today and where we are going \nto be tomorrow and where we are going to be in the next confirmation \nprocess.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time from 2 to 3 \np.m. will be under the control of the majority.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the next hour \nunder majority control be allocated as follows: 15 minutes for Senator \nTalent, 10 minutes for Senator Vitter, 15 minutes for Senator Thune, \nand 20 minutes for Senator Bunning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, it is really a privilege for me to spend a \nfew minutes visiting with the Senate about Judge Roberts. He is \nprobably the most analyzed and evaluated Supreme Court nominee ever. \nBased on my study of his record and my discussions with him--which have \ncertainly not been extensive but have been enough to help me get a feel \nfor the man--I believe that he will turn out to be one of the best \nChief Justices ever.\n  We have learned a great deal about who he is. We know about his \nextraordinary professional accomplishments. We have seen the \noverwhelming bipartisan support that he has earned from his colleagues \nin the legal profession. We heard from John Roberts himself on the rule \nof law, on the judicial role, and the kind of service he intends to \nprovide to the Nation as Chief Justice should the Senate confirm him.\n  I said before he is one of the most analyzed and evaluated Supreme \nCourt nominees. He spent almost 20 hours before the Judiciary Committee \nwhile Senators asked him 673 questions. Senators then asked him 243 \nmore questions in writing. And I am sure he thought the bar exam was a \nstruggle. Judge Roberts provided nearly 3,000 pages to the Judiciary \nCommittee, including his published articles, congressional testimony, \ntranscripts from interviews, speeches, and panel discussions, and \nmaterial related to the dozens of cases he argued before the U.S. \nSupreme Court.\n  The Judiciary Committee obtained more than 14,000 pages of material \nin the public domain. And as if all of that were not enough, the \ncommittee obtained a staggering 82,943 pages of additional material \nfrom the National Archives and both the Reagan and Bush Libraries \nregarding Judge Roberts' service in those administrations.\n  If you total that up, there was more than 100,000 pages of material \non a 50-year-old nominee, which amounts to 2,000 pages for every year \nof his life.\n  What did all that material reveal? Simply put, that Judge Roberts is \none of the finest nominees ever to come before the Senate. His \nprofessional record speaks for itself, but I am going to speak about it \nfor a minute.\n  He was an excellent student. He graduated from Harvard--I can forgive \nhim that--in only 3 years as an undergrad. I am a University of Chicago \nlawyer myself. He became the top graduate in law school and became \neditor in chief of the Harvard Law Review. He served as clerk for Judge \nFriendly, who was, by consensus, one of the greatest circuit court \njudges ever. He served as clerk for Chief Justice Rehnquist. He went on \nto become Deputy Solicitor General of the United States. He became one \nof the top partners in one of the top law firms in the country and \nargued 39 cases before the Supreme Court. In 2003, he was confirmed \nunanimously by this Senate to be a judge on the Court of Appeals for \nthe District of Columbia Circuit.\n  We learned a lot about him as a person as well. He embodies the idea \nof being fair, being thoughtful, and being capable. He is certainly \nhard working. He is certainly brilliant. He managed his testimony \nbefore the Judiciary Committee without a note. He is a man of \nintegrity, he is honest, and he is devoted to his family.\n  Those are the qualities we want in the men and women who serve our \nNation on the High Court. They are the kind of qualities that will move \nAmerica forward and move the judicial branch forward, and more on that \nin a minute or two.\n  He has proven beyond any doubt that he has the qualifications, the \ntemperament, the knowledge, and the understanding to serve as America's \nnext Chief Justice. I was particularly impressed by the humility he \nshowed through the process. I think it is very important that judges \nhave a judicial temperament and, for me, that begins with the idea of \nservice.\n  When you are a judge, the people who come before you have to treat \nyou with respect because of your position. You should conduct yourself \nin that position so they want to treat you with respect, they feel that \nis owing to you, not just because of your office but because of how you \nconduct yourself in office.\n  I would hazard to say even those who will oppose his nomination for \nother reasons would agree that he has that kind of a temperament. He \nwants to be on the Court because he loves the law, and he wants to be a \njudge because he wants to serve the United States of America. Those are \nthe right reasons to want to be on the Supreme Court of the United \nStates.\n  We have had this opinion ratified by the individuals who know him the \nbest--by his colleagues on the bar, Democrats and Republicans alike, \nwho have overwhelmingly supported his elevation to the Supreme Court. I \nthink it is very important when you look at judicial nominees to make \ncertain they have support from people from all parts of the political \nspectrum and all parts of the jurisprudential spectrum.\n  A point I made on other occasions on this floor about judicial \nnominations is that it is misleading in a way to talk about a judicial \nnominee being in or out of the mainstream of American jurisprudence \nbecause the truth is, there is more than one mainstream. Lawyers are \ndivided over which jurisprudential theory ought to guide judges in \ninterpreting statutes and interpreting the Constitution. They may \ndiffer as to theories or constructs, if you will, as they approach \ndifferent parts of the Constitution.\n  There is not one mainstream, and often there is not any one \ncompletely correct answer when you are interpreting a vague provision \nof the Constitution. But that does not mean there are no incorrect \nanswers. Just because reasonable people looking at the history and the \ntext of the document might disagree as to what is exactly the right \nanswer does not mean there are no wrong answers.\n  The wrong answer, as Judge Roberts said so eloquently and so often in \nhis testimony, is one that does not respect the rule of law. A wrong \nanswer is one that is based on an idea of the judicial role that allows \nthe judge to do whatever he or she thinks they would want to do if they \nwere in control of the policy in issue. Whatever their theory \nof interpreting the Constitution is, they should be consistent in \napplying it. They should be circumscribed by their own jurisprudence. \nThey should have a standard against which they measure their decisions, \nand that standard has to be other than their own predilections on the \nunderlying issue.\n\n  It is one thing to be ruled, to some extent, by judges. We are \ntalking about officers of the Government. So the decisions have the \npower of law, and we have always, to some extent and in appropriate \nways, been ruled by judges. It is another point to be ruled by judicial \nwhim. This is the distinction Judge Roberts made over and over again, \nfor which I think we should all be grateful.\n  Because of his attitude in that respect, more than 150 Democratic and \nRepublican members of the DC Bar, including well-known Democrats such \nas\n\n[[Page S10552]]\n\nLloyd Cutler and Seth Waxman, wrote to the Senate calling Judge Roberts \none of the very best and most highly respected appellate lawyers in the \nNation.\n  The American Bar Association has given Judge Roberts a rating of \n``unanimously well-qualified,'' its highest possible rating. As Steve \nTober, the chairman of the ABA Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary, explained: Judge Roberts has the admiration and respect of \nhis colleagues on and off the bench, and he is, as we have found, the \nvery definition of collegial. This is another quality that I hope and \nbelieve Judge Roberts will bring to the role of Chief Justice. I think \nhe can operate in that Court in a way that pulls the Justices together \nwhere their convictions honestly allow them to be pulled together. It \nis one thing to disagree when you have strongly different opinions on \nthe jurisprudential matters before the Court; it is another to disagree \nbecause over time you have become part of one faction or you have \nbecome alienated or estranged on some other grounds from some of the \nother Justices.\n  That is not good, and I believe, just my gut opinion after talking \nwith him and watching him is that this is a person who can lower the \ntemperature on the Court, who can shed light rather than just heat on \nmany of the issues that are before the Court.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes remaining of the 15 \nminutes allocated.\n  Mr. TALENT. I did not want my eloquence to outstrip the time I had \navailable, Mr. President, so thank you for that.\n  We have heard a lot from Judge Roberts himself, and maybe it is good \nfor me to close by quoting some of what he has said about the judicial \nfunction. I thought he did an excellent job of explaining to people \nwhat the judicial role is. Of course, to explain something clearly you \nhave to, to some extent, oversimplify it, and he admitted the times he \nwas doing that.\n  He talked about the judge being the umpire, and somebody else \nbasically writes the rules. The judge is the umpire. Believe me, that \ngives plenty of discretion and authority to the judge to develop the \nlaw in one direction or another but to develop it within the \nconstraints of an objective rule of law.\n  Judge Roberts said about this:\n\n       If the people who framed our Constitution were jealous of \n     their freedom and liberty, they would not have sat around and \n     said, ``Let's take all the hard issues and give them over to \n     the judges.'' That would have been the farthest thing from \n     their mind. Now judges have to decide hard questions when \n     they come up in the context of a particular case. That is \n     their obligation. But they have to decide those questions \n     according to the rule of law, not their own social \n     preferences, not their policy views, not their personal \n     preferences, but according to the rule of law.\n\n  That leaves room for Supreme Court Justices, for the rule of law, to \ninclude their views developed over time carefully with respect to \ncolleagues and arguments from litigants about how particular provisions \nof the Constitution ought best to be interpreted in a range of cases so \nas to reflect the purposes of the document and the impulses of the \nFramers.\n  There is room there for that, but always according to the rule of \nlaw, not according to a desire to make the case or make the result be a \nparticular thing, or to make Americans live the way the judge wants \nthem to live, rather than the way they have chosen to live in the \ndecisions they make about their own lives or the decisions they make \nthrough their representatives. I think Judge Roberts understands that. \nHe understands that is a judicial role with which we can all live.\n  He clerked for Judge Henry Friendly. Another great court of appeals \njudge--he had an interesting name--was Learned Hand. If I had met his \nparents, I would have asked them why they called him Learned Hand, but \nthey did. Judge Hand said one time, and he was referring to the same \nthing Judge Roberts was referring to about the rule of law: I would not \nchoose to be governed by a bevy of platonic guardians even if I knew \nhow to choose them, which I most assuredly do not.\n  The first right, the first birthright of every American, is to \nparticipate through the representative process in their own governance. \nThe first and most basic right is the right to govern yourself through \nthe processes set up in our Constitution. And it is not out of a desire \nto avoid difficult decisions but out of a respect for that right that \nJudge Roberts talked about the rule of law. He manifested in those \nhearings a confidence that I think we should all reflect on in the \njudgment and the decency of the American people. It is OK, whether your \nviews about social policy are on the rightwing or whether they are on \nthe leftwing, whether they are someplace in the middle, it is OK \nbasically to leave the development of our culture and our society to \nthe wisdom and the decency of the American people. The center will \nhold. The people will move us in an orderly and decent direction as \nthey have for 200 years. We don't need to be ruled by platonic \nguardians or dictators, whether they are in the form of judges or \nanybody else. There is plenty of scope, in the Senate, on the other end \nof Pennsylvania Avenue, and in the Supreme Court building as well, for \nthe exercise of individual leadership and appropriate discretion to try \nto move the people in a direction that we think is appropriate, with \ntheir consent. But there is no reason to feel out of some fit of \ndesperation or panic that courts or anybody else have to make the \nAmerican people do something they have not chosen the orderly processes \nto do. That is what Judge Roberts meant when he was talking about the \nrule of law.\n  That is why I believe, because of that and also his professional \nqualifications, he is going to do an outstanding job as Chief Justice \nof the United States, and that is why I think he will be confirmed by \nan overwhelming majority of this body.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield back whatever remains of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nSouth Dakota is recognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my strong support for \nthe nomination of Judge John G. Roberts to be Chief Justice of the \nUnited States. This is a historic moment, Mr. President, as many of my \ncolleagues have already noted. This moment marks only the 17th time in \nthe history of our Republic that the U.S. Senate has considered a \nnominee to be Chief Just1ce.\n  As one of the Senate's newest Members, it is a great privilege for me \nto participate in this process. To have had only 16 individuals lead \nthe judicial branch of government in our history illustrates the most \nimportant characteristic of the judicial branch, and that \ncharacteristic is lifetime tenure.\n  I believe the guiding question for each of us in determining a \nnominee's fitness for this post should be whether the person is \ndedicated to applying the Constitution to every case considered by the \nCourt, and not adding to or changing the Constitution's text to suit \nhis or her own personal policy preferences.\n  I was pleased to have met privately with Judge Roberts just \nyesterday. I came away from that meeting even more convinced that this \nman has the ability and temperament necessary to lead the Supreme \nCourt. I believe Judge Roberts is dedicated to the rule of law and the \nprinciple of judicial restraint, and most importantly, will not \nsubstitute his own policy preferences for those of the elected \nrepresentatives in the executive and legislative branches of our \ngovernment.\n  The Supreme Court gets the last word on some of the most challenging \nand divisive issues of our day. Because Federal judges and justices \nhave lifetime tenure, we must ensure that those who populate Federal \nbench are people of strong character and high intellect, with a \npassionate commitment to applying the law as it is written, rather than \nlegislating from the bench.\n  Judges and justices must say what the law is, not what they believe \nit should be. That is the job of the Congress. That is what the authors \nof the Constitution intended.\n  I believe Judge Roberts' career embodies these principles. As Judge \nRoberts stated during his hearing, judges are like umpires, and umpires \ndon't make the rules, they apply them. I do not believe Judge Roberts \nwill engage in the judicial activism that we have witnessed on the \nSupreme Court and the lower Federal courts in the past few decades.\n\n[[Page S10553]]\n\n  Even in the recent past, we have witnessed several instances of \njudicial activism. Judicial activism manifests itself when justices \ndetect ``penumbras, formed by emanations'' in the Constitution, as \nJustice Douglas did in the case of Griswold v. Connecticut--in other \nwords, judges who rely on their personal views rather than the \nConstitution when deciding matters of great importance.\n  We have seen what damage the Supreme Court is able to do when it is \ncomposed of individuals who are not committed to judicial restraint. \nInstead of acting as umpires and applying the law, some on the Supreme \nCourt and the Federal bench are pitching and batting.\n  The most recent example came in the case of Kelo v. City of New \nLondon, decided just this past June. As you know, Mr. President, the \nConstitution says the government cannot take private property for \npublic use without just compensation. However, in the Kelo case, the \nSupreme Court emptied any meaning from the phrase ``for public use'' in \nthe fifth amendment.\n  In Kelo, the Supreme Court held that a city government's decision to \ntake private homes for the purpose of economic development satisfies \nthe ``public use'' requirement of the fifth amendment. This case makes \nprivate property vulnerable to being taken and transferred to another \nprivate owner, so long as the government's purpose for the taking is \ndeemed ``economic development.''\n  While I understand that many of the principles reflected in the \nConstitution are written broadly, and sometimes can be subjected to \nconflicting interpretations, I think we can all agree that the Supreme \nCourt cannot be adding or deleting text from the Constitution. Yet that \nis what happened in the Kelo case. The majority effectively deleted an \ninconvenient clause in the fifth amendment.\n  The Supreme Court is also engaging in a troubling pattern of relying \nupon international authorities to support its interpretations of the \nlaws of the United States. In Atkins v. Virginia, the Court cited the \ndisapproval of the ``world community'' as authority for its decision. \nIn Lawrence v. Texas, the Court cited a decision by the European Court \nof Human Rights as authority for that decision. Most recently, in Roper \nv. Simmons, the Court cited the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the \nChild--a treaty never ratified by the United States--as authority for \nthat decision.\n  Article II, section 2 of the Constitution requires two-thirds of the \nSenate to ratify a treaty. Democratically elected Members of the \nSenate, accountable to the people, have refused to ratify the U.N. \nConvention on the Rights of the Child.\n  Unfortunately the Supreme Court chose to ignore this fact and based \ntheir judgment in part on a treaty never ratified by the United States. \nClearly, some on the Supreme Court are substituting the policy \npreferences of democratically elected representatives with their own. \nThis is judicial activism at its worst.\n  As we near the completion and expected confirmation of Judge Roberts, \nI want to take a moment and look ahead as the President will soon make \nanother nomination to the Supreme Court. It is important that the \nnominee to replace Justice O'Connor share Judge Roberts' commitment to \njudicial restraint and dedication to the rule of law. It is important \nbecause the Supreme Court will be considering several cases in the near \nfuture that may have far-reaching consequences.\n  The Supreme Court will probably consider the Pledge of Allegiance \ncase that was recently decided in the Ninth Circuit at the district \ncourt level. In that case, the district court held that the words \n``under God'' in the Pledge of Allegiance violate the establishment \nclause of the first amendment. However, in the Fourth Circuit, the \nappellate court came to the opposite holding--that the Pledge of \nAllegiance did not violate the establishment clause. Where there are \nconflicting holdings in the lower courts, the Supreme Court must become \nthe final authority on the matter, and it is important that Judge \nRoberts and individuals who share his approach are on the court to \nconfront this issue.\n  During the next term, the Supreme Court will also consider a case \nabout a State's parental notification law and possibly a case about \npartial-birth abortion. Again, these are instances where the Supreme \nCourt will have the last word on one of the most divisive moral issues \nof our time. It is critical that those who confront these cases are \ndeferential to the elected branches of our government, exercise \nrestraint, and follow the law.\n  After our confirmation vote tomorrow on Judge Roberts, the President \nwill forward his nominee to fill the seat vacated by Justice O'Connor. \nIt will then become our duty in the Senate to provide our advice and \nconsent on that nomination. It is a responsibility that we should all \ntake very seriously. The manner in which we handle that nomination will \nsay a lot about the Senate as an institution.\n  I read in today's edition of the Washington Post that several of our \nDemocratic colleagues, as well as the Democratic National Committee \nchairman, are already threatening to filibuster the next nominee to the \nSupreme Court. It is shocking to me that they are threatening a \nfilibuster of the next nominee before they even know who the nominee is \ngoing to be. They are even threatening to filibuster possible nominees \nwho were just confirmed to the appellate courts and explicitly included \nin the Memorandum of Understanding that seven Democrats and seven \nRepublicans signed onto last May.\n  That is wrong and the American people will see it for the blind \npartisanship that it is. I would remind my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle that they have sworn to uphold the Constitution through \ntheir representation in this body, not to thwart its intent or reshape \nits application to suit the nattering liberal elite and their special \ninterest groups. I implore my Democratic colleagues not to blindly \nabuse the filibuster. These threats are symptomatic of the breakdown of \nthe nomination process, and they must stop.\n  The process by which justices and judges are nominated and confined \nhas degenerated to a point where ideological litmus tests are too often \napplied and nominees are torn apart by personal attacks.\n  The nomination process should not be brought down to the level of \npersonal attacks on the nominee or fishing expeditions into the \nnominee's political allegiances. I believe there is a lot of room for \nimprovement in the process, and I hope to see such improvement as we \nconsider the next nominee.\n  One ideological litmus test I am hearing about a lot these days is \nthat the Supreme Court must somehow maintain its ``balance.'' Where in \nthe Constitution does it say that a certain balance must be maintained \non the Supreme Court? According to the Constitution, the President is \nentitled to nominate the individuals he desires to have on the courts, \nand we in the Senate must determine whether the nominee is fit and \nqualified. There should be no ideological litmus test for nominees. If \na nominee is fit and qualified, he or she should be confirmed.\n  I believe Judge Roberts is eminently fit and qualified to serve as \nthe next Chief Justice. I will proudly cast my vote for him, and I urge \nmy colleagues to do the same.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nLouisiana is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. VITTER. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nLouisiana is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. VITTER. I thank the Chair.\n  I, too, rise in strong support of the nomination of John Roberts to \nbe Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. I do that for two reasons, \ntwo equally important reasons. One is the strong qualification and \nbackground of Judge Roberts. But the second and perhaps just as \nimportant or even more important is the fact that this nomination and \nthis confirmation process I believe has gotten us back as a Senate, as \na country to the process that the Founders intended and the sort of \nvalues and the sort of qualifications, the sort of judgment by the \nSenate that the Founders intended.\n  We are finally remembering that it is the President's prerogative to \nnominate qualified persons to fill judicial vacancies, and in the past \nthe Senate\n\n[[Page S10554]]\n\nhas accorded great deference to the President's selection. Justice \nGinsburg was overwhelmingly confirmed 42 days after her nomination. \nJustice O'Connor was overwhelmingly confirmed 33 days after her \nnomination. So we are returning to that determination of the \nPresident's prerogative.\n  The White House is to be commended for engaging in unprecedented \nconsultation with respect to this nominee. So we are also returning to \na very robust and full and healthy consultation process. I understand \nthat the Bush administration consulted with more than 70 Senators on \nthe Roberts nomination, countless conversations and phone calls and \nmeetings and now is a strong part of our tradition which we are \ncertainly returning to.\n  Moreover, few would disagree that President Bush could not have \nnominated a more qualified person for this position. John Roberts has \nan impressive academic background, a distinguished career in Government \nservice, private practice, and as a Federal judge.\n  So we are also returning to that fine tradition that actual \nqualifications matter. It is not all about ideology and political \npositions but qualifications, judicial temperament, those sorts of \nimportant considerations matter, first and foremost.\n  Certainly, Judge Roberts has those. He graduated summa cum laude from \nHarvard college, my alma mater. He also graduated from Harvard Law \nschool, magna cum laude. I guess he couldn't get into Tulane Law \nSchool, as I did, but I congratulate him on his accomplishments at \nHarvard. After graduation, he law clerked for Judge Henry Friendly on \nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and then for William \nRehnquist on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Judge Roberts enjoyed a distinguished career as a public servant in \nmany different positions during the Reagan administration and became a \npartner at a major and highly respected law firm in Washington, DC, \nwhere he acquired the reputation as one of the finest Supreme Court \nadvocates in the country. In fact, he argued an impressive 39 cases \nbefore the Supreme Court. Of course, as we all know, Judge Roberts was \nappointed in 2002 by President Bush for the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe District of Columbia Circuit--those sort of mainstream \nqualifications.\n  Academic, practice, smarts, judicial temperament--all are certainly \nvery important. But I think the single most important factor which \nqualifies Judge Roberts for this esteemed position is his appropriate \nview of what it means to be a judge, his appropriate view of the \nlimited role of the judiciary and what that means in our system of \ngovernment.\n  He has said, frankly and refreshingly, in a straightforward way, that \njudges should not place ideology above thoughtful legal reasoning. He \nis not the sort who will legislate from the bench. His judicial \nphilosophy is based on the rule of law and on respect for the \nConstitution.\n  Let's think about what he said in his own words. This is what he said \non September 12 at his confirmation hearing:\n\n       [A] certain humility should characterize the judicial role. \n     Judges and justices are servants of the law, not the other \n     way around. Judges are like umpires. Umpires don't make the \n     rules, they apply them. The role of an umpire and a judge is \n     critical. They make sure everybody plays by the rules but it \n     is a limited role. Nobody ever went to the ball game to see \n     the umpire.''\n\n  He also said on the same occasion:\n\n        . . . I come before the committee with no agenda, I have \n     no platform. Judges are not politicians who can promise to do \n     certain things in exchange for votes. I have no agenda. But I \n     do have a commitment. If I am confirmed, I will confront \n     every case with an open mind. I will fully and fairly analyze \n     the legal arguments that are presented. I will be open to the \n     considered views of my colleagues on the bench, and I will \n     decide every case based on the record, according to the rule \n     of law, without fear or favor, to the best of my ability, and \n     I will remember it is my job to call balls and strikes, and \n     not to pitch or bat.\n\n  That, first and foremost, is the tradition we are getting back to \nwith this confirmation. I sincerely hope that it is a tradition in \nwhich we remain grounded. Let's remember again the lessons of this \nnomination and this confirmation. Let's remember that it is the \nPresident's prerogative to nominate qualified persons to the bench. \nLet's remember that the Senate does have an important consultative role \nand let's all encourage the President to perform that consultation in a \nfull and robust fashion, as he did with Judge Roberts. Let's remember \nthat qualifications--smarts, academic credentials, practice history--\nare very important when you are talking about a judicial nominee. And \nlet's all remember, first and foremost, that judges are umpires, they \nare not the players in the baseball game. That is the crucial \ndistinction that I think we have lost over the past several decades and \nthat we are finally trying to pull back to.\n  It is very important for us as a body to remember that lesson of this \nnomination of this confirmation as we move on. As we move on, I do \nthink that is the most important open question. As the previous speaker \nmentioned, already certain Democrats in this body are threatening a \nfilibuster without having the foggiest notion who the next nominee to \nthe U.S. Supreme Court may be. Already they are threatening a \nfilibuster of circuit court nominees who have basically been agreed to \nin terms of no filibuster in the Senate.\n  That would move us dramatically in the opposite direction from the \none I have spoken about. That would turn the clock back. That would \nmove us 180 degrees and point us again in that wrong direction.\n  I will be proud to join with other Members of this body tomorrow for \nthis historic confirmation vote. I will be proud to vote yes for Judge \nJohn Roberts to be the next Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Just as proudly, just as fervently, I will argue and fight to make \nsure that where we are today is where we remain in terms of future \nnominations and future confirmations; that we all remember that we are \ntalking about an umpire to enforce the rules of the game, not a \nplayer--not a batter we like or a fielder we prefer but the umpire to \nenforce the rules as written.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nKentucky is recognized for 20 minutes.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of John Roberts \nto be the next Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. Confirmation of \na Supreme Court Justice, particularly the Chief Justice, is one of the \nmost important duties we have in the Senate. I hope we can put politics \nand partisanship aside and swiftly confirm him.\n  Earlier this year, we found ourselves in an unprecedented position. \nThe Democratic minority decided to use Senate rules to block judicial \nnominees. The minority tried to take away the power of nomination that \nthe Constitution gives the President. But President Bush was solidly \nreelected last fall, and during the campaign he stressed the type of \njudges he would nominate--those who respect the law and the \nConstitution and who will not legislate from the bench.\n  The American people knew what they were getting when they reelected \nPresident Bush. President Bush kept his word. His judicial nominees \nhave been highly qualified and worthy of confirmation. The minority's \nobstructionism ended earlier this year, or at least for now. Many on \nthe left want to see a filibuster against John Roberts, but I have no \ndoubt that John Roberts will be confirmed soon. Our job is to determine \nthe qualifications of the nominees. Then we should vote to approve or \noppose them. Anything else is to disregard the oath we took when we \njoined the Senate.\n  Our job is not to oppose nominees because we think their views are \ndifferent from ours. We should not oppose nominees to keep our \npolitical base happy. Regardless of all the excuses, nominees deserve a \nvote. That is it.\n  John Roberts is extremely qualified to serve on the Supreme Court, \nand he is as qualified to be Chief Justice. He is, no doubt, one of the \nmost qualified nominees to come before the Senate since I have been \nhere. He is a brilliant legal scholar, an accomplished attorney, and a \nfine judge. I will strongly support him.\n  I do not need to spend too much time restating John Roberts' \nqualifications. They have been stated. He graduated with honors from \nHarvard college and its law school. He clerked in the Second Circuit \nCourt of Appeals and for Chief Justice Rehnquist when he was an \nAssociate Supreme Court Justice.\n\n[[Page S10555]]\n\nJohn Roberts also worked for the Attorney General, the White House \ncounsel and Solicitor General in previous administrations.\n  In private practice, he was one of the best appellate and Supreme \nCourt litigator's in the Nation. He argued an unprecedented 39 cases \nbefore the Supreme Court. Now he is a judge on the DC Circuit Court of \nAppeals, where he has been since we confirmed him unanimously in 2003.\n  His resume is not what convinces me that he will be a fine Chief \nJustice. What is clear is that John Roberts respects the law and \nConstitution and will be faithful to the proper role of a judge. In his \nconfirmation hearings, Judge Roberts used an example to explain the \nproper role of a judge. It has been stated before. He said a judge is \nlike an umpire, not a player or a coach. And similar to an umpire, a \njudge applies the rules to the situation at hand. An umpire doesn't \nrewrite the rules or enforce what he thinks the rules ought to be.\n  I know a little bit about umpires. I have dealt with them, and all \ntypes of them, for years. Some are liberal and some conservative with \nthe strike zone. Some were unpredictable and made the strike zone up as \nthe game went along. The worst umpires decided the outcome of the game \nby playing favorites or enforcing their own version of the rules. The \nbest umpires applied the rules as written in the rule book and let the \nrules and the players dictate the outcome of the game.\n  As Judge Roberts said, that is how judges should act. The law, and \nnot judges, should decide the outcome of the cases. The rules of the \ngame, the writing of the laws is done by Congress. The President \nimplements and enforces the laws, the judiciary settles disputes by \napplying laws and the Constitution. Judges are not lawmakers as umpires \nare not players. If umpires want to be players, that umpire should quit \nand join a team. If a judge wants to write laws, he should run for \nCongress.\n  We have seen courts try to replace Congress and legislatures. Social \nissues have been taken out of the political process and decided by \nunelected judges. The voice of the people has too often been ignored. \nActivism of a few judges threatens our judicial system.\n  If judges keep exercising powers not granted to them, the public and \nits servants may tune out the courts and ignore them altogether. That \nwould be bad and we would all suffer. I think Judge Roberts sees that \ndanger. As Chief Justice, he will protect the Constitution and \nreputation of the courts.\n  At his confirmation hearing, Judge Roberts recognized the damage of \nan activist judiciary. Their activism undermines the authority and \nrespect needed to overturn truly unconstitutional actions. Courts must \nnot be activists and settle public policy disputes. Judge Roberts also \nsees that danger, and I trust he will work hard to keep the Court \nwithin its boundaries and implore judges to exercise restraint in \ndecisionmaking. A key part of that restraint is to not wade into public \npolicy disputes. I imagine it is tempting for judges to impose their \npersonal views when making decisions.\n  But I believe Judge Roberts will exercise restraint and encourage the \nFederal court system to do the same.\n  Many of my colleagues are frustrated over Judge Roberts not revealing \nhis views on public policy.\n  As Chief Justice, Judge Roberts is not going to act like a Senator. \nHe will not let his personal views influence his decision and rulings.\n  The complaints of some of my colleagues led me to believe that they \ndid not understand the role our Founding Fathers intended for the \ncourts. Congress is the policymaking branch of government. The \nPresident and the administration enforce the laws. And the courts act \nas neutral decisionmakers when disputes arise.\n  But my colleagues know this.\n  And so I fear they see the courts as a political arm to implement \ntheir liberal policy agenda.\n  To them--the Supreme Court is a super legislature. But that is not \nwhat our Framers envisioned. And that is not how Judge Roberts will use \nhis position as Chief Justice.\n  The left turns to the courts to impose their agenda because they \ncannot advance it through elections. They cannot pass their laws \nthrough Congress or legislatures. They cannot even get elected by \nrunning on their liberal policies. So they must use the courts to \nimpose their agenda.\n  What is that agenda?\n  Unlimited abortion on-demand; banning schoolchildren from saying the \nPledge of Allegiance; banishing the Ten Commandments from public \nplaces; rewriting the definition of marriage; and banning arms for \nself-defense.\n  That agenda does not sell with America or in Congress.\n  So the last great hope for liberals is the judicial bench. And that \nis why they oppose nominees who do not agree to their liberal activist \nagenda.\n  The only thing stopping the rewriting of our Constitution are judges \nthat will support the rule of law.\n  John Roberts is one such judge. He will not write new laws from the \nbench.\n  As Chief Justice, he will set an example for the court system to \nfollow the same principles.\n  Many Senators have expressed frustration at not knowing Judge \nRoberts' political views. I do not know his views either.\n  I have not asked him. And I will not ask him.\n  They do not matter. I trust him not to let his political beliefs \ninfluence his decisions.\n  During his hearing, Judge Roberts rightly declined to answer how he \nwould rule in specific cases.\n  The current Supreme Court Justices also declined to answer similar \nquestions.\n  Answering those kind of questions would corrupt and politicize the \nprocess.\n  Judicial nominees would turn into politicians campaigning for office \nto get confirmed--pledging to vote a certain way in order to gain \nvotes.\n  They would also have to make promises to the President in order to \nget nominated.\n  Judges must be selected based on their qualifications.\n  I have not asked Judge Roberts about his personal political views. I \nhave not asked him about his legal views. I do not need to know how he \nwill rule in a certain particular case--because I know his approach to \nthe law--and that is all I need to know.\n  John Roberts will lead by example and earn the respect of the other \nJustices and the American public. He will also be joined on the Court \nby another new Justice.\n  I trust President Bush will choose another highly qualified nominee \nto replace retiring Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.\n  If the new nominee is in a similar mold and has the same respect for \nthe rule of law, then I will be glad to support the next nominee.\n  I have seen comments from some of my Democrat colleagues that they \nwill filibuster certain nominees. That is most unfortunate. And it \ncould bring us back to the point where we were earlier this year.\n  I hope and pray the minority does not do this.\n  But make no mistake about it. We will ensure that the next nominee \nreceives fair treatment in the Senate and gets a vote.\n  I thank President Bush for keeping his promise to nominate \noutstanding individuals to our courts.\n  I thank Chairman Specter for ushering this nomination swiftly through \nhis Judiciary Committee.\n  And I thank John Roberts for his service to our country.\n  I vow very strongly to vote for him when his vote comes up tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to express my agreement \nwith the Senator from Kentucky. He stated the case very clearly for the \nproper role for a judge. I know he faced many an umpire in his Hall of \nFame baseball career. But he knows when they make the call, they are \nstuck with it, and he has every right to expect that that umpire is \ngoing to make the call not based on whether they favor one team or \nanother or one side or another but what the rules of the game are.\n  I think that metaphor Judge Roberts utilized as he talked about the \nrole of a judge is an apt one.\n  I saw Senator Burns here. He used to be a football referee. I wanted \nto ask him: Senator Burns, if you thought that the holding call was a \nlittle bit inadvertent and it wasn't too a bad a holding call but the \npenalty called for\n\n[[Page S10556]]\n\n15 yards, should the referee be free to impose 10 yards because they \nthink that might be more fair? No. Of course, not. Those are the basic \nprinciples of rules.\n  I am pleased that we have a nominee who I think understands it.\n  Activism is a concern of the American people. It is something that \nshould concern all of us because it represents a movement by unelected, \nlifetime-appointed judges to impose policy decisions and values on the \nAmerican people. If it is required by the Constitution, that is their \njob. If it is not required and not a part of the Constitution, they \nshould not be engaged in those kinds of issues.\n  The high point I think of activism was when two Supreme Court \nJustices in every death penalty case declared that they dissented and \nthey would oppose all death penalty cases in the United States because \nthey believed the Constitutional prohibition on cruel and unusual \npunishment prohibited the death penalty. That might sound plausible. \nBut the Constitution itself has half a dozen references to capital \ncrimes. That means crimes for which you may take somebody's life. It \nhas references to not being able to take life without due process of \nlaw. Obviously, you could take life with due process of law. And when \nthe Constitution was written, every single State, every single Colony, \nmembers of the Confederacy, had the death penalty, and they did when \nthe Constitution was written.\n  So it is obviously the judges' decision that they didn't like the \ndeath penalty. They declared it was unenlightened public policy \ninvolving a standard of decency and all of that, and that justified \ntheir opinion. But that wasn't so, was it? Because State after State \nhas maintained the death penalty. Many have enacted death penalties \nafter they eliminated the death penalty.\n  It is not what the American people rejected, in fact, and would never \nhave been rejected by the members of the legislatures of all the \nStates.\n  They tried to say the Constitution prohibited any State from having a \ndeath penalty.\n  That is an extreme abrogation of power, and it is something we should \nbe concerned about.\n  What did Judge Roberts say?\n  I see my chairman, Senator Specter, who has done such a great job in \nmoving this nomination forward. I want to speak long and will yield the \nfloor to him. I had my opportunity to make a few remarks earlier.\n  But I think it is important for us to listen to the eloquent, \nbeautifully repeated--I am going to touch on a few of his statements--\nbut the repeated statements of Judge Roberts in different ways that \naffirm so clearly that he knows what the role of the judge is in the \nAmerican legal system. I picked out a few.\n\n       It is that rule of law that protects the rights and \n     liberties of all Americans. It is the envy of the world, \n     because without the rule of law any rights are meaningless.\n       Mr. Chairman, I come before this committee with no agenda. \n     I have no platform.\n\n  Neither the President nor Members of our side of the aisle are asking \nany nominee to impose our political agenda on this country. I would \nnever do that. That is not the role of a judge. But neither do I think \nthe judge ought to be opposing any agenda. And I certainly am offended \nwhen they oppose the agenda which I don't agree with, which I think is \nthe province of the legislative branches. Judge Roberts understands \nthat.\n  Then he goes on:\n\n       That's a paraphrase, but the phrase, calmly poise the \n     scales of Justice if, if anything, the motto of the court on \n     which I now sit. That would be the guiding principle for me \n     whether I am back on that court or a different one, because \n     some factors may be different, the issues may be different, \n     the demands may be different, but the Bill of Rights remains \n     the same. And the obligation of a court to protect those \n     basis liberties in times of peace and in times of war, in \n     times of stress and in times of calm, that doesn't change.\n\n  What a beautiful statement.\n  Another:\n\n       Like most people, I resist the labels. I have told people \n     when pressed that I prefer to be known as a modest judge, and \n     to me that means some of the things that you talked about in \n     those other labels. It means an appreciation that the role of \n     the judge is limited, that a judge is to decide the cases \n     before them, they're not to legislate, they're not to execute \n     the laws.\n\n  Another:\n\n       I don't think the courts should have a dominant role in \n     society and stressing society's problems. It is their job to \n     say what the law is.\n\n  Isn't that correct?\n\n       But the Court has to appreciate that the reason they have \n     that authority is because they're interpreting the law, \n     they're not making policy, and to the extent they go beyond \n     their confined limits and make policy or execute the law, \n     they lose their legitimacy, and I think that calls into \n     question the authority they will need when it's necessary to \n     act in the face of unconstitutional action.\n\n  That is a brilliant statement.\n  If a court consistently abuses its power, does not remain faithful to \nthe Constitution, at some point it may have to take a very unpopular \nstand to truly and rightfully defend the Constitution against \ncongressional Presidential overreaching.\n  Will they have the credibility to do so? Not so, perhaps, if they \nhave squandered it by improper legislation for many years that has \nundermined public confidence in the Court.\n  That is exactly what he is saying--a beautiful statement.\n  If you believe in our Constitution, if you believe in the laws to \nprotect our liberties and that laid the foundations for our prosperity, \none must believe that we have to enforce the Constitution, even if you \nmight not agree with some part of it.\n  He was asked, ``Are you an originalist? Are you a strict \nconstructionist? What label do you put on yourself, Judge?''\n  He said this:\n\n       I do not have an overarching judicial philosophy that I \n     bring to every case, and I think that's true. I tend to look \n     at the cases from the bottom up rather than the top down. And \n     like I think all good judges focus a lot on the FACTS. We \n     talk about the law, and that's a great interest for all of \n     us, but I think most cases turn on the facts, so you do have \n     to know those, you have to know the record.\n\n  In other words, we were asking him to blithely make his views known \non how he would rule on this case or that case. By the time it gets to \nthe Supreme Court of the United States there has been a full trial and \nmaybe hundreds, maybe thousands of pages of transcript and records. \nThere are facts that underlie the dispute, and it is only after the \nfacts are asserted that a judge needs to be making a decision about the \noutcome of a case.\n  Judges apply the facts to the legal requirements of the situation, \nand only then make a decision. He refused to make opinions on cases \nthat may come before him. Of course, he should not make opinions on \nthat. He has not studied the record, the transcript, talked with the \nother judges, read the briefs, or heard the oral arguments of counsel. \nHe should not be up there making opinions on the cases. That is so \nobvious. He was pushed, pushed, and pushed to do that and criticized \nfor not doing so. That is the rule of the law: Do not make a decision \nuntil you know the facts and the law.\n  I will say this: We have had a tutorial on the rule of law under the \nAmerican system. We have had a classroom exercise beyond anything any \nMember could ask for on the role of a judge in the American system. It \nwas a beautiful thing. I am pleased to see many of my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle have seen fit now to announce they intend to \nsupport Judge Roberts. That is the right thing. I am confident, also, \nthe President will submit another nominee, just like he promised, who \nwill be consistent with the same philosophy of Judge Roberts--one who \ndoes not seek to impose any political agenda, liberal or conservative, \non the American people, but will simply consider the facts, consider \nthe arguments of counsel, and decide the case before them.\n  That is what we have a right to ask and to insist on to preserve the \nrule of law in this country, which, more than any other country in the \nworld, reveres and respects and venerates law and order.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, before the distinguished Senator from \nAlabama yields the floor, I thank and compliment him for his comments \nand for his work on the Judiciary Committee. He has been steadfast in \nhis participation in all matters but especially with the nomination \nproceedings as to Judge Roberts. It ought to be noted for the record.\n\n[[Page S10557]]\n\n  Mr. President, Senator Domenici was here seeking an opportunity to \nspeak. I ask unanimous consent he be sequenced following my speech.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \ncomment on a story which is in the Washington Post today captioned \n``Filibuster Showdown Looms in the Senate: Democrats Prepare For Next \nCourt Pick.''\n  I suggest it is in the national interest that there be a lowering of \nthe decibel level of the partisan rhetoric. There is no doubt that the \nprocess for the nomination, hearings, and confirmation of a Supreme \nCourt nominee is part of the political process. I further suggest \npartisanship has its limits.\n  The partisanship which is demonstrated in this report by the \nWashington Post today seems to me to be flagrant, extreme partisanship, \nflagrantly excessive partisanship, really out of bounds and out of the \nmainstream.\n  The core objection raised by certain Democratic political activists \nas outlined in the Washington Post story is frustration among party \nactivists who think their elected leaders did not put up a serious \nfight against Judge Roberts.\n  I was present as chairman of the committee during the entire \nproceeding. I can state it was a very vigorous fight. It is not \nnecessary to have Arlen Specter's characterization of it. The record \nspeaks for itself. We had experienced Senators on the Democrat side of \nthe aisle who questioned Judge Roberts very closely and who came to the \nconclusion they would vote no, which they did in the committee \nproceedings. Senator Kennedy, who can doubt his tenacity? Senator \nBiden, who can doubt his sincerity? And Senator Feinstein questioned \neloquently in many directions. Senator Schumer was on top of all of the \nissues not only in three rounds of questioning which we had, 30 minutes \nand then 20 minutes and then 30 more minutes, but in the submission of \nwritten questions. And Senator Durbin, the assistant minority leader, \nspoke and all voted against Judge Roberts because that was their \nconclusion.\n  But who can say they didn't put up a strong and tough fight? That is \nan insult to those dedicated Senators tending to their business to say \nthey did not put up a professional fight.\n  There are at this moment some 18 announced or reported Senators on \nthe Democrat side who are going to vote in favor of the Roberts \nnomination: Senator Baucus, Senator Bingaman, Senator Byrd, Senator \nConrad, Senator Dodd, Senator Dorgan, Senator Feingold, Senator \nJohnson, Senator Kohl, Senator Landrieu, Senator Leahy, Senator Levin, \nSenator Lieberman, Senator Nelson of Nebraska, Senator Nelson of \nFlorida, Senator Pryor, Senator Salazar, and Senator Wyden.\n  Among those 18 Senators are some veterans of the Senate whose \ncredentials cannot be challenged as progressive, as liberal, as \nforward-thinking Senators.\n  I will quote from just a few of the comments which they have made. \nSenator Leahy was the first among the Democrats to speak out in favor \nof the nomination of Judge Roberts to be Chief Justice. As the ranking \nmember, I sat next to him during the entire proceeding. I can attest \nfirsthand the conscientious way Senator Leahy approached this \nnomination. It was not a matter of our discussing the merits. It was \nnot a matter of my trying to persuade him.\n  I have served with Senator Leahy for 25 years, and many years before \nthat, back in 1969 when I was the host at the National District \nAttorney's Association Convention in Philadelphia, I was Philadelphia's \nD.A., and Pat Leahy, a young prosecutor from Burlington, VT, was the \nprosecuting attorney in his jurisdiction. I could see him struggle with \nthe nomination as a matter of conscience. He came to the conclusion \nthat was where his conscience led.\n\n  I identified with his courageous move in the committee. It is not \neasy to go against the party line, and Senator Leahy was prepared to do \nthat.\n  His statement was a very thoughtful statement, as Senator Leahy is \naccustomed to be: He commented extensively on Judge Roberts' reliance \non the Raich decision, moving away from Lopez and Morris on the \ncommerce clause. He comments extensively on the precedence of Roe and \nPlanned Parenthood v. Casey and forcefully on a number of occasions \nregarding the recognition to the right to privacy embodied in Griswold \nv. Connecticut.\n  Senator Leahy commented about the assurances which he accepted from \nJudge Roberts about taking the mold of Justice Jackson, moving away \nfrom being a partisan in the administration as Attorney General to \nbeing an impartial judge.\n  There is much more, but the record of what Senator Leahy has said \nspeaks for itself.\n  In addition to Senator Leahy, there are other very well established \nSenators on the other side of the aisle, impeccable standing in the \nliberal community. Senator Levin spoke in favor of Judge Roberts; \nSenator Dodd spoke in favor of Judge Roberts for Chief Justice; Senator \nFeingold in the committee; Senator Lieberman. I have already enumerated \nthe Senators.\n  So when there are some so-called Democrat political activists who \nspeak up and are critical, as they were of Senator Leahy after he made \nthe opening declaration, first of the Democrats to speak--we are all \nsubject to comment and we are all subject to criticism, but I was taken \na little aback by the criticism which came to Senator Leahy after he \nmade his declaration. I have been the object of such substantial \ncriticism myself, so I know what it was like. But I think it goes a \nlittle too far when the so-called political activists are raising these \nobjections out of purely partisan motivations. One activist was quoted \nin this story as saying that Democrats must vote against Judge Roberts, \notherwise ``we will not win an election.''\n  The political process, I submit, goes only so far. And as foreign \npolicy debate stops at the water's edge, at least it used to \ntraditionally, I think that extreme partisanship stops at the \nconsideration of a nominee for the Supreme Court of the United States. \nThat is a line at which party loyalties ought to end and there ought to \nbe independence. That is the confluence of the three branches of \nGovernment where, as we all know under our Constitution, the President \nnominates, where the Senate conducts proceedings and confirms or \nrejects, and where the nominee, if confirmed, if approved, then takes a \nseat on the Supreme Court. That is a line in the administration of \njustice in the United States where partisanship, rank, extreme \npartisanship ought to end.\n  The so-called political activists are blunt in what they had to say. \nTheir concern is ``restoring enthusiasm among the rank and file on the \nleft.''\n  I suggest there is a higher calling on selecting a nominee for the \nSupreme Court, and especially for a Chief Justice, which transcends \nappeal to extremes at one end of the political spectrum or the other.\n  This kind of comment, I believe, is only going to inspire corollary \ncomment from the other end of the political spectrum. We simply do not \nneed it. I sensed, and have commented publicly on, a lot of frustration \nbubbling just below the surface in the Roberts nomination hearings. I \nam concerned about the next nomination. We are looking at a replacement \nfor Justice O'Connor, who was a swing vote. I have stated both publicly \nand privately my hope we will find someone in the mold of Judge \nRoberts.\n  The statements which were made by Senator Leahy, by Senator Levin, by \nSenator Dodd, by Senator Feingold, and others all focused on the \napproach of Judge Roberts to modesty and stability. And it was more \nthan the words he uttered, it was the way he conducted himself. It was \nthe way he spoke about the cases when he answered the questions and \nwhen he did not answer questions. I spoke at length earlier, on Monday, \nabout questions which I thought he should have answered but he did not \nanswer. But that is the nominee's prerogative. And then the Senator's \nprerogative is to make a decision on how the Senator is going to vote. \nBut when you talk about a filibuster, this body was at the risk of a \nvirtual civil war, with the Democrats filibustering and with \nRepublicans threatening to exercise the constitutional or nuclear \noption. I took the floor earlier this year on several occasions to urge \nan independent stand. I\n\n[[Page S10558]]\n\nheard so many Democrats say they did not like the idea of a filibuster \nand I heard so many Republicans say they did not like the idea of the \nconstitutional or nuclear option, but Democrats felt constrained to the \nfilibuster and Republicans felt constrained to the nuclear or \nconstitutional option.\n  I urged my colleagues to take an independent stand, that when you \ntalked about the long-range composition and the long-range approach of \nthe institution of the Senate, it was more important than the passions \nof the moment. I went into some detail and quoted how the Senate saved \njudicial independence in the impeachment proceedings of Supreme Court \nJustice Chase in 1805 and 1806 and how the U.S. Senate saved the \nindependence of Presidential prerogatives in the impeachment proceeding \nof President Andrew Johnson. The Congress had passed a law saying there \nhad to be consent by the Senate for the President to remove a Cabinet \nofficer. Secretary of War Stanton bolted himself in his office. He \nwould not leave. Because President Johnson would not tolerate that kind \nof usurpation of Presidential power, he was impeached. In this Chamber, \nhe was saved. The Senate saved him.\n  When you talk about the institutions of the Senate, we do not need \noutsiders telling us when to filibuster. We do not need outsiders and \npolitical activists on either side telling us when to filibuster or \nwhen to exercise the constitutional option. We were elected. They were \nnot.\n  When you have men of the stature of Senator Leahy and Senator Dodd \nand Senator Lieberman taking a position, those positions ought to be \nrespected. When you have hard-fighting Senators such as Kennedy and \nBiden and Schumer fighting a nomination and voting no, their positions \nought to be respected.\n  So I hope as to this headline in the Post about ``Filibuster Showdown \nLooms in Senate,'' it is the last time we will hear the word \n``filibuster'' and that we will have a nominee who will command \nrespect, that we will have an orderly, dignified proceeding in the \nJudiciary Committee in another round of hearings, and that we will \nacquit ourselves with distinction.\n  At a time when the Congress is under a very heavy fire on all sides \nfor so many items--or the response to the hurricane and for the highway \nbill and for spending and for a lack of offsets--I have heard many \ncomments that the Senate has acquitted itself very well throughout the \nentire confirmation process, not just what was done in the Judiciary \nCommittee, but what has been done on the floor of the Senate, and what \nwill be concluded tomorrow when the full body votes.\n  So we do not need outsiders telling us how to conduct our business. \nThey can make their suggestions. They have freedom of speech. But it \nought to be within bounds. This sort of extreme, excessive partisanship \nhas no place in the selection of the next Supreme Court Justice.\n  In the absence of any Senator seeking recognition, Mr. President, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, is it proper now to speak on the \nnomination of Judge Roberts?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, it is in order.\n  The President pro tempore is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, having lived and studied alongside one of \nthe greatest legal minds of my generation, I believe Judge Roberts' \ncapability and knowledge of the law is superior to any of his \ngeneration. When I was at Harvard Law School, my roommate was H. Reed \nBaldwin. He had abilities quite similar to those of John Roberts. He \nwas the top of our class, No. 1, and on the Harvard Law Review. He was \nwhat I call a Renaissance man. He could handle almost any subject. \nUnfortunately, he suffered an untimely death; otherwise, he might have \nonce been in the same place John Roberts is today.\n  During the Judiciary Committee's hearings, Juneau Mayor Bruce Botelho \ntestified in support of Judge Roberts' nomination. Bruce, whom I know \nwell, was Attorney General for the State of Alaska from 1994 through \n2002. He employed John Roberts to represent our State before the \nSupreme Court on a wide range of issues, including the Venetie case \ninvolving Indian country claims and cases related to submerged lands \nissues, natural resource matters, and the Alaska Statehood Act. As a \nmatter of fact, I met with Judge Roberts then and have met with him \nsince. He has a brilliant legal mind.\n  I am not alone in that opinion. Judge Roberts has been to our State \nmany times, and he has won the respect of Alaskans who hold a wide \nrange of political beliefs and opinions.\n  Judge Roberts also won the respect of the bar association of the \nDistrict of Columbia, of which I am a member. In 2002, when Judge \nRoberts was nominated to serve as a Federal court of appeals judge on \nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, more \nthan 150 Members of the DC bar sent a letter to the Judiciary Committee \nof the Senate supporting his nomination. I know many of the bar members \nwho signed this letter. They are a distinguished and bipartisan group \nof lawyers, law professors, and public servants. I think they said it \nbest:\n\n       John Roberts represents the best of the bar.\n\n  I agree with their opinion and the opinion of many Alaskans who have \nworked with him. I shall vote to confirm Judge Roberts as the 17th \nChief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. I urge all of my colleagues in \nthe Senate to do the same.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter I mentioned be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                December 18, 2002.\n     Re Judicial Nomination of John G. Roberts, Jr. to the United \n         States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia \n         Circuit.\n\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Daschle, Hatch, Leahy, and Lott: The \n     undersigned are all members of the Bar of the District of \n     Columbia and are writing in support of the nomination of John \n     G. Roberts, Jr., to serve as a federal court of appeals judge \n     on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of \n     Columbia Circuit. Although, as individuals, we reflect a wide \n     spectrum of political party affiliation and ideology, we are \n     united in our belief that John Roberts will be an outstanding \n     federal court of appeals judge and should be confirmed by the \n     United States Senate. He is one of the very best and most \n     highly respected appellate lawyers in the nation, with a \n     deserved reputation as a brilliant writer and oral advocate. \n     He is also a wonderful professional colleague both because of \n     his enormous skills and because of his unquestioned integrity \n     and fair-mindedness. In short, John Roberts represents the \n     best of the bar and, we have no doubt, would be a superb \n     federal court of appeals judge.\n       Thank you.\n           Sincerely,\n         Donald B.

Is it appropriate now for the Senator from New Mexico \nto speak?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is appropriate.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Is there a time limit?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is none.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, it is, indeed, a privilege to come to the Senate \nChamber to speak on behalf of such a distinguished nominee for Chief \nJustice of the Supreme Court. I have a unique perspective on Judge \nRoberts because I practiced law for 16 years before I came to the \nSenate, during which time I got to meet and try cases, and read \nopinions by many judges. I have also been here for 33 years, during \nwhich time I have had the luxury and privilege of hearing from, reading \ntranscripts of, and voting for 10 Supreme Court nominees. So everyone \nsitting on the Supreme Court now I have had the luxury of considering \nthrough the confirmation process, which means I have heard what each of \nthose eight justices said, and I have seen what qualifications they \ncame before the Senate with.\n  Based upon my previous experiences, it is almost as if Judge Roberts \nwere destined to be a Supreme Court Justice. As I have listened to him, \nread what he has written, reviewed his background, and watched his \nconduct before the Judiciary Committee, it has become clear to me that \nhe exemplifies many great qualities. When I look at him in comparison \nwith nominees of the past, considering those men and women that I have \npreviously voted for, it has become clear to me that he was born to \nserve his nation on our highest court.\n  Frankly, in all deference to the judges I have voted for heretofore, \nI have never been more confident that the President picked the right \nperson for the right job at the right time as I am today.\n  If there is a perfect judge that can be visualized based upon all of \nthe judges I have seen, listened to, read about, and voted for, this \nman seems to me to be extremely close to such a picture. He will be a \njudge for whom I will be extremely proud to have voted for.\n  Many people have described the message I am trying to convey about \nJudge Roberts in different ways, and there have been some excellent \nanalyses of his qualifications. The largest newspaper in my home state \nof New Mexico wrote: ``In addition to his encyclopedic fluency in \nconstitutional law and the flesh and blood history behind it, Roberts \nexhibited a fine quality for a Chief Justice: collegiality. Justices, \nlike Senators, disagree. Roberts showed he can disagree without \ndisrespect, leaving open the door to work toward consensus. If \nDemocrats cannot accept Roberts, is there any suitable Republican \nnominee?''\n  I appreciate those words from the Albuquerque Journal, and I agree \nwith the question they raise. Democrats who want a Democratic nominee \nwho fits their mold and agrees with their positions will have to wait \nuntil there is another Democratic President for such a nominee to come \nbefore the Senate. That is the way it has always been, and my friends \nfrom the other side of the aisle cannot expect a Republican President \nto nominate an individual who will carry their beliefs onto the court. \nSuch a belief is not consistent with history or with tradition.\n  I will close by saying that I have great confidence that in 5 years, \nGod willing, in 10 years, God willing, I can look back at Judge \nRoberts' performance as our Chief Justice and say: I was right in how I \nanalyzed what he has been, what he is today, and what he will be as a \nSupreme Court Justice. I don't think I will be surprised or let down.\n\n[[Page S10560]]\n\n  And I know, looking back at nominees for whom I voted, that such is \nnot an ordinary expectation. Some judges for whom I voted did not turn \nout to be what I expected. But I am quite confident that Judge Roberts \nwill not be anything but the great judge I expect as I look back on his \ntenure in the ensuing years.\n  I congratulate the Judge on his nomination. I hope he will remain \nloyal to what he has said and the way he has said it when he pledged \nwhat he wanted to be and what he would be. I wish him the very best \nbecause if he is successful, it will be good for America. His success \nin this job is correlated with good relationships under our \nConstitution between the great powers of the executive, legislative, \nand judicial branches.\n  I yield the floor and thank the Senate for listening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to comment on \nthe issue before us, which of course is Judge John Roberts. Certainly \nwe have been hearing all about him for the last several days and nearly \neverything that is to be said has been said at least once. But I do \nwant to take the opportunity to say I am very impressed with this \ncandidate for Supreme Court Chief Justice. I am convinced that he will \nbe a strong defender of the Constitution, that he has an exceptional \nability to interpret the Constitution with respect to the law, and that \ncertainly he has the background and qualifications to do that.\n  I am not an expert in law, but I do feel strongly that the Court is \nthere to measure what is done in other places, what is done in the \nexecutive branch, and what is done in the legislative branch with \nrespect to how it fits into the Constitution.\n  I have met with Judge Roberts, and I appreciated the opportunity to \nget better acquainted with him. I am very impressed with his demeanor \nand his character. It is comforting to see someone you think is \nextremely qualified for such an exceptional job and, at the same time, \nseems to see the world pretty much from the standpoint we all do, just \nas a human being, a person who wants to live in a country with freedom, \nin a country with constitutional law, in a country that does the best \nfor everyone, and I have that impression. So I feel very good about \nhim.\n  He has great respect for the rule of law and that, it seems to me, is \none of the most important aspects of our country. I have had a chance \nto visit other places. I have had a chance to talk with kids about \nother countries. As I have gone about, one of the big differences is we \nhave a rule of law, not a rule of people who happen to be in a strong \nposition at the time, but a rule of law that exists and continues in \nthe Constitution to be interpreted by the Supreme Court.\n  Of course, Judge Roberts has credentials that are outstanding. His \neducational background is great. He has been a White House Counsel, so \nhe knows how that works. He has been a Deputy Solicitor General, so he \nknows how that aspect of it works, too. And he is a circuit judge, so \nhe has a background as a judge. I believe that is very important.\n  I am very impressed, I am very pleased, and I am very proud to be a \npart of voting for him. I think the vote will be strong.\n  I shared with Judge Roberts a few areas about which I am concerned. I \ndid not ask his opinion on them, but rather in the State I am from, \nWyoming, we are very concerned about venue shopping. We are very \nconcerned about the idea of people filing suit or going to the proper \ndistrict court or area to get one that is sympathetic. That is not the \nway it ought to be. The Federal court that deals with the issue from an \nevent in our history has to be in that history, and I wanted to share \nthat with Judge Roberts.\n  I am very concerned about emminent domain, with regard to people's \nrights and property, gun rights, endangered species. Again, I did not \nask him for his opinion on those issues because that is not the issue. \nThe issue is, as legislation is passed, are they consistent with the \nConstitution, and that is, indeed, the role of judges--to listen to the \nfacts and see how they apply to the rule of law.\n\n  I was very impressed, as most of us were as we watched some of the \ninterrogation in the committee, with his conduct. Of course, he was \npressed many times with different kinds of questions and tried to be \npushed into making specific stands on his own opinion on issues, which \nreally is not what it is all about. That is for him to decide when \nthose issues come up with respect to the law, with respect to the \nConstitution. He handled that situation very well.\n  We have the opportunity--and a very pleasant opportunity--to support \na man who has the qualifications, who has not politicized his \nbackground, a learned lawyer, a well-trained lawyer. I am persuaded he \nwill be a strong defender of the Constitution.\n  I must confess that is the strongest point I support and seek to see \nthe Court do. I think that will happen.\n  Mr. President, if I may, during this time, I wish to divert from this \nsubject for a minute or two.\n\n\n Government Reorganization and Program Performance Improvement Act of \n                                  2005\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to talk about a condition that is very much \nimportant to us, where we have unusual events happening in our country. \nWe have the situation in Iraq. We are defending ourselves there and the \nfreedoms of this country there. I just came from a hearing. I am very \nproud of what is happening in Iraq, and I think we are making some \nprogress towards getting people to take care of their own country. \nThat, of course, is the goal, and I am sure we will be there until that \ngoal is achieved.\n  Then comes along the problems with the disasters on the gulf coast. \nBoth of those events, of course, have given us special needs for \nspending, and we have had to spend. It is right to spend when we have \nemergencies that arise of that nature, but then we find ourselves in \nthe position of, what do we do about this excessive spending and how do \nwe handle it?\n  I see it as the same thing we undertake in our families. If an \nemergency happens in the family, you have to handle it. You have to \nfind some way to deal with that emergency. At the same time, your \nfamily activities go on and you have to take care of those. Then you \nhave to decide: How can I make some changes in my economic situation to \ndeal with this excessive spending because of an emergency.\n  That is where we are now. We are talking about all kinds of ways. I \nhope we take enough time to deal with these situations on the gulf \ncoast and give the help those people need. That is the responsibility \nof the Federal Government. I hope we make sure there is accountability \nwith those moneys spent, that we can be sure they are spent the way for \nwhich they are defined to be spent. I hope we make sure the Federal \nGovernment does what it is supposed to do and that the other units of \ngovernment--State, local, and private sector--do what they are supposed \nto do. But we still will spend a great deal of money and, indeed, we \nshould.\n  We also have to consider that over the past year, because of Iraq and \nother events, we have also had an increase in our deficit. Our deficit \nhas gone up. So we need to find some ways to do something about it. \nObviously, we will take a look at spending and see what areas we can \nreduce. I hope we do that as we finish our budget for this year. We \nneed to.\n  We should take a look at some of the ways we raise money, in the case \nof some taxes, that probably we might otherwise change. Perhaps they \nwill have to be left as they are for a while and continue to offset \nsome of these costs.\n  I wish to specifically mention a bill I am currently sponsoring that \nrequires the regular review of Federal programs. This should be done \nanyway, but it makes it particularly important as we look toward this \nbusiness of spending. It is called the Government Reorganization and \nProgram Performance Improvement Act. It creates the necessary \nmechanism, I believe, to set up some commissions to take a look, No. 1, \nat programs that have been in place, let's say, for 10 years, and to \ndetermine if, in fact, the program is still as needed as it was 10 \nyears ago, to see if it accomplished what it was set up to do 10 years \nago and now is completed, could be ended, or could be put in with some \nother program, or could be reduced because the situation may not be the \nsame as it was when a program was put in place. Even though there \nprobably was a very good reason to have\n\n[[Page S10561]]\n\nthe program then, is the reason still good? Should we be changing it?\n  It is really a modernization effort, something we would do in every \nbusiness, something we should do, which is take a look at what we have \ndone historically and see if they are appropriate and can be done \nbetter.\n  The second half is to not only look at programs that might be \nunnecessary or wasteful, but take a look at programs that will \ncontinue, but are they being done as efficiently as they can be.\n  One of the issues we have to take a look at in terms of excessive \nspending is controlling the size of the Federal Government. It has \ncontinued to grow and grow. We have sort of developed a political \nnotion that if there is anything needed anywhere, let's get the Federal \nGovernment to pay for it.\n\n  Well, that is a nice thing to do. The fact is we are supposed to be \ndivided up, and there are local governments, State governments, and the \nFederal Government, each of which has its own responsibilities and its \nown areas and we ought to be seeking to define what the role of the \nFederal Government is and sort of restrict those things to that area so \nthat we can control size.\n  So this program would inventory the programs, would have proactive \nsteps toward improving and eliminating unnecessary and redundant \nefforts, and it would help us return to fiscal responsibility. It is \nkind of common sense in Government. It provides a framework to do that. \nI don't think anybody will disagree with the notion that we ought to \nevaluate programs to see if they are still efficient, effective, and \nneeded, if they could be more productive. Nobody would argue that \nconcept, but we don't really have a system to do that. I believe this \nis a good Government measure, and I certainly urge my colleagues to \ntake a look at the bill S. 1399 and urge their consideration and \nsponsorship of this bill.\n  Mr. President, we always have a responsibility to make sure that \nGovernment is as efficient as possible, that spending is as effective \nas possible, that we hold spending to the minimum to do the things we \nneed to do but not in excess of that, and I think we have an \nopportunity to put that kind of measurement into place and to ensure \nthat those things can happen.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the next hour \nunder majority control be allocated as follows: 20 minutes for Senator \nCornyn, 5 minutes for Senator Cochran, 15 minutes for Senator Bennett, \nand 20 minutes for Senator Allen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I am going to talk about the nominee that we presently \nhave before the Senate, Judge John Roberts, in a moment. First, let me \nexpress my concerns about a Washington Post story that was published \ntoday entitled ``Filibuster Showdown Looms in Senate.'' The curious \nthing about this article is it does not talk about the nominee for \nChief Justice of the United States, John Roberts, the nominee that is \nactually pending before the Senate. Rather, what this article talks \nabout is the next nominee of the President of the United States to fill \nthe seat of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.\n  I am afraid it is perhaps a sign of the times in which we are living \nand perhaps a sign of the contentiousness with which the nomination for \na vacancy on the Supreme Court has met in the Senate that some of my \ncolleagues are already talking about a filibuster of the next nominee \nof the President when that nominee has not yet been named. I think it \ntakes partisanship to a new level, to threaten to block an up-or-down \nvote on the Senate floor when we do not even know who that person is \nyet and, indeed, some apparently cannot conceive of the possibility \nthat this President would nominate someone on whom they would at least \nallow an up-or-down vote. We are not talking about a Senator not \nfollowing their conscience but talking about Senators, a minority in \nthe Senate prohibiting a bipartisan majority from casting an up-or-down \nvote without even knowing who that nominee is going to be.\n  We ask that nominees for the courts not prejudge cases that will come \nbefore them. I would think that we should also ask Senators not to \nprejudge nominees who have not even been nominated by the President \nyet. Whomever the President nominates should be entitled to an up-or-\ndown vote on the Senate floor. We are not a country that believes in \nthe tyranny of the minority but, rather, we believe in a fair process \nand an up-or-down vote and majority rule. That is all we would ask for \nthis yet-to-be-named nominee.\n  But now let me go to the business at hand and say that I will vote to \nconfirm Judge John G. Roberts as the next Chief Justice of the United \nStates. Before I explain why I am going to vote for his confirmation, I \nfirst want to explain the reasons why I am not.\n  First, I am not voting for his confirmation because he told us how he \nwould rule on cases or issues that might come before the Supreme Court. \nSome of my colleagues have said that they will not vote to confirm \nJudge Roberts because they are not certain how he would rule on cases \nor issues that will come before the Court. They are not certain whether \nhe will vote in favor of abortion rights, for example. They are not \ncertain that he will vote in favor of racial preferences and quotas. \nThey are not certain whether he will vote to give the Federal \nGovernment unlimited regulatory power to the exclusion of State and \nlocal government. I am not certain how Judge Roberts is going to vote \non these issues either, but although my constituents are as concerned \nand as interested in these issues as anyone, I am not going to refuse \nto vote for this nominee on that basis. Judges are not politicians. \nThey do not come to Washington to run on a political platform. They do \nnot say: Vote for me, and I will put a chicken in every pot. They are \nnot supposed to come before the Senate and promise to vote this way or \nthat way on a matter that will come before them. Certainly, I \nunderstand as well as anyone why the American people, and Members of \nthe Senate included, are curious about how Judge Roberts is likely to \nrule on future cases. I am curious about that, too. But sometimes we \nhave to put our curiosity aside for a greater good. We do not want to \ncreate a situation where a Justice cannot win confirmation to the \nSupreme Court unless he pledges to vote this way or that way on certain \nhot-button issues of the day. Judges are supposed to be impartial, and \nthey are supposed to be independent. That is why they have lifetime \ntenure once confirmed. Judges cannot be either impartial or independent \nif they are forced to make promises to the Senate of how they will vote \nin order to get confirmed.\n  Some of my colleagues have said they simply cannot or will not put \npromises to politicians aside for this greater good of independence and \nimpartiality. One of my colleagues says she wants to know who will be \nthe winners on certain issues when Judge Roberts is on the Court. I can \ntell you who the winners will be. The winners are going to be the \nparties whose positions are supported by the Constitution and laws of \nthe United States of America. Judge Roberts eloquently explained this \nduring his confirmation hearing. He was asked whether he would rule in \nfavor of the little guy. His answer was that if the Constitution and \nlaws of the United States supported the little guy's position, the \nlittle guy will win. But if the Constitution says that the big guys are \nsupported, their position is supported by the Constitution and laws of \nthe United States and the facts in the case, then he will vote in favor \nof the big guy.\n\n  This is exactly how it should be. Over the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States, as you look at that stately edifice, it says, ``Equal \njustice under the law,'' not that justice will be rendered in favor of \nthe little guy all the time or against the big guy all the time or, \nconversely, for the big guy all the time and against the little guy. \nThat is the antithesis of equal justice under the law. As a matter of \nfact, we all recall that Lady Justice wears a blindfold for a very good \nreason--because justice is about the law, not about persons who are \nsitting in front of a judge.\n  Mr. President, second, I am not voting for this confirmation because \nhe turned away clients with legal positions with which my constituents \nor some of us might disagree. Some of my colleagues have said they will \nvote against Judge Roberts because they are unsure of his heart. They \nare saying that his heart may not be pure because\n\n[[Page S10562]]\n\nin private law practice he would not turn down clients with positions \nanathema to liberal special interest groups. Now, although they \nacknowledge that Judge Roberts has donated his time to clients who, for \nexample, were on the liberal side of a lawsuit over gay rights, they \ncriticize Judge Roberts because at his confirmation hearings he said he \nwould have donated his time to clients on the conservative side of that \nsame issue had they approached him first.\n  This is perhaps the strangest argument of all against this nominee. \nMy colleagues are going to vote against him because they think it is \nheartless to take on clients regardless of whether he agreed with them \nor not? That is the very essence of being a lawyer, a professional, an \nadvocate. Lawyers are somewhat like public accommodations in a sense. \nSimilar to hotels, restaurants, and the like, when lawyers place their \nshingle out and say, I am willing to entertain cases that people may \nbring to me, they are supposed to serve anyone who comes through the \ndoor, as long as they have an arguable legal position or factual \nposition with which the Court might ultimately agree. As a matter of \nfact, our adversarial system of justice depends on lawyers not just \ntaking cases with which they perhaps ideologically are inclined to \nagree but, rather, they are supposed to take the facts and the legal \narguments and do the very best they can so that in a clash that plays \nout in our adversarial system of justice in the court room, the judge \ncan make the best decision based on the best legal arguments and that \njurors can decide what the truth is based on this clash of opposing \npositions.\n  People are not supposed to be judged by the lawyers. Rather, in our \nsystem they are supposed to be judged by a jury of their peers. But if \nlawyers were constrained or prohibited from representing people with \nwhom they might personally not agree, then they would never have a \nchance to be judged by a jury of their peers because they would not \nhave a lawyer to take their case so that it could be presented to that \nimpartial conscience of the community.\n  I wish to ask where this reasoning of my colleagues might lead. There \nare any number of clients who few people would support politically but \nwho need legal representation in our adversarial system. Criminal \ndefendants are the most obvious example. Do my colleagues plan on \npunishing a lawyer who did not refuse to represent someone who is \naccused of a crime? Do they plan to disqualify anyone from service in \nthe Federal judiciary who has ever represented someone accused of a \ncrime? Or do they plan to disqualify only those lawyers who did not \nshun conservative clients or causes? I do not believe you can tell \nanything about a person's heart, that is, a legal professional, \nprofessional advocate by whom that person has represented as a \nlawyer. But even more important, I do not think the confirmation \nprocess should be about the nominee's heart. I, for one, do not want \njudges sitting in judgment in a court of law who are going to be guided \nby their heart and sympathies, rather than the law of the land and the \nfacts as found by the trier of fact. I want judges who will side with \nthe party who has the best argument and whose position is most \nconsistent with established law that we all can recognize and read and \nunderstand for ourselves.\n\n  Again, Lady Justice is blindfolded for a reason. Justice should not \ndepend on who you are or who you know. It should depend on who has the \nlaw on their side.\n  Third, I am not voting for John Roberts because he will preserve some \nhypothetical quixotic ideal of balance on the Supreme Court. Some of my \ncolleagues have said they will vote for Judge Roberts because he is not \nany more conservative than his predecessor, Chief Justice Rehnquist, \nwhom he will be succeeding. But they issued the warning that I started \nout with: Mr. President, don't you dare nominate someone we disagree \nwith next time or we will use this unconstitutional filibuster. We will \nbreak with 200 years of precedent in the Senate and the very premise of \nour law, which is based on majority rule. We will break with that and \nwe will filibuster in the Senate and prevent your nominee from ever \ntaking the bench if you nominate someone we perceive is more \nconservative than Sandra Day O'Connor.\n  My colleagues have said this is important because they want to \npreserve balance on the Court. Preserving so-called balance on the \nCourt has never been the basis of a Supreme Court confirmation vote. \nThe examples of this are legion. One of the last Supreme Court nominees \nto win confirmation was Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who replaced \nJustice Byron White. Justice Ginsburg, I think it is clear, I think we \nwould all agree, was an unabashed liberal and one of the most zealous \nsupporters of abortion rights who has ever been confirmed to the U.S. \nSupreme Court.\n  Justice White, nominated by President John F. Kennedy, was fairly \nconservative by contrast and indeed was one of the dissenters in the \ncelebrated case of Roe v. Wade. Yet Justice Ginsburg, a self-avowed \nliberal, replaced a moderate to conservative Justice on the Court, and \nshe was confirmed by a vote of 96 to 3. No one argued that Justice \nGinsburg should be defeated because she would somehow shift this \nideological balance on the Court.\n  But she is only one example. Justice Clarence Thomas, one of the most \nconservative members of the Court, was nominated and confirmed to \nsucceed Justice Thurgood Marshall, arguably one of the most liberal.\n  Chief Justice Burger, President Nixon's antidote to judicial \nactivism, replaced Chief Justice Earl Warren, whose name, in the minds \nof some, was synonymous with the phrase judicial activism.\n  Justice Goldberg, who believed the ninth amendment gave the Supreme \nCourt a license to invent new constitutional rights, replaced Justice \nFrankfurter, the father of judicial restraint.\n  So it is clear this has never been the way it has been, historically. \nNor is there any precedent or any obligation of a President to try to \nseek ideological balance when nominating someone to the Supreme Court. \nThe reason why is very simple. Elections are supposed to have \nconsequences. The President is entitled to put the people on the \nSupreme Court who share his values and his judicial philosophy; in this \ncase one who believes the policymaking ought to primarily emanate from \nthe elected representatives of the people in Congress, not life-tenured \njudges who are unaccountable.\n  If Presidents were not entitled to change the Supreme Court, then \nAbraham Lincoln could not have changed the Dred Scott case, and \nFranklin Delano Roosevelt could not have changed the Lochner Court. I \ndoubt my colleagues who are arguing for this ideological lockstep, or \nuniformity, would have favored that.\n  But that brings me to why I am supporting this nominee, and the \nreasons are actually pretty simple. First, Judge Roberts is simply one \nof the most qualified individuals ever nominated to serve on the \nSupreme Court. Indeed, he may very well be the best qualified. We have \nheard it before. He graduated the top of his class, he clerked for two \nof the finest judges in the Nation, he served, with great distinction, \ntwo Presidents. He has argued 39 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court \nand is widely regarded as the finest oral advocate before the Court \nliving today.\n  In only 2 years on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, he has already \nacquired a reputation as one of the most respected judges in America. \nEven the New York Times, which has editorialized against this \nnomination, has conceded that few lawyers in America could compete with \nJudge Roberts in professional accomplishments.\n  There was a time not too long ago when a brilliant career such as \nJudge Roberts' was sufficient to win confirmation to the Supreme Court, \nwhen we did not have ideological tests, litmus tests; when we didn't \nhave filibusters that blocked the majority from actually having an up-\nor-down vote to confirm a nominee.\n\n  Whereas Judge Roberts has spent his career representing clients on \nboth sides of every issue, we saw in Justice Ginsburg, whom I mentioned \na moment ago, a jurist spending most of her career representing the \nsingle client, the American Civil Liberties Union, on one side of these \nissues. She voiced support for some pretty extreme positions. She\n\n[[Page S10563]]\n\nsupported taxpayer funding for abortions. She thought there was a \nconstitutional right to polygamy and prostitution. Suffice it to say, \nher ideas were far outside of the legal, not to mention the political, \nmainstream of America.\n  Finally, I am going to vote to confirm this nominee because this \njudge understands the proper role of an unelected Supreme Court Justice \nin a democratic Nation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. To repeat, Judge Roberts understands the proper role of \nan unelected Supreme Court Justice in a democratic Nation. Ours is not \na nation where nine judges sit in a marble edifice and decide what is \ngood for us. Nor is it a Nation conceived on the premise that these \nnine unelected judges should be primarily policymakers. Rather, our \nnotion of justice and law is based on consent of the governed. You can \nread it in the Declaration of Independence. Obviously, were unelected, \nlifetime-tenured judges to depart from the text of the Constitution, \ndepart from precedent, and get into a mode of sort of freewheeling ad \nhoc public policymakers, they would have departed in the extreme from \nthe framework laid down by our Founders and from the framework \nensconced in our Constitution.\n  I will vote to confirm this nominee. I hope my colleagues will do \nlikewise. I hope further that my colleagues, who have already stated \ntheir intention to filibuster the next nominee, will wait until the \nPresident has in fact named a nominee to succeed Justice Sandra Day \nO'Connor. It is just possible--it is just possible they will be \nsurprised and they will find the President has, indeed, selected \nanother nominee in the mold of John Roberts, who will be overwhelmingly \nconfirmed as Chief Justice of the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak on \nbehalf of Judge John G. Roberts' nomination to serve as Chief Justice \nof the United States. The Members of the Senate may disagree on many \nlegal and political issues, but I am confident a majority of the Senate \nwill agree that Judge John Roberts should be confirmed. He has provided \nthe Judiciary Committee with the story of his life. He has answered \nquestions on a wide range of issues. In the process, he has \ndemonstrated the ability, the temperament, and the wisdom to serve as \nChief Justice of the United States.\n  The process of providing advice and consent on a Supreme Court \nnomination is one of the Senate's most significant constitutional \nresponsibilities, although it is not something we are called upon to do \nvery often. Eleven years have passed since the Senate last exercised \nits duty to provide advice and consent to the President on his \nselection of a Supreme Court nominee; 19 years have passed since the \nSenate last considered a nominee for Chief Justice.\n  By now, all Senators and most Americans have come to know the \nimpressive life story of John G. Roberts, Jr. He is a summa cum laude \ngraduate of Harvard University and an honors graduate of the Harvard \nLaw School. He was an editor of the Harvard Law Review.\n  After graduating from law school with high honors, Judge Roberts \nserved as a law clerk to a judge on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals \nand as a law clerk to then Associate Justice Rehnquist on the U.S. \nSupreme Court. He has also served as a Special Assistant to the \nAttorney General of the United States and as an associate counsel to \nPresident Ronald Reagan.\n  After those years of public service, he spent 3 years in private \npractice at a well-respected law firm, specializing in civil \nlitigation. Judge Roberts then returned to public service as the \nPrincipal Deputy Solicitor General of the United States.\n  During these years of service at the Department of Justice and as a \nlawyer in private practice, Judge Roberts argued 39 cases before the \nU.S. Supreme Court. His performance before the Court earned him a \nreputation as one of the Nation's premier appellate court advocates.\n  Two years ago Judge Roberts was unanimously confirmed by this Senate \nto the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. This \ncircuit court is considered by many to be the Nation's second highest \ncourt.\n  Judge Roberts is a devoted husband, a dutiful father of two young \nchildren, and he is a good and honest man. I closely followed the \nSenate Judiciary Committee's hearings on his nomination to be Chief \nJustice. It is clear to me that he is the right person for this very \nimportant responsibility. Judge Roberts has served with distinction in \nevery job he has ever had. His record is compelling evidence that he \nwould be an able and thoughtful member of the Supreme Court, and that \nhis experience and his respect for the rule of law demonstrate he would \nbe an outstanding Chief Justice of the United States.\n  The quality and correctness of opinions and decisions by the Supreme \nCourt will depend upon the conscientious application of reason and the \nrule of law by Chief Justice Roberts and his colleagues on the Supreme \nCourt. I think Judge Roberts fully understands the role of the Supreme \nCourt Justice and is totally qualified to discharge the duties of Chief \nJustice. I believe he will be fair to all and, in the application of \nthe rule of law, impartial and unbiased.\n  This is serious business. The members of the Federal judiciary are \ncharged with the responsibility of protecting our rights as American \ncitizens, adjudicating our grievances, promoting order and justice, and \nserving as stewards of the rule of law. The Chief Justice of the United \nStates is the highest ranking official in the judicial branch of our \nFederal Government. He is in charge of the management and \nadministration of the highest Court in the land. I believe Judge \nRoberts has what it takes to be an outstanding Chief Justice.\n  I congratulate the President for his selection of Judge Roberts and I \ncommend the President for his nomination. His nominee will be in an \nimportant position in our Government. I am pleased, indeed, that I will \nbe able to vote in favor of his confirmation by the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nUtah is recognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, most of the speakers who have discussed \nthis subject have talked about Judge Roberts' qualification. There is \nno point in my referring to them or repeating them again.\n  There is a point that I do wish to make with respect to the entire \nprocess, which I think needs to be emphasized and stressed. It is this: \nNominations are not elections.\n  Read the Constitution, and we see that it allows for elections. It \nprovides for elections. It says there are places where elections are \nappropriate. The President is elected. The Vice President is elected. \nThe Members of the Senate and House are elected. But members of the \nCabinet are not; they are appointed by the President. And to allow the \nelection process to have an influence, they have to be confirmed by the \nSenate. But they are not elections.\n  The same thing is true very much with respect to the judicial branch. \nA nomination for the Supreme Court is not an election.\n  The reason I make such stress of that is because there are many \ngroups out there who think this is an election. There are big ads on \ntelevision. They are organizing demonstrations. They are walking around \nwith placards. That is what you do when you try to influence voters in \nan election. This is not an election. The Founding Fathers understood \nthat it should not be an election.\n  There are some who have made up their minds long in advance of any \nnomination as to what they are going to do. I think, quite frankly, if \nPresident Bush were to somehow resurrect John Marshall and send his \nname to the Senate to be the Chief Justice of the United States, People \nFor the American Way and Ralph Neas would insist that he was badly out \nof the mainstream and unqualified to be Chief Justice, even though \nhistory says he was the greatest Chief Justice in our history. But if \nhe were picked by George W. Bush, that group would immediately say he \nis radical, he is out of the mainstream.\n  We are getting the same thing with respect to Judge Roberts--an \nelection\n\n[[Page S10564]]\n\ncampaign complete with television ads and placards and demonstrations \nsaying that Judge Roberts is out of the mainstream.\n  I do not know where you go to find mainstream today. I do not know \nexactly where the mainstream is. I know where the left bank of this \nparticular stream is. The New York Times is against Judge Roberts. That \nwas predictable. That was as sure as the Sun would rise--that the New \nYork Times would be opposed to anybody George W. Bush proposed.\n  The Washington Post is usually thought of as being fairly close to \nthe left bank, but the Washington Post looked at this nominee and said \nthis is a qualified nominee.\n  The American Bar Association tries to be as much of the mainstream as \nthey can. They have given Judge Roberts' nomination their highest \nsupport, ``well qualified,'' unanimously. Maybe they are not mainstream \nenough for some of these people who are using this argument.\n  The Los Angeles Times is not thought of as a rightwing organization. \nThe Los Angeles Times said it would be a travesty if we didn't confirm \nJudge Roberts by a wide margin.\n  Why do we want to confirm somebody like Judge Roberts? Why is the \nPresident's nomination a good one? In my view, it is because Judge \nRoberts understands one fundamental truth. Along with the one I have \njust given, a second fundamental truth, if you will, is that \nnominations are not elections and judges are not politicians, or more \nappropriately judges are not legislators. You have elections for \nlegislators. You should not have elections for judges.\n  Judge Roberts put it this way in describing his understanding of his \nresponsibility. We have heard this before with respect to this nominee, \nbut it is worth repeating. He said to the committee:\n\n       I come before the committee with no agenda. I have no \n     platform.\n\n  Again, judges are not legislators.\n\n       Judges are not politicians who can promise to do certain \n     things in exchange for votes. I have no agenda but I do have \n     a commitment. If I am confirmed, I will confront every case \n     with an open mind. I will fully and fairly analyze the legal \n     arguments that are presented. I will be open to the \n     considered views of my colleagues on the bench, and I will \n     decide every case based on the record, according to the rule \n     of law, without fear or favor, to the best of my ability. I \n     will remember that it is my job to call balls and strikes and \n     not to pitch or bat.\n\n  In other words, he is the umpire, he is not a player. We have seen an \nexample brought up in an effort to try to derail Judge Roberts' \nnomination of how he called ``balls and strikes'' and how he was not a \nlegislator. It has been dropped now because those people who raised it \ndidn't realize that it was going to be analyzed properly and turn out \nto be embarrassing to them rather than to the judge.\n  But there was the case of the 12-year-old girl in Washington who, \nwhile waiting with her friend at the Metro station to buy a Metro \nticket, happened to eat a single french fry, and she was arrested, \nhandcuffed, and taken down to the station. Judge Roberts upheld the \naction of the Metro Police.\n  Horrors, came the groups. There is an election. We can grab onto this \nas an example that we can sensationalize and win votes on. Then they \nexamined the matter very carefully, and we got Judge Roberts' actual \nopinion in this case. He did not victimize a 12-year-old girl who was \narrested for eating a french fry. This is what he said in his opinion \nthat once again outlines the truth of his position that he will be an \numpire, not a player, not a legislator.\n  He said:\n\n       No one is very happy about the events that led to this \n     litigation. A 12-year-old girl was arrested, searched and \n     handcuffed, all for eating a single french fry in a Metro \n     rail station. The child was frightened, embarrassed, and \n     crying throughout the ordeal. The District Court described \n     the policies that led to her arrest as ``foolish,'' and, \n     indeed, the policies were changed after those responsible \n     endured the sort of publicity reserved for adults who make \n     young girls cry. The question before us, however, is not \n     whether these policies were a bad idea but whether they \n     violated the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the Constitution.\n\n  He put the emphasis in the right place. This was a stupid law. It was \npassed for some other reason and turned out in administration to be a \nstupid law. It was passed by legislators, people with legislative \nresponsibility. It was repealed by legislators. It should not be \nrepealed by the judge just because it is stupid.\n  I remember a conversation that took place after the Supreme Court \nruled on the bipartisan Campaign Reform Act. It is no secret that I \nopposed that act as vigorously as I could. We passed it nonetheless. \nThe President signed it. Then a lawsuit was filed. It went all the way \nto the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court found that the law was \nconstitutional and upheld it.\n  I will not reveal names because these were private conversations, but \na Member of the Senate had the occasion to have a conversation with a \nmember of the Supreme Court. The Member of the Senate said to the \nmember of the Supreme Court: How could you uphold that law? That is a \nterrible law.\n  The member of the Supreme Court appropriately said: You are right. It \nis a terrible law. You shouldn't have passed it.\n  In other words, the Supreme Court should not be the one that corrects \nour mistakes unless we violate the Constitution. The Supreme Court \nshould not take a position unless we violate the Constitution. The \nSupreme Court is not made up of legislators who fix things; it should \nbe made up of people who examine the law.\n  Even if the law is foolish enough to punish a 12-year-old girl for \neating a french fry on the Metro, the Supreme Court should say: \nLegislators, this is a dumb law. You ought to fix it. But it is not our \nresponsibility to legislate.\n  The real reason so many groups have tried to turn Judge Roberts' \nnomination into an election rather than a nomination is because they \nlost the election and they are hoping they can turn the Supreme Court \ninto a superlegislature that is beyond the reach of voters. Clearly, \nthat is not what the Founding Fathers had in mind. Clearly, when they \nput the responsibility to make the choice in the hands of the \nPresident, they were saying this will be a nomination and not an \nelection. If the Founding Fathers had wanted the Supreme Court at the \nnational level to be open to the electoral process, they would have \ndone what others have done at the State level. There are States where \nthe appointment to the supreme court of the State is an electoral \nprocess. Whether that is good or bad is the subject for another \nconversation. But in this circumstance, we are talking about the U.S. \nConstitution, which every Member of this Chamber has taken an oath to \nuphold.\n  If we are going to uphold the Constitution of the United States and \ndefend it against all enemies who would undermine it, be they foreign \nor domestic, we should preserve the constitutional process of \nnominations coming from the President of the United States. He has to \nanswer to the people for his decisions. He should be the one to make \nthe nomination. He is the one who is given the powers specifically.\n  We can say, Mr. President, we don't consent to that because we think \nyou made a mistake, but we in the Senate should not condone those who \nare trying to turn the nomination process into an electoral process. \nBecause we should understand as Members of the legislature that members \nof the judiciary are not legislators, and we should not move in a \ndirection of turning them into legislators by participating in an \nelection-type process in vetting their credentials. If this man is \nqualified, he should be confirmed. If he is unpopular with the \nelectorate, that should be irrelevant. The Constitution does not allow \nfor that to intrude upon the confirmation process.\n  There is no question but that John Roberts is qualified.\n  I end with a conversation I had with one of my colleagues who made up \nhis mind to oppose Judge Roberts. I said to him: In a theoretical \nsituation, suppose you had everything you own on the line in a nasty \nlawsuit, and you had a legal problem where you could lose everything. \nWho would you choose to defend you? Which lawyer would you hire, John \nRoberts or a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee? He laughed \nimmediately. He said: Bob, it isn't even close. If John Roberts is the \nobvious choice for a personal attorney for someone who needs real help, \nwhy should he not be the obvious choice for the Nation that needs real \nhelp?\n  He will be a superb Chief Justice, and I will vote for him with great \nconfidence.\n\n[[Page S10565]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nVirginia is recognized for 20 minutes.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I rise this afternoon in strong support of the \nconfirmation of Judge John Roberts to be the 17th Chief Justice of the \nUnited States.\n  When we first learned of this vacancy on the Supreme Court earlier \nthis summer, I laid out the principles of what kind of judge I believe \nthe President should nominate and how the nomination process should \nproceed. It should be a dignified approach as a due process. It should \nbe fair, and there should be a vote.\n  Federal judges are appointed for life. When one recognizes those \ndebates in the founding of our country, Mr. Jefferson wanted judges \nappointed for terms, and Mr. Hamilton wanted them for life. \nUnfortunately, in my view, Mr. Hamilton won. The only time there is any \nscrutiny on the part of the public is at this time of confirmation. \nWhile some may not like the editorials, some may not like the TV ads, \nthe demonstrations, and all the speeches. I don't think judges ought to \nbe legislators, and I don't agree with some of their perspectives in \nour free country. Let us as Senators not say that people are wrong to \ndemonstrate, run TV ads, advocate and express their views, even if we \nmay not be in agreement with them. That is one of the foundational \nprinciples of our country. Ultimately our role is to listen, to examine \njudicial nominees based upon our criteria. Obviously, we can listen to \nthe people and then ultimately it is our responsibility to vote.\n\n  The following are the criteria I use to judge a judge. I have always \nbelieved the proper role of a judge is to apply the law, not invent the \nlaw. The proper role of a judge is to uphold the Constitution, not \namend the Constitution by judicial decrees. The proper role of a judge \nis to uphold the intent of the Constitution and the principles of our \nFounders, not to indulge in self-satisfying judicial activism. The \nproper role of a judge is to protect and, indeed, to defend our God-\ngiven rights, not to create or deny rights out of thin air.\n  I believe it is my responsibility and the responsibility of all \nSenators to make sure that America's courts, including, of course, and \nmost importantly, the Supreme Court, are filled with qualified men and \nwomen who possess the proper judicial philosophy in our representative \ndemocracy.\n  Laws are to be made by the representatives of the people. The people \nare the owners of the government. At the local level, they elect city \ncouncils, parish leaders, county boards of supervisors. Then we have \nState legislators, Governors, and, of course, Federal legislators, \nCongress, and the President.\n  However, colleagues, every week, and almost every day, we see the \nconsequences of activist judges who do not properly respect our \nrepresentative democracy. They do not understand or respect the proper \nrole and responsibilities of a judge not to be an executive and not to \nbe a legislator.\n  Let me share with my colleagues two examples of judicial activism, \ndecisions where the rule of law which is one of those foundational \nbedrock pillars of a free and just society, where these concepts have \nbeen eroded and ignored by judges.\n  Exhibit A comes from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The Ninth \nCircuit has trampled upon the will of the people of California by \nruling that the Pledge of Allegiance cannot be recited in California \npublic schools because it contains the words ``under God.'' They fail \nto see that the Pledge of Allegiance is not the establishment of any \nreligion. It is a patriotic act. If a student does not wish to recite \nthe Pledge of Allegiance, he or she is not compelled to do so. They can \nsit there quietly as the pledge is recited.\n  This is a terrible ruling, not just because it violates the will and \nthe values of the people of California, which it surely does, but it is \nalso a terrible ruling because it actually displays a woeful and \ninexcusable ignorance of America's legal and historical traditions \ngoing all the way back to Mr. Jefferson's statute of religious freedom. \nThis is all sacrificed on the altar of judicial activism.\n  Unless the Ninth Circuit reverses itself, then the Supreme Court of \nthe United States should ultimately reverse this prohibition of the \nPledge of Allegiance in schools.\n  Exhibit B comes from, I regret to say, the highest Court in the land, \nthe Supreme Court of the United States. This past summer, in the case \nof Kelo v. City of New London, Connecticut, five Supreme Court Justices \nwillfully ignored the Bill of Rights, allowing local governments, \nacting as commissars, the right to take someone's home, a person's home \nto be taken not for a road, not for a school, not for a legitimate \npublic use, but simply because they think they can generate more tax \nrevenue from the property upon which that home is located.\n  Colleagues, home ownership is the greatest fulfillment of the \nAmerican dream. Every American should have the opportunity to own the \nhome in which they live. Every child is enriched by learning and \nappreciating the value and pride of home ownership. That is why I \nadvocate economic policies that make home ownership more affordable to \nmore people. It is not just good economic sense, it is also an issue of \nfairness. It is an issue of opportunity in this land we call home, \nAmerica.\n  This outrageous decision that is forcing people out of their homes, \nthe very definition of the American dream, in the name of expanded \ngovernment tax revenue, is amending the Bill of Rights by judicial \ndecree and is contrary to what I believe is a fair and just society.\n  These are just two examples of judicial activism. We do not need any \nmore judicial activists on the Ninth Circuit, on the Supreme Court, or \nany court in this land. The only way to stop this insidious effect of \njudicial activism is to confirm well-qualified judges who possess good \nlegal minds and understand their role in our Republic. Judges are not \nto be legislators or executives. Judges should fairly adjudicate \ndisputes based upon the law and the Constitution.\n  I believe Judge Roberts is precisely that kind of judge. I believe \nJudge Roberts has the credentials, the values, and the temperament to \nbe an outstanding Chief Justice.\n  Let me briefly touch on some of his outstanding credentials. He \ngraduated summa cum laude from Harvard College, magna cum laude from \nHarvard Law School, was a law clerk for both Judge Friendly and later \nfor Chief Justice William Rehnquist, a Justice Department aide for the \nReagan administration, the Principal Deputy Solicitor General in the \nfirst Bush administration, a private attorney with Hogan & Hartson, and \nsince 2003, an esteemed judge on the D.C. Court of Appeals.\n  I supported Judge Roberts' confirmation to the D.C. Court of Appeals, \nand his service there has confirmed my confidence in his outstanding \ncapabilities. I have been impressed not only by his keen judicious mind \nbut also his commitment to the Constitution and understanding the \nimportance of the rule of law and the role of a judge.\n\n  I met with Judge Roberts back in August. We discussed things one on \none. I found him to be a very well grounded individual. He possesses \nthe right judicial philosophy. I know people are concerned that some \njudges might get in there and somehow get out of touch in the rarefied \nair of judgeships, particularly on the Supreme Court. I thought it was \ngood he cuts his grass every now and then--not that it is a \nqualification to be a judge, but it shows he understands how people \nlive in a relatively normal way.\n  Most importantly, we talked about the importance of precedence, \nindividual rights, the interpretation of Federal and State laws, and \nwhat deference should be given to laws passed by the representatives of \nthe people, as well as a variety of other issues.\n  I am very comfortable with Judge Roberts and his understanding of the \nrole of a judge, the importance of the Constitution, and that the \nConstitution should not be amended by judicial decree.\n  I enjoyed asking him what he thinks the role of international law or \nlaws from other countries should be for judges. We will not have others \nfrom another country tell us what our laws ought to be. I love his \njudicious approach that any judge who uses international laws or the \nlaws from other countries to make decisions upon cases in the United \nStates, those judges are trying to accrue to themselves more power than \nthey should have. The powers of Federal judges in this country\n\n[[Page S10566]]\n\ncome from the laws that are passed by the people in the United States. \nIf you start trying to get extraneous laws, that is judicial expansion. \nHe understands the modest and respectful way a judge should handle \ncases.\n  Later in his confirmation hearings, we saw how Judge Roberts \ncontinued to show a rare reverence for our Constitution and the Supreme \nCourt's responsibilities under our Constitution. He declared:\n\n       Judges are not to put in their own personal views about \n     what the Constitution should say, but they are supposed to \n     interpret it and apply the meaning that is in the \n     Constitution.\n\n  Judge Roberts went on to say:\n\n       [J]udges need to appreciate that the legitimacy of their \n     action is confined to interpreting the law and not to making \n     it, and if they exceed that function and start making the \n     law, I do think that raises legitimate concerns about [the] \n     legitimacy of their authority to do that.\n\n  It is refreshing to hear those words from the lips of a Supreme Court \nnominee. May other judges in the Federal court system understand and \nrespect that, as well.\n  As we get ready to vote tomorrow on Judge Roberts, this is exactly \nhow this system and this process ought to work--fair and open hearings \nwhere the nominee explains his or her judicial philosophy but refuses \nto prejudge individual cases, and following all of the scrutiny and the \nquestions and examination, there is a fair, up-or-down vote on the \nSenate floor. This is the American tradition. This should not be an \nexception. This should be the rule and the way we treat judicial \nnominees, not just this nominee but future nominees.\n  I remind my colleagues, we will soon have another Supreme Court \nvacancy to fill. We will need to fill it very soon. We should be fair \nand dignified, we should be deliberative, and when it is over, we \nshould vote. Yes, that is our responsibility, to vote.\n  I am looking forward to having John Roberts serve as Chief Justice of \nthe Supreme Court of the United States. I am also looking forward to \nconfirming other well-qualified judges who understand and appreciate \nthe foundational principles of our country and who will reinforce the \nrule of law by fairly adjudicating disputes protecting our freedom of \nreligion, protecting our private ownership of property, and our freedom \nof expression.\n  John Roberts, I believe, will go down in history as one of the great \nChief Justices of the Supreme Court. Let him also become a role model \nfor all other men and women who will follow on Federal benches.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the time from 5 p.m. to 6 p.m. will be \nunder the control of the Democratic side.\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, those of us who are privileged to serve in \nthe Senate literally cast thousands of votes during the years we spend \nhere. Some votes are procedural in nature and of little consequence. \nOthers are far more meaningful. Katrina relief, pension reform, and \ntrade agreements come to mind. Once in a great while, though, we are \ncalled upon in this body to cast a vote of such importance to our \nNation that it will resonate for years to come--whether to authorize \nthe use of military force against another nation or whether to impeach \na President. There are few votes, however, we will cast in our time \nhere that are likely to leave a more lasting impact on America than the \none we will cast tomorrow morning. In confirming the nomination of John \nRoberts--something that is all but certain--we not only will authorize \nhim to serve as the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, we will \nalso make him the leader of the judicial branch of our Government. God \nwilling, he will hold that post for as long as most of us in the Senate \nare likely to live. A great deal is riding on this vote for our country \nand its people, both today and for a long time to come.\n  For many of us, this one is a close call. Understandable concerns \nhave been raised on a number of fronts about what kind of Chief Justice \nJohn Roberts ultimately will make. Do the writings of a young man in \nhis twenties reflect the views of this 50-year-old man today? If not, \nwhy was he reluctant to clearly say so publicly when given that \nopportunity? Why did the current administration refuse to allow any \nscrutiny of the writings of Judge Roberts from when he served as the \nNo. 2 person in the Solicitor General's Office of former President \nBush? What direction would Chief Justice Roberts seek to lead the \nSupreme Court in the coming years on issues relating to privacy, to \ncivil rights, and to the prerogatives of the Congress to set policy \nthat may be at odds with the views of State and local governments? How \nwill Judge Roberts seek to interpret and apply the Constitution and a \nwide variety of laws, both State and Federal? Will the Roberts Court \nrespect precedent or aggressively seek to establish new ones?\n  The honest answer to most of these questions is that none of us \nreally know for sure--not the President, probably not even Judge \nRoberts himself. That uncertainty explains at least in part why this \nvote is so difficult for many Members of this body. So we are asked to \nmake a leap of faith. For some, that leap is large. For others, it is \nnot.\n  For myself, I have decided to take that leap of faith. After a great \ndeal of deliberation, conversations with many Democrats and Republicans \non the Senate Judiciary Committee, as well as with others back home and \nhere, I have decided to vote tomorrow to confirm the nomination of John \nRoberts to serve as our Nation's Chief Justice. Time will determine the \nwisdom of that decision, along with the decisions of each of our \ncolleagues who join me in casting our votes tomorrow.\n  Yesterday, I had the privilege of meeting with Judge Roberts in my \noffice. There, we discussed many of the concerns and question marks I \nmentioned just a few minutes ago. His responses were forthright. They \nwere insightful. And I believe they were sincere.\n  Our conversation also provided me with insights into how a young man \nfrom a small town in Indiana could grow up, attend Harvard, become one \nof the most admired lawyers in America, be nominated for the Supreme \nCourt, not once but twice, and then sit through 3 days of often \ngrueling questioning before the Senate Judiciary Committee, responding \ncalmly and respectfully to questions on a wide range of legal issues \nwithout the benefit of any notes or even a pad of paper.\n  Judge Roberts and I spoke with one another at length about our \nrespective childhoods and of our parents and the roles they played in \nour lives and the values they instilled in us and in our siblings. We \nalso talked about our educational opportunities, our careers, our \nmentors, our spouses, and even about the children we were raising.\n  It was a revealing and encouraging conversation. It was a revealing \nand encouraging conversation in that it provided me with important \ninsights into his personal values and with a measure of reassurance on \nthe direction he may ultimately seek to lead the highest Court of our \nland.\n  I shared with him that in the 8 years before coming to the Senate, I \nserved as Governor of Delaware. In that role, I nominated dozens of men \nand women to serve as judges in our State courts, several of whom enjoy \nnational prominence given my State's role in business and corporate \nlaw.\n  Ironically, and I think wisely, Delaware's Constitution requires \noverall political balance on our State's courts. For every Democrat who \nis nominated to serve as a judge, Delaware Governors must nominate a \nRepublican, and vice versa. The result has been an absence of political \ninfighting and a national reputation for Delaware's State judiciary \nregarded by some as the finest of any State in our land.\n  The qualities I sought in the judicial nominees I submitted to the \nDelaware State Senate included these: unimpeachable integrity, a \nthorough understanding of the law, a keen intellect, a willingness to \nlisten to both sides of a case, excellent judicial temperament, sound \njudgment, and a strong work ethic. In applying those standards to Judge \nRoberts, I believe he meets or\n\n[[Page S10567]]\n\nexceeds all of them. To my knowledge, no one has questioned his \nintegrity, his intellect, or his knowledge of the law. Democrats and \nRepublicans alike watched, along with a national audience, as Judge \nRoberts fielded any number of tough questions over the 3 days of \nhearings and responded knowledgeably, respectfully, with humility, and \noccasionally with self-deprecating good humor. In all candor, I am not \nsure any of us would have done as well.\n  Having said that, though, questions and doubts remain about where \nChief Justice Roberts will come down on a number of issues--\nreproductive rights, civil rights, and respect for congressional \nprerogatives, to mention a few. I might add that, if truth be known, \nall of those doubters are not liberal Democrats. Some of them are \nconservative Republicans.\n  The answers to these questions will come in the years ahead as Chief \nJustice Roberts assumes this important post and begins to lead this \nCourt and the judicial branch of our Government. In the end, some of \nthe decisions he helps to formulate may surprise and confound people on \nall sides of the political spectrum. That is something one of his \nearliest mentors, Judge Henry Friendly of the Second Circuit Court of \nAppeals, has done for years.\n\n  Let me pause and ask my colleagues today to think back just for a \nmoment. How many of us would ever have imagined that a Texas \nCongressman and Senator with Lyndon Johnson's early civil rights record \nwould go on to champion the civil rights of minorities like no other \nAmerican President in the 20th century? Who among us, watching former \nRepresentative and Senator Richard Nixon, a Cold War warrior for \ndecades, would have foreseen the role he played in opening the door for \nU.S. relations with Communist China? Then, too, recall, if you will, \nthe loathing many conservatives came to feel toward the late Chief \nJustice Earl Warren, a nominee of President Eisenhower, or the disdain \nmany liberals came to feel toward former Justice ``Whizzer'' White, a \nnominee of President Kennedy.\n  The truth is that life and its experiences do change us and some of \nour views in ways that cannot always be predicted. Having children of \nour own and later welcoming those children into our lives as well as \nlearning from our mistakes and from the mistakes of others can combine \nto make us wiser, to temper our views, to broaden our horizons and \ndeepen our understanding of the views of others with whom we share this \nplanet. And so it is likely to be with Judge Roberts.\n  As I prepare to take a leap of faith tomorrow--albeit not a reckless \none, in my view--let me close with a few words of advice, respectfully \noffered, to our President. A second nomination looms just around the \ncorner. President Bush's choice of that nominee is, in many respects, \nas important as this one. The next choice can divide this Congress and \nour country even further or it can serve to bring us a little closer \ntogether. We need a choice that unites us, not one that divides us \nfurther.\n  We also need a choice that reflects the diversity of this country in \nwhich we live. There are any number of well-qualified women, and maybe \neven a few men, who would be a good choice for the seat now held by \nJustice Sandra Day O'Connor. On behalf of all of us, Mr. President, let \nme encourage you to send us one of those names.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to announce my vote on the \nnomination of Judge John G. Roberts, Jr., to be the 17th Chief Justice \nof the United States.\n  I do not cast this vote lightly. I recognize how critical the courts \nare in protecting and advancing the rights of all Americans. I know \nwhat is at stake. I am also mindful that John Roberts has been \nnominated for a lifetime appointment to the highest seat on the highest \nCourt in our country. In our system, there is no backstop or review of \na Supreme Court Justice once he or she is confirmed. That means under \nthe Constitution we in the Senate have the responsibility to fully \nevaluate each nominee before voting, and that is exactly what I have \ndone.\n  For me personally, casting a vote on a nominee to the Supreme Court \ncarries special meaning. Thirteen years ago the nomination of another \nSupreme Court Justice, Clarence Thomas, helped launch my own path from \nthe kitchen table in Shoreline, WA to this historic desk on the floor \nof the Senate. During the Thomas confirmation, I was deeply frustrated \nthat the questions I believed needed to be answered were not even \nraised. I was troubled that average Americans, moms and dads, had no \nvoice in a process that would affect their rights and liberties.\n  This time I had the opportunity to ask those questions directly to \nthe nominee. I was pleased to work with my Democratic women colleagues \nto open the process and empower people across the country to submit \nquestions to the nominee via a Web site that Senator Barbara Mikulski \ncreated. Today not only did I have the opportunity to ask those \nquestions directly, but the weight has also been on my shoulders.\n  For days I have struggled with whether this nominee represents the \nfear I have of the worst motives of this administration or whether he \nrepresents the best hopes of a country for wise decisions that protect \nour rights and our freedoms and our responsibilities. No one of us can \nknow for sure. There is no doubt that anyone I would have nominated \nwould have come from a different background with a different history, \nbut this was not my choice. There is much I do not know about how Judge \nRoberts will rule, but as history has shown, none of us can predict \nthat. And without a crystal globe, I must make this very difficult \ndecision based on what I do know and upon the criteria I have long used \nto evaluate nominees for judicial appointments.\n  This evening I talk about how I have applied my standards to other \nnominees for the Federal bench. I am especially pleased that in \nWashington State we do judicial nominations the right way, through a \ncareful, bipartisan process that helps us select qualified candidates \nwithout regard to politics. In Washington State, I have worked with \ndifferent administrations to craft a process that helps us identify and \nconfirm qualified individuals for the Federal bench. We solicit input \nfrom a wide variety of respected individuals within the Washington \nState legal community, and then we personally interview each \nrecommended candidate prior to submitting his or her name to the White \nHouse for consideration.\n  During the Clinton administration, my colleague Senator Gorton and I \nworked together to recommend and support individuals for appointment to \nthe Federal bench. Senator Gorton and I disagreed on a lot of issues, \nbut we did agree that when it came to our duty in confirming \nindividuals to the third and coequal branch of our Government, we \nshould set aside partisanship and focus on qualifications. That \ntradition has continued with my colleague Senator Cantwell. We got off \nto a rough start on this approach because the Bush administration at \nfirst did not want to continue the fair process Senator Gorton and I \nhad established, but eventually the wisdom of our process prevailed. \nWhile there have been hiccups along the way, we have used it to confirm \nqualified people to serve on the bench.\n  Through this fair and deliberative process, I have supported nominees \nwith a wide variety of backgrounds. I have supported people who have \ncome from privileged backgrounds and those who beat the odds to realize \ntheir achievements. I have supported Democrats and Republicans. Each \ntime, though, I was confident that I was supporting an individual who \nwould serve every American who came before them well, and I have not \nbeen disappointed.\n  My home State of Washington is 2500 miles away from Washington, DC. \nIn many ways it is even further than that in terms of our independence \nof thought. The White House would do well to learn from the example we \nset in Washington State, and I hope the Bush administration will do a \nbetter job of consulting with the Senate on its next nominee and \nproviding a more complete record of that nominee's background and \nwritings.\n\n[[Page S10568]]\n\n  Some have suggested to me that I use my vote to register my \ndisapproval at things the Bush administration has done or that I use my \nvote to send a message to the President. While I am angry about \nmistakes and miscalculations and misrepresentations and misdirected \npriorities of the Bush administration, this vote is not the place to \nvent those frustrations. Fairness requires that I evaluate each nominee \non his or her own merits, without a predetermined outcome, just as I \nexpect every judge to do when a case comes before them. My vote is \nbased on the same standards I have used for years, not on anger or in \nsending messages or ignoring a nominee's actual record.\n\n  This would be an easier decision if we had a complete record. The \nWhite House has refused to provide more recent memos from Judge \nRoberts' work in the Solicitor General's office which would have \nprovided us with a clearer picture of the nominee. I, frankly, think \nthe White House's position is a reflection of the general breakdown in \nthe process that we use to select and confirm judges today. With this \nadministration, consultation with the Senate is cursory at best, and \nfrom the very beginning there has been often a kind of ``spoils of \nwar'' approach to how they view appointments to the Federal bench. I \nbelieve this approach has resulted in unqualified individuals being \nforwarded by the administration to the Senate for consideration. This \napproach has contributed to the partisan rancor regarding nominations \nto the courts.\n  These actions are even more concerning in light of the second vacancy \nthe Bush administration is set to fill in the coming weeks. I do not \nbelieve that an honest, fair evaluation could be completed with any \nless material information than we were provided during this \nconfirmation process. I believe the Bush administration is attempting \nto set a dangerous precedent with its words and actions or lack \nthereof, and I fear that future court nominations could be even more \ncontentious as a result.\n  In looking at nominees for our courts, I always follow a very \ndeliberative process of having a set of standards and comparing \nindividuals who come before us as nominees to that set of standards. I \nexamine their record and their experience and their testimony. I see if \nthey meet the basic standards of honesty and ethics and qualifications \nand fairness. Then I evaluate if they will be independent, evenhanded \nin deciding cases, and if they will uphold our rights and our \nliberties. Those standards help me ensure that when any American, \nregardless of background, comes before the court, he or she receives a \nfair hearing and that the resulting decision renders justice according \nto the law.\n  In reaching a decision on Judge Roberts, I reviewed all of the \ninformation that was available, and then I examined how Judge Roberts \nmeasured up to my criteria for judicial nominees. I followed the \nJudiciary Committee hearings closely. I read the transcripts. I have \nspoken directly with Judge Roberts twice, once in a meeting in my \noffice and once by phone.\n  Looking at my standards, I found Judge Roberts to be honest, ethical, \nqualified, and fair. I believe he will be evenhanded in deciding cases. \nOn those criteria, Judge Roberts clearly met my test. It was my last \ncriteria, upholding the rights and liberties of all Americans, where I \nhad a harder time evaluating Judge Roberts. I wish the White House had \nbeen more forthcoming in making available more documents that would \nhave shed light on some of his more recent work and opinions. I wish \nthe nominee himself had been more responsive to questions in his \ntestimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  Through this process, I have concluded that Judge Roberts is a decent \nperson with keen intellect and high ethical standards. I believe he \ndoes know the difference between the role of advocacy, which he has \nheld in the past, and the role of judge. I think he has the capacity to \nbe fair, and I think he aims to serve all of the American people.\n  On the question of upholding the hard-won rights and liberties of the \nAmerican people, I believe Judge Roberts has a healthy regard for \nprecedent and intends to apply a thoughtful approach to interpreting \nthe law. This is not to say I would expect or even hope to agree with \nevery decision he might make or every opinion a Chief Justice Roberts \nmight author. In making my decision, I recognize that history has shown \nno one can accurately anticipate what type of Justice a nominee may \nultimately become.\n  For many weeks I have known some people in Washington State will be \ndisappointed in my decision regardless of what that decision is. I have \nheard from friends and colleagues, constituents and strangers, on all \nsides of the question. Many of them have surprised me in their candor \nand in their position. All this has led me to struggle with the \ndecision for many days now. I have read up on Judge Roberts. I have \nlistened to the thoughts of others. I have talked with the judge \nhimself. All the while, it has been an extremely close call in my mind, \nfor I know the gravity and the consequences of this important vote. I \nhave had deep and lasting concerns. But I have had strong, heartfelt \nhopes as well.\n  In the end, I returned to the basic criteria I use on any tough \nquestion and to the values the people of Washington State sent me here \nto protect. In examining that criteria and those important values, I \nhave made a decision that I hope everyone can understand and appreciate \nand even be proud of. I am satisfied that Judge Roberts meets my long-\nheld criteria and, therefore, I will vote to confirm his nomination.\n\n  I believe Judge Roberts is well qualified to serve. I believe he is \nintelligent and honest and fair. Is he wise? Only time can answer that. \nI cast this vote with the hope that John Roberts will be an individual \nwho will combine common sense and decency with a real respect for how \nthe law affects each American as he serves out his tenure on the \nSupreme Court. In spending time with him and reviewing the available \nrecord, I believe Judge Roberts has the capacity to be that kind of \njustice.\n  Throughout our history, America has always had to confront challenges \nand enjoyed a lively debate on how to meet them. Today is no different. \nOur great Nation is confronting enormous challenges, and the debate \nover how to address those challenges has caused great divisions in our \ncountry. Many people, as I do, fear the direction in which this country \nis headed. They fear for our security. They fear we are not doing \nenough at home to secure a stronger future, and they fear the progress \nwe have made in the last several generations is being eroded by a \npolitical agenda. Those fears are well founded, and they are real. But \nour country was also founded on hope, hope that by securing individual \nliberty, a free people could govern themselves in the interest of \npromoting the common good, hope that despite our differences, we could \nband together to create strong communities and a better future for \ngenerations of Americans to come. That spirit of hope is alive today \nand should help guide us at least as much as our fears.\n\n  My vote tonight is a vote of hope--hope that despite our differences, \nwe can unite around the common good; hope that equal justice under the \nlaw means something powerful to every American, regardless of \nbackground or political persuasion; and hope that John Roberts responds \nto the needs of this Nation to have a Supreme Court that honors our \npast and helps secure the rights and liberties of every American into \nthe future.\n  When I asked Judge Roberts what kind of judge he wanted to be, he \nsaid: A Justice for all Americans. I hope my vote, along with the \ndiverse group of my Senate colleagues, reminds him every day that he \nmust be a judge for all Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague from \nWashington State for the incredible job she does here every day, for \nthe thoughtfulness she brings to this process, and the wonderful job \nshe does representing the people of Washington State. She is a delight \nto work with and someone who I think brings to the table thoughtful \nconsideration, with a strength and a courage and a wisdom that should \nmake the people of Washington State proud, and I know it does.\n  I come here today after much thought and prayer over a decision\n\n[[Page S10569]]\n\nthat is incredibly important. I agree with my colleague from Washington \nState that this is a time where our Nation needs much hope, whether it \ncomes from the devastation we have seen in the gulf coast in the \nsouthern region of our Nation, whether it is the families of our \nsoldiers who find themselves giving of themselves and of their families \nto protect the rights and the freedoms in which we in this Nation take \ngreat pride, and it is also as we come to the consideration of a \nSupreme Court nomination by the Senate which I find to be one of the \nmost important and consequential duties we have as an institution in \nour system of Government.\n  I think the American people look to us now with hope that we will \nwork in a bipartisan way, in a way of union, in uniting our Nation to \nbring about a coequal branch of our Government that can reassure the \nAmerican people of justice and of hope.\n  This is especially true when the candidate being considered has been \nnominated to the position of Chief Justice of the United States, not \nsimply an Associate Justice but someone who is going to provide the \nleadership to the highest Court in our land.\n  As the Senate performs its duty under the Constitution with regard to \nthis nominee, I am also mindful this is the first Supreme Court nominee \nI have been called upon to evaluate as a Senator from the great State \nof Arkansas. I have no doubt this is one of the most important \nnominations I will consider during my tenure in public service.\n  Given the import of this decision for the future of this Nation and \nthe responsibilities I have to my constituents and my country, I have \nexamined all of the information available about Judge Roberts' \nnomination to ensure I have given this matter the full attention it \nneeds and, most importantly, that it deserves.\n  In making my decision, I very carefully and deliberately reviewed the \nrecord compiled by the Senate Judiciary Committee. Further, I have \nconsidered the views of Arkansans, both those who think Judge Roberts \nwill make a fine Supreme Court Justice and those who have real concerns \nabout the direction he might lead this very important Court.\n  I have also met with Judge Roberts privately to get a better sense of \nwho he is as a person, his temperament, and, most importantly, what his \nexperiences have been in his life that may form his views and the \ninterpretation of the Constitution.\n  Additionally, I have considered the views of his peers and colleagues \nin the legal community on both sides of the political spectrum who know \nJudge Roberts, who have worked with him firsthand and have a firsthand \nknowledge of his works and abilities.\n  Finally, I have prayed. I searched my conscience and reflected on my \nprinciples as a Senator for the people of the State of Arkansas, using \nmy experience, coming from the salt of the earth in east Arkansas, a \nfarmer's daughter, my experience as a wife, a mother, a neighbor, to \nmake what I believe is the right decision and one I will have to live \nwith for the rest of my life.\n  I want to say at the outset this has been one of the hardest \ndecisions I believe I have been called upon to make since I came to the \nSenate more than 6 years ago. It has been difficult because the \nconsequences of confirming a new Chief Justice are so profound.\n  Judge Roberts will likely serve on the Court for several decades, and \nI believe he will have more influence on the future of our Nation than \nany Member who serves perhaps in this body today.\n  This decision has also been difficult for me because of the manner in \nwhich this administration has handled this nomination, in some \nrespects, and certainly many other nominations that have come before \nit.\n  When President Bush first ran for office in 2000, he told the \nAmerican people he was a uniter, not a divider. He talked about how \nwell he had worked with Democrats as Governor of Texas and that he was \ngoing to continue that approach as President to change the tone in \nWashington. And, oh, how that tone in Washington needed to be changed.\n  But sadly, that did not happen. President Bush has not followed \nthrough on that promise, and judicial nominations, unfortunately, are \none of the most glaring examples of where his administration has fallen \nshort. In my opinion, this administration has gone out of its way to \ndivide this Nation and the Senate on judicial nominations, which I \nthink is truly a disservice to our judiciary and to the American \npeople.\n\n  When the Senate rejected only a handful of Federal appeals court \nnominees during the President's first term in office, I expected a \nuniter who would work with Senators, who expressed concerns, and \nnominate other qualified candidates who could win confirmation with \nbroad bipartisan support. Instead, after winning reelection, the \nPresident renominated many of the same controversial nominees and \nessentially dared the Senate to challenge him again.\n  Reflecting on the last 5 years, his administration apparently \nbelieves it is better for them politically to pick a fight over \njudicial nominees than it is to pick sometimes qualified nominees who \nhave earned the support and respect from those on both sides of the \naisle in the legal community in which they work and in the Senate.\n  As a pragmatic Democrat who has always been willing to find common \nground and to work in good faith with members of both parties to serve \nthe best interests of my constituents, I am alarmed by the \nconfrontational approach this administration has taken.\n  We can all be proud of the Founders of this great Nation who created \nour system of government, where they wisely divided the power of \nappointment and confirmation of the Federal court Justices between the \nexecutive and legislative branches of our Government. They did this to \nensure only the most qualified candidates who had the confidence of the \nPresident and the Senate would be confirmed to a lifetime seat on the \nFederal bench.\n  I truly worry that the political tug of war over the judiciary, which \nPresident Bush has encouraged, threatens to undermine the judicial \nselection process and with it our framework of checks and balances \nwhich has preserved for centuries the rights and freedoms we cherish as \nAmericans, not to mention the sense of pride and comfort or peace of \nmind it provides the American people to know that in that third coequal \nbranch of Government, they can rest assured that their freedoms, their \nrights will be justly directed.\n  To work properly, the process depends on mutual trust and respect \nbetween the executive and the legislative branches, and when that trust \nand respect is strained, our ability to do our very best as a \ngovernment, to preserve and to protect a fair and independent judiciary \nfor future generations, becomes in jeopardy.\n  So it is into this atmosphere of political confrontation that Judge \nRoberts was nominated to the Supreme Court. And it is why, frankly, I \nhave had difficulty separating my profound disappointment with the \nadministration and the distrust it has fostered from my opinion of \nJudge Roberts as an individual. So to separate that opinion of Judge \nRoberts that I needed to develop as an individual, as a lawyer, and \npotentially the next Chief Justice of the United States, ultimately, I \nconcluded it is unfair to hold Judge Roberts accountable for the \nactions of the President who appointed him.\n  As I have set aside the history of the last 5 years to take a closer \nlook at this nominee, it has become apparent to me that Judge Roberts \ndoes meet the test I believe we should strive to achieve in the \njudicial selection process. After careful thought and deliberation, I \nhave concluded Judge Roberts is a very smart man who has an enormous \nrespect for the law.\n  There is no question in my mind that Judge Roberts has the legal \nskills and the intellect necessary to perform his duties on the Supreme \nCourt. He has impeccable academic credentials and has demonstrated an \nimpressive command of the law and Constitution throughout his \nprofessional career and during his recent confirmation hearings.\n  I also believe that above all else, Judge Roberts is devoted to the \nConstitution and the institutional integrity of the judiciary and the \nvital role it plays in our system of Government.\n  I have no doubt John Roberts is a Republican, like the President who \nappointed him. But I don't believe his party affiliation will prevent \nhim from\n\n[[Page S10570]]\n\ngiving both sides in each case before the Court a fair and impartial \nhearing.\n  Simply put, I believe John Roberts cares more about following the law \nand maintaining the respect for the judiciary than he does about \npolitics and ideology.\n  I base this conclusion on the respect and support he has earned from \nlawyers and colleagues on both sides of the aisle who know Judge \nRoberts well--they know him far better than I do--on the evidence in \nthe record from his own comments and those of his colleagues that he \nhas had an abiding respect for the Court's decisions and that he \nunderstands the value of continuity in the law, and on his \ndistinguished career as a lawyer and advocate before the Federal \njudiciary over many years.\n  I regret Judge Roberts has made this decision more difficult than it \nneeded to be by refusing to be more forthcoming about his views on \nprotections in the Constitution for individuals, especially as \nthose protections and guarantees relate to civil rights and gender \nequality.\n\n  As many of my colleagues have already mentioned, Judge Roberts wrote \nseveral memos when he worked in the Reagan administration in which he \nadvocated for a narrow application of Federal antidiscrimination \nstatutes, specifically the Voting Rights Act and title IX. Judge \nRoberts indicated in his response to questions about these memos during \nhis confirmation hearings that he was representing the views of his \nclient, the administration, without elaborating on whether he held \nthose same views today.\n  He stated he could not say more regarding his views on those subjects \nbecause to do so might undermine his ability, if confirmed, to \nimpartially consider similar cases that are likely to come before the \nCourt.\n  I believe he could have said more on those and other issues before \ncrossing that line, but I don't believe Judge Roberts is entirely to \nblame for failing to be more responsive.\n  The partisan atmosphere which pervades the confirmation process today \nalmost guarantees that Senators are left with no choice but to ask \nlegitimate questions of a Supreme Court nominee they know will not be \nanswered. So the Senate is left to make a decision based on the limited \ninformation provided during the confirmation process and from a \nnominee's previous work and life experience.\n  My vote for John Roberts is by no means an endorsement of his \nnomination process, nor is it an endorsement of the decision by the \nadministration to withhold documents from Judge Roberts' tenure in the \nSolicitor General's Office during the first Bush administration. That \nwould be helpful to Senators in forming an opinion about this \nnomination. These are the types of documents previous administrations \nhave made available to the Senate during the consideration of Supreme \nCourt nominees in the past. There is no reason to have not made them \navailable in this instance. Future nominees to the Supreme Court, or \nany lifetime judicial position, may not possess the same outstanding \npersonal qualities and impeccable reputation that helped Judge Roberts \novercome his failure, and the failure of the administration, to respond \nmore fully to legitimate requests for information. Indeed, there have \nbeen past nominees who have failed to receive Senate confirmation, at \nleast partially because they refused to answer questions or release \ndocuments.\n\n  I feel that I have done my level best, despite my misgivings about \nthe actions of this administration in the past, to fairly and carefully \nand in good faith evaluate this nomination, which is my duty as a \nSenator. I believe I have done that. It is my hope and expectation \nthat, if confirmed, Judge Roberts will do likewise with respect to \nevery litigant who comes before the Court, especially those who have \nnot experienced the same opportunities with which he has been so richly \nblessed.\n  I believe Judge Roberts will do that, and therefore I will support \nhis nomination. I join my other colleagues who look to leadership in \nhopes, in hopes that we can mend many of the fences and the \ndifficulties that have been conjured up by very partisan attitudes in \nthese nomination processes, but to look toward Judge Roberts in a way \nthat understands and takes in full faith his commitment that he will \nadminister the law through the courts in a just way, without regard for \nhis political or personal views but with the kind of sincere devotion \nto the Constitution and the rule of law and the precedent of the courts \nthat he has expressed to many of us personally; that he will move \nforward, and deal with every litigant who comes before him in Court in \na fair and just way.\n  In closing, I wish to comment briefly on the future as we move beyond \nthis nomination. When I first ran for office as a young single woman in \nthe early 1990s, I did so because I had hope, hope that I could improve \nmy Government and make it more responsive to the needs of the citizens \nof my State. Perhaps my greatest attribute was the fact that I was \nnaive. It never occurred to me that I didn't belong here; perhaps that \nas a young woman, this might have been a place a little bit out of \ntouch for me. But I ran because I believed in my country, I believed in \nthe people of my home State, and I believed in what I had to offer.\n  I see a good bit of that in Judge Roberts as well. I have tried my \nbest each day that I have been privileged to serve in public office to \nfulfill that commitment, and today I still have great hope for our \nNation's future and its government. I also have hope that we can \nimprove the judicial nomination process as we move forward if all \npeople of good will on both sides of the aisle will work together in a \nspirit of cooperation and good faith. I stand ready to do my part to \novercome our differences as a nation because I believe our country is \nso much stronger if we are united and not divided.\n  As we prepare to consider a second Supreme Court nominee in the \ncoming weeks, I hope President Bush will take that opportunity to do \nthe same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I note the time is under Democratic control.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I was aware of that. I was asking if there are any \nDemocrats who would object to my starting my comments at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, before the Senator from Arkansas goes, I \ndo not have prepared remarks, but to try to put her a little bit at \nease about these decisions that we have to make on the Supreme Court \nbecause they are very important decisions, I would reflect on some \nhistory.\n  For instance, I probably had the same concerns about President \nClinton and Justice Breyer and Justice Ginsburg when I voted for them. \nRegarding the political positions that Justice Ginsburg stood for in \nher life before coming to be a judge, I wouldn't agree with many of \nthem. But she was totally qualified to be on the Supreme Court, and I \nvoted for her based upon the proposition that Alexander Hamilton said \nthat the purpose of our activities here of confirming people for the \ncourts is basically two. Maybe there is some historian around who will \nsay Grassley has it all wrong, but I think it was, No. 1, to make sure \nthat people who were not qualified did not get on the courts. In other \nwords, only qualified people get appointed to the courts and that \npolitical hacks do not get appointed to the courts.\n  That is somebody who was around when the Constitution was written, \nand the Federalist Papers, stating those things about our role. So I \nhave a fairly flexible point of view of how I ought to look at people, \neven those with whom I disagree.\n  In regard to what the Senator said about hoping what President Bush \nwould do, or what he has done in the past in regard to these \nappointments, I would want you to look at that as I looked at President \nClinton being elected in 1992. I don't know whether court appointments \nwere an issue in that campaign as they were in 2000 or 2004, but I \nassume that he had a mandate to appoint whom he wanted appointed, as \nlong as they were not political hacks and as long as they were \nqualified. So I gave President Clinton that leeway.\n\n  I am hoping that even more so with President Bush, since he made very \nclear to the people of this country that he was going to appoint strict \nconstructionists and people who were not going to legislate from the \nbench. You may not like what he is doing, but he\n\n[[Page S10571]]\n\nis doing exactly what he said he was going to do, and I hope that would \nenhance credibility to the American people of at least one more \npolitician who keeps his word when he is in office. He appoints whom he \nsaid he was going to appoint, and that is what he is doing here. It \nshould not be any surprise, and I hope he would be respected for doing \nthat and have leeway in doing that, as long as they are not political \nhacks but they are qualified.\n  The other one is, over a long period of time, to maybe take away some \nworry about whether or not we have to be concerned about this specific \nperson doing exactly what he said he was going to do. I would refer to \nJudge Souter. I was thinking Judge Souter was maybe not exactly whom I \nwould want on the Court, but he would be pretty close to it. During \nthat debate--I think it was in committee and not on the floor--there \nwas one of the Senators on your side, who I have named but I will not \nname him this time, who made this point about Justice Souter--that he \ndidn't have respect for the right to privacy and then was a threat to \nRoe v. Wade.\n  Here is one Republican who thought maybe Souter would work out OK, \nfrom my point of view. There was a Democrat over there who thought \nSouter would be a threat to Roe V. Wade. We were both wrong.\n  So it is difficult to predict what people are going to do down the \nroad, so you have to look at are they qualified. I don't have any doubt \nbut that Judge Souter is qualified to be on the Court. But I misjudged \nhim and this Democratic Senator also misjudged him.\n  The other one is, if you worry about Republicans, to look at what \nthey might appoint versus what Democrats might appoint, and you end up \ngetting something from a Republican you don't like. I assume you are \nmore to the liberal end than the conservative, and you have to stop to \nthink that a Republican appointed John Paul Stevens and a Republican \nappointed Justice Souter, two of the four most liberal people on the \nSupreme Court.\n  To some extent, you get what you want from a Republican President as \nmuch as you do from a Democratic President because the other two were \nappointed by President Clinton.\n  Then, also, from a historical standpoint, time brings a great deal of \nbalance to the Court. Justices change their views sometimes over a \nperiod of 25 or 30 years on the Court. Or Presidents that you might be \nthinking are appointing conservatives end up appointing liberals--they \nend up being liberals on the Supreme Court.\n  History is going to bring balance to the Court. Right now, if Justice \nRoberts is appointed, we will have four liberals. I don't need to name \nthem. Everyone understands who they are. You are going to have three \nconservatives: Roberts, Scalia and Thomas. And then you are going to \nhave two moderates, Kennedy and O'Connor--O'Connor for a little while \nnow. So you have some balance, but it is tilted a little bit more \ntoward the liberal side than it is to the conservative side.\n  Maybe, when President Bush gets done with this next nominee, there \nwill be even more balance, four conservatives and four liberals and one \nmoderate, Justice Kennedy left as a moderate.\n  Then I keep thinking about what we ought to do if we want to bring \nbalance to the Court, and I hear more about that on your side than I do \non this side: Let's just say that Justice Ginsburg, obviously a woman, \nand Justice O'Connor is obviously a woman; we have two women, so maybe \nwe ought to have a woman appointed to the Supreme Court.\n  The liberal women of America have Justice Ginsburg as voting the way \nthat they think Justices ought to vote. Maybe the conservative women of \nAmerica are entitled to a seat on the Supreme Court. We might be \nfortunate enough to get appointed a very qualified woman who is also a \nstrict constructionist. Then we would have one liberal woman and we \nwould have one conservative woman on the Supreme Court, and we have \neven more balance brought to the Court.\n  So you see history kind of takes care of these things. I hope 25 \nyears from now--and you are a lot younger than I am and you will be \naround here 25 years from now--that you are satisfied that history will \ntake care of all these problems that are brought up about what the \nSupreme Court might do 10 or 15 years from now.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. If the Senator will yield, I want to say how grateful I \nam to my chairman because he always does provide hopefulness, without a \ndoubt, as well as a bipartisan attitude, in trying to get things done.\n  I guess you are exactly right. Some of my fear comes from the role \nthat I have in helping to create history and the thoughtfulness that I \nneed to put into it.\n  Some of it also certainly comes from recognizing that there is a \nright way and a wrong way to do everything. My hope is, as we go \nthrough these processes, that we become a more united body, looking at \nthe right way to go about things and a more unified way.\n  I am grateful to the chairman. He is always a wonderful Member of \nthis body to work with and he always brings balance and hopefulness and \nI am glad he is my chairman.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. She said she is glad I am her chairman. She means she \nand I serve on the Finance Committee together. I don't want to mislead \nthe audience, I am not chairman of the Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. President, I will proceed, then, with the remarks I wanted to \nmake in regard to my support for Judge John Roberts to be the next \nChief Justice of the United States. I do support that nomination. Judge \nRoberts has earned our vote. He understands the proper role of a judge \nin our constitutional democracy. He understands the courts are not \nsuperlegislatures.\n  He understands that I am elected to be a legislator, to make law. If \npeople do not like the law I make, they can vote me out of office. But \nif Judge Roberts makes law, with a lifetime appointment to the Court, \nhe can never be voted out of office unless he is impeached. He \nunderstands that the courts are not responsible for addressing every \nsocial ill or injustice that, in fact, ought to be settled through law \nand public policy. He understands that courts do not create new rights. \nRather, courts protect those liberties and rights guaranteed by our \nConstitution and the laws appropriately enacted by Congress and State \nlegislatures.\n  He also understands that there are a great deal--infinitesimal--\nnumber of unenumerated rights out there for you and me that are \nreserved under our Constitution to the States and to the people \nthereof.\n  Judge Roberts said this to the committee:\n\n       Judges and Justices are servants of the law, not the other \n     way around. Judges are like umpires. Umpires don't make \n     rules, they apply them.\n\n  Judge Roberts underscores that ``judges and Justices'' make sure \neverybody plays by the rules. But these rules limiting the power of \nGovernment over the people apply to the courts as well. He made it very \nclear to us. In Judge Roberts' view, ``Not everybody went to a ball \ngame to see the umpire.''\n  That is the right approach to the job of a Supreme Court Justice.\n  Judge Roberts has demonstrated, particularly to the committee, that \nhe understands the limited nature of judges, and especially the \nhumility and the modesty necessary to be the kind of judge we need on \nour highest Court. Judge Roberts believes that courts may act only to \ndecide cases and controversies. That is exactly what it says in article \nIII of the Constitution. So judges cannot address every unaddressed and \nunremedied social problem.\n  Judge Roberts said:\n\n       Judges have to decide hard questions when they come up in \n     the context of a particular case. That is their obligation. \n     But they have to decide those questions according to the rule \n     of law, not their own social preferences, not their policy \n     views, not their personal preferences but according to the \n     rule of law.\n\n  That is what he told us in committee.\n  Judge Roberts also said:\n\n       We don't turn a matter over to a judge because we want his \n     view about what the best idea is, what the best solution is. \n     It is because we want him or her to apply the law. Let me say \n     parenthetically, as I would interpret that, not to make law, \n     but to apply the law.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       They--\n\n  Meaning judges--\n\n     are constrained when they do that. They are constrained by \n     the words that I choose to\n\n[[Page S10572]]\n\n     enact into law in interpreting that law. They are constrained \n     by the words of the Constitution. They are constrained by the \n     precedents of the other judges that became part of the rule \n     of law that they must apply.\n\n  This answer he gave to the committee demonstrates that Judge Roberts \nbelieves in and will exercise judicial restraint on the bench. This \nprinciple of judicial restraint is a cornerstone of our constitutional \nsystem, best defined by the tenth amendment--that that power is not \nspecifically given to the Federal Government or reserved to the States \nand the people thereof. This is the defining characteristic of the \njudiciary in our Government of divided powers.\n  In particular, I was pleased when Judge Roberts told the committee \nthat he has no agenda to bring to the bench. I want to remind you what \nJudge Roberts said in a very short opening statement. To quote a little \nbit of it:\n\n       I come before the committee with no agenda. I have no \n     platform. Judges are not politicians who can promise to do \n     certain things in exchange for votes. I have no agenda but I \n     do have a commitment. If I am confirmed, I will confront \n     every case with an open mind. I will fully and fairly analyze \n     the legal arguments that are presented. I will be open to the \n     considered views of my colleagues on the bench, and I will \n     decide every case based on the record according to the rule \n     of law, without fear or favor, to the best of my ability, and \n     I will remember that it's my job to call the balls and \n     strikes and not to pitch or bat.\n\n  I was also pleased when Judge Roberts told the committee that:\n\n       I had someone ask me in this process: Are you going to be \n     on the side of the little guy? And you obviously want to give \n     an immediate answer. But as you reflect on it, if the \n     Constitution says that the little guy should win, the little \n     guy is going to win in court before me. But if the \n     Constitution says that the big guy should win, well, then the \n     big guy is going to win because my obligation is to the \n     Constitution. That's my oath.\n\n  So, obviously, Judge Roberts will strive to uphold the Constitution \nand the laws of the United States, regardless of his personal beliefs.\n  I want to take a little time to commend Chairman Specter for \nconducting a fair and respectful hearing. I am pleased we are looking \nat a timely up-or-down vote on this nominee. Obviously, so many people \nfor so long were inclined to filibuster judges, and to have this \nimportant person--this ``well-qualified'' person--go through in the \ntradition of the Senate doing what the Constitution says to do, give \nits advice and consent with a 51-vote margin, is something that \nsurprises me to some extent after the last 2 years. But to have it \nhappen gives me a very warm feeling toward all my colleagues for having \nthat up-or-down vote.\n\n  Article II of the Constitution puts the appointment power in the \nexecutive, and says the President gets to nominate the person of his \nchoice to the Supreme Court. And President Bush in an unprecedented \nmanner consulted with more than 70 Senators on both sides of the aisle \nbefore sending up Judge Roberts' nomination. President Bush didn't have \nto do that under the Constitution. But it was wise for him to so do.\n  Even though I have been a member of the Judiciary Committee for my \n25th year, I don't remember a President who has talked to me about who \nI think ought to be appointed. I wouldn't want to say over 25 years \nthat I couldn't have forgotten some Republican or Democrat talking to \nme about it, but I don't remember. I was consulted by this President on \nthe type of person I thought should be nominated. I was even offered to \ngive names, if I wanted to. And I took advantage of giving my advice to \nhim.\n  At the hearing which Senator Specter conducted, Senators were able to \nask numerous questions of the nominee over a period of 3 days. The \nJudiciary Committee also reviewed thousands of documents, opinions, and \nother information produced by the White House.\n  Throughout the process, Judge Roberts was patient; he was candid and \nforthcoming in his responses.\n  Judge Roberts clearly has been the most scrutinized judicial nominee \nto come before the Senate in my years on the committee. No nominee in \nthese years before the committee has testified as thoroughly and \ncomprehensively on his judicial philosophy as Judge Roberts. I have \ngone through 10 Supreme Court hearings. Judge Roberts' command of the \nlaw and the facts of cases was without precedent.\n  Still, some of my colleagues objected to Judge Roberts' refusal to \nreview the results of cases. But his refusal was absolutely the right \nthing to do. Judge Roberts wisely resisted the bait to confuse results \nand reasoning when it comes to the judicial function. No doubt this \ngreatly frustrated some of my colleagues, particularly on the other \nside of the aisle, who wanted to impose litmus tests on all judicial \nnominees, who want to extract commitments from nominees to rule in a \npredetermined way, their political way, regardless of the facts of the \nlaw.\n  If they can't get that, if they can't get allegiance to their \npersonal political predilection, and work with their far-left activist \ngroups, well, then it seems as though that nominee isn't worthy of \ntheir vote.\n  It stymies me why it would be wrong for the President of the United \nStates to ask a nominee if they support Roe v. Wade or not--and Judge \nRoberts under oath answered the question of whether the President \ndiscussed it with him, and the President didn't discuss it with him--\nbut a lot of Senators were saying, or at least implying, that it would \nbe wrong for the President to get that sort of litmus test type of \ncommitment from a nominee, but some of those very same Senators found \nit not in the least bothering their conscience to ask him exactly that \nsame question and expect an answer from him.\n  Frankly, I have no way of knowing how Judge Roberts will rule on the \nhot-button issues in the next 25 years. I acknowledge that he might \nrule in ways that will disappoint me in some of the same ways that I \nwas disappointed by Justice O'Connor, Justice Kennedy, and Justice \nSouter in the years since they have been on the Court. These were all \nnominees I supported through the Supreme Court confirmation process, \nbut no Senator has a right to impose his or her particular litmus test \non an otherwise qualified nominee.\n  I voted, as I said earlier to the Senator from Arkansas, for Ruth \nBader Ginsburg, as did almost all of my Republican colleagues, because \nwe acknowledge the President's--that was President Clinton--primacy in \nthe appointments to the Supreme Court, even where we knew this Justice \nGinsburg had a different philosophy. I knew then that I shared very \nlittle in terms of political, social, or philosophical views of Ruth \nBader Ginsburg. As everyone knows now, Judge Ginsburg was then \naffiliated very closely with extremely liberal views--views a majority \nof the American public would deem way out of the mainstream. But the \nJudiciary Committee evaluated her as a fully competent person to serve \non the Supreme Court. And then because of that, because we were doing \nwhat we should constitutionally be doing, we voted her in 96 to 3.\n  As I said in committee, it seems there is a whole new ball game out \nhere when we have an individual with the competence, intelligence, and \nbrilliance of Judge Roberts who nonetheless is going to get a lot of \nDemocrats voting against him. This says far more about the Democrats \ntoday than it does about the nominee John Roberts.\n  The truth is that at another time Judge Roberts would have been \nconfirmed 100 to 0, and properly so, as Justice Scalia 20 years ago was \napproved almost unanimously. Today's Democrats have made the needle's \neye for approving so small, so impossibly tiny, even the Supreme Court \ngiants of the past could never pass through it.\n\n  The reality is that today's Democrat Party seems to be beholden to \nfar left pressure groups who know their radical agenda for America can \nonly be implemented by judicial fiat. I am sad to say that the other \nparty has expressed an unquestionable loyalty to what is probably their \nbase but a base out of touch with the vast majority of Americans.\n  When we finally cast our vote on the nomination of Judge Roberts, \nmost Senate Democrats will show they will be voting in lockstep with \nthe demands of their leftwing interest groups regardless of how \nqualified, brilliant, or worthy the nominee is.\n  On the other hand, I have to admit since I prepared these remarks, I \nhave heard speeches by two Members of that party within the last hour \nwho I did not think would come to the conclusion of voting for him, who \nhave said within the last hour they were going to vote for Judge \nRoberts. I am pleased with that.\n\n[[Page S10573]]\n\n  But we still have a situation that has been demonstrated over the \nlast 3 years, up until May of this year when some judges finally got \nthrough for the circuits, that judges were being held up for very \npartisan reasons. The other party and their outside groups have their \nown agenda. They want the Supreme Court or courts, generally, to \nimplement it, particularly things they might not be able to get through \nthe Congress of the United States.\n  My colleagues like to say they voted for more judges appointed by \nRepublican Presidents than judges appointed by Democrat Presidents. But \nmy friends on the other side of the aisle who say this, are not telling \nthe whole picture. Sure, they voted for a lot of Republican nominees \nduring my time in the Senate. More Republican nominees have been sent \nup for consideration than Democrat nominees. The point is, the \nDemocrats have stuck like glue to their outside interest groups through \nthick and thin and voted in lockstep against more Republican-appointed \njudges than Republicans have voted against Democrat-appointed judges. \nThat has been by a landslide margin.\n  The fact is, a majority of the Democrats voted in lockstep against \nJudge Bork and Justice Thomas. A majority of Democrats voted in \nlockstep against Justice Rehnquist when he was elevated to Chief \nJustice.\n  On the other hand, Republicans voted overwhelmingly for President \nClinton's two liberal nominees, Justices Ginsburg and Breyer. So I \nthink my party has shown it is not wedded to the single-issue interest \ngroups.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle are weaving revisionist \nhistory saying the more conservative Justices of the Court, such as \nScalia and Thomas, are the ones who are really the judicial activists \non the bench. But we all know this is just not true.\n  The American people know what is really going on. The liberal \nleftwing interest groups and Senate enablers, as my friend, Senator \nHatch, has sometimes called them, want to win in the courtroom what \nthey cannot win in the ballot box. The Democrats have taken this to a \nnew level. They are already talking about filibustering the next \nnominee, and we do not even know who that is yet. They are really the \nones who are judicial activists.\n  We should take care because the independence of the Federal judiciary \nis at stake. Our entire framework of government as we know it and was \nintended by the Framers is at stake.\n  We are told the Democrats are laying the groundwork for the next \nSupreme Court nominee by sending a message, I presume, to the President \nand those of this party. These messages are an argument that Justice \nO'Connor must be replaced by a liberal or moderate, and that individual \nshould be a woman or another minority, claiming the balance of the \nCourt must be maintained at all costs.\n  I hope I made this clear in my comments that Senator Lincoln listened \nto so closely, and that was that history takes care of a lot of this. \nOf the four liberals on the Supreme Court today, two were appointed by \nRepublicans, President Ford and President Bush 1. The moderates, \nO'Connor and Kennedy, were appointed by a Republican President. So we \ndo not know what we get. I wish we did. I wish we could predict 25 \nyears from now, but we can't.\n  The Democrats did not expect President Clinton to appoint a moderate \njudge to replace Justice Byron White. I remind my colleagues that \nJustice White was one of the two Justices who dissented in Roe v. Wade. \nWe Republicans did not say: Well, Justice White is retiring so we need \nto make sure we appoint another person like Justice White to the \nSupreme Court. President Clinton wasn't elected to appoint people the \nRepublicans wanted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time from 6:20 \nto 7:20 is under the control of the Democrat side, if the Senator would \nlike to ask unanimous consent to finish his remarks.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent for 3 or 4 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. So we get appointments such as Ruth Bader Ginsburg, \ntotally qualified to be on the Court. I voted for her; Justice Breyer, \ntotally qualified to be on the Court, I voted for him. We did not try \nto second-guess President Clinton.\n  Clearly, Justice Ginsburg does not share Justice White's philosophy. \nYet Senate Republicans overwhelmingly confirmed her, with only three \n``nay'' votes. The fact is, the President picked people they thought \nwould be good Justices.\n  The bottom line is we should not be thinking of liberal, \nconservative, or moderate judges--men or women for that matter. We \nought to think of who is qualified. If you are qualified for the job, \nyou ought to get the vote of the Senate. Someone who has the right \ntemperament and integrity on the job is also a requirement. But these \nliberals I voted for have had that as well.\n  Judge Roberts recognized this problem, politicizing the Federal \nbench, and in particular the Supreme Court, when some of my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle attempted to pin him down on certain \nlitmus test questions at his nomination hearings. Judge Roberts said:\n\n       [I]t is a very serious threat to the independence and \n     integrity of the court to politicize them. I think that is \n     not a good development to regard the courts as simply an \n     extension of the political process. That's not what they are.\n\n  Judge Roberts went on to say:\n\n       Judges go on the bench and they apply and decide cases \n     according to judicial process, not on the basis of promises \n     made earlier to get elected and promises made earlier to get \n     confirmed. That's inconsistent with the independence and \n     integrity of the Supreme Court.\n\n  I am in total agreement with that statement. So when Judge Roberts \ntestifies his oath is to uphold the Constitution and the laws of the \nUnited States and that he won't impose a political or social agenda in \nhis decisionmaking, that is what we need to hear. That is because the \nbottom line is, irrespective of Judge Roberts' impressive resume, \nbrilliant intellect, and personal integrity, he would not be qualified \nto be a Supreme Court Justice unless he was truly willing and able to \nsubject himself to that judicial restraint.\n  Judge Roberts says his obligation is to the Constitution and that is \nhis oath. He says he will not impose his personal views on the people \nbut will make decisions in an impartial manner in accordance with the \nConstitution, the laws enacted by Congress. He says he will be modest \nin his judging and exercise judicial restraint. He says he will respect \nthe limited role of a judge in society. That is the kind of Justice we \nneed to see on the Supreme Court. That is the kind of Justice the \nSenate should support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, generally when we vote, the decisions we \nmake can be revisited within a few months or years. This year's \nappropriations policy can be replaced by a new one next year. \nUnintended consequences can be rectified, legislation fine tuned.\n  But the consequences of confirming a Supreme Court Justice last well \nbeyond a Senator's term and maybe even his or her life. Given Judge \nJohn Roberts' age, he may be making critical decisions on \nconstitutional rights when my newborn grandson is welcoming children of \nhis own into this world.\n  Not surprisingly then, I consider voting on the confirmation of a \nSupreme Court Justice, and especially the Chief Justice, one of the \nmost important responsibilities of a Senator.\n  While I have considered and voted on four Supreme Court nominees \nduring my tenure in the Senate, the nomination of Judge Roberts to be \nthe 17th Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court is my first chance to \nconsider the nomination of an individual to be the Chief Justice.\n  I have spent a great deal of time the last few weeks considering this \nnomination. I looked at Judge Roberts' decisions during his tenure on \nthe D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, reviewed the memorandums he wrote \nwhile working in the Reagan administration, watched the nomination \nhearing, and listened to what my Senate colleagues have said on this \nnomination. After considering all of this, I have decided to support \nJudge Roberts' nomination to be Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme \nCourt.\n  My decision to support Judge Roberts did not come easily. As my \nfather, who served as the Chief Justice of the Vermont Supreme Court, \nfirst taught me, the law trumps any personal beliefs when a judge is \nworking to reach\n\n[[Page S10574]]\n\na decision on a case. A fair, equal application of the law is what Olin \nJeffords was known for, which is a reflection of Vermont's view of the \njudiciary.\n  As the former attorney general in Vermont, and as a lawyer, I have \nalways been deeply devoted to the Framers' concept of an independent \njudiciary filled with intelligent, capable individuals serving the law \nand the public. As a Senator, I have watched in dismay as this \nindependence has increasingly been threatened and demeaned by partisan \nbickering.\n  It has been my general policy while in the Senate to support the \nexecutive branch nominations made by a President, provided the \nindividual is appropriately qualified and capable of performing the \nduties required of the position. However, while a position in the \nexecutive branch lasts only as long as the President remains in office, \nan appointment to the Federal bench is for the life of the nominee.\n  I believe it would be illogical to assume that our Founding Fathers \nused the phrase, `` . . . with the Advice and Consent of the Senate . . \n.'' in the Constitution to mean the Senate can only look at the legal \nexperience and character of a judicial nominee. So in addition to those \nfactors I also look at a nominee's judicial temperament and ideology \nand whether these factors will influence the decisions they make.\n  This higher standard is especially appropriate for a nominee to the \nU.S. Supreme Court. This Court is the final authority on the meaning of \nlaws and the U.S. Constitution. The Supreme Court gives meaning to what \nis the scope of the right of privacy; whether Vermont's limits on \ncampaign contributions and spending are constitutional; what is an \nunreasonable search and seizure; how expansive the power of the \npresident can be; or whether Congress exceeded its power in passing a \nlaw. These are issues that affect everyone, and it is the \nresponsibility of the Senate to closely and carefully review every \nnominee to the Supreme Court.\n  There are clearly many stances Judge Roberts took as a lawyer in the \nReagan administration that I do not agree with. Here it is unfortunate \nthe Senate has been denied access to the memorandums Judge Roberts \nwrote while part of the Solicitor General's office. These documents \nwould have provided a more complete picture.\n  From the record we have, nobody has raised a question on whether \nJudge Roberts has the proper legal experience or character to be the \nnext Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. It also appears to me \nfrom a review of his judicial decisions that Judge Roberts has not \nallowed his judicial temperament or ideology to influence his \ndecisionmaking process.\n  This belief was reinforced by Judge Roberts himself in sworn \nstatements he made to the Senate Judiciary Committee. In his opening \nstatement Judge Roberts stated, ``I have no platform.'' He also said, \nthat he would ``confront every case with an open mind . . . And I will \ndecide every case based on the record, according to the rule of law, \nwithout fear or favor, to the best of my ability.'' Near the end of 3 \ndays of testimony Judge Roberts reiterated this view when he said, ``I \nset those personal views aside.''\n  With the information and sworn testimony on the record it is clear \nJudge Roberts has the necessary legal experience and character to be \nthe Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. It also appears that Judge \nRoberts will use the law and the Constitution to make his judicial \ndecisions, not his ideological or personal beliefs. Judge Roberts gave \nthis pledge at the conclusion of his opening remarks, ``I will be \nvigilant to protect the independence and integrity of the Supreme \nCourt, and I will work to ensure that it upholds the rule of law and \nsafeguards those liberties that make this land one of endless \npossibilities for all Americans.'' I trust he will stay true to these \nwords during his tenure as Chief Justice. History will be the judge.\n  Finally, let me acknowledge and thank the Senate Judiciary Committee. \nSenators Specter and Leahy led a dignified, bipartisan and thorough \nhearing on Judge Roberts. For all this hard work they deserve our \nthanks and appreciation.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the nomination of \nJudge John Roberts to become Chief Justice of the United States. If \nconfirmed, which is widely expected, Judge Roberts would be the \nseventeenth Chief Justice in Nation's history. As such, this nomination \nis historically significant, both in its relative rarity and its \npotentially lasting impact on our judiciary. The confirmation process \ntherefore warrants serious, meaningful, and dignified consideration by \nthe Senate. I believe that the Senate has met this responsibility over \nthe past weeks, in spite of the efforts by outside groups and the \nurgings of some members to turn the process into something much \ndifferent. After closely following the confirmation hearings and \ncareful review of the nominee, I strongly support President Bush's \nnomination of Judge Roberts to be the next Chief Justice.\n  Let me first start by saying the obvious, Judge Roberts is an \nincredibly talented and gifted attorney. Armed with a sharp legal mind \nand extensive experience making arguments before the Supreme Court, \nthis man is truly one of the best in a very select group of legal \nsuperstars--namely, the exclusive club of Supreme Court appellate \nspecialists. Judge Roberts has therefore rightfully received broad \npraise from coworkers and from all corners of the legal community. He \nalso is respected by the very Justices whom he may soon be sitting \nalongside, and he has served our Nation ably on the D.C. Circuit Court \nof Appeals. We are all familiar with these facts, and even my \ncolleagues who somehow oppose this nomination have not questioned Judge \nRoberts' intellect or legal skills.\n  Judge Roberts has testified, under oath, about his views regarding \nthe proper constitutional role of a Supreme Court Justice and the \njudiciary branch overall. Consistently and repeatedly, he has said that \nJustices and judges should approach each case with an open mind and \ndecide cases according to the rule of law--and not based on their own \npersonal preferences or policy views. Judge Roberts has testified, \nagain under oath, that he would fully and fairly analyze the legal \narguments that come before the Court. He has made it clear that judges \nare not politicians or legislators, and that he is committed to \nupholding the cherished liberties and rights that are enshrined in our \nconstitution. Roberts also has stated, under oath, that he is mindful \nof precedent, recognizes constitutional protections for the right to \nprivacy, and strongly believes in protecting the judiciary's \nindependence.\n  During 20 hours of oral testimony and after responding to \napproximately 500 questions, Judge Roberts made it clear--consistent \nwith past precedent for other nominees--that he is not going to comment \non unsettled areas of law that may come before the Supreme Court. \nAlthough some outside groups and some of my colleagues chafe at such \ncomments, it is wholly appropriate and, in fact, ethically required to \nprotect the Court's integrity. Moreover, many of these same individuals \nseeking a change in precedent did not complain when previous judicial \nnominees invoked this requirement, such as now Justice Ruth Bader \nGinsburg, whom I supported back in 1993 during her confirmation \nproceedings. But now, sadly, it appears that some of my colleagues want \njudicial nominees, or at least those nominated by President Bush, to \nstart issuing opinions on future cases even before the nominees are \nconfirmed, before the facts of the cases are ascertained, and before \nboth sides present their legal arguments before the Court.\n  This focus on litmus tests and political, even religious, ideology \nduring the confirmation process not only undermines the Supreme Court's \nrole--namely, that of an impartial arbiter of the most important \ncases--but also represents a potentially dangerous evolution in the \nhistory of the confirmation process. Throughout the history of the \nSenate, Supreme Court nominees have not been expected to swear under \noath what their opinions will be on unsettled areas of law. I believe \nthat this is a good thing. If the confirmation process were to become a \nseries of litmus tests and ideological hurdles, the Senate would be \npoliticizing the one branch of government that the Founding Fathers \nintended to be above politics. The men and women who serve on the \nFederal bench would no longer be determined on the basis of their legal \nqualifications and dedication to uphold\n\n[[Page S10575]]\n\nthe rule of law, but mainly based on who wins at the ballot box and on \ncertain hot button issues. Is this what we or the American people want?\n  I am hopeful that the Senate will not go down this path and establish \na precedent that we will someday look back on with regret. Fortunately, \nmost of my colleagues, led by the majority leader, share this same hope \nand have done an admirable job throughout the Senate's review of the \nRoberts nomination. They have stayed true to the Senate's proper role \nunder the Constitution and to what truly matters when confirming a \njudicial nominee. I would never want to come before a court knowing \nthat the judge already has made up his mind based on certain personal \nviews and therefore I will never get a fair hearing. Rather, I want \nsomeone who is bright, considerate of different viewpoints, \nexperienced, and dedicated to upholding the rule of law with the \nConstitution as his guide. In his life, career, and under oath, Judge \nRoberts already has shown that he would be precisely this type of Chief \nJustice. In fact, I cannot recall a judicial nominee in recent memory \nthat lives up to this ideal as much as Judge Roberts. As a result, I am \npleased to support this nomination and applaud President Bush for \nmaking such an outstanding choice.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I had the privilege and honor of meeting \nwith Judge Roberts. I was impressed by his legal scholarship, but \nexpressed a hope that he would be forthright and open with the American \npeople as he progressed through the Senate confirmation process. \nAlthough I must regretfully conclude that there are still questions \noutstanding on Judge Roberts' record, in light of the urgency of \nensuring that our Nation's Supreme Court has its full complement of \nJustices, I agree with my Democratic and Republican colleagues that his \nnomination should be given an up-or-down vote.\n  I have studied the development of the Supreme Court by our Founding \nFathers, and it is apparent to me that our Nation's leaders did not \nwant this group of citizens to be subjected to the political pressures \nof the day, so they provided for lifetime appointments, with no \ntermination date. Further, candidates were not required to be lawyers, \nperhaps as a reminder that legal brilliance alone does not qualify a \nman or woman to sit on the bench of our highest court. Integrity, \ncompassion, and wisdom are also required in equal--or perhaps greater--\nmeasure.\n  Reconciling lifetime appointments with the demands of democratic \nelections, created understandable consternation. After much debate, our \nFounding Fathers provided that the executive and legislative branches \nof our Federal Government would employ every means available to them to \nmake certain that the selection is a wise one, and one that a nation \ncould live with for the lifetime of the judge. Today, we walk again the \ncareful path laid out by the Founding Fathers to ensure for the \nAmerican people that Judge Roberts is a man worthy of their trust.\n  Fully realizing that Judge Roberts will most certainly receive \nsubstantial support from the Senate, I will cast my vote against this \nappointment. I do not object to Judge Roberts' politics, nor do I \nobject to his personal beliefs. Our democracy guarantees him both the \nfreedom to think and speak as he chooses, and the opportunity to ascend \nto any position in our government for which he is qualified.\n  My concerns lie instead with the failure of the Department of Justice \nand the White House to honor the request of members of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee to make available certain documents relating to 16 \ncases Judge Roberts worked on when he served as Principal Deputy \nSolicitor General. These documents, written during Judge Roberts' \ntenure in his most senior executive branch position, are relevant to \nthe Senate's evaluation of his fitness to serve as the Chief Justice of \nthe highest court of this land.\n  I am not suggesting that these documents might contain dark shadows--\nfar from it. The refusal of the White House to allow the American \npeople to see this corner of Judge Roberts' record, however, deviates \nfrom the careful road our Founding Fathers paved for us so many years \nago, and leaves Americans wondering, ``Do those papers hide something I \nshould know?''\n  Many groups have questioned Judge Roberts' position on civil rights. \nHis early writings outline defiance toward review of civil rights \nviolations by Federal courts, and many have asked how his views have \nevolved over the years. As one who has spent his life fighting against \nbaseless prejudice and discrimination, I share these concerns. Would \nthe papers withheld from our sight have answered these questions? We \nwill never know.\n  Throughout my career I have supported a woman's right to choose. I \nhave supported Roe v. Wade. I have also supported stem cell research. \nThe responses Judge Roberts provided when questioned about these issues \ndid not assure me that these questions would be seriously considered. I \nhope I am wrong. Perhaps the papers hidden from our sight would have \nallayed my fears.\n  Similarly, my questions on Judge Roberts' thoughts on the death \npenalty, and habeas corpus review by the Federal courts will never be \nanswered.\n  I am not against the person. As I noted, I am impressed by his legal \nscholarship. Although we seem to differ on the fundamental issues of \nthe day, I respect his right to freely form and hold his own opinions. \nI do, however, object to the failure of the White House, the Department \nof Justice, and ultimately Judge Roberts himself, to make available \ndocuments from his past. The American people deserve a nominee \nunclouded by needless secrecy--and our democratic heritage demands that \nthe President and the Congress work together to confirm the worthiness \nof any man or woman to sit as a Supreme Court Justice. To affirm my \nallegiance to these most American of principles, I will vote, ``no.''\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, after careful consideration, I will \nsupport the nomination of Judge John Roberts to be Chief Justice of the \nSupreme Court.\n  When he was nominated by President Bush in July, it was clear that \nJudge Roberts had the necessary professional qualifications to sit on \nthe Supreme Court. He graduated from Harvard College, summa cum laude, \nin 1976, and received his law degree, magna cum laude, in 1979 from the \nHarvard Law School where he was managing editor of the Harvard Law \nReview.\n  Mr. Roberts clerked for Judge Henry J. Friendly of the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Second Circuit and for then-Associate Justice William \nH. Rehnquist.\n  John Roberts has served his country twice, working for the President. \nFirst, he served as Special Assistant to United States Attorney General \nWilliam French Smith. He returned to government service in the first \nBush administration, serving as Principal Deputy Solicitor General of \nthe United States.\n  As a lawyer, Roberts has presented 39 oral arguments before the \nSupreme Court covering the full range of the Court's jurisdiction, \nincluding admiralty, antitrust, arbitration, environmental law, first \namendment, health care law, Indian law, bankruptcy, tax, regulation of \nfinancial institutions, administrative law, labor law, federal \njurisdiction and procedure, interstate commerce, civil rights, and \ncriminal law.\n  During the hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senators \nextensively probed the judicial philosophy of Judge Roberts. I think \nour colleagues Senator Specter and Senator Leahy did an excellent job \nand conducted a fair and thorough hearing.\n  We do not know how Judge Roberts will rule in many cases. What we do \nknow is that he was nominated by a President who, in the glare of the \nlights of a campaign, clearly indicated the type of Supreme Court \nnominee that he would favor. We also know that Judge Roberts is an \nextraordinarily accomplished man with the right temperament.\n  I have long noted that I believe we must retain an appropriate \nbalance on the Supreme Court. I was pleased that during the hearings, \nJudge Roberts unequivocally acknowledged that the Constitution contains \na right to privacy. He further testified that the right to privacy is \nnot a narrow right. He explained his belief that the right to privacy \nwas sufficiently broad to allow the courts to apply it to changing \ncircumstances. It was important to hear Judge Roberts state that as a \nSupreme Court justice, he would strive to follow precedent in order to \nensure stability in the law.\n\n[[Page S10576]]\n\n  I wish Judge Roberts well as he takes his seat as Chief Justice of \nthe United States Supreme Court.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, 25 years from now most of the events and \npersonalities of September 2005 will have passed into the pages of \nhistory. New Orleans will once again stand proudly as one of America's \nmost vibrant cities; America will have been forced to address our need \nfor energy independence; and the legacies of today's politicians will \nbe the work of tomorrow's history professors. However, the confirmation \nof John Roberts as the 17th Chief Justice of the United States Supreme \nCourt could well be even more significant in 2030 than it is today. The \nRoberts Court will have a profound and historic impact on the \npreservation of liberty for decades to come.\n  I first met John Roberts when we both served in the Reagan \nadministration in the early 1980s. He is a person of enormous \nintelligence, character and judgement. His performance in his Senate \nconfirmation hearings earlier this month transcended television ads, \ninternet blogs, television talking heads, and the million dollar \nindustry that reduces the judicial nominations process to caricatures \nand buzz words across the political spectrum. As many of my colleagues \nhave noted, the Roberts confirmation hearings forced a serious \nexamination of the role of the Supreme Court and the Federal Government \nin our society.\n  My beliefs about the role of Government were shaped and molded when I \nserved on the staff of Nebraska Congressman John Y. McCollister in the \n1970s. I remember him warning America about the wholesale disregard of \nthe 10th Amendment to the Constitution which states:\n\n       The powers not delegated to the United States by the \n     Constitution, nor prohibited to it by the States, are \n     reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\n\n  In the late 1930s and early 1940s, the Supreme Court used Article I, \nSection 8 of the Constitution which gives the Federal Government the \npower to ``regulate commerce,'' as a crowbar to pry open the lid of \nfederalism and more fully insert the Federal Government into the lives \nof the American people. By the 1970s, we saw an expansion of the \nFederal Government's power our Founders could not have imagined.\n  At the same time that Congressman McCollister was invoking the 10th \nAmendment in the House of Representatives, Justice William Rehnquist \nwas frequently the lone voice on the Supreme Court for the discretion \nof States and the integrity of the 10th Amendment. Much has been said \nabout William Rehnquist in the last month. He was a giant of our time. \nAs history considers his legacy, I believe his ability to move the \nCourt back to a responsible position concerning federalism will be his \ngreatest accomplishment. In this, he had a strong ally in Justice \nSandra Day O'Connor.\n  The Founders did not arrive at the 10th Amendment by accident. It was \na necessary compromise in order to get the Constitution ratified. The \nFounders believed that the Constitution must protect the citizens of \nthe United States from the consolidation of the Federal Government's \npower. History has proven them wise. Well meaning politicians never \nhave enough power to do all the good things they believe are essential \nto the Nation's well-being. History shows that the growth of central \ngovernments is no substitute for the ingenuity and energy of individual \ncitizens.\n  It was President Woodrow Wilson who said:\n\n       The history of liberty is a history of the limitation of \n     governmental power, not the increase of it.\n\n  As we work to address 21st century challenges like terrorism, the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and incredible advances in \ntechnology, we will constantly be confronted with the need to balance \nthe expansion of the Federal Government's power with States rights, \nindividual liberties and national security. As we act to secure our \nNation, we must also guard against Federal overreaching. That is why \nmeasures like the sunset provisions in laws like the Patriot Act are so \nimportant.\n  In years to come, Congress will be under great pressure to reach into \nareas of law historically reserved for State and local governments, \nincluding land use, education, economic development, law enforcement \nand contract law, including marriage. A wise and judicious Supreme \nCourt will be as critical as it has ever been to see America through \nthis volatile time.\n  Decades from now, if John Roberts can look back upon a legacy of \nhaving protected the rights of States and individuals while helping \nstrengthen America from within, and constraining the power of the \nFederal Government, then it will be a legacy worthy of succeeding \nWilliam Rehnquist.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nvote to confirm Judge John G. Roberts as the next Chief Justice of the \nUnited States Supreme Court.\n  Before I discuss my reasons for supporting Judge Roberts, however, I \nwould like to make a few remarks about the judicial confirmation \nprocess. Judge Roberts is the first nominee to the Supreme Court since \nI have been a Senator. I have been very pleased with how his nomination \nhas been handled by both the White House and the Judiciary Committee \nand hope that this confirmation process will be a model for future \nconfirmations.\n  I want to compliment the President, and in particular the President's \nCounsel Harriet Miers, for doing an excellent job in reaching out to \nSenators prior to Judge Roberts' nomination. Ms. Miers called me prior \nto Judge Roberts' nomination and asked me what qualities I thought the \nPresident's nominee should possess. Our conversation gave me confidence \nthat the President wanted to work with Senators to make sure that he \nnominated an excellent candidate--which I believe he succeeded in \ndoing. I hope the White House undertakes the same outreach to the \nSenate prior to the President's nomination of the next nominee to the \nSupreme Court.\n  I also want to compliment Senator Specter and Senator Leahy for the \nsuperb job they have done in handling the confirmation hearings for \nJudge Roberts. The hearings were fair and orderly and did not \nsignificantly interfere with the Senate's other business. I was very \npleased that the questioning and debate on Judge Roberts was largely \ndevoid of personal attacks. Indeed, I think the hearings gave the \ncountry an opportunity to see what type of judge and person Judge \nRoberts is. They also gave the country a wonderful lesson in \nconstitutional law. I hope that Judge Roberts' confirmation hearing \nwill serve as a model for future confirmation hearings for nominees to \nthe Supreme Court.\n  Turning now to Judge Roberts' nomination, I believe that Judge \nRoberts is among the finest candidates to the Supreme Court in our \nNation's history. I believe history will look back on the nomination of \nJudge Roberts as one of the most important legacies of the Bush \nadministration.\n  When I spoke with White House Counsel Harriet Miers on the qualities \nI looked for in a Supreme Court nominee, I told her there were two \nqualities I valued most. First, a nominee must have outstanding \nprofessional credentials. Second, a nominee must be committed to the \nrule of law. I am very pleased to say that Judge Roberts is \nextraordinarily qualified on both of these counts.\n  It is difficult to see how Judge Roberts could have more impressive \nprofessional credentials. From his academic record to his Government \nservice to his law practice, Judge Roberts has accumulated a remarkable \nrecord of achievement.\n  As my colleagues have previously noted, he graduated from Harvard \nCollege summa cum laude in 3 years, and graduated from Harvard Law \nSchool magna cum laude, where he served as the managing editor of the \nHarvard Law Review. During his time at Harvard, he was awarded numerous \nacademic accolades, including being inducted into Phi Beta Kappa.\n  He has excellent Government experience, having served as a law clerk \nto then Justice William Rehnquist and in several top positions in the \nReagan and Bush administrations, including as Associate Counsel to \nPresident Reagan and as Principal Deputy Solicitor General for the \nfirst President Bush.\n  Prior to his unanimous confirmation to the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe D.C. Circuit, Judge Roberts was widely regarded as the best Supreme \nCourt litigator in the Nation. Throughout his distinguished career, he \nargued an impressive 39 cases before the Supreme Court.\n\n[[Page S10577]]\n\n  He has now served for 3 years as a judge on the D.C. Circuit, which \nis regarded as among the most important appellate courts in the Nation. \nAs a judge, he has developed a reputation for fairness and producing \nwell-written and well-reasoned opinions.\n  This impressive background has made Judge Roberts well prepared to be \nChief Justice of the Supreme Court. As he displayed during his \nconfirmation hearings, he has an encyclopedic knowledge of the Supreme \nCourt and of constitutional law. Yet, he also has real world experience \nin Government and in how law interacts with the actual day-to-day \noperation of Government. Judge Roberts has the perfect balance of \nacademic and practical experience.\n  Judge Roberts also has an impeccable ethical record. No question has \nbeen raised regarding his integrity or professionalism. On the \ncontrary, the record is full of testimony praising his honesty and \npropriety from friends and former colleagues. Moreover, during his \nconfirmation hearings he properly resisted the temptation to discuss \ncases and legal disputes that could come before him as Chief Justice so \nhe would not bias his consideration of those cases and debates. While \nsome would like to hear how Judge Roberts would decide future cases, it \nis clear that legal ethics prevent him from doing so. Furthermore, \nknowing how a nominee is going to decide future cases is not necessary \nto select good judges. When I was Governor, I appointed scores of \njudges and never--not once--did I ask how they would decide a case. \nInstead, I examined their credentials, reviewed their writings and past \ndecisions and, on several occasions, personally interviewed them.\n  Given his professional achievements and ethical record, it is not \nsurprising that the American Bar Association has given him a unanimous \nwell-qualified rating, its highest rating.\n  I also believe that Judge Roberts has shown a commitment to the rule \nof law. Now, no two people will agree on how to interpret every \nprovision of the Constitution or every statute. I may not agree with \nall of Judge Roberts' future decisions. However, I think that it is \nessential that any nominee displays a conscious commitment to deciding \ncases based on the law rather than on his or her own personal views.\n  During Judge Roberts' confirmation hearings, I was struck by how \ndedicated he is to the law and to correctly applying the law as a \njudge. As he stated during his testimony, ``Judges and Justices are \nservants of the law, not the other way around.'' He also revealed his \ndedication to the law by recognizing that the judiciary has a limited \nrole in our government. This means that judges are, to use Judge \nRoberts' words, ``constrained by the words of the Constitution'' and \n``by the precedents of other judges.'' Judges must interpret the law \nbased on the text of the Constitution or statute, as the case may be, \nand based on precedent, rather than on their own personal beliefs about \nhow the case should be resolved. It is the role of Congress to pass \nlegislation and the role of the courts to apply that legislation to \nparticular cases. I believe Judge Roberts not only understands this \ndistinction, but also will prove to be both a skilled practitioner and \nan eloquent advocate of judicial restraint.\n  Accordingly, I have every confidence that parties who appear before \nJudge Roberts will see a fair and brilliant judge who will decide their \ncase according to the dictates of the law, not his own personal \npreferences.\n  When I initially spoke to Ms. Miers about the qualities I was looking \nfor in a nominee, we were discussing a replacement for Justice \nO'Connor. Now that Judge Roberts has been re-nominated to be Chief \nJustice, I believe that Judge Roberts' management skills are an \nimportant aspect to consider. The Chief Justice is the top \nadministrator of the Federal Courts, so any nominee to Chief Justice \nmust possess management skills. Former Chief Justice Rehnquist was an \nexcellent administrator, so Judge Roberts has some shoes to fill.\n  I had an opportunity to sit down with Judge Roberts, and I asked him \nabout his management experience. We discussed his management \nresponsibilities while he was at his law firm where he helped manage \nthe firm's litigation group. While Judge Roberts has never managed \nanything as large as the Federal court system, our conversation \nconvinced me that he has the management skills necessary to be Chief \nJustice. He clearly has already thought about how he will undertake his \nmanagement responsibilities and what he needs to do in order to \neffectively carry out those responsibilities.\n  Finally, I want to offer some personal observations about Judge \nRoberts. Too often we view executive and judicial nominees through \npolitical or ideological glasses and not as human beings. Nominees \nquickly get labeled as being a ``Republican Nominee'' or a ``Democratic \nNominee'' or as belonging to a particular ``school of thought'' or as \nbeing a follower of a particular thinker or politician. This is \nunfortunate, as each nominee's own personality gets overlooked and we \nfail to see the most important aspect of a nominee. It is, however, a \nnominee's character that can have the biggest impact on his or her \nwork.\n  In Judge Roberts, I believe the Senate has before it not only a \nnominee who has the capability to be a great Chief Justice, but also a \nnominee who is simply a wonderful person. During my meeting with him, I \nwas struck by his gracious manner and humble attitude. He is clearly \nvery smart and engaging, and it is a pleasure to hear him explain \nSupreme Court cases. But, he is also a very open minded person, who \nlistens to others with sincerity and a willingness to hear their views. \nYet what struck me most about him was his humility. For such a \nbrilliant and successful person, I did not detect a hint of arrogance. \nHe is a dedicated family man with a good sense of humor whom I believe \nall Americans will be able to respect and admire.\n  I have been struck by how my regard for Judge Roberts has been echoed \nby so many others, including many whose politics may differ from his. I \nwould like to encourage my colleagues to get a hold of an interview C-\nSPAN recently aired of Professor Richard Lazarus and Patricia Brannan, \ntwo longtime friends of Judge Roberts. Both Professor Lazarus and Ms. \nBrannan are Democrats, but they both expressed the highest respect for \nJudge Roberts and supported his nomination. Now, such testimonials may \nconcern some of my Republican friends, but to me they are further signs \nthat Judge Roberts has the ability to persuade people across the \nspectrum about the importance of judicial restraint.\n  In short, I believe Judge Roberts displays the openmindedness and \nhumility that should serve as the paradigm of judicial temperament for \nmembers of the Federal bench.\n  In reviewing Judge Roberts' impeccable academic and professional \nrecord, his firm commitment to the rule of law, and his strong \ncharacter, I believe that Judge Roberts is a nominee of the highest \ncaliber. Indeed, I wonder if a stronger nominee could be found.\n  I, therefore, urge my colleagues to support the nomination of Judge \nRoberts to be the next Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, the nomination of Judge John Roberts to \nbe Chief Justice of the United States is a matter of tremendous \nconsequence for future generations of Americans. It requires thoughtful \ninquiry and debate, and I commend my colleagues on the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee for their dedication to making sure that all questions were \npresented and that those outside of the Senate had the opportunity to \nmake their voices heard. After serious and careful consideration of the \ncommittee proceedings and Judge Roberts's writings, I believe I must \nvote against his confirmation. I do not believe that the judge has \npresented his views with enough clarity and specificity for me to in \ngood conscience cast a vote on his behalf.\n  The Constitution commands that the Senate provide meaningful advice \nand consent to the President on judicial nominations, and I have an \nobligation to my constituents to make sure that I cast my vote for \nChief Justice of the United States for someone I am convinced will be \nsteadfast in protecting fundamental women's rights, civil rights, \nprivacy rights, and who will respect the appropriate separation of \npowers among the three branches. After the Judiciary hearings, I \nbelieve the record on these matters has been left unclear. That \nuncertainly means as a matter of conscience, I cannot\n\n[[Page S10578]]\n\nvote to confirm despite Judge Roberts's long history of public service.\n  In one memo, for example, Judge Roberts argued that Congress has the \npower to deny the Supreme Court the right to hear appeals from lower \ncourts of constitutional claims involving flag burning, abortion, and \nother matters. He wrote that the United States would be far better off \nwith 50 different interpretations on the right to choose than with what \nhe called the ``judicial excesses embodied in Roe v. Wade.'' The idea \nthat the Supreme Court could be denied the right to rule on \nconstitutional claims had been so long decided that even the most \nconservative of Judge Roberts's Justice Department colleagues strongly \ndisagreed with him.\n  When questioned about his legal memoranda, Judge Roberts claimed they \ndid not necessarily reflect his views and that he was merely making the \nbest possible case for his clients or responding to a superior's \nrequest that he make a particular argument. But he did not clearly \ndisavow the strong and clear views he expressed, but only shrouded them \nin further mystery. Was he just being an advocate for a client or was \nhe using his position to advocate for positions he believed in? The \nrecord is unclear.\n  It is hard to believe he has no opinion on so many critical issues \nafter years as a Justice Department and White House lawyer, appellate \nadvocate and judge. His supporters remind us that Chief Justice \nRehnquist supported the constitutionality of legal segregation before \nhis elevation to the high court but never sought to bring it back while \nserving the court system as its Chief Justice. But I would also remind \nthem of Justice Thomas's assertion in his confirmation hearing that he \nhad never even discussed Roe v. Wade, much less formed an opinion on \nit. Shortly after he ascended to the Court, Justice Thomas made it \nclear that he wanted to repeal Roe.\n  Adding to testimony that clouded more than clarified is that we in \nthe Senate have been denied the full record of Judge Roberts's writings \ndespite our repeated requests. Combined, these two events have left a \nquestion mark on what Judge Roberts's views are and how he might rule \non critical questions of the day. It is telling that President Bush has \nsaid the Justices he most admires are the two most conservative \nJustices, Justices Thomas and Scalia. It is not unreasonable to believe \nthat the President has picked someone in Judge Roberts whom he believes \nholds a similarly conservative philosophy, and that voting as a bloc \nthey could further limit the power of the Congress, expand the purview \nof the Executive, and overturn key rulings like Roe v. Wade.\n  Since I expect Judge Roberts to be confirmed, I hope that my concerns \nare unfounded and that he will be the kind of judge he said he would be \nduring his confirmation hearing. If so, I will be the first to \nacknowledge it. However, because I think he is far more likely to vote \nthe views he expressed in his legal writings, I cannot give my consent \nto his confirmation and will, therefore, vote against his confirmation. \nMy desire to maintain the already fragile Supreme Court majority for \ncivil rights, voting rights and women's rights outweigh the respect I \nhave for Judge Roberts's intellect, character, and legal skills.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this Thursday the Senate will have the \nopportunity to vote on the nomination of Judge John Roberts to be Chief \nJustice of the United States. Few decisions made by this body are as \nconsequential as this one. If Judge Roberts is confirmed by the \nSenate--and I believe he will be confirmed--he will be the youngest \nChief Justice in more than 200 years. With the blessing of a long \ntenure on the Court, his influence as Chief Justice will not just \naffect us and our children but also several generations to come.\n  In nominating Judge Roberts, the President clearly was mindful of the \nserious and lasting nature of the vote before us. He respected the \nSenate's advice and consent role and engaged in a thorough, deliberate, \nand fair nomination process. The President and his staff consulted with \nmore than 70 Members of the Senate, and the President reviewed the \ncredentials of many well-qualified candidates. The President also met \npersonally with a number of potential nominees. I believe that this is \nthe process envisioned by the so-called Gang of 14, and that it \nresulted in an excellent nominee.\n  Judge Roberts has impeccable legal credentials and a strong \nreputation and record as a fair- and sharp-minded lawyer and jurist. \nThe American Bar Association and many others of all political stripes \nagree that his distinguished career as a lawyer and a jurist makes him \nvery well qualified for the position of Chief Justice. Indeed, some \nobservers have pointed out that if one were to imagine the perfect \ntraining to be a Supreme Court Justice, Judge Roberts's career would be \nthe model. I could not agree more.\n  As an appellate judge, Judge Roberts has built a record of measure, \ncontrol, and fair-mindedness--all crucial characteristics for a member \nof our Nation's highest court.\n  Prior to his tenure as a Federal judge, John Roberts was a widely \nrespected appellate lawyer. The Washington Post recently characterized \nhim as ``among the country's best-regarded appellate lawyers, both in \nprivate practice and as deputy solicitor general during the \nadministration of George H.W. Bush.''\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee has engaged in an extensive review of \nJudge Roberts' record. During his nomination hearings, the judge \nacquitted himself with dignity and honesty, answering directly \nquestions that he believed he could address without hindering his \nability to carry out his functions on the Supreme Court or in his \ncurrent position on the DC Court of Appeals. The editorial board of the \nSan Francisco Chronicle wrote some days ago that Judge Roberts ``passed \nthe key tests before the Senate Judiciary Committee. His command of the \nlaw is impressive. He carries no trace of ethical taint. His ability to \nstay calm and on point in the face of exhaustive questioning from a \npanel of highly inquisitive--and occasionally posturing--U.S. senators \nwas indicative of judicial temperament.''\n  The committee has voted to recommend that the full Senate confirm \nJudge Roberts as the Chief Justice of the United States. Several \nDemocratic members of the committee joined in that recommendation, and \nrightly so--this nominee's exceptional credentials and temperament \nshould place him well above the fray of partisanship.\n  I agree wholeheartedly with the nomination of the President and the \nrecommendation of the Judiciary Committee. I will vote for John \nRoberts, a man who has proven to be an extraordinarily talented lawyer \nand judge who approaches the law with modesty and a deep respect for \nthe Constitution and our Nation's laws.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/28/senate-section/article/S10578-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10578-S10579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                EMERGENCY HEALTH CARE RELIEF ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am in the Senate to mention that there \nis ongoing discussions between the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Committee on Finance, and a number of \nMembers who have been concerned about S. 1716, the Emergency Health \nCare Relief Act of 2005. I fully support the desire of the Senator and \nmembers of the Committee on Finance to provide health care relief for \nthe victims of Hurricane Katrina. We have noted that it has about a $9 \nbillion price tag, and we have been in ongoing discussions which I \nbelieve will bear fruit with the Senator from Iowa.\n  It is important to know that the administration also objects to S. \n1716, and I ask unanimous consent the letter from Secretary Leavitt be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           The Secretary of Health\n\n\n                                           and Human Services,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 27, 2005.\n     Hon. William H. Frist,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Frist: I am writing to express the views of \n     the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) with \n     respect to S. 1716, the ``Emergency Health Care Relief Act of \n     2005''.\n       We understand and appreciate that the intent of S. 1716 is \n     to help provide, in the most timely manner possible, \n     emergency health care relief to the victims of Hurricane \n     Katrina. The Department is strongly committed to this same \n     objective, and we have\n\n[[Page S10579]]\n\n     engaged in our utmost efforts to furnish such relief directly \n     to Katrina victims as well as to support State efforts to \n     provide emergency health care and related services (see \n     addendum below). We believe these ongoing efforts largely \n     preclude the need for the activities proposed under S. 1716. \n     Moreover, we have serious concerns with S. 1716, as \n     enunciated below.\n       In addition, the bill spends significant amounts on \n     adjustments to the Medicaid FMAP (Federal medical assistance \n     percentage) for individuals who are not survivors of \n     Hurricane Katrina. We think this is inadvisable and that \n     resources should be targeted to services for these survivors.\n\n\n                 Title I--Emergency Health Care Relief\n\n       Title I of S. 1716 establishes a new Disaster Relief \n     Medicaid (DRM) program for survivors of Hurricane Katrina. \n     Survivors of the hurricane would be entitled to five months \n     of Medicaid coverage, and the President is given the option \n     to extend the program for another five months. Individuals \n     who were previously receiving Medicaid before the hurricane \n     are deemed eligible for this assistance. In addition DRM \n     eligibility is also available to pregnant women and children \n     with incomes up to 200% FPL, disabled individuals up to 300% \n     SSI, and other individuals with incomes up to 100% FPL. As a \n     result, a new eligibility category for childless adults is \n     established. There are no resource or residency requirements \n     for DRM. DRM recipients will receive the benefits package \n     available to categorically needy beneficiaries under the \n     Medicaid state plan. States may also provide extended mental \n     health benefits and coordination benefits to DRM eligibles, \n     which are not limited to conditions directly resulting from \n     the hurricane.\n       The legislation requires a new Medicaid entitlement for \n     Katrina survivors, regardless of whether that will work best \n     for those survivors or the states. This new program is \n     unnecessary. CMS is already acting to meet the health care \n     needs of hurricane survivors through the establishment of a \n     new Medicaid/State Children's Health Insurance Program \n     (SCHIP) waiver program that builds upon existing Medicaid/\n     SCRIP eligibility and other program rules to provide \n     immediate, comprehensive relief without the need for \n     congressional action. This waiver program allows individuals \n     who otherwise would be eligible for Medicaid in their home \n     states to receive 5 months of temporary eligibility without \n     going through a complex and burdensome application process. \n     Texas, Alabama, Florida, and Mississippi now have these \n     programs in place, and more states with significant numbers \n     of evacuees are very close to establishing similar programs. \n     With this new waiver program, we are providing relief \n     quickly, rather than waiting to implement an unprecedented \n     new federal program as envisioned by S. 1716.\n       The bill (section 108) also establishes a massive new \n     Federal program which would be administered by the Secretary \n     of HHS, rather than states. The fund would provide $800 \n     million for direct payments to Medicaid providers to offset \n     their costs incurred as a result of Hurricane Katrina, and \n     for payments to state insurance commissioners for health \n     insurance premiums for individuals otherwise eligible for \n     DRM. Again, S. 1716 is duplicating efforts which are well \n     underway at CMS through the uncompensated care pools \n     referenced in the new waiver program The Federal \n     uncompensated care fund envisioned by S. 1716 would create \n     uncertainty and delay progress being made right now. To make \n     the system envisioned by the bill work, CMS would have to \n     develop a brand new Federal system with new forms and \n     applications, eligibility criteria, program requirements, \n     criteria for reviewing applications and determining payment \n     amounts, as well as other rules and procedures. Providers \n     would need to learn this new system and provide new kinds of \n     documentation. It is far more expeditious to use existing \n     state systems.\n       We believe states are better equipped than the Federal \n     Government to work directly with local providers to solve the \n     problems of uncompensated care. The state-based uncompensated \n     care pool in the CMS waiver will pay providers more quickly \n     through the existing state payment systems without \n     establishing a new bureaucratic process. It will also allow \n     for care in settings and from providers that do not usually \n     participate in Medicaid, enabling evacuees to get the best \n     care and the providers in the state to deliver it as \n     effectively as possible. The waiver program also allows for \n     new interactions with expanded community-based health care \n     centers, mobile units for providing basic care at convenient \n     locations for evacuees, and new referral networks. The pool \n     will permit states to pay for additional services needed by \n     evacuees, such as additional mental health services, that are \n     not generally covered by Medicaid.\n       While we prefer the state-based uncompensated care pool \n     referenced in the CMS waiver, we look forward to working with \n     the committee to ensure care to evacuees and solve the \n     problems of uncompensated care.\n       We believe that S. 1716 does not appropriately target \n     spending to the true victims of Hurricane Katrina. Section \n     103 spends $4 billion on a 100% FMAP rate for services (and \n     related administrative activities) provided from August 28, \n     2005 through December 31, 2006 under the State Medicaid or \n     SCHIP plan to any individual residing in a major disaster \n     parish or county, regardless of whether the individual was \n     affected by Hurricane Katrina. Section 108 spends almost $700 \n     million for 29 states, most of which were not affected by the \n     hurricane, by preventing a drop in the FMAP for Medicaid that \n     otherwise would have occurred on October 1. We believe that \n     these provisions are inadvisable and that federal resources \n     should be targeted to meeting the needs of those harmed by \n     Hurricane Katrina.\n       In addition, S. 1716 includes several provisions that \n     affect the timely implementation of the new Medicare Part D \n     program. We do not support any changes to the Medicare Part D \n     program. We note that under S. 1716, DRM dual eligibles are \n     excluded from the low-income subsidy program. We think it \n     would be far more advantageous to ensure that dual eligibles \n     are timely enrolled in a Part D plan so that they receive the \n     low-cost drug coverage available to them under the new \n     Medicare drug benefit.\n\n\n                         Title II--TANF Relief\n\n       Under title II, S. 1716 would also make a number of \n     adjustments to P.L. 109-68 the ``TANF Emergency Response and \n     Recovery Act of 2005,'' which was signed into law on \n     September 21. For the most part, these adjustments would be \n     unnecessary and would complicate State administration of \n     Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) benefits in \n     the wake of Hurricane Katrina.\n       HHS believes that the existing administrative authority \n     under the TANF program under title IV-A of the Social \n     Security Act (as extended through December 31, 2005 by P.L. \n     109-68 and several earlier temporary extensions), coupled \n     with the special hurricane-related provisions of the new law, \n     has given States the ability to be responsive to the most \n     significant issues confronting them as a result of Hurricane \n     Katrina. We provided early administrative guidance reminding \n     States of their flexibility to amend their TANF plans to meet \n     the special circumstances of the hurricane aftermath such as \n     adjusting State plans, streamlining the eligibility process, \n     making residency optional, and using in-kind and non-Federal \n     cash expenditures to meet the maintenance of effort \n     requirements.\n       In addition to this program flexibility, which continues \n     under title IV-A (as so extended), P.L. 109-68 also provides \n     special flexibility for TANF in areas such as the contingency \n     fund, loan program, and penalty waivers.\n       We are especially concerned about the dual contingency fund \n     provisions in S. 1716, under which a State may be reimbursed \n     from the contingency fund if it qualifies as a ``needy \n     State'' based on Hurricane Katrina-related criteria, while \n     still remaining eligible to receive reimbursement from the \n     fund if it meets the current law definition of a ``needy \n     State'' (based on certain Food Stamp and unemployment-related \n     criteria).\n       We are advised by the Office of Management and Budget that \n     there is no objection to the submission of this letter to the \n     Congress from the standpoint of the Administration's program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Michael O. Leavitt.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I say again to my friend from Iowa, I think he does a \ntremendous job as chairman of our Committee on Finance. He continues to \ndistinguish himself in that role. But I do believe--and we had, I \nthink, a very productive meeting with the Senator from New Hampshire, \nMr. Sununu, and Senator Lott, who, obviously, has a very deep and \nabiding interest in this situation, as well as the Senator from Iowa. I \nhope we can work out the objections that the administration has, as \nwell as the concerns that others of us have on this issue.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from Iowa for his diligent efforts in \ntrying to get this legislation done and, at the same time, satisfy the \nconcerns of many who are concerned about the scope of it, as well as \nhis efforts to attempt to satisfy the concerns of the administration.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/28/senate-section/article/S10579-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10579-S10582]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 1716\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I come to the floor once again to insist \nthat the Senate act on the emergency health care needs of Katrina \nvictims. They need help. They need help now--not tomorrow, not the next \nday, now. The Senate must pass the Katrina health package that Chairman \nGrassley and I put together. Why? Obviously, to help the victims of \nKatrina. That is why. They need the help now.\n\n[[Page S10580]]\n\n  I might say, Senator Grassley and I have worked for weeks on this \nlegislation. It has been 4 weeks since Katrina hit--4 weeks.\n  Now, some suggest the administration was slow to respond, that FEMA \nwas slow to respond, that FEMA was inadequate in responding. We have \nheard these complaints. A lot of them are accurate.\n  Where is the Senate? Where is the Congress? Where? I ask Senators, \nwhere is the Senate? Where is the Congress? I will tell you where. We \nare poised to pass legislation, but the same people and the same \npolitical party that were slow with respect to FEMA and the \nadministration are now here today slowing down and stopping this \nlegislation from passing. The same group. The same group. I cannot \nbelieve it. I cannot understand it.\n  This legislation has very broad support. It has the support of \nSenator Grassley, the chairman of the Finance Committee, the Republican \nchairman of the Finance Committee, who, I might say, is a very good \nman. He is a good man. He cares. He puts people above politics. He puts \nthe needs of the Katrina victims above politics. He wants to do the \nright thing. And I very heartily and soundly congratulate him. He has \ndone such a wonderful job.\n  We have also consulted for weeks with the Senators from the States \naffected, working out the details of this legislation, crossing the \nT's, dotting the I's, making changes to make sure it works right. We \nhave consulted with the Senators from the States affected, who are from \nboth political parties. They want this legislation. They are from both \npolitical parties, and they want it.\n  We spent a lot of time working on this--a lot of time. We have done \nthe right thing. We made changes, as Senators suggested. We are trying \nto make it balanced, trying to make it fair, trying to make it respond \nto the needs of the people in Louisiana, Alabama, Texas--the States \naffected. We have tried our very best to do this right.\n  I might repeat, not only the Senators of the States want this \nlegislation, but the Governors of the States want this legislation. If \nwe want to get to labels here, two of those Governors are Republicans. \nToday, publicly, I asked the question and Senator Grassley, the \nchairman, asked the question: Governors, what do you think of this \nlegislation? Yes, they want it, they want it now.\n  Ask Governor Blanco of Louisiana. They know the needs. They are \nthere. They know the stakes. They are the Governors. They want this \nlegislation passed now.\n  Governor Riley of Alabama, he wants it now. Governor Barbour of \nMississippi, he wants this legislation passed now. Governor Blanco of \nLouisiana, she would certainly like it passed now.\n  I might say, too, this is a compromise. There are Senators here who \nwould like to offer more sweeping legislation and try to get that \nlegislation up for a vote. I daresay, if that legislation were up for a \nvote, it would pass by a very large margin.\n  But there are Senators here who do not want to vote. They do not want \nto vote on that legislation. They do not want to vote on it. They do \nnot want to vote on it. What is my evidence of that? Many times I have \nasked unanimous consent to bring up this legislation. Many times the \nchairman of the committee has asked to bring up this legislation. And \nwe get objections from the other side of the aisle. We get objections \nfrom the other side of the aisle. Oh, it costs too much, I heard. That \nis one complaint.\n  I do not know. This legislation is temporary. It is only for several \nmonths. It is only basically until the end of the year. It is basically \nto help people get health care under Medicaid, to get health care now.\n  There are countless examples of people who cannot get health care \ntoday, victims of Katrina who cannot get health care today. Why in the \nworld is the Senate, controlled by the same party as the White House, \nsaying no? Oh, we hear: We want a compromise. Let me tell you this. \nWhat is the compromise I heard? The compromise I heard is: Take it all \nout of the $65 billion appropriated for Katrina. Take it out of that. \nThat is what I have heard.\n  Can you believe that? Can you believe that? They say some of that \nmoney has been misspent. So people who need health care shouldn't get \nthe dollars? They shouldn't get support? They shouldn't get their \nhealth care because some of the FEMA dollars might have been misspent? \nGive me a break. Give me a break.\n  What is going on here? What, in fact, is going on here? I don't \nunderstand it. I thought we were Senators. I thought we were elected to \ndo the right thing, to rise up and help people who need help, \nparticularly immediately. Sure, we should scrub this stuff and look at \nit closely. And we have. We have. Senator Grassley and I have. Our \nstaffs have--very closely. We have tailored this down and cut it back \ndown compared to what other Senators in the body want passed, some of \nthe Senators in the committee wanted passed. We said: Oh, no, no, we \nare not going to go that far. We will take this a step at a time. We \nwill pass limited legislation, only until the end of this year.\n  These provisions, the Medicaid provisions, the FMAP provisions, the \neligibility requirements only apply for several months, to the end of \nthis year. Then they stop.\n  Let me tell you, we met today, the Finance Committee, with experts--\none was George Yin, head of the Joint Tax Committee staff--trying to \nlearn some lessons from New York that might be applied in this case. He \nmade a very interesting point to us. He said: You must know, Senators, \nit is very hard to know the effectiveness of tax breaks because we \ndon't have a lot of evidence. He also said something else. He said: \nBecause these are of a short duration, the ones proposed in this bill, \nthey probably will not be utilized very much because people don't know \nabout them. People don't know they are there. It is hard to get the \nword out.\n  So those Senators should not be too concerned this bill will be ``too \nexpensive.'' If they are concerned about fraud, FEMA fraud, if they are \nconcerned about waste, if they are concerned about money not being \nproperly spent under FEMA, and so forth, I suggest when the next \nappropriations bill comes up to spend more money at FEMA, to give more \ncash, that is the proper place to look at any potential waste, any \nproblems, if any, that occur under FEMA. I don't know what occurs and \ndoes not occur, but the Senators I have heard don't want this bill \npassed because they say: Oh, it is wasteful. FEMA wasted money. If that \nis the case, don't take it out of the hides of poor people who need \nhelp. You take it out of the hide of FEMA. You take it out of the hide \nof additional appropriations.\n  I heard something else here tonight. I have heard the administration \nis opposed to this legislation. They quietly kind of are. I don't think \nthey want to admit it. They sent this letter that the Senator from \nArizona put in the Record. They say: Well, maybe we can do it with \nwaivers. Maybe we can do it a little bit better. Come on. That is not \ngoing to work. Why isn't it going to work? It is not going to work \nbecause this waiver process is so vague, it is so amorphous. Nobody \nknows what it is. Nobody knows when it might go into effect.\n  Let me give you an example of that. Today at the Finance Committee \nhearing, I raised the question: Governor Barbour, Governor Riley, \nGovernor Blanco, what about waivers?\n  Governor Barbour did not know anything about it. This is 4 weeks \nsince Katrina. He said: I have to plead ignorance. I don't know. You \nwould think if this waiver process is going into effect a little bit, \nif there has been discussion between the administration and some of \nthese States, you would think the Governor of Mississippi, if this \nwaiver program is worth anything, would know about it. No, he did not \nknow anything about it. He wants this legislation passed.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter Senator \nGrassley and I wrote back to Secretary Leavitt in response to that \nWhite House letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                         Committee on Finance,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 27, 2005.\n     Hon. Michael O. Leavitt,\n     Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: The aftermath of Hurricane Katrina has \n     left hundreds of thousands of Americans displaced and in need \n     of\n\n[[Page S10581]]\n\n     assistance. We want to, first and foremost, thank you for \n     your assistance with Katrina relief. We share the goal of \n     addressing the immediate health care needs of people affected \n     by this disaster.\n       We have, however, chosen different paths for achieving our \n     shared goal. We have introduced and sought to pass the \n     Emergency Health Care Relief Act, S. 1716, which would \n     provide immediate coverage for a temporary period for \n     Americans displaced by Hurricane Katrina, directly assist the \n     states of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama, and provide a \n     means for survivors to retain private health insurance \n     coverage. We believe that this program can be very quickly \n     and efficiently implemented by the Department. We have noted \n     your opposition to our bill and are puzzled at how you expect \n     to achieve our shared goal through the Department's waiver \n     process. Specifically, we would raise the following \n     questions:\n       1. After the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York City, \n     the Department quickly approved a waiver to provide Medicaid \n     coverage for New Yorkers, even those not normally eligible \n     for Medicaid, for a temporary basis. While you refer to the \n     coverage provided through the waiver program as \n     ``comprehensive relief,'' the waiver in Texas does not \n     provide for the same eligibility for Katrina evacuees as was \n     provided through the New York waiver. Could you please \n     explain to us why the Katrina evacuees do not deserve the \n     same assistance provided the people of New York.\n       2. Your waiver process appears to contemplate having those \n     Katrina evacuees without health care coverage covered by an \n     uncompromised care fund. Providers will provide charity care \n     and then seek reimbursement from the uncompensated care fund. \n     This raises numerous questions for us. First, how does the \n     Department believe it has the statutory authority to provide \n     funding for this uncompensated care fund when we believe it \n     is fairly obvious the Department does not have statutory \n     authority to do so? Second, it is unclear to us how much \n     money will be needed for the uncompensated care fund for \n     Texas and all other host states. How much money does the \n     Department anticipate needing for the fund? Finally, the \n     Medicaid program has known costs, payment rates and \n     control systems, which is why we sought to use the \n     Medicaid program for the temporary assistance program. How \n     does the Department plan to control expenditures for the \n     uncompensated care fund to protect against fraud and \n     abuse? What accountability measures will apply to these \n     new funds?\n       3. The states of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama have \n     suffered tremendous devastation that will drastically affect \n     their ability to meet state obligations, including their \n     share of Medicaid. The Department's waiver process simply \n     bills claims for Katrina evacuees in Texas (and other host \n     states) back to Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. When the \n     bill comes due for those claims we would anticipate that the \n     Department is going to expect payment since the Department \n     does not have the statutory authority to waive those \n     payments. Will the Department be seeking a statutory response \n     or does the Department believe that the affected states do \n     not need assistance? If the Department does support relieving \n     Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama of some portion of the \n     state share requirement, what is your projection for the cost \n     of the assistance you might provide those states? New York \n     provided disaster relief Medicaid after September 11, with \n     the hope that their state match costs would be paid for \n     through FEMA grants, but they are still appealing FEMA's \n     denial of payment and have not received any funds. What \n     assurances can you give states that they will not find \n     themselves in similar circumstances?\n       4. We believe that allowing individuals to preserve their \n     private insurance coverage is an important principle. The \n     bill that you oppose, the Emergency Health Care Relief Act, \n     provides for Disaster Relief Fund so that people may keep \n     private coverage. Your waiver process does not appear to \n     provide for assistance to people wishing to keep private \n     coverage except perhaps through the uncompensated care fund \n     which we have already established has no money. Do you oppose \n     preserving private coverage for Katrina survivors?\n       5. We believe that the welfare provisions of S. 1716 are \n     very important. Though H.R. 3672 the TANF Emergency Response \n     and Recovery Act of 2005 (Public Law 109-68) makes some \n     modest progress towards getting states the help they need to \n     provide vital support services to evacuees and those in the \n     directly impacted states, we remain concerned that P.L. 109-\n     68 falls short in several ways. Working in close conjunction \n     with members from the directly affected states, the Senate \n     bill makes a number of improvements to P.L. 109-68. P.L. 109-\n     68 limits assistance to non-recurrent short-term cash \n     benefits S. 1716 allows funding to be available for any \n     allowable TANF expenditure. We understand that states would \n     like the flexibility to use these funds to provide non-cash \n     services such as employment readiness and job training for a \n     period of time that is not limited to four months. Do you \n     agree that it is appropriate to give states the greatest \n     amount of flexibility to serve the broad needs of these \n     families? Additionally, the Senate bill lifts the ``cap'' on \n     the Contingency Fund which would direct additional resources \n     to states that are providing services to Katrina survivors. \n     Do you agree that states should be confident that they will \n     be reimbursed for the costs of helping these families?\n       6. We note that in your letter, you took special exception \n     to the provision in Title II--TANF RELIEF that would allow \n     states, such as Tennessee, that are currently drawing down \n     Contingency Funds in order to meet the needs of their \n     existing caseload to also qualify for the Contingency Fund in \n     order to meet the needs of evacuees. Are we to infer from \n     your letter that states like Tennessee should be prohibited \n     from accessing the Contingency Fund to provide services to \n     evacuees simply because of a dire state fiscal condition that \n     made them eligible for the Contingency Fund under existing \n     law?\n       We would also like to bring to your attention certain \n     provisions of our bill that we would be surprised to find the \n     Department opposes.\n       The bill provides the Secretary with the authority and \n     funding to assist providers whose ability to stay in business \n     has been jeopardized. We consider it critical that hospitals, \n     physician practices and other providers get immediate \n     assistance so that they may continue to function. If the \n     doors close on a hospital, it makes rebuilding that community \n     that much more difficult. We hope you would agree.\n       2. The bill provides additional assistance for people who \n     have lost their job through extensions of unemployment \n     insurance. We feel that it is appropriate and necessary.\n       3. The bill provides additional funding for the Office of \n     the Inspector General to ensure that relief funds are \n     appropriately spent. We certainly hope you approve of that \n     provision.\n       4. The bill protects the taxpayer by reducing the micro-\n     purchase threshold which limits purchases made outside of \n     existing federal procurement laws. These purchases are \n     commonly made through the use of government credit cards, a \n     medium which has a history of fraud, waste and abuse of \n     taxpayer dollars. The micro-purchase limits were capped by \n     law at $2,500 with an emergency limit of $15,000 domestically \n     and $25,000 abroad. These limits were drastically raised to \n     $250,000. While we understand the need for increased credit \n     limits to help deal with a disaster of Katrina's magnitude, \n     any increase should address the problem at hand, not create \n     new ones.\n       We truly believe that we have similar interests in \n     assisting people displaced by this disaster. While we are \n     troubled that you have chosen to oppose our effort, we will \n     continue to work with you to meet our common goal. In that \n     spirit, we respectfully request that you respond to the \n     questions by this Friday, September 30, so that we may better \n     understand how you intend to proceed.\n           Sincerely,\n     Charles E. Grassley.\n     Max Baucus.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That letter points out the glaring defects of the waiver \nprocess the administration talks about.\n  First, the Government is amorphous, as I said. Second, the waiver \nkind of promises money to hospitals for uncompensated care. It does not \nsay how it is going to happen. It is very unclear. It is very \namorphous.\n  I might say, at that point, for 9/11 FEMA was billed for several \nitems, and FEMA did not pay for it. In this case the administration, in \nthe waiver process, says, well, there might be some money for hospitals \nfor all the uncompensated care they have provided. It is a promise. Who \nknows if it is empty or not empty. There are no dollars behind it.\n  We have dollars in our legislation. It is $800 million. It goes for \nuncompensated care to hospitals. You talk to the administrators of the \nhospitals in these areas--Louisiana, New Orleans; other States, \nArkansas, Texas--that are overwhelmed--and most of this is \nuncompensated care--they need help. We are providing it in this bill, \n$800 million.\n  We also provide help for people who need care, who do not have health \ninsurance, who live up to 100 percent of poverty. They are not wealthy \npeople: only up to 100 percent of poverty, and 200 percent of poverty \nfor mothers who have children, pregnant women and children. That is not \nvery much. But no, we cannot pass that. Senators say that is too much. \nThat might be wasteful.\n  I don't get it. I don't get it. It reminds me of when I graduated \nfrom high school. This fellow sent me a congratulation card for \ngraduating from high school. He said basically: Congratulations, and \nall this stuff. He said: Best of luck in those interstitial spaces when \nyour brain runs against headlong perversity. This is one of those \ninterstitial spaces in the sense that I don't get it. I can't fathom \nwhy people would not want to get this passed.\n  We can go to conference. We can modify this bill in conference if \nthere are real problems. That is what we do around here. If something \nis not perfect--nothing is ever perfect--you don't let perfection be \nthe enemy of the good\n\n[[Page S10582]]\n\naround here. We go to conference. By that time, little wrinkles crop \nup, little problems. We take care of them in conference. No, we can't \ndo that. We can't even pass the legislation. Some Senators say: No, we \ncan't pass it. Wrong. Take it out of FEMA. It won't work. For the life \nof me, I don't understand why we are here.\n  One small example, not so small for Tina. Who is Tina? Tina Eagerton \nis a lady who fled Louisiana 7 months pregnant but could not find a \nFlorida doctor who would accept her Louisiana Medicaid card, wouldn't \ndo it. With this legislation, Tina can get some help.\n  I can talk about Rosalind Breaux, who has colon cancer and was \nscheduled for her third round of chemotherapy on August 31, the day \nafter the flooding began. Her husband has lost his job. There is no \nhealth insurance. Rosalind is in a real bind.\n  I mentioned the letter the administration has sent. The Senator from \nArizona has mentioned that letter. I also mentioned the letter we sent \nin response, the chairman of the committee, Senator Grassley, and I. \nThat letter from the administration says the administration claims it \ncan provide relief without the need for congressional action. It can't. \nI must also say they do not have the authority. They do not have the \nauthority to provide additional appropriations. That takes an act of \nCongress. They say, apparently, by implication, they do not need any \ndollars. That is the implication of that process. They don't \nappropriate dollars. It is against the law. We have to do that. They do \nnot want us to do it.\n  The waivers, I might say, also limit eligibility for Medicaid \ncoverage to only those groups of people traditionally eligible for \nMedicaid. Adults without children, no matter how poor they are, or how \nmuch they need health care, would not be covered under the \nadministration's waiver policy suggested by the letter the Senator from \nArizona mentioned.\n  The woman with diabetes would not be covered. She would not be \ncovered. Diabetes is a very time-sensitive illness. Limiting access to \nbenefits in the waiver would mean leaving tens of thousands of Katrina \nvictims without aid.\n  After Katrina, Louisiana dispatched Medicaid eligibility workers to \nmore than 200 shelters to enroll evacuees in Medicaid. Of the 4,000 \npotentially eligible families screened in these shelters, more than 1 \nin 5 were screened out as ineligible. They did not meet Louisiana's \ntraditional eligibility rules--1 out of 5. No help there. One out of \nfive: You do not meet the traditional screening test.\n  Our legislation would address that. One out of every three people who \nhave applied for Medicaid in Louisiana following Katrina have been \ndenied coverage. Let me repeat that. One out of every three people who \napplied for Medicaid in Louisiana following Katrina have been denied \ncoverage. The waiver process is not going to help that out because the \neligibility requirements are not raised. Most of these people are \ndenied because they don't meet the eligibility criteria.\n  Adult Katrina survivors need access to health care. A recent study of \nKatrina evacuees in Houston shelters found that most of the adult \nevacuees without children were uninsured. Among those, more than 40 \npercent reported having a chronic condition. A third reported having \ntrouble getting the prescription drugs they need. I can't believe it. \nWhat is going on here?\n  Differentiating among individuals during this time of need is not \nright. This isn't legislation that is usual; this is an emergency. \nPeople need health care right now. Katrina did not differentiate. \nKatrina hit all the residents of the gulf hard. We should not \ndifferentiate in our efforts to help those in need.\n  The second key difference between the administration's policy and \nwhat our bill does is the funds provided to defray the cost of \nuncompensated care that thousands of health care providers across our \nNation are giving to Katrina survivors. I have already mentioned that. \nLet me repeat that point. The administration has said it will provide \nan uncompensated care fund. But the administration, in this waiver \nletter referred to on the floor a few minutes ago, has not given any \nfurther information about how much would be provided, not one iota, \nwhether it be $1 or zero dollars. The administration has not even given \ninformation about how it will be spent.\n  By contrast, the Grassley-Baucus bill includes an uncompensated care \nfund of up to $800 million to be spent on compensating those health \ncare providers--that is, hospitals--who have seen a dramatic increase \nor drop in their patient load as a result of Katrina. The \nadministration promises, but under our bill, there would be no doubt. \nWe would be there. It is not words but deeds. The administration is \nwords. Our legislation is deeds. It is getting it done.\n  Third, our bill provides 100 percent Federal funding for all evacuees \ncovered under Medicaid, wherever they are, and for the affected States. \nBy contrast, the administration's waiver policy promises to make States \nwhole. What does that mean? I have serious questions about how they can \ndeliver on that without legislation, because it is unclear that the \nadministration could, under its current statutory authority, provide \nthese additional funds to States. I referred to that earlier. I don't \nthink they have the legal authority to provide additional funds. I have \nno doubt they intend to do so. I am sure they do. Why wouldn't they? I \njust do not believe they have the legal authority to do so. So why \nshould we get involved in this legal morass--do they have the \nauthority; do they not have the authority? Are we going to sit down and \nargue about this, while the people need health care? I don't get it.\n  At the same time the administration has asked for the three most \naffected States to sign a memorandum of understanding making them \nfinancially responsible for paying the cost of evacuees' care in other \nStates. Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama need our help, not more bills \nto pay--not now. We could straighten that out later.\n  It is an outrage that a small number of willful Senators continue to \nstall this bill. Hurricane Katrina's health costs continue to spill in \nwaves across the gulf coast region. Victims continue to suffer without \nproper medical care. Our bill will restore immediate access to basic \nhealth care. Our bill would relieve the financial burden health care \nproviders have shouldered. We must act. Thus, at the appropriate time, \nI intend to join with my colleagues and ask unanimous consent for the \nSenate to pass our bill.\n  In fact, I do so now. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed \nto the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 214, S. 1716; that the \nGrassley-Baucus substitute amendment which is at the desk be considered \nand agreed to, that the bill as amended be read a third time, passed, \nand that the motion to reconsider be laid on the table, and that all of \nthis occur with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In my capacity as a Senator from Oklahoma, I \nobject.\n  Objection is heard. The unanimous consent request is not agreed to.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/28/senate-section/article/S10582-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10582]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, the USA PATRIOT Act greatly expanded the \nGovernment's authority to use national security letters, documents \nissued by FBI agents without judicial or grand jury approval that allow \nthe Government to obtain sensitive information about innocent American \ncitizens. The recipient of a national security letter is subject to a \npermanent automatic gag order.\n  The Justice Department claims that they are not interested in the \nlibrary records of innocent Americans. However, they acknowledge that \nthey do not know how often FBI agents have obtained library records \nsince enactment of the PATRIOT Act. And just 3 weeks ago, the Justice \nDepartment again refused my request to make public the number of \nnational security letters that FBI agents have issued since\n\n[[Page S10583]]\n\nthe PATRIOT Act became law. As a result, the American people have no \nidea how often the FBI is using this controversial power to obtain \ntheir sensitive personal records, including library records.\n  I commend our Nation's librarians for defending our Constitution and \nleading the fight to reform the PATRIOT Act. Unfortunately in the past \nthis Justice Department has criticized librarians for exercising their \nfirst amendment rights. Now they have gone even further--preventing a \nlibrarian from speaking publicly about a legal challenge to the \nnational security letter power.\n  In our democracy, the government is supposed to be open and \naccountable to the people and the people have a right to keep their \npersonal lives private, This Justice Department seems to want to \nreverse this order, keeping their activity secret and prying into the \nprivate lives of innocent American citizens.\n  The President has asked Congress to reauthorize the PATRIOT Act. In \norder to have a fully informed public debate, the American people \nshould know how often the national security letter authority has been \nused and they should be able to hear from librarians and others who are \nconcerned about this power.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/28/senate-section/article/S10583-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate passed \nS.1752, a bill to reauthorize the U.S. Grain Standards Act. I \nunderstand that the House of Representatives is scheduled to consider \nthis legislation today and look forward to its swift approval, as the \nact expires September 30, 2005.\n  This reauthorization bill is identical to the administration's \nrequested language provided to the committee earlier this year, a \nsimple 10-year extension of current law.\n  The Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee held a hearing to \nreview the U.S. Grain Standards Act on May 25, 2005. Testimony provided \non behalf of the National Grain and Feed Association and the North \nAmerican Export Grain Association highlighted industry's desire to be \ncost-competitive and remain viable for bulk exports of U.S. grains and \noilseeds in the future. Specifically, these organizations proposed the \nU.S. Department of Agriculture's, USDA, utilization of third-party \nentities to provide inspection and weighing activities at export \nfacilities with 100-percent USDA oversight using USDA-approved \nstandards and procedures. Support for this proposal in the hearing was \nprovided by the American Farm Bureau Federation, American Soybean \nAssociation, National Association of Wheat Growers, National Corn \nGrowers Association, National Grain Sorghum Producers, and the American \nAssociation of Grain Inspection and Weighing Agencies. Testimony \nprovided by USDA stated that the ``proposal of the industry establishes \na framework for changing the delivery of services without compromising \nthe integrity of the official system.''\n  During the hearing, the Committee also learned of workforce \nchallenges currently facing the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Grain \nInspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration, GIPSA. The majority \nof official grain inspectors will be eligible for retirement over the \nnext several years. Testimony presented explained that transitioning \nthe delivery of services through attrition would minimize the impact on \nFederal employees.\n  Since the hearing, I have extensively reviewed legislative proposals \nand discussed the issue of improved competitiveness with various \nSenators, organizations, and USDA. Chairman Bob Goodlatte of the House \nAgriculture Committee and I wrote to USDA to determine if they had \nexisting authority to use private entities at export port locations for \ngrain inspection and weighing services, and if they did, how they would \nimplement this authority.\n  Accompanying this statement is a copy of the letter we received from \nUSDA responding to our questions. The letter clearly states that the \nU.S. Grain Standards Act ``currently authorizes the Secretary of \nAgriculture to contract with private persons or entities for the \nperformance of inspection and weighing services at export port \nlocations.'' The letter further explains that GIPSA considers the use \nof this authority as an option to address future attrition within the \nAgency and to address expanded service demand. I fully expect USDA to \nuse this authority in a manner that improves competitiveness of the \nU.S. grain industry, that maintains the integrity of the Federal grain \ninspection system, and that provides benefits to employees who may be \nimpacted.\n  The committee greatly appreciates the work provided by GIPSA, and we \nare pleased to extend the authorization of current law for 10 years.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter to which I referred be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                 The Secretary of Agriculture,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 21, 2005.\n     Hon. Saxby Chambliss,\n     Chairman, Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: This is in response to your letter of \n     this date, also signed by Bob Goodlatte, Chairman of the U.S. \n     House of Representatives Committee on Agriculture, posing two \n     questions regarding legislation which is currently pending \n     before the Congress. The legislation would reauthorize, for \n     an additional period of years, the United States Grain \n     Standards Act, 7 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 71 et seq. (Act), which is \n     presently scheduled to expire on September 30, 2005. Your \n     questions and our responses are as follows:\n       1. Would existing authority under the U.S. Grain Standards \n     Act allow USDA to use private entities at export port \n     locations for grain inspection and weighing services?\n       Response. The Act currently authorizes the Secretary of \n     Agriculture to contract with private persons or entities for \n     the performance of inspection and weighing services at export \n     port locations. See 7 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 79(e)(I), 84(a)(3).\n       2. If so, how would USDA implement this authority?\n       Response. The Act currently authorizes the Secretary to \n     contract with a person to provide export grain inspection and \n     weighing services at export port locations. The Grain \n     Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration (GIPSA) has \n     reserved this authority to supplement the current Federal \n     workforce if the workload demand exceeded the capability of \n     current staffing. GIPSA has also considered use of this \n     authority as one of several options to address future \n     attrition within the Agency and to address expanded service \n     demand as several delegated States have decided or are \n     considering to cancel their Delegation of Authority with \n     GIPSA.\n       In accordance with federal contracting requirements, GIPSA \n     would contract with a person(s) (defined as any individual, \n     partnership, corporation, association, or other business \n     entity) to provide inspection and weighing services to the \n     export grain industry. The person(s) awarded the contract \n     would adhere to all applicable provisions of the Act to \n     ensure the integrity of the official inspection system during \n     the delivery of services to the export grain industry. The \n     person(s) would charge a fee directly to the export grain \n     customer to cover the cost of service delivery and the cost \n     of GIPSA supervision. Contract terms would require \n     reimbursement to GIPSA for the cost of supervising the \n     contractor's delivery of official inspection and weighing \n     services.\n       GIPSA would comply with OMB Circular No. A-76 for any \n     contracting activity that may replace or displace federal \n     employees. The Circular would not apply if the contract for \n     outsourcing services intends to fill workforce gaps, not \n     affect Federal employees, or supplement rather than replace \n     the federal workforce. The A-76 process typically takes two \n     years and involves an initial cost-benefits analysis, an open \n     competitive process, and an implementation period.\n       I hope that the explanations provided above are fully \n     responsive to the questions\n\n[[Page S10584]]\n\n     you have asked.

Mr. President, I rise today to thank very much all of \nmy colleagues for their support in extending the Breast Cancer Research \nStamp for another 2 years.\n  This bill has the strong bipartisan support of Senator Hutchison and \n68 other Senators from both sides of the aisle.\n  Without congressional action, this extraordinary stamp is set to \nexpire on December 31 of this year.\n  During the past 7 years, the U.S. Postal Service has sold over 650 \nmillion semipostal breast cancer stamps--raising $47.4 million for \nbreast cancer research.\n  These dollars allow the National Institutes of Health, NIH, and the \nDepartment of Defense, DOD, to conduct new and innovative breast cancer \nresearch.\n  So far the NIH has received approximately $31 million and the DOD \nabout $13 million for breast cancer research--helping more people \nbecome cancer survivors rather than cancer victims.\n  In addition to raising much needed funds, this wonderful stamp has \nalso focused public awareness on this devastating disease and provided \nhope to breast cancer survivors to help find a cure.\n  The breast cancer research stamp is the first stamp of its kind \ndedicated to raising funds for a special cause and remains just as \nnecessary today as ever. For example: breast cancer is considered the \nmost commonly diagnosed cancer among women in every major ethnic group \nin this country; over 2 million women in the U.S. are living with \nbreast cancer, 1 million of whom have yet to be diagnosed; this year, \napproximately 211,240 women in this country will get breast cancer and \nabout 40,410 women will die from this dreadful disease; and about 1,300 \nmen in America are diagnosed with breast cancer each year though much \nless common.\n  Extending the life of this remarkable stamp is crucial so that we can \ncontinue to reach out to our women and men who do not know of their \ncancer and to those who are living with it.\n  This bill would permit the sale of the breast cancer research stamp \nfor 2 more years--until December 31, 2007.\n  The stamp would continue to have a surcharge of up to 25 percent \nabove the value of a first-class stamp.\n  Surplus revenues would continue to go to breast cancer research \nprograms at the National Institutes of Health, 70 percent of proceeds, \nand the Department of Defense, 30 percent of proceeds.\n  This bill does not affect any other semipostal proposals under \nconsideration by the Postal Service.\n  With this stamp every dollar we continue to raise will help save \nlives until a cure is found.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues for supporting this important \nlegislation to extend the breast cancer research stamp for 2 more \nyears.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/28/senate-section/article/S10584-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10584-S10586]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE 2005 BRAC PROCESS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the Base Realignment \nand Closure, or BRAC, process that occurred this year. I have always \nvoted to authorize base closure rounds in deference to the Department \nof Defense's stated need to restructure our military facilities to meet \ncurrent and future needs. Nevertheless, the ceding of significant \nauthority by Congress to an independent commission is an extraordinary \nstep that should not be undertaken frequently or lightly. When Congress \ndoes lend its power to an independent commission, we retain the \nresponsibility to closely monitor the commission's deliberations and \nactions. I have done so with respect to the 2005 BRAC Commission, \nnaturally paying the closest attention to the issues before the \nCommission that affect Iowans.\n  My observation of the Commission's final deliberations raised some \nconcerns about the information and reasoning used in making its \ndecisions. I followed up with a letter to the Commission to clarify \nthese concerns and have recently received a response that did nothing \nto allay my concerns. As a result, I have now concluded that I do not \nhave full confidence that this was a thorough and fair process.\n  A joint resolution to disapprove the 2005 BRAC recommendations has \nbeen introduced in the House and has just been marked up by the House \nArmed Services Committee. It will now be considered under expedited \nprocedures. I would urge my colleagues in the House to approve this \nresolution. Obviously, if this resolution is not approved by the House, \nSenate action will be meaningless. But, if the Senate does take up such \na resolution, I will vote to disapprove the 2005 BRAC recommendations.\n  The BRAC Commission is charged with reviewing the recommendations of \nthe Department of Defense and altering those recommendations if they \nare found to deviate substantially from the BRAC criteria. On that \nbasis, the Quad Cities community in Iowa and Illinois challenged some \nrecommendations for the Rock Island Arsenal and did not challenge \nothers.\n  One issue on which I thought we had a clear-cut case of a substantial \ndeviation of the BRAC criteria was the proposed move of the U.S. Army \nTank-Automotive and Armaments Command, or TACOM, organization at the \nRock Island Arsenal to the Detroit Arsenal. This proposal was \nessentially a footnote to a consolidation of what is called inventory \ncontrol point functions from 11 separate organizations around the \ncountry that would now report to the Defense Logistics Agency. The \nconsolidation of inventory control point functions would affect 52 \npeople at TACOM Rock Island and was not challenged by the community. \nHowever, the DOD recommendation then, puzzlingly, proposed to move the \nrest of the approximately 1,000 employees of TACOM Rock Island to the \nTACOM Headquarters at the Detroit Arsenal in Michigan.\n  The facilities at the Detroit Arsenal are already strained to \ncapacity. The base is encroached on all sides and has no room to grow. \nIn fact, the Detroit Arsenal is rated far lower in military value than \nthe Rock Island Arsenal. Moving in 1,000 new employees will require \nmajor military construction. That includes building two parking garages \nto replace the already limited parking space that would be used up. \nWhat's more, because of higher locality pay in the area, it will cost \nsignificantly more in the long term to pay those employees at the new \nlocation. You also lose some unique facilities currently used by TACOM \nRock Island, like a machine shop and live fire range. In addition, \nthere will be no space to house the outside contractors currently \nembedded with TACOM Rock Island, who would also need to move but aren't \ncounted in the BRAC data.\n  The Quad Cities community challenged this proposed move on the basis \nof military value, and the enormous costs both up front and in the long \nrun. In fact, the move would cost the taxpayers millions of dollars \nmore out into the future. This point was made clear when Commissioner \nSkinner visited the Rock Island Arsenal. It featured prominently in my \ntestimony before three BRAC Commissioners at the regional hearing in \nSt. Louis. My colleagues, Senators Durbin, Obama, and Harkin and \nRepresentative Evans also made this point at the regional hearing. This \nwas followed by a detailed presentation by community representatives. \nMembers of our bistate congressional delegation reinforced this point \nin follow-up phone calls to commissioners. Finally, community \nrepresentatives and congressional staff met with the BRAC Commission \nstaff to make sure they knew about the costs.\n  When it came time for the final deliberations, the Commission \nconsidered the TACOM move with the consolidation of inventory control \npoint functions. I question this approach to start with since the TACOM \nmove was completely unrelated to the other moves in the recommendation. \nIt was obvious by Commissioner Skinner's questions to the BRAC staff \nthat considering these unrelated moves in one recommendation confused \nthe commissioners. Commissioner Skinner asked twice how the move being \nconsidered would affect another move from the Rock Island Arsenal to \nthe Detroit Arsenal that he believed would be considered separately. He \nhad to be corrected twice by staff who explained that it was all part \nof one recommendation.\n\n[[Page S10585]]\n\n  Furthermore, despite all the briefings from the community, the BRAC \nstaff presented a summary of the community's concerns that omitted the \ncritical issue of the long-term costs of the move. The summary's only \nreference to cost was a relatively minor concern that the number of \npositions to move were underestimated. When Commissioner Skinner asked \nhow increased estimates of the military construction costs at the \nDetroit Arsenal would affect the payback, the BRAC staff responded that \n``Payback with the new scenario, new MILCON, is $1.8 billion savings \nover 20 years, still a large savings.'' However, that figure refers to \nthe entire recommendation package, not just the otherwise unrelated \nTACOM move. I believe that response by the BRAC staff was \nintellectually dishonest and misleading.\n  The disturbing fact is that the TACOM move will actually squander \n$128.23 in taxpayer money. I pointed out this problem in a message \ndelivered to Commissioner Skinner before the Commission's final vote on \nthe BRAC report, but no action was taken. Only after the final vote has \nthe Commission admitted to me in a letter that the TACOM move, taken by \nitself, would cost $128.23 million over the 20 year time frame used in \ntheir estimate. The Commission's letter also confirmed that the \nCommissioners were never briefed about the cost of the TACOM move \nby itself.\n\n  In its response to me, the BRAC Commission continued to justify \nconsidering the cost of the TACOM move in terms of the net present \nvalue of the entire recommendation. However, in reference to another \nportion of the same recommendation regarding a cryptological unit at \nLackland Air Force Base, the slide used by the BRAC staff for its \npresentation read, ``The extent and timing of potential costs outweigh \npotential savings with no payback of investment.'' The same could have \nbeen said about the TACOM portion of the recommendation. The Commission \nthen voted to overturn the portion of the recommendation to realign \nLackland Air Force Base. In this case, the Commission did consider one \nportion of the larger recommendation separately, including a staff \nanalysis of the payback for just that portion of the recommendation, \nand voted to overturn that component of the larger recommendation. The \nCommission's justification for its failure to do so with respect to the \nTACOM portion of that recommendation therefore falls flat.\n  In fact, there is evidence that the selective presentation of facts \nby the BRAC staff resulted in Commissioners misunderstanding the issue \nwhen voting. In justifying his decision on the TACOM move in an \ninterview with the Rock Island Argus, Commissioner Skinner said of the \nBRAC staff's analysis, ``They said there's still significant payback by \ndoing that and that was the major objection that they (the community) \nhad.'' Commissioner Skinner should have known the most about this \nproposed move from his site visits to both the Rock Island Arsenal and \nthe Detroit Arsenal, but his statement is inaccurate. It seems clear \nfrom this quote that he was misled by relying on the faulty \npresentation by the BRAC staff.\n  Of course, while cost is a major consideration in BRAC, it is not the \nonly consideration. Still, if a recommendation contains significant \ncosts, like the TACOM move, there must be a very compelling case for an \nincrease in military value to justify the costs. In this case, I think \nit is clear that more is lost in terms of military value than is \ngained. Moreover, the Commission never got to this point since the BRAC \nstaff represented that the move was justified based on cost.\n  I don't believe that DOD made this recommendation based on a \nconclusion that consolidating TACOM in one location would increase \nmilitary value in the first place. Several smaller components of TACOM \nin other locations were not proposed for consolidation. Still, if there \nwas a compelling case for merging the two TACOM organizations together, \nthen why wasn't the Rock Island Arsenal considered as a receiving site? \nThe Rock Island Arsenal could accommodate all the personnel at Detroit \nArsenal without major military construction, possibly even allowing \nDetroit Arsenal to be closed entirely. The Rock Island Arsenal was \nnever considered as a receiving installation by DOD since it was \nassumed to be closing during much of DOD's internal BRAC process.\n  In fact, the preliminary assumption that the Rock Island Arsenal \nwould close is why it was not considered as a receiving site for the \nconsolidation of the Defense Finance and Accounting Service, \nInstallation Management Agency, and Civilian Personnel Operations \nCenter. In the case of the Civilian Personnel Operations Center, the \nBRAC staffer who presented this issue to the Commission pointed out \nthat this was not fair and equal treatment, which is a violation of the \nBRAC rules. The Commission then voted to overturn the recommendation \nbased on the fairness issue. I asked the BRAC Commission to answer why \nthis same logic did not apply to their actions in each of these areas. \nThe response stated that each recommendation was developed and briefed \nseparately by DOD supporting different initiatives. This does not \nanswer my question as to why the Commission did not overturn each of \nthese recommendations on the basis of fairness as they did, rightly, \nwith the Civilian Personnel Operations Center.\n  For instance, like the Civilian Personnel Operations Center at the \nRock Island Arsenal, the Defense Finance and Accounting site was ranked \nNo. 1 in military value of all such sites. Given the low labor costs \nand room to expand, it would be an ideal location to which to \nconsolidate other sites if it were given fair and equal consideration. \nThe Commission even questioned the sites chosen by DOD as receiving \nsites based on higher costs and lower value. Yet, in the end, the \nCommission chose to rearrange the sites to receive the consolidation \nand keep open two smaller sites with lower value than Rock Island. At a \nminimum, the Commission should have voted to keep open the Defense \nFinance and Accounting Service at the Rock Island Arsenal based on the \nsame fairness consideration as the Civilian Personnel Operations \nCenter. Ideally, it should have chosen the Rock Island Arsenal as a \nreceiving site.\n  I knew going into this BRAC process that the Rock Island Arsenal \ncould lose jobs. In fact, I am relieved that DOD did not recommend full \nclosure as first contemplated. Moreover, as I testified before the BRAC \nCommission, if it was determined that an organization would be more \nefficient and less expensive somewhere else, then I could have lived \nwith that. On this basis, I was even prepared for the BRAC Commission \nto disagree with my assessment about the proposals for the Rock Island \nArsenal that I didn't think made any sense.\n  However, what I saw in the BRAC Commission's final deliberations took \nme by surprise. The Commission did not refute the concerns raised by \nthe community. No evidence was produced that the TACOM move made \neconomic sense or would be more efficient. Instead, the staff gave a \nmisleading presentation that gave the impression that the move made \neconomic sense when it did not, based on the data used by the \nCommission. That doesn't mean I absolve the Commissioners from \nresponsibility in this either. Four of them had seen a presentation by \nthe community and all of them had been contacted by Members of \nCongress. They had a responsibility to challenge the staff when the \nstaff analysis didn't match what they had heard previously. In this \nrespect, both the BRAC staff and the Commissioners failed in their \nresponsibilities. In the end, what I have seen has caused me to lose \nconfidence in the work of the BRAC Commission. As a result, I cannot \nendorse their final product.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the Rock Island Argus article to \nwhich I referred printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Skinner: Arsenal Dodged a Bullet\n\n                           (By Edward Felker)\n\n       Washington--BRAC Commissioner Samuel K. Skinner on Thursday \n     said the Rock Island Arsenal ``dodged a major bullet'' in the \n     base closing process by losing jobs but not closing \n     completely.\n       During a brief interview, Mr. Skinner, who visited the \n     Arsenal on behalf of the commission, defended the panel's \n     vote to send 1,129 Quad-Cities jobs to the Detroit Arsenal. \n     The panel approved the move despite protests that the \n     transfer will cost too much and not further Army integration.\n       Mr. Skinner said that he looked into arguments that the \n     Detroit Arsenal did not have\n\n[[Page S10586]]\n\n     the space for the incoming workers, but was satisfied that \n     additional construction costs will not hamper expected \n     savings to the taxpayers.\n       ``They said there's still significant payback by doing \n     that,'' he said of the BRAC staff's review of the move, ``and \n     that was the major objection that they had.''\n       He said the commission felt it was only fair to keep open \n     the Arsenal's 251-job Civilian Personnel Office and Civilian \n     Human Resource Agency. It was originally slated to move to \n     Fort Riley, Kan., as part of a sweeping consolidation of \n     defense personnel offices.\n       But Mr. Skinner urged the panel to delete it because it was \n     targeted as part of a complete closure of the Rock Island \n     Arsenal, and the move was never re-examined after the \n     Pentagon decided to keep the Arsenal open.\n       ``They had no chance to be heard, it wasn't even \n     considered, and on that basis it wasn't fair. So we got a \n     little life,'' Mr. Skinner said.\n       He also defended the closure of the Arsenal's 301-job \n     Defense Finance and Accounting Service office. The commission \n     voted to keep other offices open that the Pentagon targeted \n     for closure, but Mr. Skinner said they were on bases of \n     higher military and had the worst economic closure impact \n     among DFAS locations.\n       He said the overall result for the Arsenal was better than \n     it could have been. ``They dodged a major bullet. Not \n     perfect, but it could have been a lot worse.''\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/28/senate-section/article/S10586-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10586]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n GOVERNMENT REORGANIZATION AND PROGRAM PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT ACT OF \n                                  2005\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, we are facing times of record spending. \nWhether it is in the form of relief to the hurricane ravaged gulf \ncoast, financing the war on terrorism, or meeting our obligations to \nseniors with the Medicare prescription drug benefit, Federal spending \nis higher now than ever. We have committed ourselves to funding these \npriorities.\n  In doing so, I believe we must also look for ways to save in other \nareas to offset some of these costs. I would liken our current fiscal \nsituation to that of any common American household. When emergencies or \nunforeseen obligations arise, such as an illness or a major repair, you \nfind a way to pay the bill. But in doing so, you must also look at your \nhousehold budget and find places to save.\n  So I come to the Senate floor today to speak a little bit about \nlegislation I recently introduced to require regular review of Federal \nprograms with the goal of identifying areas where savings can be made. \nS. 1399, the Government Reorganization and Program Performance \nImprovement Act, will create the necessary mechanisms to require \nCongress and the executive branch to regularly and formally examine \nwhether Federal programs and agencies are achieving, or have achieved \ndesired results for the American people, and make the necessary \nadjustments.\n  The bill would do this through the creation of a sunset commission \nand individual results commissions. The sunset commission would hold \nthe Federal Government accountable for performance by reviewing and \nproviding recommendations to retain, restructure, or end Federal \nagencies or programs. Congress and the President would enact a 10-year \nschedule for the administration to assess the performance of all \nFederal agencies and programs. Acting on those assessments, the seven-\nmember bipartisan sunset commission, appointed by the President in \nconsultation with Congress, will recommend ways to improve \neffectiveness and spend taxpayer dollars more wisely.\n  The commission will provide an important framework to facilitate the \nreform, restructuring, or possible elimination of those agencies or \nprograms unable to demonstrate expected performance results during \ntheir scheduled review. It will also help to identify those programs \nthat have achieved their intended purposes or outlived their \nusefulness.\n  A second key feature of this important measure is the creation of \nindividual results commissions targeted at specific programs or policy \nareas where duplication and overlapping jurisdiction hinder reform. \nAgain, these seven-member bipartisan commissions, appointed by the \nPresident in consultation with Congress, will consider administration \nproposals to improve the performance of various programs and agencies \nby restructuring and consolidation. This will reduce unnecessary costs \nand waste paid for by the American taxpayer.\n  We need to continue to evaluate the way the Federal Government \noperates and look for ways to make it more cost effective for the long \nterm. I believe this legislation presents a good step toward dealing \nwith the large number of Federal programs out there, many of which are, \nfrankly, wasteful and unnecessary. Many also duplicate other Federal, \nState and private efforts. S. 1399 provides a commonsense framework for \nreorganization and review of Federal programs, and provides for a way \nto abolish them if determined unnecessary.\n  S. 1399 is a good government measure. It is about efficiency, \naccountability to the American taxpayer, and identifying potential \nsavings. It is a fiscally responsible measure that will provide a way \nfor the Federal Government to save even as it meets its spending \nobligations in the future. I invite my colleagues to take a serious \nlook at this proposal and to join me in advancing this effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/28/senate-section/article/S10586-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10586-S10590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AUGUST 2005 CODEL TO LATIN AMERICA\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, from August 14 to the 22, I traveled to \nLatin America to investigate first hand important issues relating to \nnational security, immigration and the war on drugs. I would like to \nshare the details of this trip and some of the insights I gained with \nmy colleagues.\n  On Sunday, August 14, we flew to Havana, Cuba. Upon our arrival we \ndrove to the U.S. Mission where we met with James Cason, our chief of \nmission, and members of his staff. I started off the meeting by asking \nmy hosts if Cuba could help the U.S. combat the smuggling of illegal \ndrugs into our country. Mr. Rod Rojas of the U.S. Coast Guard, who \ncurrently serves as the U.S. Drug Interdiction Specialist based in \nHavana, noted that there is a good working relationship between the \nCoast Guard and the Cuban Border Guard on drug issues. It primarily \ntakes the form of the Cubans sharing information with the United States \nas to suspicious ships passing through its territorial waters. The \nUnited States then interdicts these ships when they cross into U.S. \nwaters. While the number of such reports has fallen in recent years, \nMr. Rojas believes that this is a testament to the success of Cuban \nefforts: now that they know they will be reported, drug smugglers seem \nto be avoiding Cuban waters.\n  These reports confirm my long-held view that we should be working \nmore closely with Cuba on drug interdiction efforts. This is why since \n2001 I have sought to include language in the Foreign Operations \nappropriations bill to fund joint drug interdiction efforts between our \ntwo countries. This language is in the Senate version of the fiscal \nyear 2006 bill, and I intend to press to secure its retention in the \nbill through conference.\n  From this positive report on the drug interdiction situation, our \nconversation turned to a troubling report on the current human rights \nsituation in Cuba. Mr. Cason told us that there has been a \ndeterioration of human rights in Cuba in recent years as Castro has \ncracked down on political dissidents. In 2003, Castro jailed 75 \ndissidents and has thus far released fewer than 20 from this group. \nThese arrests were followed by others including the arrest of over 30 \ndissidents earlier this year. In addition to arrests, Castro has begun \nto employ other atrocious practices including having dissidents \nassaulted on the streets and generating demonstrations at the homes of \ndissidents to prevent them from stepping outside.\n  This repression has spread to the economic realm as well. In the late \n1990s, Castro had opened a very limited window to free enterprise in \nCuba by issuing licenses for private businesses. Had this trend \ncontinued, Cuba could have followed the path of China and Vietnam \ntowards a limited market economy and higher living standards. Instead, \nCastro has abandoned this liberalization and cut back the number of \nlicenses for private business. Both politically and economically, there \nare signs that Cuba is going backwards.\n  Finally, our conversation turned to the issue of immigration. In an \neffort to provide a legal outlet for immigration and avoid the massive \nboatlifts of the past, the United States allows 20,000 Cubans to \nlegally immigrate every year. This number includes family \nreunifications, visas given out by\n\n[[Page S10587]]\n\nlottery, and approximately 5,000 visas granted to individuals accorded \nrefugee status because they are found to face persecution if they \nremain in Cuba. Yet this legal outlet is still overwhelmed by the \ndesire to leave Castro's Cuba: every year thousands of Cubans who \ncannot secure these visas still come to the U.S. by sea and, \nincreasingly, overland via Mexico.\n  On Monday, August 15, we returned to the airport in the morning and \nflew an hour and a half from Havana down to our military base at \nGuantanamo Bay. Upon arrival we were met by White House Counsel Harriet \nMiers, Department of Defense General Counsel Jim Haynes, and a \ncontingent of my Judiciary Committee staff. The base commander, MG Jay \nHood, greeted us all and loaded us into a boat for the trip across the \ninlet from the airstrip to the operational center of the base.\n  Our visit began with a briefing by General Hood and members of his \nstaff about many of the individuals being held and interrogated at \nGuantanamo and what they were learning from them. The briefing also \nreviewed the many cases on record of individuals we released from \nGuantanamo who immediately returned to the ranks of the terrorists once \nfree. This briefing was an important reminder of the difficult balance \nthat must be struck in our handling of these detainees. While we must \nstrive for fair processes, we must remember that the individuals we are \ndealing with are often our most vicious enemies.\n  After our briefing, we drove to a mess hall for lunch where I had the \nopportunity to meet a number of Pennsylvanians who are serving with \ndistinction at the base. We then visited one of the buildings used for \ninterrogation and met with a group of interrogators who have been \nassigned to work with the Saudi prisoners. The interrogators informed \nus that their progress was slow. I asked these interrogators about the \ntactics they used. They were adamant that they did not use coercive \ntactics. They added that such tactics do not work. On the contrary, \nthey told us that they have found the most effective method of \ninterrogation to be developing a relationship with a detainee, treating \nhim with respect, and winning him over through positive reinforcement.\n  On August 1, the New York Times ran a front page story detailing the \nallegations of two senior prosecutors at Guantanamo that the trial \nsystem for detainees had ``been secretly arranged to improve the \nchances of conviction and to deprive defendants of material that could \nprove their innocence.'' After our tour of the base, I questioned \nGeneral Hood, DoD General Counsel Jim Haynes, and Brigadier General \nThomas Hemingway of the DoD Office of Military Commissions about these \nallegations and other complaints about the military justice system. \nWhite House Counsel Miers was present. Since our conversation was \nclassified, I will not comment in this forum on what was said. After \nthis meeting we returned to Havana.\n  On Tuesday, August 16, we returned to the U.S. Mission to meet with \ntwo brave Cuban dissidents: Vladimiro Roca and Martha Roque. Mr. Roca \nis the President of the Social Democratic Party of Cuba. Knowing that I \nwould meet with President Castro later in my trip, I felt it important \nto meet with the dissidents so that I would hear from both sides. I \nlearned after my visit that the Governor of Nebraska, who was in town \nat the same time I was, also met with Castro but declined to meet with \nthe dissidents.\n  Since political parties are banned in Cuba, Mr. Roca's ``party'' has \nonly 35 members. Mr. Roca was jailed by Castro for 5 years from 1997 to \n2002 for criticizing his government. Yet Mr. Roca continues to speak \nout and to criticize the regime. Although free, Mr. Roca has been the \nsubject of intimidation and demonstrations designed to keep him from \nleaving his home.\n  Like Mr. Roca, Ms. Roque has also been jailed for expressing her \nstrong anti-Castro views. She spent 3 years in jail from 1997 to 2000. \nUpon her release from prison she immediately returned to her activism. \nIn 2003, she was arrested for a second time while attending an anti-\nCastro demonstration and sentenced to twenty years in jail. One year \nand five months into her term, Ms. Roque suffered a heart attack and \nwas released.\n  While both Mr. Roca and Ms. Roque had trials, neither process sounds \nas if it was worthy of the name. According to Mr. Roca, he was told \nprior to his trial what the verdict and sentence would be. Mr. Roca and \nMs. Roque are not alone. They inform me that there are still 81 \nprisoners of conscience languishing in Cuban jails for doing nothing \nmore than exercising a right to free speech that their government \nrefuses to recognize.\n  Following this meeting we drove to a luncheon meeting with President \nFidel Castro. I had met with Castro during two prior visits to Cuba in \n1999 and 2002 and found the experience to be worthwhile. As before, I \nfound Castro to be an engaging host. He has an easy wit and enjoys a \ngood-natured exchange. Yet beneath the joking was a serious \nundercurrent. Having just come from a meeting with dissidents, I \npressed Castro to release the political prisoners in his jails. Castro \ntried to shift the topic of conversation from his prisoners by bringing \nup the case of five Cubans convicted of spying in the U.S. whose \nconvictions were recently overturned by the 11th Circuit. I suggested \nto Castro that far from being an example of American wrongdoing, this \nkind of fair process is exactly the type of justice he should be \noffering to his own people. I also pressed Castro to open his country \nto democracy and dissent. He listened, but my exhortations obviously \nhad no effect.\n  Much of Castro's conversation focused on his efforts to provide \nhealth care to third world countries. Castro discussed this topic at \nlength, and it quickly became clear that he believes this effort will \nbe his central legacy. Cuba, a country of 11 million, has 70,000 \ndoctors due to Castro's early emphasis on providing medical care to his \nown people. Castro has in recent years started sending thousands of \nthese doctors abroad to help serve the underprivileged. Venezuela is \nthe leading recipient of this medical largesse and hosts the majority \nof Cuba's overseas medical corps. According to Castro, Cuban doctors in \nVenezuela live and work in the slums and provide crucial medical care \nto those who would otherwise go without. For example, Castro told us \nthat 6,000 Cuban eye doctors will perform 100,000 eye operations on \npoor Venezuelans this year. In addition to providing care, Castro told \nus that his doctors also provide an education, teaching Venezuelans to \nbe doctors both in Venezuela and in Cuba. Castro then read off to us a \nlist of the many countries in which Cuban doctors are living and \nserving from East Timor to Haiti and including many African and Latin \nAmerican countries.\n\n  It must be noted that Castro's motives are not entirely altruistic. \nOur Embassy in Caracas informed me that in exchange for these medical \nservices he is given a generous supply of free oil and his doctors are \npaid a subsidy which is remitted back to the state. Yet it is doubtful \nthat Castro's arrangements with poorer countries such as Haiti bring \nsimilar financial rewards. While there is much to criticize about \nCastro and his regime, this humanitarian effort is to be respected. To \nunderscore the personal importance of this effort to him, Castro ended \nhis discourse by stating that ``history will vindicate us.''\n  When we left Castro we proceeded to the airport and flew to Caracas, \nVenezuela. On Wednesday, August 17, we had breakfast with our \nAmbassador in Caracas, William Brownfield. Mr. Brownfield is a career \ndiplomat with an obvious passion for his work and a deep knowledge of \nhis subject. Ambassador Brownfield sets forth a pragmatic approach to \nVenezuela. While fundamental differences exist between our two \ncountries, he argues, we can and must cooperate on those issues where \nwe share an agenda, namely oil and drugs.\n  On oil, Venezuela lacks the infrastructure to refine more than one-\nfourth of the oil it produces. Venezuelan oil is heavier than most and \nneeds special refineries, and these refineries are located in the \nUnited States. In addition, Venezuela is relatively close to the United \nStates when compared to other United States suppliers and other \nVenezuelan markets. Thus continued cooperation on oil is imperative for \nboth nations.\n  Secondly, both nations share an interest in combating drugs. There \nhave been some recent conflicts over the specifics of fighting drugs. \nOnly a week\n\n[[Page S10588]]\n\nbefore our trip, President Chavez announced that he was suspending all \ncooperation with our DEA. The United States, in turn, suspended the \nvisas of three high ranking Venezuelan law enforcement officials. Yet \nbeneath the conflict, the shared interests and goals remain and can \nserve as a motivation to overcome these differences and proceed with \nthe important work of drug interdiction.\n  The Venezuelan President, Hugo Chavez, has been criticized for \ngoverning in an anti-democratic fashion. While in Caracas, I wanted to \nhear directly from those who held this view and arranged a meeting with \nan activist named Alejandro Plaz and one of his associates. Mr. Plaz is \nthe President of Sumate, a Venezuelan non-governmental organization \ndedicated to electoral observation and what he calls ``democratic \nobservation''--i.e. monitoring the leading indicators of a healthy \ndemocracy such as human rights and freedom of speech. These activities \nhave stirred the ire of President Chavez's regime. Mr. Plaz has been \ncharged with conspiracy to destroy the Republican system in Venezuela \nand if convicted would face 8 to 16 years in prison. The core element \nof the allegation of ``conspiracy'' is that Mr. Plaz accepted a $31,000 \ngrant from the National Endowment for Democracy. The Venezuelan \nGovernment argues that since teaching about democracy is a political \nactivity, and since political activities cannot be funded from abroad, \nMr. Plaz has violated the law. By all accounts, however, including an \nanalysis conducted by the American Bar Association, this is a political \ntrial aimed to intimidate a man perceived to be a political opponent.\n  Mr. Plaz also detailed how Chavez loyalists in the legislature used a \nsimple majority vote to change the rule requiring a supermajority to \namend certain basic laws of the nation. Having thus lowered the \nthreshold, the legislature has used simple majorities to expand the \nnumber of seats on the Supreme Court and pack these seats with Chavez \nloyalist as well as to fill the election boards with Chavez loyalists.\n  We next drove to the Venezuelan foreign ministry where we met with \nVenezuelan Foreign Minister Ali Rodriguez Araque and the Venezuelan \nMinister of Interior and Justice Jesse Chacon. Foreign Minister Araque \nstarted things on a positive note by stating that despite the \ndifferences which the United States and Venezuela may have in the \npolitical sphere, our two nations have many shared interests in oil and \ndrug interdiction and must emphasize our commonalities. Interior \nMinister Chacon picked up on the theme of drug interdiction and went on \nat some length about Venezuela's efforts to fight the use of its \nterritory as a transit point for Columbian drugs. According to the \nMinister, Venezuelan authorities seized 57 tons of cocaine and heroin \nin 2004 and 42 tons in 2003. He then spent some time discussing the \nrecent controversy between our DEA agents in Venezuela and the \nVenezuelan government. He set forth his government's side of the story, \nand focused on alleged inappropriate actions by our DEA agents \nincluding the use of ``controlled deliveries'' to ship illegal drugs \nout of Venezuela in contravention of Venezuelan law.\n\n  Immediately following this meeting, we drove to Miraflores Palace \nwhere I met with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. We were joined by \nthe two Ministers with whom I had previously met as well as U.S. \nAmbassador Brownfield. President Chavez began the meeting with an \nextended discussion about the importance of drug interdiction to both \nof our countries. He noted that drugs are a destabilizing force in the \ncountries victimized by them. He then spoke about the deteriorating \nrelations between the United States and Venezuela. He expressed concern \nin particular about statements coming from the U.S. government that he \nis trying to destabilize Latin America. He also said he is concerned \nabout his U.S. ambassador's lack of access to the White House and high \nranking executive branch officials.\n  Chavez commented about having met President Clinton on three \noccasions, one of which was at the United Nations. President Chavez \nbelieved that his relations with President Clinton were good and would \nlike to see similar relations with President Bush. President Chavez \nalso spoke about Venezuela's oil resources and his plans for billions \nof dollars of investments to increase oil production.\n  After the President's extensive opening statement, I responded that \ngood relations between the United States and Venezuela are very \nimportant to both countries. I told the President that we appreciate \nhis help in stopping the flow of drugs from Columbia and South America. \nI also noted the importance of Venezuelan oil to the United States and \nthe world. I expressed my view that United States. companies would be \nwilling to invest substantial sums to improve Venezuelan oil production \nand help them produce oil for the world and help Venezuela generate \nrevenue money to fight poverty. I then took up the dispute between \nVenezuelan narcotics officers and the DEA and suggested that all facts \nshould be put on the table to determine exactly what occurred so that \nboth parties are then in a position to decide what steps could be taken \nto resolve the dispute. President Chavez said that this was a good idea \nand that consideration ought to be given to having a new agreement on \ndrug interdiction.\n  President Chavez later spoke at some length about President Castro \nand his efforts to provide extensive medical personnel to Venezuela. \nChavez commented that Castro had discussed my meetings with Castro and \nthought that they were productive. Chavez then returned to the topic of \noil and pointed out that a Venezuelan company, presumably Citgo, had \n13,000 gas stations and 8 refineries in the United States. He then \nreiterated his concern about statements from the U.S. regarding \nVenezuela destabilizing Latin America. Chavez said that public opinion \nin Venezuela was running against the United States because of these \nstatements.\n  At the conclusion of our meeting, President Chavez agreed that it \nwould be useful for his Foreign Minister and Minister of the Interior \nto meet with our Ambassador the following week to try to resolve United \nStates/Venezuela differences on drug enforcement. Previously, all of \nour Ambassador's efforts to arrange such a meeting had been rejected.\n  On Thursday, August 18 we flew to Liberia, Costa Rica. Our first \nmeeting that afternoon focused on the drug issue. We sat down with Paul \nKnierim, our top DEA agent in Costa Rica, and his Costa Rican \ncounterpart, Allen Solano, who is the Director of the Costa Rican Drug \nControl Police. Although no drugs are grown or processed in Costa Rica, \nthe nation and the rest of Central America serve as a crucial transit \nroute for smugglers bringing South American drugs to the markets in \nNorth America and Europe.\n  Drugs are transported overland on Costa Rica's roads, by sea through \nboth its Pacific and Caribbean territorial waters, as well as over \nCosta Rica's airspace in private planes and on passenger jets. These \noperations are often sophisticated. In one smuggling ring that was \nuncovered, re-fueling ships met the smuggling boats at fixed points \nalong the Costa Rican coast so that the boats would not have to risk \ndetection by coming ashore.\n  The region faces its own set of issues. The Trans American Highway, \nan important overland route for drugs, passes through this region and \nhas been the site of increased drug traffic in recent years. Also, the \nDaniel Oduber international airport outside of Liberia has seen growing \npassenger traffic in recent years, especially to and from the United \nStates, as the local tourist industry and real estate markets have \ndeveloped. This increased traffic provides an opportunity for smugglers \nto blend into the crowd. Thus authorities have found that drug \ntraffickers are sending more smugglers on the planes to transport drugs \nnorthward. These ``mules'' typically transport the drugs by placing \nthem in latex and swallowing them, a practice which can prove fatal if \nthe latex bags break.\n  I was pleased to learn that in Costa Rica cooperation between our DEA \nand the local authorities is excellent. We have five of our agents \nstationed in country where they work with the Costa Ricans to \ninvestigate and interdict drug shipments. Success is difficult. Mr. \nKnierim of our DEA told me that they know they are having an impact, \nsince their actions force the smugglers to change their tactics. But he \nalso realizes that they have not been able to defeat the smugglers. The \nbattle continues.\n\n[[Page S10589]]\n\n  Later in my visit, I met with Dr. Rolando Herrero, a leading cancer \nresearcher who has been a pioneer in the exploration of the connection \nbetween viral infections and cancer. In particular, in a series of \nstudies conducted in the 1980s and early 1990s, Dr. Herrero \ndemonstrated a connection between the Human Papiloma Virus, HPV, a \nsexually transmitted disease, and cervical cancer. Having proven this \nconnection, Dr. Herrero is now conducting a trial of an HPV vaccine \nthat could prevent the spread of the virus and thus significantly lower \nthe incidence of cervical cancer. This vaccine trial received $5 \nmillion in NIH funding through the National Cancer Institute this year. \nGiven the prevalence of the HPV virus among sexually active young \nAmericans, and the enormous expense of pap smears and treatments, this \ntrial has obvious importance for the protection of women's health in \nthe U.S.\n  Dr. Herrero has conducted his studies, including the current vaccine \ntrial, in the Guanacaste Province in northwest Costa Rica. He explained \nthat because of the relative stability of the local female population \naged 18-25, this region allows for the extensive yearly follow up that \nwould not be possible in the more mobile societies of America and \nEurope. As a result of his extensive prior work in the region, Dr. \nHerrero also has an impressive infrastructure in place to allow for \neffective follow-up studies by a highly professional team of 150 \nscientists and health care workers who know the local population and \nits habits well.\n  Finally, we drove to the offices of Mr. Bernardo Rojas, the Director \nof Ecodesarollo, a private company which has been given a concession \nfrom the Costa Rican government to develop an area known as the \nPapagayo Peninsula on the Pacific Coast of northern Costa Rica. The \nwork being done by Mr. Rojas and this innovate public/private \npartnership can serve as a model for other countries wishing to develop \ntheir tourism industry while preserving the environment and respecting \nlocal populations.\n  Specifically, the Ecodesarollo Company has been given the rights to \ndevelop and manage an 840 hectare peninsula for a period of 49 years, \nwith a right to renew the concession for another 49 years. In return, \nhowever, the company must meet a series of significant requirements. \nFirst, it must build 9 hotels and 3 golf courses in this area within a \n28-year period which began in 1999. To date, two hotels and one golf \ncourse have been built to very impressive standards and have begun \nattracting tourists from around the world.\n  While conducting extensive construction, the developers are required \nto preserve the environment. They must preserve 70 percent of the green \nareas and set aside two conservation zones. They have also put into \nplace extensive water treatment and recycling and a project to \nrepopulate the local forests with local species of plants. The \ndevelopers have focused on the prevention of forest fires with great \nsuccess. Before the project began, there were 18 consecutive years of \nforest fires during the dry season. Since development began, there have \nbeen six dry seasons without any fires.\n  Finally, they must assist the local population. The company is \nrequired to build 2,000 residential units in the region. It must also \nprovide additional funding and programs to the local schools and \ncolleges.\n  While in Costa Rica I learned that the day after my meeting with \nVenezuela's President Chavez, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld made \nsome critical comments about the Venezuelan leader during a visit to \nPeru. I was concerned that Mr. Rumsfeld's rhetoric had the potential to \nerode the progress we had made with President Chavez during our visit. \nAccordingly, I wrote to Secretary Rumsfeld and informed him of my \nmeeting with Chavez and my belief that a window of opportunity had been \nopened to resolve our disagreement with Venezuela over drug \ninterdiction policy. I suggested that, at least for the time being, we \nshould have a moratorium on adverse comments about Venezuela.\n  Our next and final destination was Mexico City, Mexico. Given our \nlong common border, Mexico presents the greatest challenges and \nopportunities in the war on drugs and terror and on the immigration \nissue. Good relations with Mexico are crucial to both of our nations, \nand I was very glad for the opportunity to learn about these issues \nfirst hand.\n  On my first morning in Mexico we were met at our hotel by our \nAmbassador, Antonio Garza. Prior to his assignment to Mexico, \nAmbassador Garza was elected Railroad Commissioner of Texas and \nappointed by then Governor Bush to be Texas's Secretary of State. \nAmbassador Garza has a detailed knowledge of the issues facing our two \ncountries, and I believe he is serving us very well in Mexico.\n  From the hotel we drove to the Mexican Foreign Ministry for a \nbreakfast with a group of Mexican government officials to discuss the \ntwo most important issues before us: drugs and immigration. The group \nincluded Geronimo Gutierrez, Mexico's Under Secretary of Foreign \nRelations for North America, and Eduardo Medina Mora, the Director of \nMexico's Center for National Security Investigations, Mexico's \nequivalent of the CIA.\n  I began our breakfast by asking my hosts about the problem of the \ndrug cartels and the recent violence in Nuevo Laredo, a town just south \nof the border with Texas, where rival cartels have been fighting each \nother in the streets with machine gins and rocket launchers. Mr. Mora \ninformed us that the Mexican authorities have successfully prosecuted \nthe leaders of some of the country's largest drug cartels, including a \nmajor cartel in Baja, California and the Gulf Cartel operating south of \nTexas. I was also informed that the U.S. has been providing crucial \nassistance in this effort. We have helped to train, equip and fund a \nnew, professional Federal police force to replace its corrupt and \ninefficient predecessor. The new force currently stands at 7,000 \nmembers. According to Mr. Mora, the next big challenge facing the \nMexicans in the war on drugs is to replicate at the state and local \nlevel what they have accomplished at the Federal level by replacing \nineffective and/or bribed police forces with professional police forces \ncapable of winning the fight against the cartels. I was informed that \nthe U.S. can be helpful in this effort much as we were in building the \nFederal police by providing money, equipment and training.\n  Extradition of drug lords to the U.S. is a key component in this \nfight against the drug cartels. Mexican prisons fail to deter the drug \nlords, and there are stories of many who, through bribes, have been \nable to get everything they need to manage their empires from behind \nbars. I have been told repeatedly, however, that Mexican drug lords are \nterrified by the prospect of being jailed in U.S. prisons where they \nserve hard time.\n  Unfortunately, the Mexican courts have created a serious impediment \nto extradition to the U.S. Like many European countries, Mexico is \nopposed to the death penalty and will not extradite an individual to \nthe U.S. if that individual may face the death penalty upon conviction. \nYet the Mexican courts have extended this policy in a unique way. Three \nyears ago the Mexican Supreme Court held that life imprisonment without \nthe possibility of parole is the equivalent of the death penalty since \nthe prisoner will die in jail, and therefore a prisoner who would face \na life sentence in the U.S. cannot be extradited. Other Mexican courts \nhave gone so far as to declare that a 20-year sentence is the \nequivalent of the death penalty when imposed on a 60-year old convict, \nsince someone of that age will likely die in prison.\n  My Mexican hosts expressed displeasure with these court decisions and \ntell me they will seek their review. Still, despite these setbacks, \nextraditions are at their highest level ever, exceeding thirty a year \nin recent years. I suggested to my Mexican counterparts that we in the \nJudiciary Committee can work with our Department of Justice and local \nprosecutors to encourage them to file charges in a way that will \nfacilitate extradition. U.S. prosecutors have secured the extradition \nof murderers from Europe by taking the death penalty off the table, and \nwe can take similar steps to alleviate the concerns of the Mexicans. \nFor example, Mexican law allows for a sentence as long as sixty years \nin the case of ``aggravated homicide.'' Thus if U.S. prosecutors agree \nnot to seek a penalty greater than 60-years imprisonment, or to seek \nlife imprisonment but with the\n\n[[Page S10590]]\n\npossibility of parole, it may well facilitate the extradition while \nstill providing a serious sentence for the offenders.\n  On the immigration front my hosts assured me that Mexico is making a \nserious effort to reduce the traffic of illegal immigrants from Mexico \ninto the United States. These efforts are largely focused on limiting \nthe flow of illegals from third countries as opposed to the flow of \nMexicans themselves. Before they seek to illegally enter the United \nStates, hundreds of thousands of would-be immigrants from South and \nCentral American must first illegally enter Mexico. But Mexico is \ncracking down on these illegals and is deporting them back to their \nhome countries in large numbers. I was informed that last year the \nMexicans deported over 200,000 such illegals. The Mexicans are also \nrequiring visas for visitors from countries such as Brazil and Ecuador \nwho did not previously need them.\n  The Mexicans have also agreed to permit the U.S. to implement an \ninterior repatriation program. Typically, when we catch an illegal \nimmigrant, we deposit them on the other side of our border with Mexico \nwhere they are tantalizingly close to the United States and likely to \ntry again to enter. Under the interior repatriation program, we fly \nthose illegals who wish it all the way back to their home towns and \nvillages. Once home, far away from the border, they are far less likely \nto try again. So far, this program has returned 13,000 illegal \nimmigrants to their homes in Mexico.\n  From the Mexican Foreign Ministry we drove to the United States \nEmbassy, where I was greeted by over 30 representatives of the Embassy \nand other U.S. agencies for a briefing on our drug and counter-terror \nefforts. This briefing largely confirmed what I had learned earlier in \nthe day from the Mexican officials. Larry Holifield, the regional \ndirector of the DEA for Mexico and Central America, described the great \ncooperation between our DEA and their Mexican counterparts, including \npermission to conduct wiretaps and joint operations where vetted \nMexican police units act on U.S. intelligence tips to take down members \nof the drug cartels. He and others spoke about the help we have \nprovided to the Mexicans in building their police force and how \neffective this has been.\n  Greg Stephens of the Department of Justice confirmed that the \nMexicans are getting better on extradition. As of 6 years ago the \nMexicans had never extradited a Mexican citizen to the United States \nLast year the Mexicans extradited 34 people to the United States and \nare on track to extradite a similar number this year. Renee Harris of \nU.S. Customs and Border Control spoke about the internal repatriation \nprogram and agreed that it was working, although she would like to see \nmore help from the Mexican government in publicizing the program to its \ncitizens. In response to my question about what more we can to stem the \nflow of illegal immigrants, Ms. Harris responded with a familiar \nrefrain: we can provide more technology, equipment and training.\n  Following this meeting, we drove to the offices of the Mexican \nPresident, Vicente Fox. Before our meeting with the President began, I \nhad the opportunity to sit down with Mexican Attorney General Daniel \nFrancisco Cabeza de Vaca. I asked Attorney General Cabeza de Vaca about \nthe extradition issue and if it would help if we agreed not to seek a \nsentence of longer than 60 years for anyone extradited to the United \nStates from Mexico. The Attorney General thought this would help, and \ntold me that he had discussed this topic directly with Attorney General \nGonzales. He also believed that the problematic Supreme Court decision \nwould be reviewed.\n  I asked the attorney General about the situation in Nuevo Laredo, and \nhe expressed confidence that the situation was improving. He told me \nthat the Federal Government had sent over 1,500 police to the city and \nthat some important arrests were made just last week. He praised the \nsharing of intelligence with the United States which has helped them to \nidentify and detain targets. He said there were two phases to combating \nthe violence in Nuevo Laredo. The first phase was to ensure the \npermanent presence of the Federal police and the army in the City. This \nhas already been accomplished. The second phase was to improve local \nlaw enforcement and create a new and professional local police force \nwhich was not owned by the cartels. He expected to see a reduction in \nthe level of violence very soon. The Attorney General also asked for my \nassistance in the matter. He told me that the warring cartels were \nusing very high powered weapons, including 50 caliber machine guns and \nrocket launchers, and that these weapons were coming from the United \nStates. I agreed to contact the ATF to see what could be done to stem \nthe flow of such illegal weapons to Mexico.\n  Next I was received by President Vicente Fox. Fox started off our \nmeeting by telling me that it is vital for the United States, Canada \nand Mexico to work together on a variety of problems including \nimmigration, counter narcotics, and terrorism. He noted that our three \nnations were losing jobs to Asia and needed to work jointly to bolster \nour economies.\n  On the issue of violence in Nuevo Laredo and elsewhere, the President \ntold me that Mexico has both a short term and a long-term approach. In \nthe short term, Mexico has jailed 40,000 members of the drug cartels in \na 4-year period. Among those in prison are six of the country's major \ndrug lords. The President complained, however, that even while in jail \nsome drug lords have been able to continue to run their syndicates by \nbribing prison guards for access to telephones and other means of \ncommunication. Fox then spoke in more general terms about the problem \nof police corruption at the local level. He noted that police earn a \nsalary of $600 a month but are offered bribes in the thousands. In \nNuevo Laredo alone, 1,100 policemen were fired from their jobs last \nmonth for corruption. The Federal Government has moved 1,000 policemen \ninto the area to stem the violence.\n  In the long term, President Fox told us that he is trying to foster \ngreater cooperation between the Mexican Federal Government and the \nMexican states. To do so would require passage of legislation that has \nlong been pending in the Mexican Congress. President Fox's party \ncontrols neither house of Congress and so far this legislation has not \nbeen enacted. To emphasize the importance of better cooperation from \nlocal police, President Fox pointed out that there are approximately \n400,000 local police and only 10,000 Federal police. He also noted that \napproximately 95 percent of all crime consists of violation of state \nand local laws, while only 5 percent is Federal.\n  On the issue of extradition, President Fox told me that he would like \nto extradite more criminals to the United States but is limited by what \nhis Supreme Court has done. While he would like to see this opinion \noverruled, he is sensitive not to take any action which would be \ncounter productive. But he is working hard in the fight against drugs. \nHe told me that earlier that day he spent 2 hours with his counter \nnarcotics experts. He plans to meet with the governors of Arizona and \nNew Mexico to discuss the states of emergency that they have declared \nin response to the influx of illegal drugs and immigrants.\n  On the violence in Nuevo Laredo, President Fox stated that the cause \nwas the fight between rival drug cartels for control of the city. He is \nusing his military in Nuevo Laredo. I told President Fox that I was not \noptimistic that the war over the drug cartels could be won having \nobserved the problems in Colombia since the early 1980s and having now \nseen the problems in Venezuela and Costa Rica. I asked the President if \nhe felt that war was winnable. President Fox replied that it would be \nvery difficult to win the war on drugs as long as the demand for drugs \nremains strong. But he believes that the fight must continue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/28/senate-section/article/S10590-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10590-S10591]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         HONORING RALPH CURTIS\n\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \nrecognize one of my constituents, Mr. Ralph Curtis. Mr. Curtis has \nserved as manager of the Rio Grande Water Conservation District for 25 \nyears. He took over the managerial position when the organization was \nvery small, consisting of just Ralph and one other employee. The time \nand energy that Ralph has given\n\n[[Page S10591]]\n\nto the Rio Grande Water Conservation District has made this \norganization the well respected entity that it is within the San Luis \nValley and Colorado.\n  Because he grew up on--and later managed--his family's ranch in \nSaguache, Ralph has long been aware of the importance of water to the \nSan Luis Valley. Under his direction, the district took a leadership \nrole in fighting against the American Water Development Inc. water \ngrab, in water conservation education and in pro-active efforts on \nbehalf of endangered species such as the Southwestern Willow \nFlycatcher.\n  Ralph's community contributions have not gone unmarked either. He has \nbeen honored with numerous awards such as: the Wayne Aspinall Water \nLeader of the Year, San Luis Valley Wetlands Stewardship Award, Friend \nof 4-H, Distinguished Service Award for Conservation of Natural \nResources, Support of Colorado Association of Soil Conservations \nDistricts, and he was inducted into the Honorable Order of the Water \nBuffalo.\n  Ralph has always looked ahead to the next challenge, has always \nlooked forward to the next hill, in order to see where the road will \nlead him. I would like to wish Ralph and his wife Gloria the very best \nas they walk down that new road together looking for new \nchallenges.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/28/senate-section/article/S10591-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10591]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CONGRATULATIONS TO JAY DAVIDSON\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

He does this by serving as the president and CEO of The \nHealing Place, based in Louisville, KY. Under Mr. Davidson, this center \nhas achieved a success rate of 65 percent, which is five times the \nnational average. The efforts of The Healing Place have been so \nsuccessful that this year Governor Ernie Fletcher has announced that it \nwill serve as a model to 10 other shelter and recovery centers \nthroughout Kentucky.

Dixon, this on the occasion of her retirement from \nthe Economic Development Administration, United States Department of \nCommerce effective today, September 28, 2005.\n  Mrs. Dixon has served honorably at the Economic Development \nAdministration for 33 years, most recently and prominently as the \nEconomic Development Representative to the State of South Carolina. Her \ncontributions to economic development in South Carolina are numerous \nand have greatly contributed to the economic progress of the most \ndistressed areas of the State. Her work has been widely recognized most \nnotably by the South Carolina Association of Regional Councils, which \nawarded her their highest honor, the Outstanding Staff Award in 1991.\n  Mrs. Dixon has demonstrated her work in disaster recovery and base \nclosures, saving jobs, solving solid waste problems, expanding job \nopportunities and rebuilding tax bases. Her innovative approaches to \neconomic development problems and issues have been replicated in other \ncommunities. She also served as the first Federal cochair of the South \nCarolina Rural Development Council under the President's Initiative for \nRural Development. Mrs. Dixon continues to serve on the executive \ncommittees of both the North and South Carolina rural development \ncouncils. In addition, she was instrumental in the original \nestablishment of revolving loan funds for economic development \ndistricts in South Carolina.\n  Mrs. Dixon has garnered the personal and professional respect and \nadmiration of her friends and colleagues at the Economic Development \nAdministration and elsewhere. She represents the finest of qualities in \na public servant and has been an incomparable asset to the greater \neffort of improving quality of life for the people of South Carolina. \nIn conclusion, the retirement of Mrs. Patricia M. Dixon will be a great \nloss to the EDA and the State of South Carolina, but I wish her great \nsuccess and happiness in her future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/28/senate-section/article/S10591-3", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10591-S10592]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HONORING IOWA COMMUNITY LEADERS\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, every year the Iowa Council for \nInternational Understanding honors immigrants and refugees in Iowa who \nhave, in the words of the council, ``achieved, belonged and contributed \nto our community in a significant way.''\n  The ICIU began in 1938 when a group of volunteers joined forces to \naid immigrants fleeing the war in Europe. Since their founding, the \nICIU has continued to provide cultural services to both the immigrant \ncommunity and to native-born Iowans. The United States has always been \na beacon of hope for many around the world seeking refuge from \noppressive regimes, and it is my belief that each generation of \nimmigrants has enriched our Nation both culturally and economically. My \nmother was an immigrant from Slovenia, and I am proud to be a first \ngeneration American.\n  I take this opportunity to join in honoring the recipients of this \nyear's ICIU awards and to thank and congratulate them for all they have \nachieved and contributed to Iowa's communities.\n  Joe Gonzalez was born in Mexico and immigrated to Des Moines in 1957. \nIn 1971, he joined the Des Moines Police Department. He was one of the \nfirst Hispanic officers in the department and has garnered numerous \nawards, on both the State and national level, over his 33-year tenure. \nAmong other things, Officer Gonzalez has been particularly active in \naiding crime victims and victims of sexual and domestic abuse. After \nthe September 11 attacks, he worked at Ground Zero.\n  Sonia Parras Konrad immigrated to the United States 9 years ago from \nGranada, Spain. She was trained as a lawyer and is most recently a \ngraduate of Drake University Law School. Today she practices law in \nIowa. Ms. Konrad is being honored today for her passionate dedication \nto helping victims of domestic and sexual violence, particularly within \nSpanish speaking communities. Among the programs she has founded is \nLUNA, Latinas Unidas por un Nuevo Amanecer--Latinas United for a New \nDawn--designed to prevent and deal with the effects of domestic and \nsexual violence. This program has aided countless Iowans and has been \nused as a model in other states.\n  Juliet Cunningham emigrated from Kirkuk, Iraq, to the United States \nin 1979 to pursue advanced educational opportunities. She is actively \ninvolved with many Iowa institutions, including the Iowa State \nUniversity Engineering and Research Complex, Des Moines Science Center, \nSociety of Women Engineers and the West Des Moines United Methodist \nChurch. In 1994 Mrs. Cunningham cofounded TEAM Services Inc., a soil, \nenvironmental, and construction materials consulting firm with her \nhusband. Of particular note is her role in helping get a TEAM Services \nlaboratory in central Iowa accredited for the testing of construction \nmaterials, making it the first laboratory in Iowa with these \ncapabilities.\n  Dr. Liansuo Xie was born in 1958 and grew up in China's Hebei \nProvince. He worked as a mechanic in a paper manufacturing plant there \nbefore studying to receive a B.S. from the Beijing Agricultural \nEngineering University in 1982. Shortly thereafter, he married and came \nto the U.S. to study further at Iowa State University where he \neventually earned a Ph.D. and was honored with a Research Excellence \naward. He is widely considered to be one of the best engineers at the \nTownsend Engineering Company in Des Moines, where he has worked since \n1990, for his work on project design and design productivity. Finally, \nDr. Liansuo is a longstanding contributor to his community, serving as \na founding member of\n\n[[Page S10592]]\n\nthe Iowa Chinese Language School, the Sister States of Iowa, Hebei \nCommittee, and acting as a tour guide for Chinese delegations to Iowa \nand the United States.\n  B.J. Do arrived in Iowa in 1975 at the age of 13. He arrived wearing \nonly shorts and speaking very limited English, having fled Vietnam at \nthe end of the Vietnam War. Despite his humble beginning, he went on to \nearn both B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical and computer engineering \nfrom the University of Iowa. From there the sky was the limit, as Mr. \nDo went on to work on, design for, and manage projects for major \ninternational companies all over the United States. He has since \nreturned to Iowa where he is the co-founder and CEO of ABC Virtual \nCommunications, a software product and services company based in west \nDes Moines. He has received recognitions for his accomplishments from \nmyriad institutions, including the University of Iowa and the State of \nIowa, along with receiving the Ernst and Young Entrepreneur of the Year \nAward in 1999.\n  We are proud of their achievements and are pleased they are members \nof our communities. I am sure that ICIU would agree that for every \nstory told here today, countless others remain untold.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/28/senate-section/article/S10592-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10592]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO THE SOUTHEAST MISSOURIAN\n\n Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to a \nhistorically significant anniversary for one of Southeast Missouri's \nmost widely recognized and respected institutions. For the past year, \nthe Southeast Missourian, located in Cape Girardeau, MO, has been \ncelebrating its grand centennial.\n  Its first issue rolled off the presses on October 3, 1904, with \nGeorge and Fred Naeter at the helm. The brothers had purchased the \nsmall business with hopes of one day transforming it into the thriving \ncompany thousands of faithful readers are familiar with today. After a \nnumber changes, the Southeast Missourian was formally dedicated on \nSeptember 11, 1925, at 301 Broadway.\n  Over the past several decades, the Southeast Missourian has provided \ntimely reporting of the important changes in the region. Much of the \narea surrounding Cape Girardeau is rural. The Southeast Missourian has \nbeen a primary source of information to those readers. They depend on \nthe Southeast Missourian for local, statewide, national and world news.\n  From the reports on flooding along the banks of the Mississippi \nRiver, to the birth announcements in the Sunday edition, the Southeast \nMissourian has a unique appeal that is difficult to match. They have \nset a precedent for excellence in print journalism with the underlying \ntheme of community and public service. It's been a personal privilege \nover the years to be covered by the paper's news department and to \ndiscuss ideas with its editorial board.\n  The Southeast Missourian has been instrumental in collaborating with \nits host city of Cape Girardeau to strengthen the community through \nlocal enterprise. And year after year the newspaper continues to give \nback countless chartable donations and sponsorships to the community.\n  I express my sincerest gratitude to the entire staff, past and \npresent, for their contribution and dedication in making the Southeast \nMissourian the publication it is today. I extend warm congratulations \nto the Rust family, which has continued to raise the bar year after \nyear in achieving excellence for fair and objective journalism. Joe \nSullivan, the editor of the paper, in particular deserves credit for \nhis hard work and professionalism. I hope for the next 100 years, the \nSoutheast Missourian will continue to make a difference for the good in \nSoutheast Missouri.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/28/senate-section/article/S10592-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10592]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/28/senate-section/article/S10592-3", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10592]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a treaty which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/28/senate-section/article/S10592-4", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10592-S10593]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  At 9:34 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       H.R. 2385.

A bill to amend the Humane Methods of Livestock Slaughter \nAct of 1958 to ensure the humane slaughter of nonambulatory livestock, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Downed Animal \nProtection Act, legislation intended to protect people from the \nunnecessary spread of disease. This bill would prohibit the use of \nnonambulatory animals for human consumption.\n  Nonambulatory animals, also known as downed animals, are livestock \nsuch as cattle, sheep, swine, goats, horses, mules, or other equines \nthat are too sick to stand or walk unassisted. Many of these animals \nare dying from infectious diseases and present a significant pathway \nfor the spread of disease.\n  The safety of our Nation's food supply is of the utmost importance. \nWith the presence of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), also known \nas mad-cow disease, and other strains of transmissible spongiform \nencephalopathies (TSE), which are related animal diseases found not \nonly in nearby countries but also in the United States, it is important \nthat we take all measures necessary to ensure that our food is safe.\n  Currently, before slaughter, the United States Department of \nAgriculture's (USDA) Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS) diverts \ndowner livestock only if they exhibit clinical signs associated with \nBSE. Routinely, BSE is not correctly distinguished from many other \ndiseases and conditions that show similar symptoms. The ante-mortem \ninspection that is currently used in the United States is very similar \nto the inspection process in Europe, which has proved to be inadequate \nfor detecting BSE. Consequently, if BSE were present in a U.S. downed \nanimal, it could currently be offered for slaughter. If the animal \nshowed no clinical signs of the disease, the animal would then pass an \nante-mortem inspection, making the diseased animal available for human \nconsumption. The BSE agent could then cross-contaminate the normally \nsafe muscle tissue during slaughter and processing. The disposal of \ndowner livestock would ensure that the BSE agent would not be recycled \nto contaminate otherwise safe meat.\n  There are other TSE diseases already known to us such as scrapie that \naffects sheep and goats, chronic wasting disease in deer and elk, and \nclassic Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease in humans, all of which are present \nin the United States. Because our knowledge of such diseases are \nlimited, the inclusion of horses, mules, swine, and other equine in \nthis act are a necessary precaution. This precautionary measure is \nneeded in order to ensure that the human population is not affected by \ndiseased livestock. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has already \ncreated regulations that prevent imports of all live cattle and other \nruminants and certain ruminant products from countries where BSE is \nknown to exist. In 1997, the FDA placed a prohibition on the use of all \nmammalian protein, with a few exceptions, in animal feeds given to \ncattle and other ruminants. These regulations are a good start in \nprotecting us from the possible spread of BSE, however, they do not go \nfar enough. Because they still allow the processing of downer cattle.\n  According to a study performed by the Harvard School of the Public \nHealth in conjunction with the USDA and surveillance data from European \ncountries, downer cattle are among the highest risk population for BSE. \nAccording to the Harvard Study, the removal of nonambulatory cattle \nfrom the population intended for slaughter would reduce the probability \nof spreading BSE by 82 percent. The USDA and the FDA have acknowledged \nthat downed animals serve as a potential pathway for the spread of BSE. \nWhile both have entertained the idea of prohibiting the rendering of \ndowned cattle, they have taken no formal action. It is imperative that \nwe, Congress, ensure that downer livestock does not enter our food \nchain, and the best way to accomplish this task is to codify the \nprohibition of downer livestock from entering our food supply.\n  The Downed Animal Protection Act fills a gap in the current USDA and \nFDA regulations. The bill calls for the humane euthanization of \nnonambulatory livestock, both for interstate and foreign commerce. The \neuthanization of nonambulatory livestock would remove this high risk \npopulation from the portion of livestock reserved for our consumption. \nDue to the presence of other TSE diseases found throughout other \nspecies of livestock, all animals that fit under the definition of \nlivestock will be included in this bill.\n  The benefits of my bill are numerous, for both the public and the \nindustry. On the face of it, the bill will prevent needless suffering \nby humanely euthanizing nonambulatory animals. The removal of downed \nanimals from our products will insure that they are safer and of better \nquality. The reduction in the likelihood of the spread of diseases \nwould result in safer working conditions for persons handling \nlivestock. This added protection against disease would help the flow of \nlivestock and livestock products in interstate and foreign commerce, \nmaking commerce in livestock more easily attainable.\n  Some individuals fear that this bill would place an excessive \nfinancial burden on the livestock industry. I want to remind my \ncolleagues that one single downed cow in Canada diagnosed with BSE in \n2003 shut down the world's third largest beef exporter. It is estimated \nthat the Canadian beef industry lost more than $1 billion when more \nthan 30 countries banned Canadian cattle and beef upon the discovery of \nBSE. As the Canadian cattle industry continues to recover from its \neconomic loss, it is prudent for the United States to be proactive in \npreventing BSE and other animal diseases from entering our food chain.\n  Today, the USDA has increased its efforts to test approximately ten \npercent of downed cattle per year for BSE.\n\n[[Page S10597]]\n\nHowever, it is my understanding that the USDA is looking to revisit \nthis issue. I do not believe that now is the time to lower our \ndefenses. We must protect our livestock industry and human health from \ndiseases such as BSE. This bill reduces the threat of passing diseases \nfrom downed livestock to our food supply. It ensures downed animals \nwill not be used for human consumption. It also requires higher \nstandards for food safety and protects the human population from \ndiseases and the livestock industry from economic distress.\n  American consumers should be able to rely on the Federal Government \nto ensure that meat and meat by-products are safe for human \nconsumption. I urge my colleagues to support this important bill. I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the measure be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1779\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nincentives for charitable contributions by individuals and businesses, \nto improve the public disclosure of activities of exempt organizations, \nand to enhance the ability of low-income Americans to gain financial \nsecurity by building assets, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the CARE Act of 2005 \nalong with Senator Lieberman, a bill we have been trying to push \nthrough Congress since 2000. However, at no point in the past five \nyears has the passage of this bill been so timely.\n  At a time where America appears divided on a War on Terror, Supreme \nCourt nominations, and the relief effort in the gulf region, Americans \nare unified in their support of charitable organizations. In a recent \nZogby poll, 86 percent of those polled rated private charities' \nresponse to Hurricane Katrina as excellent or good. By contrast, 32 \npercent described the government's response as excellent or good, and \n67 percent said fair or poor.\n  The work of charitable organizations and their volunteers have been \ninspirational at a time when many feel hopeless. I recently held a \nhearing in the Finance Subcommittee of Social Security and Family \nPolicy to hear from charitable organizations about their efforts around \nthe gulf coast. Though the hearing was scheduled before the events of \nHurricane Katrina, the amazing work being done by these organizations \nhighlighted the need for charitable incentives to continue and expand \nthe generosity we are seeing.\n  In response to Hurricane Katrina, we have seen organizations such as \nAmerica's Second Harvest and the Florida Boulevard Baptist Church feed \nthe hungry. We have seen that within 48 hours of Katrina, the Nation's \nfraternal benefit societies were feeding, housing, and providing \nsupplies, clothes, toiletries, cash and beds to those in need in \nshelters both in Houston and in New Orleans. During the first week of \nthis effort, fraternals had already expended upwards of $14 million on \nhurricane relief, a sum which is expected to increase as these efforts \nbroaden. We see community foundations, such as the Baton Rouge Area \nFoundation, literally saving people's lives by helping Louisiana State \nUniversity open a field hospital for 1,000 people in an old Kmart. And \nwe see national organizations such as the YMCA of the USA providing \nprogram services such as emergency child care, recreation, and grief \ncounseling. The YMCA has provided showers and other physical comforts \nand opened up their facilities as staging areas for relief, recovery \nand clean-up efforts. And the list goes on and on and on--not even \nconsidering the response of these same organizations and many others to \nHurricane Rita.\n  The CARE Act is a bipartisan bill that received strong bipartisan \nsupport as it passed the Senate in the 108th Congress by a vote of 95-\n5. The House of Representatives passed companion legislation, the \nCharitable Giving Act, by a vote of 408-13. Sadly, this bill was \nblocked this bill from going to conference despite overwhelming support \nfrom both Houses and the general public.\n  The CARE Act of 2005 provides commonsense provisions to induce \ncharitable giving. Among these include the above-the-line deduction for \nnon-itemizers. More than two-thirds of Americans do not itemize on \ntheir tax returns, yet this group is estimated to contribute $36 \nbillion to charities. Research indicates that lower and moderate-income \nindividuals are more likely not to itemize on their tax returns, and \nthat they give a greater percentage of their incomes to charity than \nhigher income individuals. It is only fair that they benefit for their \ngenerosity. As Major Hood from the Salvation Army\n\n[[Page S10598]]\n\nso eloquently wrote in his testimony at my hearing, ``[t]he provision \nallowing non-itemizers to deduct charitable contributions can only \nencourage those Americans with smaller incomes--including young \nprofessionals who might otherwise be inclined to begin a lifetime of \nannual giving--to contribute to worthy causes. We do not discriminate \namong those in need, and we ask Congress not to discriminate in \nproviding tax incentives for charitable giving.''\n\n  Additionally, the CARE Act calls for tax-free IRA charitable \ndistributions for individuals aged 70\\1/2\\ and over. My home State of \nPennsylvania has the second highest percentage of seniors in the \ncountry. Many of these older Americans want to experience the joy of \nmaking a difference by giving, and this provision provides them that \nopportunity. Certainly, these individuals should not be penalized for \ncontributing portions of their life's savings to a worthy cause.\n  Organizations have been generous during this crisis by donating food \nto those who need it. The CARE Act provides expanded incentives that \nwill yield an estimated $2 billion worth of food donations from \nfarmers, restaurants, and corporations to help those in need. America's \nSecond Harvest estimates that this is the equivalent of 878 million \nmeals for hungry Americans over 10 years. Last year, the North American \nMission Board of the Southern Baptist Convention helped provide 3 \nmillion meals to hungry people. At the time of my hearing they were \nfeeding hurricane victims 250,000 meals each day. By allowing \nbusinesses to recoup production costs this provision will incentivize \nfood donations and help our action fight hunger. For the first time, \nfarmers, ranchers, small business and restaurant owners will benefit \nfrom the same tax incentives afforded major corporate donors for the \ndonation of food to the needy.\n  The CARE Act also provides asset building initiatives for low-income \nindividuals. Low-income Americans face a huge hurdle when trying to \nsave. Individual Development Accounts, IDAs, provide them with a way to \nwork toward building assets while instilling the practice of saving \ninto their everyday lives. IDAs are one of the most promising tools \nthat enable low-income and low-wealth American families to save, build \nassets, and enter the financial mainstream. Based on the idea that all \nAmericans should have access, through the tax code or through direct \nexpenditures, to the structures that subsidize homeownership and \nretirement savings of wealthier families, IDAs encourage savings \nefforts among the poor by offering them a one-to-one match for their \nown deposits. IDAs reward the monthly savings of working-poor families \nwho are trying to buy their first home, pay for post-secondary \neducation, or start a small business. These matched savings accounts \nare similar to 401(k) plans and other matched savings accounts, but can \nserve a broad range of purposes.\n  We have also seen the philanthropy of corporations such as Home Depot \nand Coca-Cola Company. The Home Depot Foundation has donated nearly $4 \nmillion to assist in the relief efforts. Coca-Cola Company donated $5 \nmillion and water and other beverages to the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency for its relief efforts. This is an appropriate time \nto gradually raise the caps on corporate contributions from 10 to 20 \npercent to encourage corporations to continue their social \nresponsibility. We must also level the playing field for all corporate \ndonations by expanding charitable incentives for S corporations to \nincrease charitable giving.\n  In my home State of Pennsylvania, I have worked closely with the \nPennsylvania Association of Nonprofit Organizations. I have heard from \nmany of the nonprofits in my State about the pressing need for the \ncharitable incentives we have in the CARE Act.\n  The time is now to expand charitable giving, both in my home State \nand throughout the Nation. One certainty we have seen is in every \ndisaster that occurs in the United States and around the world is the \ndesire of fellow Americans to help those that are in need. We should \ncommend that generosity by passing this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 1781.

Mr. President, just this past May, I stood at a gas \nstation in Salt Lake City and announced the introduction of S. 1039, \nthe Gas Price Reduction Through Increased Refining Capacity Act of \n2005.\n  By standing near a gas pump charging $2.25 per gallon, I thought I \nwas making a strong statement about the high price of gas and the need \nfor greater refining capacity in our country.\n  That was only a few months ago, but hurricanes Katrina and Rita have \nsince exposed the vulnerability of our Nation's refining \ninfrastructure, and the gas prices in May now seem like the good old \ndays.\n  I am pleased that the energy bill signed by President Bush this \nsummer included the principal concept of S. 1039--that of providing a \nstrong tax incentive to expand refinery capacity by allowing the cost \nto be written off immediately. Unfortunately, because of budget \nrestrictions, my legislation had to be cut.\n  I have long been concerned that our shrinking number of refineries \nand their proximity to our Nation's coasts pose an unacceptable risk to \nour economic and strategic security. I thought cutting S. 1039 was a \nmistake at the time, and now I am hoping Congress will remedy that \nmistake.\n  Today, I rise to reintroduce those portions of my refining capacity \nlegislation that were left out of the energy bill and call upon my \ncolleagues to help me finish what was begun with my original bill.\n  My new legislation, the Refinery Investment Tax Assistance Act, would \nenhance the incentives made in the energy bill by increasing the short-\nterm incentive to add new and expanded refining facilities and by \nremoving the obstacle of long tax depreciation schedules that \nrefineries face.\n  For those refiners able to commit to installing new refining \nequipment before 2008 and to have that added capacity built by 2012, my \noriginal bill would have allowed a complete write-off for investments \nin new refining equipment in the first year. As passed by Congress, \nthough, this provision was cut for budgetary reasons to allow for \nexpensing of only 50 percent of the costs in the first year. The \nlegislation I am introducing today would enhance that to allow for the \nfull 100 percent expensing in the first year. Now, more than ever, we \nneed to use every possible means to increase the security of our fuel \nsupply.\n  This bill would also restore another very important provision of S. \n1039 that was dropped out of the energy bill as a cost savings. This \nprovision would help to remove some of the disparity the refining \nindustry faces in our current tax system. Most manufacturers in our \ncountry are able to depreciate the cost of their new equipment over \nfive years. Refineries, on the other hand, are strapped with a full 10-\nyear depreciation period. This unfair treatment of our refining \nindustry acts as a long-term obstacle to new investment in increased \ncapacity. The current 10-year depreciation schedule for refiners is \nunwarranted, and it is past time that we level the playing field on \ndepreciation for this critically important sector of our energy \nindustry.\n  On September 6, in the aftermath of Katrina, Mr. Bob Slaughter of the \nNational Petrochemical & Refiners Association testified before the \nSenate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. He said that an \nimportant solution to our energy crisis would be to ``[e]xpand the \nrefining tax incentive provision in the Energy Act. Reduce the \ndepreciation period for refining investments from 10 to seven or five \nyears in order to remove a current disincentive for refining \ninvestment. Allow expensing under the current language to take place as \nthe investment is made rather than when the equipment is actually \nplaced in service. Or the percentage expensed could be increased as per \nthe original legislation introduced by Senator Hatch.''\n  I think it is important to recognize that, over time, this \nlegislation will not cost the U.S. Treasury one dime. It would allow \nrefineries to change the timing of the depreciation of their equipment, \nbut not the amount. And, we should keep in mind that when this\n\n[[Page S10599]]\n\nbill leads to more refineries and increased capacity, we will have also \nincreased the tax base.\n  I want to throw my full support behind the proposals recently \nannounced by House Energy and Commerce Chairman Barton and House \nResource Committee Chairman Pombo, which would take other approaches to \nincrease the number of refineries in our Nation. From both a national \nsecurity and an energy security perspective, I especially endorse a \nproposal by Chairman Pombo to locate more refineries on public lands \nnear oil resource deposits. Such a move will make our Nation more \nsecure from attacks from terrorists and from Mother Nature. I \nunderstand that Senate Energy and Natural Resource Committee Chairman \nPete Domenici is promoting similar proposals on the Senate side. And I \napplaud these men for their leadership.\n  We have learned that when it comes to our Nation's energy security, \nrefining is where we are the most vulnerable. It is not the time for \nhalf measures, but bold immediate action to establish a secure and \nindependent refining program in this country. I hope my colleagues will \njoin me in my efforts to achieve this goal. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1781\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to promote a \nculture of safety within the health care system through the \nestablishment of a National Medical Error Disclosure and Compensation \nProgram; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce \nlegislation that will improve patient safety while helping to provide \nsome relief to health care providers dealing with escalating medical \nliability costs.\n  We are dealing with a medical malpractice problem in this country \nthat is jeopardizing patient safety and hurting our health care system. \nAs I visit with doctors and hospitals in New York and around the \nNation, I hear about the pressures and problems of escalating medical \nmalpractice insurance premiums.\n  These high premiums are forcing many physicians to alter their \npractice of medicine and leaving some patients without access to \nnecessary medical care. In my State of New York, an unacceptable 40 \npercent of our counties have less than 5 practicing obstetricians.\n  At the same time, we have all heard the terrifying statistic from the \nlandmark 1999 IOM report stating that as many as 98,000 deaths every \nyear are the result of medical errors. But, far fewer people know that \nthe IOM suggests that 90 percent of medical errors are the result of \nfailed systems and procedures, not the negligence of physicians.\n  We must do better. If properly designed, these systems and procedures \ncould go a long way towards seriously reducing medical errors.\n  But, understanding the root causes of errors requires their \ndisclosure and analysis. And that's the fundamental tension between the \nmedical liability system and our common goal of providing high quality \ncare and improving patient safety in the health care system.\n  Studies have consistently shown that health care providers are \nreticent to engage in patient safety activities and be open about \nerrors because they believe they are being asked to do so without \nappropriate assurances of legal protection.\n\n  That's where this legislation comes in. We build on the patient \nsafety bill that was signed into law earlier this summer by creating a \nvoluntary program to encourage disclosure of errors, an opportunity to \nenter negotiations and early settlement, while, at the same time, \nprotecting patients' rights and providing liability protection for \nhealth care providers who participate in the program.\n  Our bill is designed to bridge the gap between the medical liability \nand patient safety systems for the benefit of patients and providers.\n  The truly unfortunate result of the current congressional stalemate \nover caps is that patients and physicians are left waiting for someone \nto break the logjam and work to find bipartisan solutions that have an \nopportunity to mitigate this problem. I believe it's critical that we \nfind a way around this stalemate and that Congress work in good faith \nto find solutions that can garner enough support to find their way to \nthe President's desk.\n  I believe that this is an exciting and innovative program that will \nimprove patient-physician communication, reduce the rates of \npreventable patient injury, reduce the liability insurance premiums \nthat physicians are facing, and insure that patients have access to \nfair compensation for medical injury: Four fundamental goals that I \nbelieve are necessary components of any solution we consider.\n  There are a number of successful programs across the country that are \nconsistent with the provisions of our legislation, including one at the \nUniversity of Michigan, and even one initiated by a medical malpractice \ninsurance provider in Colorado. I am excited about the results these \nprograms are producing--fewer numbers of suits being filed, more \npatients being compensated for injuries, greater patient trust and \nsatisfaction, and significantly reduced administrative and legal \ndefense costs for providers, insurers, and hospitals where these \nprograms are in place.\n  I am hopeful that our legislation will provide an opportunity for \nmore hospitals and physicians to use this program and see for \nthemselves the benefits they--and their patients--will reap.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to join Senator Clinton \nto introduce legislation that will help us all find common ground on \nthe debate over patient safety and medical malpractice claims.\n  Today, medical error is the eighth leading cause of death in the \nUnited States. Every year, these tragic mistakes cost the lives of up \nto 98,000 Americans. This is unacceptable in America, and we must do \nmore to ensure that every patient gets the right care, at the right \ntime, in the right way.\n  The debate in Washington over this issue has been centered on caps \nand lawsuits. But across America, hospitals and medical providers are \nproving that\n\n[[Page S10600]]\n\nthere's a better way to protect patients and doctors, all while raising \nthe quality of our care and lowering its cost.\n  From the Children's Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota to the VA \nhospital in Lexington, Kentucky, doctors and administrators aren't \ntrying to cover up medical errors--They're trying to admit them. \nInstead of closing ranks and keeping the patient in the dark, they're \ninvestigating potential errors, apologizing if mistakes have been made, \nand offering a reasonable settlement that keeps the case out of court.\n  This program is often known as ``Sorry Works,'' and it's led to some \namazing results. When patients are treated with respect and told the \ntruth, they sue less. More are actually compensated for their injuries, \nbut medical providers pay less because the reward is the result of a \nsettlement, not an expensive lawsuit. Malpractice costs for doctors go \ndown, and health care professionals actually learn from their mistakes \nso they're not repeated and lives are saved.\n  At the VA hospital in Lexington, Kentucky, this program has reduced \nthe average settlement to $16,000, compared with $98,000 nationwide. \nThis ranked in the lowest quartile of all VA facilities for malpractice \npayouts. At the University of Michigan's hospital system, this program \nhelped them cut their lawsuits in half and save up to $2 million in \ndefense litigation.\n  The bill we're introducing today builds on these hopeful results and \nincorporates them into a national program. The National Medical Error \nDisclosure and Compensation Act, or MEDiC Act, will help reduce medical \nerror rates and medical malpractice costs by opening the lines of \ncommunication between doctors and patients--encouraging honesty and \naccountability in the process.\n  The bill will also set up a National Patient Safety Database, which \nwill be used to determine best practices in preventing medical errors, \nimproving patient safety, and increasing accountability in the \nhealthcare system.\n  We expect participants to see a cost savings, and we will require \nthem to reinvest a portion of these savings into patient quality \nmeasures that will reduce medical errors. This bill also requires that \nsome of these savings are passed along to providers in the form of \nlower malpractice insurance premiums.\n  Certainly, these are lofty goals. But what Senator Clinton and I hope \nto do with this legislation is promote the type of creative thinking \nthat will be required if this country is going to overcome some of the \ngridlock in the healthcare debate. The MEDiC Act of 2005 brings \ntogether some of the best ideas currently out there, and I hope my \ncolleagues in the Senate will work with Senator Clinton and me to put \nthese ideas in action.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Hatch, and Mr. Kohl):\n  S. 1785. A bill to amend chapter 13 of title 17, United States Code \n(relating to the vessel hull design protection), to clarify the \ndistinction between a hull and a deck, to provide factors for the \ndetermination of the protectability of a revised design, to provide \nguidance for assessments of substantial similarity, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise today along with the Senior Senator \nfrom Vermont in introducing the Vessel Hull Design Protection Act \nAmendments of 2005. This is the third recent piece of legislation on \nwhich I have teamed with Senator Leahy--first working together on \nimportant reforms to the Freedom of Information Act and then joining to \nintroduce significant counterfeiting prevention legislation. I am glad \nto continue our work by introducing this legislation which, though \nseemingly technical and minor, offers very important clarifications \nabout the scope of protections available to boat designs.\n  Boat designs, like any technical designs, are complex and are the \nresult of a great deal of hard work and contribution of intellectual \nproperty. Accordingly, Congress enacted the Vessel Hull Design \nProtection Act in 1998 to provide necessary protections that were not \npresent among copyright statutes prior to that time. The Act has been \ninstrumental for the continued development and protection of boat \ndesigns but unfortunately recently has encountered a few hurdles.\n  A recent court decision raised questions about the scope of \nprotections available to various boat designs. Justifiably or not, this \ninterpretation under the VHDPA unfortunately has led many in the boat \nmanufacturing industry to conclude that the Act's provisions are not \neffective at protecting vessel designs. Intellectual property \nprotection of those designs is critical to these manufacturers in order \nto encourage innovative design and clarification is needed.\n  The legislation we offer will clarify that the protections accorded \nto a vessel design can be used to separately protect a vessel's hull \nand/or deck as well as a plug or mold of either the hull or deck. The \nproposed amendments would make clear that it remains possible for boat \ndesigners to seek protection for both the hull and the deck, and plug \nor mold of both, of a single vessel, and many designers no doubt will \ncontinue to do so. However, these amendments are intended to clarify \nthat protection under the VHDPA for these vessel elements may be \nanalyzed separately.\n  This bipartisan legislation provides the necessary assurance to boat \nmanufacturers that the Vessel Hull Design Protection Act will remain a \nvital intellectual property protection statute. The bill offers very \nimportant clarifications about the scope of protections available to \nboat designs and will be welcome news to boat makers across the Nation \nand in Texas. The thousands of miles of coastline in Texas, and all the \nlakes and rivers in between, provide significant opportunities for \nrecreational and commercial boating throughout the State. This \nlegislation will ensure that there will be continued innovation in the \ndesign and manufacture of boats for many years to come.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1785\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Vessel Hull Design \n     Protection Amendments of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DESIGNS PROTECTED.\n\n       Section 1301(a) of title 17, United States Code, is amended \n     by striking paragraph (2) and inserting the following:\n       ``(2) Vessel features.--The design of a vessel hull or \n     deck, including a plug or mold, is subject to protection \n     under this chapter, notwithstanding section 1302(4).''.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       Section 1301(b) of title 17, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (2), by striking ``vessel hull, including \n     a plug or mold,'' and inserting ``vessel hull or deck, \n     including a plug or mold,'';\n       (2) by striking paragraph (4) and inserting the following:\n       ``(4) A `hull' is the exterior frame or body of a vessel, \n     exclusive of the deck, superstructure, masts, sails, yards, \n     rigging, hardware, fixtures, and other attachments.''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(7) A `deck' is the horizontal surface of a vessel that \n     covers the hull, including exterior cabin and cockpit \n     surfaces, and exclusive of masts, sails, yards, rigging, \n     hardware, fixtures, and other attachments.''.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Senator Cornyn and I have already worked \ntogether on significant Freedom of Information Act legislation and on \ncounterfeiting legislation during the first session of this Congress. \nToday, we are introducing another bill and taking our partnership to \nthe high seas, or at least to our Nation's boat manufacturing industry, \nwith the Vessel Hull Design Protection Act Amendments of 2005.\n  Designs of boat vessel hulls are often the result of a great deal of \ntime, effort, and financial investment. They are afforded intellectual \nproperty protection under the Vessel Hull Design Protection Act that \nCongress passed in 1998. This law exists for the same reason that other \nworks enjoy intellectual property rights: to encourage continued \ninnovation, to protect the works that emerge from the creative process, \nand to reward the creators. Recent courtroom experience has made it \nclear that the protections Congress. passed seven years ago need some \nstatutory refinement to ensure they meet the purposes we envisioned. \nThe Vessel Hull Design Protection Act Amendments shore up the law, \nmaking an important clarification about the scope of\n\n[[Page S10601]]\n\nthe protections available to boat designs.\n  We continue to be fascinated with, and in so many ways dependent on, \nbodies of water, both for recreation and commerce. More than fifty \npercent of Americans live on or near the coastline in this country. We \nseem always to be drawn to the water, whether it is the beautiful Lake \nChamplain in my home State of Vermont or the world's large oceans. And \nas anyone who has visited our seaports can attest, much of our commerce \ninvolves sea travel. I would like to thank Senators Kohl and Hatch for \ncosponsoring this legislation. Protecting boat designs and encouraging \ninnovation in those designs are worthy aims, and I hope we can move \nquickly to pass this bipartisan legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/28/senate-section/article/S10601-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10601-S10602]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 254--MARKING THE DEDICATION OF THE GAYLORD NELSON \n        WILDERNESS WITHIN THE APOSTLE ISLANDS NATIONAL LAKESHORE\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself and Mr. Kohl) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources:\n\n                              S. Res. 254\n\n       Whereas the Honorable Gaylord Nelson, a State Senator, \n     Governor, and United States Senator from Wisconsin, devoted \n     his life to protecting the environment by championing issues \n     of land protection, wildlife habitat, environmental health, \n     and increased environmental awareness, including founding \n     Earth Day;\n       Whereas the Honorable Gaylord Nelson authored the Apostle \n     Islands National Lakeshore Act, which led to the protection \n     of one of the most beautiful areas in Wisconsin and \n     recognized the rich assemblage of natural resources, cultural \n     heritage, and scenic features on Wisconsin's north coast and \n     21 islands of the 22-island archipelago;\n       Whereas the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore was \n     designated a National Park on September 26, 1970;\n       Whereas, on December 8, 2004, approximately 80 percent of \n     the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore was designated the \n     Gaylord Nelson Wilderness;\n       Whereas the Gaylord Nelson Wilderness within the Apostle \n     Islands National Lakeshore provides a refuge for many species \n     of birds, including threatened bald eagles and endangered \n     piping plovers, herring-billed gulls, double-crested \n     cormorants, and great blue herons, and is a safe haven for a \n     variety of amphibians, such as blue-spotted salamanders, red-\n     backed salamanders, gray treefrogs, and mink frogs, and is a \n     sanctuary for several mammals, including river otters, black \n     bears, snowshoe hares, and fishers;\n       Whereas the official dedication of the Gaylord Nelson \n     Wilderness occurred on August 8, 2005, 36 days after the \n     Honorable Gaylord Nelson's passing; and\n       Whereas the Honorable Gaylord Nelson changed the \n     consciousness of our Nation and embodied the principle that 1 \n     person can change the world, and the creation of the Gaylord \n     Nelson Wilderness is a small, but fitting, recognition of his \n     efforts: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the Honorable Gaylord Nelson's environmental \n     legacy;\n       (2) celebrates the dedication of the Gaylord Nelson \n     Wilderness within the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore; and\n       (3) requests that the Secretary of the Senate transmit an \n     enrolled copy of this resolution to the family of the \n     Senator.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, December 8, 2004, approximately 80 \npercent of the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore in Wisconsin was \ndesignated the Gaylord Nelson Wilderness. Although we did not formally \ncelebrate the new wilderness area until August 8, 2005, we have been \ndelighting in the designation ever since December of last year.\n  The designation of the Gaylord Nelson Wilderness within the Apostle \nIslands National Lakeshore on August 8, 2005 was a tremendous occasion \nfor both Wisconsin and the country. I was deeply honored to participate \nin the ceremony marking the creation of the Gaylord Nelson Wilderness. \nI knew Gaylord, and am proud to occupy his Senate seat. Like all of \nthose in attendance at the dedication ceremony, including Tia Nelson, \nGovernor Doyle, Congressman Obey, local officials, tribal chairs, and \nmany others, I was deeply saddened that Gaylord wasn't able to be \nsitting among us, having passed away on July 3, 2005.\n  However, I do believe that, because the area, the magnificent \nApostles, and the wilderness designation we were celebrating were such \na part of Gaylord, he was in fact there with us that day, urging us to \nmark the achievement and to continue his life's work of building a \nnational conservation ethic. As we all know, while his record of \nachievements is long and impressive, it is Senator Nelson's passion and \ncommitment to protecting our environment that will remain the \ncenterpiece of his legacy. For this reason, Senator Kohl and I have \nsubmitted a resolution to bring recognition to Gaylord's unwavering \nefforts on behalf of the environment and to celebrate the dedication of \na wilderness area rightly named in his honor.\n  Gaylord so believed in his responsibility to the environment that he \nstarted a revolution that has inspired millions of people from across \nthe globe. The day he created in 1970--Earth Day--has become a cause \nfor celebration, education, and reflection for all. Simply stated, \nGaylord Nelson changed the consciousness of a Nation, and quite \npossibly the world. He was a distinguished Governor and Senator, a \nrecipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and a personal hero of \nmine. Most importantly, he was the embodiment of the principle that one \nperson can change the world.\n  August 8, 2005 marked the beginning of a new period for the Apostle \nIslands and I could not be more proud of this. In 1998, Representative \nObey and I asked for a wilderness survey. Seven years later, we finally \ngathered to salute the awe-inspiring resource as well as the man who \ndedicated himself to protecting our environment, particularly those \nplaces where we humans are but humble visitors--wilderness areas. Let \nus not forget, however, that before we could talk about having a \nwilderness area within the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore, we had \nto have a National Lakeshore. I am sure it will come as no surprise \nthat Gaylord was essential in the effort to recognize the Apostle \nIslands as a national treasure.\n\n  The wild and primitive nature of the Apostles and now the Gaylord \nNelson Wilderness has always been an attraction, not only for Wisconsin \nresidents but for people from across the globe. At the Apostles you can \nfind pristine old growth forests; wetlands that are home to an \nastounding ecological diversity; birds that travel long distances and \nuse the islands for respite; and amphibians, which can act as \nindicators of the Park's environmental health.\n  It is a truly amazing place.\n  And people know it. In fact, just recently, the Apostles was rated \nthe #1 National Park in the U.S. by National Geographic Traveler. The \nrating was based on a variety of factors, most notably environmental \nand ecological quality, social and cultural integrity, and the outlook \nfor the future.\n  We have it all in the Park--ecological and cultural resources \nintertwined with one another. The history of the islands is a history \nof people living off, and very much in balance with, the land and water \nsurrounding them. A visit to the Apostles and the Gaylord Nelson \nWilderness can be, if we let go of the trappings of modern society, an \nenlightening voyage that challenges us to think about those who came \nbefore us, those who will follow us, and the connections between us and \nthe natural resources we depend on for our survival.\n  The Ojibwae, who Wisconsinites know were the original inhabitants of \nthe Apostles, had great respect for the resources. They believed in \ntaking something only if they were giving something in return. The \nOjibwae people understood their dependence on the environment long \nbefore many others began contemplating such a relationship. \nUnfortunately, as a society, we have not always heeded their example. \nWe must be better stewards of our land, our air, and our water. Gaylord \npushed us toward that goal every day of his life. And, what better way \nto mark the dedication of the Wilderness Area named in his honor than \nfor each of us to dedicate ourselves to actively carrying his legacy \nforward. That is Gaylord's challenge for all of us.\n  So many people supported the creation of the Lakeshore and the \nWilderness area. The support has taken many forms--all of which have \nadded to the success of our Park and the wilderness designation. I am \nespecially grateful for the families who have donated their properties, \nmany of which are filled with childhood and other cherished family \nmemories, for the betterment of\n\n[[Page S10602]]\n\nthe whole Apostle Islands and now the Gaylord Nelson Wilderness. Future \ngenerations whom none of us will ever know will benefit deeply from \ntheir commitment to one of Wisconsin's most treasured places.\n  Every time I visit the Apostles and pieces of what are now the \nGaylord Nelson Wilderness, I depart with a sense of inner peace and \nclarity. A New York Times journalist wrote about the Apostle Islands \nNational Lakeshore in 1972, saying he encountered a ``silence so \nintense you can hear it.'' I believe that what all those who visit the \nGaylord Nelson Wilderness are bound to hear through that ``intense \nsilence'' is Gaylord himself calling them to action.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/28/senate-section/article/S10602-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10602]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 255--RECOGNIZING THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE UNITED \n  STATES FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE AND THE WATERFOWL POPULATION SURVEY\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN (for herself and Mr. Cochran) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution that \nhonors the extraordinary heroics exhibited by employees of the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs in the response to the catastrophic \nconditions caused by Hurricane Katrina.\n  The Department of Veterans Affairs operates 11 medical centers, 18 \ncommunity-based outpatient clinics, three regional offices, and eight \nnational cemeteries in the States of Alabama, Mississippi, and \nLouisiana. Throughout this tragedy, VA moved employees, their families, \nequipment, and even patients from many of these places. Incredibly with \nover 1,000 people evacuated in total, not one life was lost.\n  While it is impossible for me to recognize every act of bravery and \ncourage exhibited, I would be remiss if I did not highlight the \nincredible story of two VA nurses and their efforts to ensure continued \npatient care during the aftermath of Katrina. These two nurses not only \nbraved the danger of the storm, but they risked their own lives to \nensure that their patients could survive. These two women fed their own \nwater supply to their patients, and, even more incredibly, they then \nadministered intravenous fluids to one another to stay hydrated so that \nthey could continue to deliver care. Clear1y, this was going far above \nand beyond the call of duty. The example set by these two courageous \nwomen must be recognized.\n  I also want to note that VA's success in responding to this storm was \nlargely due to the extensive preparation by VA workers before Katrina \nhit the Gulf Region. This preparation ensured the successful \nadministration of continued medical care to veterans upon relocation as \nwell as the safe evacuation of all staff and their families.\n  Before the storm hit, VA workers oversaw the evacuation of 166 \npatients in Mississippi and Louisiana. In addition, VA workers had the \nforesight to transfer copies of electronic medical records from the New \nOrleans VA Medical Center to the VA facility in Houston so that those \nrecords would be available on a national level. The bottom line is that \nthis careful preparation before the storm hit saved lives.\n  The examples of sacrifice and heroics are countless. But, I don't \nwant to forget those who simply stayed put in the right place and did \ntheir job--sometimes for days on end. I am speaking most specifically \nof the valiant efforts of the employees in the VA facilities throughout \nTexas. These dedicated doctors, nurses, and supporting staff worked \ncountless hours providing medical assistance, shelter and comfort to \nthe evacuated VA patients, employees, and their families.\n  As Chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, it is my \ndistinct honor to commend the heroic efforts of VA workers throughout \nthe country in this resolution. I am also pleased to note that Ranking \nMember Akaka has joined with me in expressing our sincere appreciation. \nThe devastation of Hurricane Katrina is something with which we are all \nfamiliar. It gives me great pleasure to highlight the dedication, \nsacrifice, and courage of VA workers in light of the terrible \ndevastation caused by what many have called the worst natural disaster \nin our Nation's history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/28/senate-section/article/S10603-3", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10603-S10604]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 54--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS \n    REGARDING A COMMEMORATIVE POSTAGE STAMP HONORING JASPER FRANCIS \n   CROPSEY, THE FAMOUS STATEN ISLAND-BORN 19TH CENTURY HUDSON RIVER \n                                PAINTER\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs:\n\n                            S.

RESOLUTION OF APOLOGY TO THE NATIVE PEOPLES OF THE \n                   UNITED STATES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n\n[[Page S10608]]\n\n       (1) the ancestors of today's Native Peoples inhabited the \n     land of the present-day United States since time immemorial \n     and for thousands of years before the arrival of people of \n     European descent;\n       (2) the Native Peoples have for millennia honored, \n     protected, and stewarded this land we cherish;\n       (3) the Native Peoples are spiritual peoples with a deep \n     and abiding belief in the Creator, and for millennia their \n     people have maintained a powerful spiritual connection to \n     this land, as is evidenced by their customs and legends;\n       (4) the arrival of Europeans in North America opened a new \n     chapter in the histories of the Native Peoples;\n       (5) while establishment of permanent European settlements \n     in North America did stir conflict with nearby Indian tribes, \n     peaceful and mutually beneficial interactions also took \n     place;\n       (6) the foundational English settlements in Jamestown, \n     Virginia, and Plymouth, Massachusetts, owed their survival in \n     large measure to the compassion and aid of the Native Peoples \n     in their vicinities;\n       (7) in the infancy of the United States, the founders of \n     the Republic expressed their desire for a just relationship \n     with the Indian tribes, as evidenced by the Northwest \n     Ordinance enacted by Congress in 1787, which begins with the \n     phrase, ``The utmost good faith shall always be observed \n     toward the Indians'';\n       (8) Indian tribes provided great assistance to the \n     fledgling Republic as it strengthened and grew, including \n     invaluable help to Meriwether Lewis and William Clark on \n     their epic journey from St. Louis, Missouri, to the Pacific \n     Coast;\n       (9) Native Peoples and non-Native settlers engaged in \n     numerous armed conflicts;\n       (10) the United States Government violated many of the \n     treaties ratified by Congress and other diplomatic agreements \n     with Indian tribes;\n       (11) this Nation should address the broken treaties and \n     many of the more ill-conceived Federal policies that \n     followed, such as extermination, termination, forced removal \n     and relocation, the outlawing of traditional religions, and \n     the destruction of sacred places;\n       (12) the United States forced Indian tribes and their \n     citizens to move away from their traditional homelands and \n     onto federally established and controlled reservations, in \n     accordance with such Acts as the Act of May 28, 1830 (4 Stat. \n     411, chapter 148) (commonly known as the ``Indian Removal \n     Act'');\n       (13) many Native Peoples suffered and perished--\n       (A) during the execution of the official United States \n     Government policy of forced removal, including the infamous \n     Trail of Tears and Long Walk;\n       (B) during bloody armed confrontations and massacres, such \n     as the Sand Creek Massacre in 1864 and the Wounded Knee \n     Massacre in 1890; and\n       (C) on numerous Indian reservations;\n       (14) the United States Government condemned the traditions, \n     beliefs, and customs of the Native Peoples and endeavored to \n     assimilate them by such policies as the redistribution of \n     land under the Act of February 8, 1887 (25 U.S.C. 331; 24 \n     Stat. 388, chapter 119) (also known as the ``General \n     Allotment Act''), and the forcible removal of Native children \n     from their families to faraway boarding schools where their \n     Native practices and languages were degraded and forbidden;\n       (15) officials of the United States Government and private \n     United States citizens harmed Native Peoples by the unlawful \n     acquisition of recognized tribal land and the theft of tribal \n     resources and assets from recognized tribal land;\n       (16) the policies of the United States Government toward \n     Indian tribes and the breaking of covenants with Indian \n     tribes have contributed to the severe social ills and \n     economic troubles in many Native communities today;\n       (17) despite the wrongs committed against Native Peoples by \n     the United States, the Native Peoples have remained committed \n     to the protection of this great land, as evidenced by the \n     fact that, on a per capita basis, more Native people have \n     served in the United States Armed Forces and placed \n     themselves in harm's way in defense of the United States in \n     every major military conflict than any other ethnic group;\n       (18) Indian tribes have actively influenced the public life \n     of the United States by continued cooperation with Congress \n     and the Department of the Interior, through the involvement \n     of Native individuals in official United States Government \n     positions, and by leadership of their own sovereign Indian \n     tribes;\n       (19) Indian tribes are resilient and determined to \n     preserve, develop, and transmit to future generations their \n     unique cultural identities;\n       (20) the National Museum of the American Indian was \n     established in the Smithsonian Institution as a living \n     memorial to the Native Peoples and their traditions; and\n       (21) Native People are endowed by their Creator with \n     certain unalienable rights, and that among those are life, \n     liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\n       (b) Acknowledgment and Apology.--The United States, acting \n     through Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the special legal and political relationship \n     the Indian tribes have with the United States and the solemn \n     covenant with the land we share;\n       (2) commends and honors the Native Peoples for the \n     thousands of years that they have stewarded and protected \n     this land;\n       (3) recognizes that there have been years of official \n     depredations, ill-conceived policies, and the breaking of \n     covenants by the United States Government regarding Indian \n     tribes;\n       (4) apologizes on behalf of the people of the United States \n     to all Native Peoples for the many instances of violence, \n     maltreatment, and neglect inflicted on Native Peoples by \n     citizens of the United States;\n       (5) expresses its regret for the ramifications of former \n     wrongs and its commitment to build on the positive \n     relationships of the past and present to move toward a \n     brighter future where all the people of this land live \n     reconciled as brothers and sisters, and harmoniously steward \n     and protect this land together;\n       (6) urges the President to acknowledge the wrongs of the \n     United States against Indian tribes in the history of the \n     United States in order to bring healing to this land by \n     providing a proper foundation for reconciliation between the \n     United States and Indian tribes; and\n       (7) commends the State governments that have begun \n     reconciliation efforts with recognized Indian tribes located \n     in their boundaries and encourages all State governments \n     similarly to work toward reconciling relationships with \n     Indian tribes within their boundaries.\n       (c) Disclaimer.--Nothing in this section--\n       (1) authorizes or supports any claim against the United \n     States;

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 174, S. 1281.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1281) to authorize appropriations for the \n     National Aeronautics and Space Administration for science, \n     aeronautics, exploration, exploration capabilities, and the \n     Inspector General, and for other purposes, for fiscal years \n     2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill \nwhich had been reported from the Committee on Commerce, Science and \nTransportation with amendments.\n  (Strike the parts shown in black brackets and insert the parts shown \nin italic.)\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am delighted to join my friend and \ncolleague, the distinguished Senator from Florida, in bringing before \nthe Senate today, S. 1281, the NASA Authorization Bill of 2005. Our \nsubcommittee and the full Commerce Committee have worked hard to \nprepare legislation that we believe is important and timely, because it \ncomes at a watershed moment in this Nation's civil space program.\n  That moment has come at no small cost. It grew out of a terrible \ntragedy that took place in the skies over Texas 2\\1/2\\ years ago, when \nthe space shuttle Columbia and her brave crew were lost as they were \nreturning home from an important and successful research mission.\n  In the aftermath of that accident, we were forced, as a nation, to \nonce again confront the question of the value of space exploration in \nthe face of the risks involved in sending our best and brightest--and \nthose of other nations who are our partners in space exploration--into \nthe hostile realm of space. The overwhelming and resounding answer, \nfrom the families of those who were lost to men, women and children \nacross the country, and our elected leadership, was ``yes.'' They gave \nthe same answer that Lewis and Clark gave to Thomas Jefferson 200 years \nago, when he charged them with the task of exploring what was then a \ngreat, largely unknown expanse.\n  Just as that difficult but inspiring voyage of discovery opened the \nway for this Nation to spread its wings from sea to sea, the voyages of \ndiscovery into the far reaches of space have begun--and will continue--\nto open vast opportunities for our Nation, and for the world.\n  While the vision that drove Lewis and Clark--the discovery of a \nnorthwest passage to the Pacific Ocean--was not the result they \nachieved, the understanding of the raw richness of our continent, and \nthe insights into themselves and their fellow human beings provided a \nwealth of discovery more diverse and more valuable than any specific \ngoal they had in mind as they began.\n  Among the many important findings of the investigation into the \nColumbia accident was the need for a renewed guiding vision for our \nhuman space exploration programs. On January 14, 2004, President George \nW. Bush provided the essence of that bold new vision for exploration, \nnot only for NASA, but for the Nation. It extends far beyond his tenure \nin office--beyond the tenure of most of us serving in the Senate today. \nIt reaches beyond many years and ultimately millions of miles into the \nsolar system in which we live. It will require a long-standing \ncommitment by this Nation, and it will not be an easy vision to \naccomplish. We will find unexpected obstacles and challenges along the \nway. If we didn't, it would not really be exploration. Our task as a \nnation, and in the company of international partners who will join us \non this journey, will be to meet those challenges and turn them into \nopportunities.\n\n  The essential first step in the new Vision for Exploration was to \nreturn the space shuttle to flight. As we all know, the space shuttle \nDiscovery launched into orbit and began this Nation's return to space \nflight on July 26th. Commander Eileen Collins and her crew,\n\n[[Page S10611]]\n\nthe crew aboard the International Space Station, and the entire NASA \nteam conducted an extremely successful first test flight to assess the \nprogress made in the space shuttle program since the tragic Columbia \naccident. While the shedding of foam debris during liftoff--the direct \ncause of the damage to Columbia--was reduced to a level far below that \npreviously experienced, it has not been eliminated and more work \nremains to understand and address that problem. Fortunately, among the \nmajor improvements in the Shuttle program is the vast increase in the \nability to monitor and collect visual information on the health of the \nOrbiter both during launch and in orbit. That unprecedented level of \ninformation was combined with new on-orbit repair techniques to further \nenhance our confidence in the shuttle program's flight readiness. All \nof us, I'm sure, were thrilled to watch astronaut Steve Robinson deftly \npluck the small gap fillers from Discovery's underside, and the amazing \nnever before seen images of the orbiter's thermal protection system. \nOur subcommittee will continue to monitor the application of the \nfindings of this first test flight to the preparations for the launch \nof the second test flight next year, which continues this first step in \nthe Vision for Exploration.\n  The legislation we bring before the Senate today supports the Vision \nof Exploration outlined by the President. It provides an opportunity \nfor the Congress to fulfill its responsibility to help set the stage \nfor the commencement of our new national journey of exploration. It has \nbeen 5 years since the Congress has enacted authorization legislation \nfor NASA and its programs. Those 5 years have seen a great deal of \nchange in the realm of space exploration. First and foremost, for \nnearly all of that time, humans have been living and working \ncontinuously on orbit 240 miles above the earth aboard the \nInternational Space Station. Despite the interruption of its assembly \nby the Columbia accident, the space station has already provided a \ngreat deal of important scientific information resulting from the \nresearch the expedition crews aboard the ISS have been able to \naccomplish. And most of its laboratory facilities are not yet on orbit. \nThe space station represents an immensely valuable asset for this \nNation and our international and scientific partners, and the \nlegislation before the Senate today will serve to ensure it realizes \nthe vast potential it has long promised.\n  The past 5 years have seen other changes.\n  As we have undergone the recovery from the Columbia accident, we have \nwitnessed the most comprehensive review of the hardware, systems and \nprocessing for the space shuttle program since it began operational \nflights 24 years ago. While we may never be able to completely \neliminate the risks of human spaceflight, the space shuttle system is \nsafer today than it has ever been, and we have learned valuable lessons \nthat can be applied to the next generation of human space flight \nvehicle.\n  Last year we witnessed dramatic evidence of yet another major change \nin space exploration when pilot Mike Melville flew SpaceShipOne, built \nby the Scaled Deposits Corporation, over 100 kilometers high, to become \nthe first person to fly a privately-built vehicle into the reaches of \nspace on September 29, 2004. Five days later, on October 4 Brian Binnie \nat the controls, SpaceShipOne became the first private manned \nspacecraft to exceed an altitude of 328,000 feet twice within the span \nof a 14-day period. With that accomplishment, Scaled Deposits \nCorporation won the $10 million Ansari X-Prize, funded entirely by \nprivate funds. A new era in private, commercial development of manned \nand unmanned spacecraft has begun, which offers exciting opportunities \nfor the future.\n  For example, two space entrepreneurs are planning to join together in \nthe launch early next year of the Falcon V launch vehicle, built by \nElon Musk's Space-X Corporation, which will carry aloft a prototype \none-third scale space module built by Robert Bigelow's Bigelow \nAerospace Corporation. Other companies are developing designs and \nbuilding prototype hardware that could be the precursors of \ncommercially developed space station modules and the means of supplying \nand maintaining them with cargo and crews that could complement and \nexpand the research opportunities provided by the International Space \nStation. S. 1281 includes language which both encourages and enables \nincreased commercial involvement in space activities, including \nservicing the International Space Station, developing and conducting \nfree-flying space research vehicles, and providing for increased use of \ncompetitive prizes and incentives to spur private investment and \ndevelopment. We would expect to see that private sector interest and \ninvolvement eventually extend beyond earth orbit to become an integral \npart of the nation's broader commitment to exploration of the Moon, \nMars and destinations beyond.\n  I would like now to discuss some of the key provisions of the NASA \nreauthorization bill which I believe are especially important to the \nnew beginning we are making as a nation within the Vision for \nExploration.\n  There is an old saying that a journey of a thousand miles begins with \na single step. It is also true that we must begin from where we find \nourselves today. As I said earlier, the first step of the Vision was \ninitiated this past summer with the launch of Discovery, and will \ncontinue with the subsequent flights of the space shuttle to complete \nthe assembly of the International Space Station and fulfill our \ncommitments to our international partners and--I must add--our \ncommitments to our scientific partners.\n  Over the past 17 years, this Chamber has been the scene of vigorous \ndiscussion and debate on the International Space Station, long before \nthe first module was launched in November of 1998. Through all that \ndiscussion, the central theme of those of us who supported the space \nstation--and two-thirds of us consistently supported it in the votes \nfollowing those debates--was that the ISS represents a unique \nlaboratory in space, which holds the promise for scientific findings \nthat can directly benefit us on Earth. I find it interesting to hear \nstatements that the space station has not fulfilled that promise. Those \nwho suggest that seem to have forgotten that it is not yet completed. \nIn fact, only one of the three planned laboratories is on orbit now--\nthe US Destiny laboratory--and it is not yet fully equipped. The \nremaining modules are completed, and are at the Kennedy Space Center, \nawaiting their launch and outfitting so that the long-standing plans \nfor ISS research can finally begin. We and our international partners \nhave invested far too much in building and preparing those facilities, \nand the on-orbit structure that will provide their home and supporting \npower and crew accommodations, to back away from that investment now. \nTo do so would not only represent a wasteful, irresponsible and \ninexcusable breach of faith with the American taxpayers, but an \nunconscionable betrayal of scientists and researchers in a wide range \nof disciplines who have invested years of effort and resources \npreparing to conduct research that can only be done in the microgravity \nof space.\n\n  This bill acknowledges and reaffirms our commitment to fulfill the \npromise of the ISS. We recognize that NASA has limited total resources \nand has been given an enormous task to lead the Vision for Exploration. \nThe demands of many valuable and important existing programs have \nforced NASA to make difficult choices in focusing those scarce \nresources in ways which support the goals of the Vision. We understand \nthat reality, and have attempted in this 5-year reauthorization bill to \nprovide a stable, consistent and moderately increasing level of funding \nto enable NASA to address those challenges.\n  At the same time, we have encouraged, as I noted earlier, the \nincreased participation and involvement of commercial interests and \ncapabilities, in a way that can relieve NASA of some of the basic \nburdens of space operations. With respect to space station research, we \nbelieve additional steps must be taken to enable NASA to conduct the \nresearch it must to support long-duration human spaceflight, and to \nreturn to the Moon, and move onward to Mars, while not sacrificing or \nundermining the investment we have made in the ISS.\n  To accomplish this, the legislation designates the U.S. segment of \nthe\n\n[[Page S10612]]\n\nInternational Space Station as national laboratory facility. It further \ndirects the NASA Administrator to develop a plan, within one year after \nenactment of the bill, to establish a ground-based national laboratory \nstructure that will be responsible for maintaining and operating the \nresearch capabilities in the on-orbit laboratory facilities. The ISS \nnational laboratory will be empowered to establish scientific--and \nfunding--relationships with other governmental and non-governmental \nentities and to include international participation as well. The \ninfusion of new participants and non-NASA resources will free NASA of \nmuch of the financial burden it would require to sustain broad-based \nresearch aboard ISS, and would thus enable it to focus its ISS \nresearch, as planned, on those disciplines and experiments which \ndirectly support the needs of the Vision for Exploration.\n  We believe this represents a creative and responsible approach to \nmeeting our international commitments and fulfilling the long-standing \nresearch promise of the ISS, while not inhibiting NASA's pursuit of its \nexploration objectives.\n\n  In order to continue the Nation's exploration activities, both in \ncontinuing essential activities in low-Earth orbit and moving outward, \nback to the Moon, Mars, and beyond, we must have a new generation of \nlaunch and flight vehicles. The Vision for Exploration calls for the \ndevelopment of a new crew exploration vehicle and associated launch \nsystems, to meet that objective.\n  As I have stated, this legislation supports the goals and objectives \nof Vision for Exploration. As the saying goes, however, sometimes ``the \ndevil is in the details.'' As those details have been revealed in the \nplanning to implement the vision, I have expressed concerns about some \nof the early transitional steps to redirect NASA's emphasis from low-\nEarth orbit to exploration of the Moon and Mars. I have already \naddressed the question of ensuring the maximum use of the International \nSpace Station. My other primary concern has to do with the transition \nfrom the Space Shuttle to the new crew exploration vehicle. The initial \nannouncement of the Vision for Exploration called for the termination \nof Shuttle flights in 2010, and the first flight of the crew \nexploration vehicle in 2014. The resulting 4-year hiatus in this \nNation's ability to launch humans into space was simply unacceptable to \nme. It would represent a serious degradation of our national and \neconomic security, as the community of spacefaring nations expands with \nthe advent of Chinese human spaceflight capability and the potential of \neven more nations developing such capability, potentially challenging \nU.S. leadership in this important strategic area and major engine of \ntechnological advancement.\n  S. 1281, as introduced, stated that uninterrupted U.S. spaceflight \ncapability is essential to our Nation, and required, in Section 202 of \nthe bill, that the Space Shuttle Orbiter not be retired until a \nreplacement crew-capable space vehicle be made operational. NASA's new \nAdministrator, Dr. Michael Griffin, stated, in his confirmation hearing \nbefore the Commerce Committee, and again in a subsequent subcommittee \nhearing on the space shuttle, that he shared our concern about a \nlengthy hiatus period in U.S. spaceflight capability. Since assuming \nleadership of NASA, he has undertaken an effort to approach the \ndevelopment of the replacement vehicle in such a way as to close that \ngap as much as possible. In anticipation of the success of those \nefforts, Senator Nelson and I agreed to a modification of the language \nin the bill--included in the manager's amendment to the bill--which \nprovides some flexibility in meeting the goal of uninterrupted U.S. \nspaceflight capability, but continues to state it as a policy \nobjective. The Exploration Systems Architecture Study was recently \ncompleted and I am very pleased to say that the results track very \nclosely to the provisions of S. 1281. The CEV development would be \naccelerated to 2012, with the possibility of moving its operational \ndate to 2011. The key to CEV acceleration is largely a question of \nresources, and sufficient funding could enable an even earlier \noperational date, possibly closing the potential gap in spaceflight \ncapability altogether.\n  In Dr. Griffin's appearance before the Science and Space Subcommittee \nduring our hearing on the space shuttle program, he pointed out that \nthe plan for space shuttle retirement involves the retirement of the \nOrbiters, not necessarily the additional components that make up what \nwe call the space shuttle. Those additional components are the solid \nrocket boosters and the external fuel tank.\n  I remind my colleagues that the Orbiter is a vehicle that has two \nmajor spaceflight functions combined in a single vehicle: the delivery \nof crew to and from orbit, and the delivery of cargo, or payloads, to \nand from orbit. The future developments of U.S. human spaceflight \ncapability are intended to separate those functions. That will enable \nthe development of much more simplified--and arguably much safer, more \nefficient, and less costly--vehicles to serve each separate function. \nThe provisions of S. 1281--coupled with the revised plans for vehicle \ndevelopment recently announced, will fulfill those objectives using \nmajor elements of our existing systems and adapting them to meet the \nrequirements of both manned and unmanned launch systems.\n  Launch vehicles and spaceflight vehicles do not prepare and launch \nthemselves into orbit or maintain themselves entirely independently \nwhile in space. They require ground-based support facilities, \ninstitutions and skilled personnel. The maintenance of those \ncapabilities are, in fact, the most labor and resource-intensive \nelements of a spaceflight program, over time. They must be maintained \neven when the vehicles themselves are not flying, and must be kept in a \nhigh state of readiness. For human spaceflight systems, especially, \nthat expertise and readiness are fundamental elements of flight safety.\n  The non-orbiter elements of the space shuttle program, both in flight \nhardware and ground support, represent an enormous national asset and, \nwith modifications and reengineering, can potentially be adapted to \nmeet--in separate configurations--the requirements for human \nspaceflight and for the launch of large, heavy payloads. Those large \npayloads are beyond the reach of either evolved expendable launch \nvehicles or privately-developed launch vehicles--or the current or \nplanned launch vehicles of any other nation, for that matter. For these \nreasons, and others, this legislation directs and encourages NASA to \nmake the maximum possible utilization of the personnel, assets and \ncapabilities of the space shuttle program in developing the next \ngeneration of crew and cargo vehicles. Again, the new NASA plans will \ndo just that, as envisioned by this legislation.\n  Another important and historical NASA research activity is \naeronautical research, a fundamental part of NASA's activities since \nits inception. Indeed, not only is ``aeronautics'' the first ``a'' in \nNASA, but NASA came into being as an expansion of the National Advisory \nCommittee on Aeronautics, which was established in 1915. That heritage \nis an important NASA legacy and the continued health of the Nation's \naerospace industry in a very competitive global market-place makes it \nessential that our Nation have solid aeronautical research \ncapabilities. Equally important, in an environment of limited \nresources, is that decisions about priorities for funding and programs \nbe guided by a clear statement of policy, based on a thorough \nunderstanding of both available assets and essential requirements. This \nlegislation directs the development of a national policy to guide the \nNation's aeronautical research--including that conducted by NASA. The \npolicy is to be developed within one year after enactment of the \nlegislation, in order to provide time for a thorough and complete \nassessment of every aspect of aeronautics research, and yet provide the \nearliest possible guidance for both the administration and the Congress \nin determining the appropriate funding levels for U.S. aeronautics \nresearch. We have chosen not to establish a specific level of funding \nfor that research in the legislation, in order to provide the \nflexibility for the NASA Administrator to establish those levels using \nthe national policy guidance we have required to be developed.\n\n  Finally, let me say something about the broad range of science \nactivities\n\n[[Page S10613]]\n\nfor which NASA has always been known. The remarkable feat of the Deep \nImpact asteroid interception mission and the extraordinary success of \nthe Spirit and Opportunity Mars Rovers are, of course, only the most \nrecent and dramatic examples of NASA Space Science expertise. Less \nspectacular, but equally significant, are the earth observation and \nearth sciences programs which help us understand--and better care for--\nthe spaceship of which all of as are crew members--spaceship Earth. As \nwith aeronautics research, we have not spelled out specific funding \nauthorization levels for the full 5 years authorized among the various \nscience disciplines, providing flexibility for the NASA Administrator \nto make the best judgments about resource allocations. However, we \nexpress clearly in this bill the need for maintaining a balanced \nscience portfolio throughout all NASA programs. In addition, we require \naccountability and will maintain careful oversight over the plans and \ndecisions made to implement that balance.\n  This legislation provides a comprehensive, forward-looking and \nresponsible approach to the transition of our Nation's space \nexploration programs into a new era of discovery. I believe that, \ntogether with our colleagues in the other body, we will be able to \ncraft a congressional consensus that will help ensure this Nation's \nleadership in space exploration and provide benefits beyond measure and \nbeyond imagination to this Nation and the world.\n  I want to thank my friend and colleague from Florida, Senator Nelson, \nfor the spirit of cooperation he and his staff have brought to the \ndevelopment and refinement of this legislation. It represents a truly \nbi-partisan--really a non-partisan--result, as is appropriate for the \nNation's space exploration programs. I also want to express my \nappreciation to the staff of my Subcommittee staff and the full \nCommerce Committee staff who have worked to bring this measure before \nthe Senate. And, of course, I want to acknowledge the leadership of \nSenators Stevens and Inouye, who have supported our efforts to provide \nauthorization and a strong policy foundation to our Nation's space \nexploration efforts.\n  I urge my colleagues to support S. 1281.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators \nHutchison, Stevens, Inouye, and Lott today in sponsoring an amended \nNASA Authorization Act and managers package that provides policy \nguidance for keeping NASA on track to achieve their objectives; and to \nensure that there is a good balance between the different activities \nthat NASA performs.\n  Just a few days ago, NASA released their Exploration Systems \nArchitecture Study. The study describes how NASA plans to implement the \nPresident's Vision for Space Exploration by returning to the Moon and \npreparing to go beyond.\n  Through this NASA bill, Congress can provide constructive support to \nthe good work being done by Administrator Michael Griffin, as they \nbegin to implement the President's vision and prepare NASA for the \nchallenges of the future.\n  This is a 5-year bill, authorizing NASA from 2006 through 2010. It \nauthorizes NASA appropriations in excess of the President's budget \nrequest.\n  For fiscal year 2006, the President requested $16.456 billion, which \nis a 2.4 percent increase over the fiscal year 2005 NASA operating \nbudget. Recently the Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations \nSubcommittee approved $16.4 billion for NASA. This bill authorizes \n$16.556 billion for fiscal year 2006, which is a 3 percent increase \nover the fiscal year 2005 NASA operating budget. This bill authorizes \nincreases at a level of about 3 percent each year, consistently \nproviding more funding than the President's budget projection.\n  Like many of our colleagues, Senator Hutchison and I believe that \nrecent NASA budget requests have been below the levels required for \nNASA to perform its various missions effectively. Once this bill is \nenacted, we intend to work with the Appropriations Committee to ensure \nthat adequate funds are provided for NASA to succeed.\n  This legislation authorizes NASA to return humans to the Moon, to \nexplore it, and to maintain a human presence on the Moon. Consistent \nwith the President's vision, it also requires using what we learn and \ndevelop on the Moon as a stepping stone to future exploration of Mars.\n  To carry out these missions, our bill requires NASA to develop an \nimplementation plan for the transition from shuttle to crew exploration \nvehicle, CEV. The plan will help NASA to make a smooth transition from \nretirement of the space shuttle orbiters to the replacement spacecraft \nsystems. The implementation plan will help make sure that we can keep \nthe skills and the focus that are needed to assure that each space \nshuttle flight is safe through retirement of the orbiters, and to \nretain those personnel needed for the CEV and heavy-lift cargo \nspacecraft.\n  It is essential to our national security that we prevent any hiatus \nor gap in which the United States cannot send astronauts to space \nwithout relying on a foreign country. The Russians have been good \npartners in construction of the International Space Station, and the \nSoyuz spacecraft has been a reliable vehicle for our astronauts. But \nwith all of the uncertainties in our relationship with Russia, we \nsimply cannot allow ourselves the vulnerability of being totally \ndependent on the Soyuz. We need to maintain assured access to space by \nU.S. astronauts on a continuous basis. We therefore require in this \nlegislation, that there not be a hiatus between the retirement of the \nspace shuttle orbiters and the availability of the next generation U.S. \nhuman-rated spacecraft.\n  We have worked with NASA to address their concerns regarding the \nhiatus, and have crafted language that expresses our desire not to have \na gap, and that NASA feels is suitable. We are aware of Dr. Griffin's \nefforts to reduce the potential for a gap and we appreciate the work \nthat he is doing to accelerate the crew exploration vehicle.\n  Our bill directs NASA to plan for and consider a Hubble servicing \nmission after the two Space Shuttle Return to Flight missions have been \ncompleted.\n  Americans are inspired by the images that Hubble produces. The new \ninstruments to be added during the SM-4 Hubble servicing mission will \nproduce higher quality images; enable us to see further into space; and \ngive scientists a better understanding of our universe's past, and \nperhaps of our future. The replacement gyroscopes and batteries that \nare planned for the mission will extend Hubble's life by 5 or more \nyears.\n  This NASA authorization bill calls for utilization of the \nInternational Space Station for basic science as well as exploration \nscience. It is important that we reap the benefits of our multi-billion \ndollar investment in the Space Station. The promise of some basic \nscience research requires a micro-gravity or a space environment for us \nto better understand the problem that we are trying to solve. This bill \nensures that NASA will maintain a focus on the importance of basic \nscience.\n  In order to assure that we can meet our obligations with respect to \nthe Space Station, the administration has requested that Congress \nmodify the Iran Nonproliferation Act to ensure that we can continue to \ncooperate with the Russian Federation in this area. There may be \nperiods when our only access to the Space Station will be on the \nRussian Soyuz spacecraft. But Russia's failure to cease all \nproliferation activities with respect to Iran has resulted in sanctions \nagainst Russia that would preclude such cooperation.\n  This bill directs NASA to improve its safety culture. According to \nthe Columbia Accident Investigation Board, CAIB, report, the safety \nculture at NASA was as much a cause of the Columbia tragedy as the \nphysical cause. Low- and mid-level personnel felt that you could not \nelevate safety concerns without reprisals, or being ignored. NASA has \nalready taken significant steps to address these problems, but we need \nto assure that the safety culture improves as quickly as possible and \nthat it continues to improve.\n  This legislation proposes that the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel \nmonitor and measure NASA's improvements to their safety culture, \nincluding employees' fear of reprisals for voicing concerns about \nsafety.\n  It also contains policy regarding NASA's need to consider and \nimplement lessons learned, in order to avoid another preventable \ntragedy like the Challenger and Columbia disasters.\n  This authorization bill addresses NASA aeronautics and America's \npreeminence in aviation. The Europeans\n\n[[Page S10614]]\n\nhave stated their intent to dominate the airplane market by 2020. It is \nnot in our national interest to let that occur.\n  We are calling on NASA to develop and demonstrate aviation \ntechnologies for reducing commercial aircraft noise levels at airports, \nmaking aircraft more fuel efficient, improving aircraft safety and \nsecurity, and continuing the pursuit of revolutionary concepts such as \nhypersonic flight. Aeronautics is a very important function of NASA and \nneeds to be continued and further developed. This bill calls on NASA to \nassure that at least 5 percent of the aeronautics budget is allocated \nfor fundamental aeronautical research.\n  NASA has a new direction, and they have outstanding leadership in Dr. \nMichael Griffin.\n  We have an opportunity to authorize NASA for: implementing the Vision \nfor Space Exploration; renewing our commitment to U.S. aviation and \nNASA aeronautics research; retaining or resurrecting very important \nscience activities at NASA; and assuring that America has continuous \nhuman access to space.\n  By passing this legislation, we will continue to advance our national \nsecurity, strengthen our economy, inspire the next generation of \nexplorers, and fulfill our destiny as explorers.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, passage of S. 1281, the NASA \nAuthorization Act of 2005, is a milestone in our country's continued \nefforts to open and develop new frontiers.\n  One year after the Columbia space shuttle tragedy, President Bush \ngave us a bold, new vision for the future of space exploration. This \nlegislation provides the framework we need to implement the President's \nvision.\n  The Moon is the strategic gateway to the rest of the solar system. It \nwill ultimately be a critical point for many human endeavors. It will \nsupport economic growth, cutting-edge research and technology, and \ninnovative partnerships.\n  This legislation also provides NASA with important guidance for its \nother missions. It outlines a national aeronautics policy, which will \nbe developed by the administration. This policy will enable us to take \ninto account emerging challenges in aeronautics research as we plan our \ninvestments going forward.\n  S. 1281 also calls for the implementation of a balanced space science \nprogram and highlights the need for better access to data which can \nmeet local and national challenges.\n  This is a bipartisan bill which provides a solid foundation for our \ncurrent and future space activities. I am pleased we are sustaining our \nlong-standing commitment to space exploration.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I ask unanimous consent that the Hutchison amendment at \nthe desk be agreed to; the committee-reported amendments, as amended, \nif amended, be agreed to; the bill, as amended, be read a third time \nand passed; the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table; and that \nany statements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) It is the policy of the United States to advance United \n     States scientific, security, and economic interests through a \n     healthy and active space exploration program.\n       (2) Basic and applied research in space science, Earth \n     science, and aeronautics remain a significant part of the \n     Nation's goals for the use and development of space. Basic \n     research and development is an important component of NASA's \n     program of exploration and discovery.\n       (3) Maintaining the capability to safely send humans into \n     space is essential to United States national and economic \n     security, United States preeminence in space, and inspiring \n     the next generation of explorers. Thus, a gap in United \n     States human space flight capability is harmful to the \n     national interest.\n       (4) The exploration, development, and permanent habitation \n     of the Moon will--\n       (A) inspire the Nation;\n       (B) spur commerce, imagination, and excitement around the \n     world; and\n       (C) open the possibility of further exploration of Mars.\n       (5) The establishment of the capability for consistent \n     access to and stewardship of the region between the Moon and \n     Earth is in the national security and commercial interests of \n     the United States.\n       (6) Commercial development of space, including exploration \n     and other lawful uses, is in the interest of the United \n     States and the international community at large.\n       (7) Research and access to capabilities to support a \n     national laboratory facility within the United States segment \n     of the ISS in low-\n\n[[Page S10615]]\n\n     Earth orbit are in the national policy interests of the \n     United States, including maintenance and development of an \n     active and healthy stream of research from ground to space in \n     areas that can uniquely benefit from access to this facility.\n       (8) NASA should develop vehicles to replace the Shuttle \n     orbiter's capabilities for transporting crew and heavy cargo \n     while utilizing the current program's resources, including \n     human capital, capabilities, and infrastructure. Using these \n     resources can ease the transition to a new space \n     transportation system, maintain an essential industrial base, \n     and minimize technology and safety risks.\n       [(9) The United States should remain the world leader in \n     aeronautics and aviation. NASA should align its aerospace \n     research to ensure United States leadership. A national \n     effort is needed to assess NASA's aeronautics programs and \n     infrastructure to allow a consolidated national approach that \n     ensures efficiency and national preeminence in aeronautics \n     and aviation.]\n       (9) The United States must remain the leader in aeronautics \n     and aviation. Any erosion of this preeminence is not in the \n     Nation's economic or security interest. NASA should align its \n     aerospace leadership to ensure United States leadership. A \n     national effort is needed to ensure that NASA's aeronautics \n     programs are leading contributors to the Nation's civil and \n     military aviation needs, as well as to its exploration \n     capabilities.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 256, which was submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 256) honoring the life of Sandra \n     Feldman.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I extend my deepest sympathies to the \nfamily and friends of Sandy Feldman at her untimely passing. We have \nlost a dedicated educator, a proud labor leader, a committed reformer, \nand someone my wife Teresa, and I were so proud to have as a friend in \nour lives.\n  From her early days as a civil rights advocate, Sandy had an \nunshakeable sense of justice and fairness. Sandy did not just talk \nabout helping teachers and their students--she actually did it. While \nher career spanned more than four decades, Sandy's commitment grew out \nof her early work in the civil rights movement. An advocate for civil \nrights and social justice, she was an activist in the Freedom Rides and \nthe 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. It was her firsthand \nknowledge of the power of an excellent teacher that led Sandy to a \nlifetime of activism. Sandy understood the importance of quality public \neducation and the wealth of opportunities it can unleash for every \nstudent, regardless of who they are or where they're from.\n  ``Created my future,'' that is what Sandy always said about growing \nup in Brooklyn and the public schools and libraries she spent her \nchildhood in. Sandy's commitment to education was fueled by her \nchildhood experiences and her dedication to bettering the lives of \nstudents and teachers. Beginning as a second grade teacher, Sandy \nquickly became a union activist when she led the teachers at her \nelementary school to organize. In 1986, Sandy became president of AFT's \nlargest affiliate, New York City's United Federation of Teachers, UFT. \nDuring her years as UFT president and then since 1997 when she became \npresident of the AFT, Sandy earned the respect of Presidents, of her \ncolleagues, and of many of us in Congress.\n  Calling early childhood education ``getting it right from the \nstart,'' Sandy consistently called for greater investment in public \neducation and a greater emphasis on high standards and increased \naccountability. Sandy's focus on early childhood education led her to \nintroduce a program that would provide extended learning opportunities \nfor disadvantaged students before and after the normal kindergarten \nschool year. Within a few years, Sandy's program, Kindergarten-Plus, \nhad been introduced as Federal legislation, passed or considered in \nseveral State legislatures, and passed into law in at least one State.\n  My hope is that her tragic passing after a courageous battle with \ncancer will inspire all of us to do just what Sandy fought her entire \nlife for--to make sure we are getting it right from the start and to \nstand by our children and our teachers. Sandy was an amazing American. \nI will miss her wisdom and her counsel very much. Our hearts go out to \nher husband Arthur and their family in this difficult time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 256) was agreed to.\n\n[[Page S10623]]\n\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, before the chairman leaves the floor--he \nhas put in a long day today and has some more things probably to do \nthis evening--I wish to thank him for his extraordinary leadership at \nthis time and also the Senator from Montana who was here earlier. They \nhave been working on this bill now for weeks because they are aware of \nthe great need, the extraordinary need of the people from the State I \nrepresent, Louisiana, but also our neighbors now in Texas and in \nMississippi and in Alabama.\n  As the Senator from Iowa knows, and the Senator from Montana, this is \nthe largest natural disaster in the history of the United States. We \nhad one hurricane and major levee failings in a region with over 2 \nmillion people. Then on the heels of it, we have had another hurricane, \nnot quite as large but equally as damaging to some rural areas, Mr. \nPresident, that you are very familiar with, not big cities but small \ncities that are gone. They are just gone. There is no more city. There \nis no more community.\n  All along the gulf coast--you can ask the Senators from Mississippi--\nWaveland and Biloxi and Cameron Parish, 10,000 people lived there 5 \ndays ago. No one lives there today.\n  I flew over the other day. There is one building, the courthouse \nbuilding, that stood in the Audrey hurricane, it stood in the Rita \nhurricane. When we rebuilt the Cameron Parish, I told them: Go find the \narchitect who built that courthouse because we are going need to have \neverything built that way if we are going to live here.\n  This was not a coast of people sunbathing at resorts or second homes. \nThese were people running our pipelines, our gas lines, our fishing \nindustry. These were people running the refineries, the infrastructure \nthat is on that coast. They didn't just go there in the last decade to \nretire. Their families have been there for generations, all along this \ngulf coast. When they went there, there was more land and more \nprotection. But because they are not super rich and because they did \nnot have a lot of extra money and because over a lot of decades the \nFederal Government did not do what it should--maybe we all missed a \nlittle bit here or there--the land is washed away. They find themselves \nmore vulnerable.\n  But they are not sunbathing down there. They are working on the \nports, on the oil and gas industry, and they desperately need our help. \nThese people need immediate medical attention and care. As a doctor, \nyou can understand the anxiety of people who do not know where to go \nfor health care. They are in strange places. They need to be qualified.\n  This has been well researched by the staffs. We have had input, of \ncourse, Senator Vitter and myself, but this comes straight from the \nFinance Committee, to extend what is already in the law for people to \nhelp them get coverage for 5 months, just 5 months until people can \ncatch their breath, get up on their feet, try to find their families, \nmake decisions. They lost their homes. They lost their business.\n\n  It also helps private employers. I have had private employers, little \nones, medium ones, and big ones pouring into my office. And this is \nwhat they say: Senator, we are not leaving. We want to stay. We are \ngoing to exhaust the money in our bank accounts to keep our employees \nwhole. But could you please ask the Federal Government to give us a \nlittle help here? We want to keep their coverage. We want to keep our \nemployees. We want them to come back. We don't want our companies to \nleave. But a lot of them had to leave. They had no choice. They are \ngoing to Oklahoma, they are going to Houston but at a lot of cost.\n  I talked to a gas pipeline company. They are having their employees \ncome back this weekend right in Cameron Parish. But they need our help.\n  One of the things this bill does is it helps them--if they were \ngiving insurance to their people--continue to give private insurance. \nIf some companies had to leave temporarily, their employees can still \nget private coverage through a program that already exists.\n  The chairman and the ranking member put their heads together and \nsaid, Let us do this for 5 months.\n  I know there is an objection, because some have expressed a few \nobjections, that said let us not extend it to all States, let us keep \nit targeted to Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Texas.\n  We thought about that. But the reason there is one provision that \nallows the other States to keep their Medicaid, 100-percent \nreimbursement, is because they have taken a lot of our people. Arkansas \ndidn't have a hurricane, but they took our people. They had 75,000 \npeople.\n  So if we cut the State of Arkansas' health care benefits which may go \ninto effect soon, that is what we were anticipating. It puts so much \nstrain on Arkansas for the 75,000 people.\n  We think it is reasonable to ask for a 5-month waiver for all of the \nStates just to help us through this difficult period.\n  We are not trying to expand a Government program. We are trying to \nuse what is available now in the law and extend it to millions of \npeople who need help immediately.\n  It is not everything we need in health care. We still have problems \nwith losses because companies are out of business. Doctors who want to \nstay have no place to work. Even if they showed up to the hospital to \nwork, the city of New Orleans is still virtually empty. It is a large \ncity. One-half our population has been impacted. Almost half, 4.5 \nmillion people, live in the southern part of our State.\n  Everyone has been impacted by these two disasters. A large population \nin Texas, a large population in Mississippi, and a medium-sized \npopulation in Alabama have been affected, but not to the level that, of \ncourse, Louisiana has taken. It has taken a hit to its major \nmetropolitan area, as well as then being followed up by another major \nhit to the rural area to the western side of our State.\n  I say ``rural''--there are good-sized cities, such as Lake Charles \nand other cities that are in that area.\n  We have large cities, medium-sized cities, and small villages and \ncommunities--such as Cameron--that have been very hard hit.\n  It is very important that we try to work through whatever the \ndifficulties might be. We don't have that much time.\n  If we can move on this package in the next day or two, and work out \nwhatever objections there are, I think it would be a great signal to \nsend from this Congress.\n  I know we have to get it past the House. I know we have to get it \nsigned by the President. But the President has been to our State many \ntimes. I have been with him on almost every trip. He has assured me \nthat he understands that people are in desperate need, and he wants to \nsee the Federal Government use the resources that we have to meet that \nneed. I know we can't do everything. But this is minimal. This is basic \ncoverage for people who have nothing right now.\n  While churches are helping and while the private employers are doing \na good job, private employers cannot take on more risk than is their \nfiduciary responsibility. They have a responsibility to their \nstakeholders, to their shareholders, and to their board of directors. \nThey cannot run charities.\n  That is why we have the role of Government. That is why we have to \nstep up and meet them halfway.\n  I am proud of our employers, but they need our help. The business \ncommunity needs us to be a partner, and part of this bill would do \nthat.\n  I see the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question \nthrough the Chair?\n  I came on the floor late. I heard Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley \ntalk about this bill. I want to try to bring it down to the most basic \ninformation, so if someone misses the debate, they will understand what \nwe are talking about.\n  This is generally what we are trying to do. We are taking people who \nare displaced out of their homes, out of their jobs, out of their \ncommunities because of the hurricanes--people who, frankly, are going \nthrough a lot of personal and family hardship at this moment--and \nsaying that one thing we\n\n[[Page S10626]]\n\nare going to help you with immediately is to make sure that you have \nhealth care. If you qualify, you would have Medicaid--that is for \npeople in the lower income categories--or if you had private health \ninsurance where you used to work in a business that has gone away, we \nare going to step in here for 5 months and say, We are going to give \nyou this peace of mind. You will know that you have health insurance.\n  Is that what this bill does?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. That is what this bill does.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I understand that this is a bipartisan bill that Senator \nGrassley, Republican of Iowa, Senator Baucus, a Democrat of Montana, \nhave written to make sure that the millions of people who have been \ndisplaced will have basic health care.\n  Is that is what this bill does?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. The Senator is correct. That is what this bill does. \nSenator Vitter from Louisiana and Senator Landrieu--and I am almost \ncertain that every Senator of the affected States--have signed off on \nthis, asked for it and said ``yes.'' We desperately need it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask the Senator how many times she has \nbrought this bill to the floor. How many times have we tried to provide \nthis basic health care, basic protection to these victims of Hurricane \nKatrina and Hurricane Rita so far?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I believe the Senator from Iowa and the Senator from \nMontana have been working on this for 2 weeks. We are into our fourth \nweek of Katrina and the first week of Rita.\n  But again, it is the largest natural disaster that has hit the \nContinental United States. We are getting ready to rebuild, after we \nwork out our differences, a major American city for the first time \nsince the Civil War and the region that surrounds it. We are learning \nas we go. There is not a textbook to follow. So we have to use our \ncommon sense. We have to trust each other on some of these things.\n  The Senator from Iowa and the Senator from Montana have run this \ncommittee, and their members have put a great bill together that is \nmodest but so needed.\n  I am hoping the Senator from Illinois can help us figure out how to \nmove this legislation quickly.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator would further yield for a question through \nthe Chair, I thought our biggest complaint about the Federal \nGovernment's response to Katrina was that, even when we were warned, we \nweren't ready. Many of us are calling for a nonpartisan, independent \ncommission to answer some basic questions. Why weren't we ready? But \nwhen it comes to this issue about health care for the victims of \nHurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita, we know what the need is. And \napparently, because of objections heard on the floor of the Senate, we \nare delaying, postponing, this basic health care for these victims of \nthis hurricane.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. That is what it seems to be. It is unfortunate.\n  I am hoping, through the Chair to the Senator from Illinois--and I \nsee that our minority leader from Nevada is here with us--that we could \ndo our best in the next 24 hours, either through action on this floor \nor meetings, to answer questions that a few Senators may have. I have \nheard objections, such as too much corruption. We have problems with \nMississippi spending money and corruption, but we shouldn't blame these \npeople. All they want is health care benefits. We can fix that issue. \nWe can work on that issue.\n  But let us not hold up health care to people until we get the system \nperfect. If that is the case, we should stop working tonight. The \nsystem is never going to be perfect. It can be better.\n  Let us not take it out on these people. They have already been \nvictimized outside of any of their control.\n  The Senator should know that one of the objections was that we \nshouldn't expand a Government program.\n  But again, I just want to reiterate to the Senator that this is not \nan expansion. It is in the law. It is 5 months of special help to \npeople who need it and to people who have private insurance that have \nlost it and can't have it, if we don't meet their employers halfway.\n  The only expansion for the country is to say in the next 5 months the \nFederal Government will not cut any State's Medicaid Program because so \nmany of our States are helping our people. Again, in Arkansas, 75,000. \nIt would not be fair to Arkansas, even though they didn't get hit by \nthe hurricane, to cut their State program when they are absorbing some \nmany extra people from Louisiana, Texas, and Mississippi.\n  I think that makes common sense.\n  I see the Senator from Nevada. Maybe he can shed some light on this.\n  I will yield the floor. I have spent the time and more than I was \nasked for.\n  I thank the Senators who are here who are trying to get this \nimportant bill passed by the end of the week.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want the Record to be spread with my \nappreciation for the statements made today by Senator Baucus, Senator \nLandrieu, and Senator Durbin regarding this most important issue. We \nsaw with Katrina that we have in America a safety net that has some \nholes in it. We saw in graphic description some of the people fell \nthrough that safety net.\n  That is what this is all about--helping medically. The poorest of the \npoor in our country are helped by Medicaid. That is what this is all \nabout.\n  For those people who are watching this, who are listening, this is an \ninstance where there is a bipartisan measure that is now before the \nSenate that should pass. The Finance Committee, under the direction of \nSenators Grassley and Baucus--Republican and Democrat--came up with \nthis most important piece of legislation. They did it. They worked it \nout. No one can challenge the conservative credentials of either of \nthese Senators. They are both fiscally sound. They do good work for \ntheir Finance Committee.\n  There are a few people on the Republican side of the aisle who are \nholding this up. It is not right. No one wants to waste money for \nKatrina. No one wants to waste money with the billions of dollars that \nwill be spent with Katrina.\n  I would be happy if Congress selected someone to be a czar to make \nsure the money was spent properly.\n  But here we have people who are waiting. This is going for 5 months. \nThey will be waiting for the most simple medical measures that would \nhelp them--and help the States that are taking care of them.\n  The State of Arkansas alone has 60,000 evacuees, most of whom, in \nsome way or another, their family member, would qualify for some part \nof this.\n  It is the right thing to do to help States such as Arkansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/28/senate-section/article/S10626-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10626-S10629]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PANDEMIC INFLUENZA\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in 1918, the Spanish flu pandemic swept the \nworld for a number of reasons--not the least of which we had soldiers \ncoming from all over the world going places and coming home. As a \nresult, this pandemic that swept our world claimed the lives of about \n50 million people, and 500,000 people in the United States alone before \nit completed its deadly run.\n  Today, many public health experts are warning us that another flu \npandemic is not a matter of if, but when. They tell us that this next \npandemic has the potential to be every bit as devastating as what the \nworld witnessed nearly 100 years ago.\n  A flu pandemic occurs when a new strain of flu emerges in the human \npopulation and causes serious illness and death and can easily spread \nbetween humans.\n  The avian flu, referred to as H5-N1 flu strain by scientists, already \nmeets the first step: Roughly half of the 115 people who have been \ndiagnosed with this virus to date have died. At present, all that \nstands between avian flu and pandemic status is the fact that \nscientists do not believe the avian flu can easily be transmitted \nbetween humans.\n  Scientists fear it is only a matter of time before the avian flu \nvirus mutates into a form that can spread easily from human to human.\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control Director Julie \nGerberding:\n\n      . . . many influenza experts, including those at CDC, \n     consider the threat of a serious influenza epidemic to the \n     United States to be high. Although the timing and impact of \n     an influenza pandemic is unpredictable, the occurrence is \n     inevitable and potentially devastating.\n\n  That was her word, ``inevitable.''\n  You do not have to be an expert to understand the dramatic toll a flu \npandemic could have on our Nation and on\n\n[[Page S10627]]\n\nthe world. Given our capacity for rapid travel around the globe \ncompared to 1918 and the interdependence of our economic markets \ncompared to 1918, both of which have increased dramatically since the \nlast flu pandemic, the potential human and economic costs of the next \npandemic are unimaginable.\n  A respected U.S. health expert has concluded that almost 2 million \nAmericans would die in the first year alone of an outbreak. Pandemic \nflu outbreak in the United States could cost our economy hundreds of \nbillions of dollars due to death, lost productivity and disruption in \ncommerce, and to our society generally.\n  Maybe the only thing more troubling than contemplating the possible \nconsequences of the avian flu pandemic is recognizing that neither this \nNation nor the world are prepared to deal with it. Administration \ndocuments say it will take months to develop an effective vaccine \nagainst the avian flu--some say as much as 9 months--once we have been \nable to identify the particular flu strain in circulation. \nAdministration officials say one of the best opportunities to limit the \nscope and consequence of any outbreak is to rapidly detect the \nemergence of a new strain that is capable of sustained human-to-human \ncontact. Yet we are not devoting enough resources to effective \nsurveillance abroad.\n  The administration has acknowledged we need a detailed pandemic plan \noutlining our national strategy to address this pandemic. Among other \nmatters, such a plan needs to address those who will spearhead our \nresponse to pandemic.\n  How will our response be coordinated across all levels of Government? \nAnd how will we rapidly distribute limited medical resources? Yet our \nnational preparedness plan is still in draft form.\n  We all know State and local health departments will be on the front \nlines of a pandemic. They will need to conduct surveillance, coordinate \nlocal responses, and help distribute the vaccines and antivirals. Yet \nwe are posed to approve a $130 million cut for State and local \npreparedness funding at the Centers for Disease Control. At this time, \nthat is unconscionable.\n  We also know that once a flu strain has been identified, we will need \nto develop an effective vaccine, as I have talked about, and produce \nenough to eventually inoculate the entire 300 million people in \nAmerica. Yet our existing stockpile of vaccines, assuming they are \neffective against the yet unidentified strain, may protect less than 1 \npercent of all Americans, and we have only one domestic flu vaccine \nmanufacturer located in the United States. It is estimated if our \ncapacity to produce vaccines is not improved, it could take 15 months \nto vaccinate first responders, medical personnel, and other high-risk \ngroups.\n  Given it will take months to develop, produce, and distribute a \nvaccine once we have one that is effective, we know that antiviral \nmedication will be a crucial stopgap defense against a pandemic. The \nWorld Health Organization recommended that countries stockpile enough \nantiviral medication to cover 25 percent of their populations. Other \nnations, including Great Britain, France, Norway, Portugal, \nSwitzerland, Finland, and New Zealand, have ordered enough Tamiflu, an \nantiviral pill to cover between 20 and 40 percent of their populations.\n  We should have learned. It was only last year that we did not have \nenough vaccine to take care of the people in America. We did not have \nenough vaccine to take care of the flu strain last time, and everyone \nknew what that was.\n  As important as this Tamiflu is, we now have only 2.3 million courses \nof this pill. Given country, national, and international production \ncapacity, even if we were to increase our order of Tamiflu today, we \nhave been told the United States would have to wait until the end of \n2007 before we could secure enough Tamiflu to cover 25 percent of our \npopulation. The consequences of pandemic could be far reaching, \nimpacting virtually every sector of our society and our economy.\n  We also know our medical community needs to be trained to distinguish \nbetween the annual flu and avian flu so that an outbreak could be \nrecorded immediately. Doctors, hospitals, and other medical providers \nmust develop surge capacity plans so they can respond to a pandemic. \nBusinesses, also, need to be prepared. They should be encouraged to \ndevelop their own plans, establish or expand telecommunicating and \nnetwork access plans, update medical needs policies, and provide \nsuggestions on how to promote employee health to lessen the likelihood \nof exposure. The American public also needs to be educated about the \nimportance of annual flu vaccines and steps they can take to prepare \nfor and respond to an avian flu outbreak.\n\n  Yet this administration has failed to take appropriate action to \nprepare the medical community, business community, and the American \npublic. We can do better. We need to do better. Most importantly, we \ncannot afford to wait to do better. America can do better.\n  The Federal Government's poor response to Katrina has only served to \nexacerbate concerns about the toll such an outbreak would have on our \nNation and the world. Given the very real possibility of an outbreak, \nits potentially severe consequences, and our relative lack of \npreparedness, we need to take action on several fronts to prepare our \nNation and the American people for a potential outbreak and reduce its \nimpact, should it occur.\n  What are some of the steps necessary? We need to improve surveillance \nand international partnerships so we may detect new flu strains and do \nit early. We need to prepare for a pandemic by finalizing, \nimplementing, and funding pandemic preparedness response plans. \nRemember, the director of the Centers for Disease Control has told us \nthis is going to happen. It is inevitable. We need to protect Americans \nwith the development, production, and distribution of an effective \nvaccine. We need to plan ahead for pandemic by stockpiling antiviral \nmedications, medical, and other supplies. We need to strengthen our \npublic health infrastructure. We need to educate Americans by \nincreasing awareness of and education about this flu. Finally, we need \nto commit to protecting Americans by devoting adequate resources to \npandemic preparedness.\n  Experts have warned that an avian flu pandemic is inevitable. But the \ndevastating consequences that can ensue from an outbreak are not--\nprovided this Nation and the world heed the science community warnings \nand take action immediately.\n  I propose to start by committing the resources necessary to protect \nAmericans. We need to start today. We know today that funding certain \nprograms can make dramatic reductions for the consequences of a future \navian flu outbreak. We also know many of these programs are either \nunfunded or massively underfunded.\n  Tomorrow, when we take up the Defense appropriations bill after we \nfinish the Roberts vote, Senators Harkin, Kennedy, Obama, and many \nothers, including myself and Senator Durbin, the two Democrat leaders \nhere who have been elected by our colleagues, will join in this.\n  This is important. We are going to offer an amendment that will \nensure that we begin making the investments necessary to make sure this \nNation and the world do everything possible to ensure that history does \nnot repeat itself and we do not have to relive the terror of 1918.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate is \nscheduled to adjourn at this time.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Illinois have \nan opportunity to speak. I am happy to relieve the Chair if that is \nnecessary. We have two Senators on the floor to finish their \nstatements. I ask consent that the two Senators from Illinois be \nrecognized to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Could I ask if there is a time limit?\n  Mr. REID. How long does the senior Senator from Illinois wish to \nspeak?\n  Mr. DURBIN. No more than 10 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. The junior Senator from Illinois?\n  Mr. OBAMA. I was not aware my senior colleague from Illinois was \ngoing to speak so I don't want to unnecessarily hold up the entire \nChamber.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator should know I did use your name.\n  Mr. OBAMA. I am aware of that.\n  Mr. REID. You have the only comprehensive bill filed regarding the \navian flu and I commend you in that regard.\n\n[[Page S10628]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be glad to take 5 minutes and yield to my \ncolleague 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate that. I know I have presided over a few of the \nlate nights.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I preface my remarks by saying that the \nfirst person who brought the avian flu epidemic to my attention was my \ncolleague Senator Obama, who identified this issue before most other \nSenators. I commend the Senator for his leadership on this issue. I am \nglad he is here this evening to speak to it.\n  I have had two public health briefings in my time as a Congressman \nand Senator which stopped me cold. The first one was about 20 years \nago. It was on the global AIDS epidemic. I knew it was a problem, but I \ndidn't know what kind of a problem. I left that briefing in the House \nCommittee on the Budget and went home to speak in very sincere terms to \nmy family about what I considered to be a real threat to all of us. It \nwas in the earliest stages.\n  Today, I had the second public health briefing which stopped me cold \nagain. We were briefed by Secretary Leavitt from the Department of \nHealth and Human Services, Dr. Gerberding from the Centers for Disease \nControl, and Dr. Fauci, well-known doctor at the National Institutes Of \nHealth. They talked about the possibility of this avian flu epidemic. \nSenator Reid has gone into detail.\n  Mr. President, the images from Katrina are still with us--children, \nsenior citizens, people with disabilities and chronic medical problems, \nwaiting for days for care and medicine. These are not images we hope to \nsee again anytime soon, and yet, we are told that these scenes will be \nrepeated, in larger numbers, in more cities, and for far longer when \nthe avian flu breaks out in this country.\n  Scientists and government officials alike, worldwide, agree that the \noutbreak of avian flu is virtually inevitable and that, like we were \nfor Katrina, this country is woefully underprepared.\n  A few weeks ago at the U.N., the World Health Organization warned the \nAssembly of a pending global pandemic. President Bush acknowledged, \n``If left unchallenged, this virus could become the first pandemic of \nthe 21st century.'' Department of Health and Human Services Secretary \nLeavitt and Senator Frist are as worried as I am. There is a general \nsense that we are not prepared.\n  The only antiviral drug that appears to be effective in minimizing \nthe flu's effect is in short supply. The U.S. has enough doses in its \nstockpile to treat just 2.3 million people. The only vaccine we have in \nthe pipeline is experimental. It may or may not be effective against \nthe mutation that breaks out in humans in this country. And supplies of \nthat vaccine are limited.\n  Right now, the avian flu primarily infects birds, but we are aware of \n115 cases in which people have been infected by the flu. Fifty-nine of \nthem have died. If that pattern were to hold, 55 percent of the people \ninfected with this flu could die.\n  In many ways, we are better off than we were in 1918 when a flu \npandemic struck this country and took 675,000 lives. We know how germs \nare spread and how to minimize that spread. In other ways we are far \nmore susceptible to this threat. The Wilderness Society believes the \navian flu could spread from China to Japan to New York to San Francisco \nwithin the first week.\n  The Council on Foreign Relations dedicated its last volume of Foreign \nAffairs to the impact of a global pandemic--the prospect of battling an \nepidemic of flu in several countries at the same time. ABC News reports \nthat officials in London are quietly looking for additional morgue \nspace.\n  The Bush administration is preparing a plan for responding to an \noutbreak of avian flu. I think there is more that we can do and that we \nmust do--now. If you listen to the leaders in infectious disease and \npublic health around the world, we may not have the luxury of time on \nthis one.\n  We need to step up surveillance of infectious disease here in the \nU.S. and internationally, so that we can track this thing and begin to \ncontain it immediately. We need to invest in research and development \nto pursue all possibilities for effective vaccines and antiviral drugs. \nIf the avian flu hits with a 55 percent mortality rate within days of \ninfection, as it appears to be doing, we could lose hundreds of \nthousands of Americans in the first few months. We need to aggressively \npursue vaccines now--not after the outbreak has begun.\n  We need to help states develop their own preparedness plans so that \nour response is coordinated and organized and will save lives. Where is \nthe medicine stored? How do we make decisions about who gets treatment \nwhen there is too little to go around? How will the distribution \nsystems work? This is work we must help states and localities complete \nnow--not during a time of crisis.\n  Last flu season, we lost about half of our expected supply of flu \nvaccine at the same time the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \nbegan encouraging everyone to go and get one. It was a mess. We had \nsenior citizens waiting for hours for a vaccine, often to learn that \nthey were too late. We saw people waiting for a flu vaccine standing in \nlines that snaked through K-Mart parking lots.\n  I hope we don't have to learn these lessons again the hard way. It is \nour responsibility to ensure that states and localities are prepared. \nWe need to aggressively pursue effective treatments now--not when flu \nvictims are overwhelming our hospitals before our eyes. And we have to \ninvest now--not later--in the capability to track this flu so we can \nstop its spread as quickly and effectively as possible.\n  If we don't--if we simply wring our hands and hope for the best--when \nthe avian flu hits this country, it will make the scenes of Katrina \npale in comparison\n  Before I turn it over to my colleague, I will not repeat the remarks \nof Senator Reid, but I will say if you believe you can survive this flu \nepidemic because you are not an infant or sickly or elderly, that is \nnot the situation. It turns out we have no resistance to this flu \nstrain, and as a consequence we are all in the same situation in terms \nof vulnerability. That is why this is so serious.\n  We had a briefing today, and I am sure Senator Obama will go into \ndetail on it, but it raises questions as Senator Reid raised.\n  I will yield the rest of my time to my colleague and thank him for \nhis leadership.\n  I close by saying, we left the Defense appropriations bill, brought \nit out of committee today. It contains $50 billion for our continuing \nefforts in Iraq. I will provide and vote for every penny our service \nmen and women need, but I also believe we have an obligation to \nAmericans here. A stronger America starts at home. That means being \nprepared for the next challenge we face, and this avian flu pandemic \ncould easily be that challenge.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I will be brief. I \nknow we have gone way over the time here today.\n  Mr. President, in the midst of so much difficulty that our Nation is \nfacing--Katrina and Rita, the ongoing challenges in Iraq and \nAfghanistan--I recognize it is hard to get the public, the leadership \nin Congress, and senior administration officials to focus on yet one \nmore challenge.\n  But as has already been stated by the Democratic leader, Harry Reid, \nand my senior colleague, the minority whip, Senator Dick Durbin, this \nis a crisis to which the entire country simply must awaken itself.\n  When I started talking about this 7 months ago, not too many folks \npaid attention. Perhaps because the shorthand for this looming crisis \nis the ``bird flu,'' people assume it is just going to get birds and \nanimals sick.\n  In reality, however, what is at stake here is the potential of a \npandemic that we have not seen in the United States since 1918, 1919. \nAs has already been stated here tonight, our top scientists and medical \npersonnel, including the heads of the NIH, CDC, and the Department of \nHealth and Human Services, all agree that it is almost inevitable that \nan avian flu pandemic will strike.\n  The key question is the extent of the damage, especially in terms of \nlives lost. The answer to this question will,\n\n[[Page S10629]]\n\nin large measure, depend on our level of preparedness and the amount of \nresources we are willing to immediately commit to deal with this \nlooming crisis.\n  Over the last few months, we have seen alarming reports from \ncountries all over Asia--Indonesia, China, Vietnam, Thailand, and \nRussia, just to name a few--about deaths that have resulted from the \navian flu.\n  The situation has turned so ominous that Dr. Julie Gerberding, the \nDirector of the CDC, said that an avian flu outbreak is ``the most \nimportant threat that we are facing [today].''\n  International health experts say that two of the three conditions for \nan avian flu pandemic in Southeast Asia already exist.\n  First, a new strain of the virus, called H5N1, has emerged, and \nhumans have little or no immunity to it. Second, this strain has \ndemonstrated the ability to jump between species.\n  The only thing preventing a full blown pandemic is a lack of \nefficient transmission of this strain from human to human. Once that \nhappens, as a consequence of international travel and commerce, there \nis not going to be any way to effectively contain this pandemic.\n  Moreover, the news on this last point is not good. In recent months, \nthe virus has been detected in mammals that have never previously been \ninfected, including tigers, leopards and domestic cats. This suggests \nthat the virus is mutating and could eventually emerge in a form that \nis readily transmittable among humans.\n  Mr. President, Senator Reid and Senator Durbin both outlined some of \nthe measures that have to be put in place here domestically to protect \nour population. We have to drastically ramp up our stockpiles of \nTamiflu, which, if taken properly, could act as a treatment from the \navian flu once a person is infected. Right now, we only have a couple \nof million doses. We need 80 million to 100 million doses in order to \nbe adequately prepared. That is going to cost us significant amounts of \nmoney, as the cost of Tamiflu is approximately $20 per dose.\n  In addition, we are going to have to develop flu vaccines of a sort \nwe have not seen in the past. In order to create sufficient quantities, \nwe are going to have to go push the boundaries of existing technologies \nand science--going beyond the agricultural mechanisms of developing \nvaccines that we have used in the past.\n  Third, we are going to make sure that local and State governments \nunderstand how urgent this is. We have to ensure there are clear plans, \ncoordination mechanisms, and lines of authority--that will stand up in \na time of crisis. Right now, we do not have sufficient plans in place \nto make sure local and State agencies are able to generate the kinds of \nrapid responses that are going to be necessary in the case of a flu \noutbreak.\n  After Katrina, I hope that local and State governments understand \nthey have to work with the Federal agencies more effectively to deal \nwith these kinds of emergencies.\n  Another issue I would mention is that we are going to have to \nestablish international protocols to ensure we can alert ourselves \nrapidly if we have confirmed cases of human-to-human transmission of \nthe avian flu anywhere in the world. Why do I mention this? If we \ndetect efficient human-to-human transmission, it is likely that we are \ngoing to have only weeks before we are going to see those first cases \nin the United States.\n  This means placing effective trigger mechanisms in all these \ncountries to make sure everyone is cooperating and providing rapid \ninformation, which could mean the difference in terms of tens or \nhundreds of thousands of lives.\n  Now I don't want to suggest that nothing is being done. For example, \nmonths ago, Congress, on a bipartisan basis including myself, Senator \nLugar, Senator McConnell, and Senator Leahy--included $25 million as \npart of the Iraq supplemental to make contribute to an urgent WHO \nappeal on this issue. Today, this money is making a difference in the \nfield trying to set up some of the international measures I just \ndescribed.\n  I, along with Senators Lugar, Durbin and others, introduced \nlegislation, S. 969, to enhance our ability to deal with this potential \ncrisis. But that was months ago, and we need to broaden the number of \npeople involved in this effort.\n  Moreover, these is are modest first steps. Going forward, we are \ngoing to need significantly more resources. I am eager to work with \nleaders on health issues, including Senator Harkin and Senator Reid, as \nwell as others across the aisle.\n  I hope we can work not only to make sure we have an effective \ninternational regime to deal with this problem overseas but that we \nalso invest the time, the energy, and the resources needed to put in \nplace effective measures well before we have a full blown crisis on our \nhands.\n  An outbreak of the avian flu could occur in a year, 5 years, 10 \nyears, or if we were incredibly lucky not happen at all. But the one \ngood thing about investing in measures to deal with this looming crisis \nis--and I will end on this point--if we spend the money now, it will \npay dividends, even if this particular strain of the avian flu outbreak \ndoes not occur.\n  Why is this the case? The risk of some sort of pandemic, and the \nmutations of flus for which we have no immunity, is almost inevitable. \nThe H5N1 strain may not be the strain that leads to a full blown \npandemic. But, another strain could easily come along a cause serious \ndamage in the future.\n  Presently, we simply do not have the public health infrastructure to \ndeal adequately with this contingency.\n  My point is this: undertaking these measures is going to be a wise \ninvestment that will help protect the lives of millions of people here \nin the United States and across the globe.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate your patience very much and look forward \nto working with you on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
