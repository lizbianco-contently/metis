Under the order from last week, at 2:30, we \nwill begin 3 hours of debate in relation to the Kennedy and Santorum \namendments regarding minimum wage. That consent agreement provides for \ntwo votes to begin at 5:30 today on the Kennedy and Santorum minimum \nwage amendments.\n  I do remind my colleagues that a cloture motion was filed on Friday, \nand that cloture vote will occur at 2:15 on Tuesday. Senators should \nalso be aware that under the provisions of rule XXII, and pursuant to \nour unanimous consent agreement, all first-degree amendments should be \nfiled by 2:30 today and second-degrees by noon tomorrow. We also have a \nunanimous consent agreement that provides for a vote in relation to the \nSchumer amendment at 12:15 p.m. tomorrow, on Tuesday.\n  With that said, we will have busy sessions over the next couple of \ndays as we try to finish our work on the bankruptcy bill. I do hope we \ncan invoke cloture tomorrow afternoon and bring this bill to a final \nvote. As all Senators know, if cloture is invoked, germane amendments \nare still in order, and there could be up to an additional 30 hours of \nconsideration.\n\n  Last week, we had a productive week. We had full days of debate and \nvotes. Therefore, I expect we will complete action on the bill either \nTuesday or Wednesday of this week.\n  Mr. President, I would be happy to turn to the Democratic leader.\n  Mr. President, I would like to make a few comments on another issue \nnow because at 2:30 today we will be going to the debate on the minimum \nwage amendments.\n\n\n     Pilgrimage to Selma And The 40th Anniversary of Bloody Sunday\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to spend a few moments reflecting on a \nhistorical event that occurred 40 years ago today. Historians view the \n1965 Selma to Montgomery Voting Rights March as one of the emotional \nhigh points of the modern civil rights movement that began in the \n1950s.\n  Yesterday, a number of Members of Congress went on a pilgrimage to \nSelma and marched across that Edmund Pettus Bridge. I was part of that \ndelegation. I had that opportunity to do that same march in remembrance \nof the Selma to Montgomery 1965 crossing of that bridge in the past.\n  From a historical standpoint, as we look back, we recall that 40 \nyears ago today--actually on a Sunday--but 40 years ago today, on that \nSunday, on\n\n[[Page S2112]]\n\nthat march, approximately 600 people left historic Brown Chapel and \nwalked a few blocks and then went around the corner and over that \nEdmund Pettus Bridge, going east toward Montgomery. They went on the \nother side of that arching bridge, and they encountered local law \nenforcement officers. The group of officers and some others drove the \nmarchers back across the bridge in a violent episode and series of \nactions over the next few minutes. They were pushed back the equivalent \nof several blocks over the bridge and then back to the church.\n  The activity was chaotic. They had billy clubs, tear gas. Most of us \nare familiar with the tragic story. That Sunday now has become known, \nsince that time, as Bloody Sunday, and thus today is the 40th \nanniversary of Bloody Sunday. That Bloody Sunday earned, appropriately, \nnational attention. And much of what happened in terms of the evolution \nof the civil rights movement, reaching that huge landmark on August 6, \n1965, when President Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, was \nrealized.\n  Just a couple of comments about the course of the day. Again, it was \na large bipartisan delegation of House and Senate Members. We arrived \nin Selma early yesterday morning and visited two of the museums there. \nWe then went to the church service at the historic Brown Chapel AME, \nAfrican Methodist Episcopal, Church.\n  I had the opportunity to visit and worship in that church before, but \nyesterday it captured me. The church itself was packed. It is a \nhistoric church, and there is a large balcony in the back and balconies \non either side.\n  As our delegation, which was probably 40 or 50 House and Senate \nMembers, crowded in with another several hundred people, with the \nbalconies full, you could not help but to imagine what it must have \nbeen like 40 years ago--41, 42 years ago. In that period, that church \nbecame the real refuge, sense of security for the movement that evolved \nand really instigated, in many ways, the ability for all Americans to \nvote today, culminating in that signing by President Johnson later in \n1965, on August 6, 1965.\n  Yesterday, in the church service, Rev. James Jackson, the pastor of \nthat church, opened the service itself. And we had a wonderful sermon \nthat was delivered in commemoration by the Rev. C.T. Vivian. Reverend \nVivian was an inspirational speaker in his presentation.\n  But what was fascinating to me was it was his early participation, \nreally, in Nashville, TN, working alongside others who were there \nyesterday, Congressman John Lewis and so many others, that in Nashville \nthat nonviolent movement, and the discipline involved in that movement, \nwas developed. It was developed in meetings, in churches all over \nNashville, TN, setting out a defined curriculum based on the great \nteachings in the Bible and from Gandhi and so many others.\n  It was that same discipline that yesterday now-Congressman John Lewis \nshared with us, as they marched from Brown Chapel, two by two by two, \nwhere he and Hosea Williams led that march up on that sidewalk, dressed \nin their suits, recognizing that once they got over that bridge, or to \nthe peak of that bridge, at the bottom of the hill down there, there \nwere law enforcement officers whom they knew in all likelihood would \ndrive them back.\n  Yesterday was a gorgeous day. To be able to march arm in arm, linked \nacross that bridge, with people like Congressman John Lewis and Fred \nShuttlesworth, who played such a prominent role in Birmingham, and \nBernard Lafayette, a close personal friend of mine who now lives in \nConnecticut, was a great privilege and a great opportunity.\n  I share all this with my colleagues to thank those who could be with \nus but also in recognition of today being that 40th anniversary that, \nyes, was called Bloody Sunday, but did become a turning point and led \nto the rights that we all enjoy today, but underscoring the importance \nof fighting for, with discipline and nonviolence, those rights of \njustice and equality and freedom.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                             Energy Prices\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, with crude oil prices at almost $54 a \nbarrel, and OPEC meeting in 9 days, I have come to the floor this \nafternoon to urge the administration to pursue what they promised; that \nis, to stand up for our consumers who are facing high oil and gasoline \nprices.\n  The news just this last weekend was not good on the pricing front as \nit relates to the American consumer. The Lundberg survey of American \ngasoline retailers came out Sunday and confirmed what a lot of \nAmericans suspected. The price of gas is rising high, and it is rising \nfast.\n  According to the survey that came out Sunday, the price of gasoline \nhas risen nearly 7 cents per gallon in the last 2 weeks, across the \nboard, for all grades. And the Lundberg survey indicates that this is \njust the beginning, that higher prices are on the way.\n  Now, last week, Mr. President and colleagues, I asked the U.S. \nSecretary of Energy, Mr. Bodman, whether he was going to do what the \nadministration promised; that is, to stand up for the consumer and try \nto push OPEC as hard as possible to get some pricing relief when they \nmeet in a few days.\n  Mr. Bodman said, in response to my questions, that he had not made \nthat call and, well, he had a whole lot on his plate. I do not think \nthat is good enough. I think we have to ask this administration, and \nthe President specifically, about using their political capital now to \nstand up for the American consumer who is getting clobbered by these \ngasoline and oil prices.\n  If they are not going to use it now, when are they going to use it? \nWhy not use it on behalf of American consumers when there is such a \ndemonstrable cause and effect between the price of crude oil rising and \nthe price of gasoline rising?\n  Over the weekend, the Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary Snow, said \nrising energy prices have the potential to stifle economic growth in \nthe near future. Maybe Secretary Snow is willing to get on the phone \nwith OPEC if Secretary Bodman will not. But I know somebody ought to be \ndoing it. And that is exactly what the President of the United States \npromised in 2000. He said that if the country elected him, he would \npush OPEC very hard to try to turn on the spigot and get some pricing \nrelief.\n\n  OPEC is making all the usual noises. They are concerned, they have \nsaid, about rising prices. They think the market has plenty of oil.\n  As I said before, OPEC is going to look out for OPEC. The question is \nwhether this administration is going to stand up for the American \nconsumer as they promised in 2000. If the Secretary of Energy won't \npick up the phone to do that, the American people deserve a better \nanswer than to say, Well, gosh, I have a whole lot on my plate. If the \naverage American didn't send their tax return in on April 15 saying, \nGosh, I have a lot on my plate, I don't think that would be acceptable, \nnot to this administration, not to me, not to anybody. So the excuse \ndoesn't wash when it comes to the Energy Department's duty to go to bat \nagainst high oil prices.\n  We need, at home, on a bipartisan basis, as it relates to OPEC \nabroad, to stand up for our consumers who are faced with escalating \nenergy prices that seem to go up by the day. I don't think it is right \nto let OPEC run roughshod over the American consumer and we make no \ncomment other than to say, Gosh, we have a lot on our plate.\n  Nine days from now OPEC is going to meet. Time is ticking away. But \nthere is still time for the administration to deliver on what they \npromised to the American people; that is, to protect our consumers from \nhigh oil and gasoline prices. I urge they take just that action. If Mr. \nBodman won't do it, as he indicated last Thursday, maybe somebody else \nin the Bush administration will.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. As a Senator from the State of Alaska, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is S. 256 which has been \nreported.\n\n[[Page S2113]]\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of every \nAmerican who each year is forced unknowingly to pay a hidden tax. We \nall know we have to pay an income tax, a sales tax, a payroll tax, but \nwhat about a bankruptcy tax? You may not have heard of this tax, but \nyou and every other man, woman, and child in America pay it every \nsingle year. It is the accumulated cost of higher interest rates on \ncredit, higher downpayments on a car or other essential items, and \nhigher penalty fees and late charges for financial transactions. It is \nthe result of the abuse of America's bankruptcy system which allows \npeople who still have the ability to pay back some or all of their debt \nto declare bankruptcy and escape responsibility for what they owe.\n  Somebody has to pay those unpaid bills. And that somebody is you. \nCompanies have no choice but to pass them on to the consumer.\n  When I mention this bankruptcy tax, you may think I am talking about \nsmall change, the kind of money you can find under your couch cushions. \nYou would be wrong. According to a Department of Justice study, the \nbankruptcy tax amounts to a staggering $400 for every man, woman, and \nchild in America once a year every year. Let me repeat that so I can be \nsure it soaks in. That is $400 for every man, woman, and child in \nAmerica once a year every year.\n  That amount of money would mean a lot to a family in my home State of \nKentucky where the median income is $36,936 a year. That means the \naverage Kentuckian has to work 4 days a year to pay the bankruptcy tax. \nIn fact, it is the lower income families who feel the sting of the \nbankruptcy tax the most. Higher interest rates can stop them from \ngetting access to credit for a home, transportation to a necessary job, \nor even higher education.\n  Our bankruptcy system was originally created to give those who were \nhopelessly mired in debt a way out and a second chance. As long as it \nwas used sparingly and applied only to those who most needed its mercy, \nit was the compassionate way for America to make sure that none of her \nneediest became trapped in a lifetime of deficit and despair. But in \nrecent years, too many are abusing the bankruptcy system. Last year \nnearly 1.6 million individuals filed for bankruptcy, a record high. \nThis number is five times greater than the number of individual \nbankruptcy filings 20 years ago.\n  It seems odd so many more Americans would choose bankruptcy over that \n20-year period, especially when you recognize that the last 20 years \nhave set new records for economic growth, low unemployment, and low \ninterest rates. The answer to this mystery is fraud and abuse of the \nbankruptcy system. In fact, the FBI has estimated over 10 percent of \nall bankruptcy filings involve at least some fraud.\n  Bankruptcy was created as a ladder to greater economic opportunity. \nIt should not be an escape hatch to avoid responsibility. A few weeks \nago this Senate, on a bipartisan basis, passed the moderate, \ncommonsense Class Action Fairness Act to curb some of the abuses of our \nlegal system. It was the first substantive bill passed by this new \nCongress. It was supported by Democrats and Republicans and has been \nsigned into law by President Bush. I am very pleased that this 109th \nCongress has started off in a tone of bipartisan agreement and \ncordiality. I think passing the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and \nConsumer Protection Act of 2005 can be the next step in furthering that \nsense of cooperation. Like the Class Action Fairness Act, this bill is \na moderate, commonsense bill with bipartisan support. It passed out of \nthe Judiciary Committee with bipartisan support. It has passed this \nSenate with bipartisan majorities before. It should be entirely within \nour power to pass it now and send it on to the President for his \nsignature.\n\n  Right now individuals have two options for declaring bankruptcy. They \nmay file under chapter 7, surrender their assets to be sold, and then \nbe released from all debt. They start again with a fresh slate, leaving \ntheir creditors unpaid.\n  The second option is to file under chapter 13. In that case an \nindividual must work with a bankruptcy court and draft a payment plan \nto satisfy as much outstanding debt as possible, given the debtor's \nincome. The problem is too many people are filing under the more \nlenient chapter 7, leaving their debts unpaid even when they have \nsizable income and sizable assets. Some are choosing it as an avenue to \ncommit fraud.\n  The bill currently before the Senate will institute a means test to \nsort out those who file chapter 7 but actually have the ability to live \nup to their obligations. This is not a draconian measure, by any means. \nOnly about 7 to 10 percent of chapter 7 filers will be screened out by \nthe means test which will be administered by a bankruptcy court.\n  Any debtor who earns less than their State's median income--and that \nincludes about 80 percent of the debtors in question--will remain in \nchapter 7. Those earning more than the State median income will be \nallowed to deduct certain obligations and expenses from their net \nworth, thus allowing some of them to also remain in chapter 7. And \nanyone left will be able to show special circumstances for why they \nshould be allowed to still file under chapter 7. So there will be \nplenty of opportunities for the neediest among us to file chapter 7 and \nuse the safe haven of bankruptcy as it was originally intended.\n  Those remaining will be required to file under chapter 13. It is not \ntoo much to ask people to pay back what they owe when they clearly have \nthe means to do so. And those who are abusing the system will be \nexposed. Catching the individuals who are defrauding the system to \navoid responsibility will save America $3 billion a year--a good start \nfor reforming our system. That $3 billion rightfully belongs to the \nAmerican people who are forced to pay the egregious bankruptcy tax. \nThey are being robbed by an unscrupulous few.\n  It is our responsibility to end the fraud and abuse in the bankruptcy \nsystem by passing this bill. It will strengthen our economy, and it is \nalso the right thing to do.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the hour of 2:30 having arrived, there will \nnow be 3 hours of debate, equally divided, on the Santorum and Kennedy \namendments.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I understand it, we have an hour and a \nhalf on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 44\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be temporarily set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \npending amendment is laid aside.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, at 5:30, the Senate will have an \nopportunity to vote on an increase in the minimum wage, and we have not \nhad an opportunity to increase the minimum wage for some 8 years. The \npurchasing power of the minimum wage is now probably at its second \nlowest purchasing level in the history of the minimum wage and is \ndeteriorating every single day, in terms of purchasing power.\n  These individuals that work at the minimum wage are hard-working \nindividuals, men and women of great pride--primarily women, and women \nwith children, and in many instances men and women of color. \nHistorically, this issue has not been a partisan issue. Republicans and \nDemocrats have joined together to raise the minimum wage because we \nhave believed as a country and as a society that work is important, \nwork should be rewarded, and that men and women who work hard, 40 hours \na week, should not have to live in poverty, particularly those who have \nchildren. Nonetheless, we have seen that those millions of workers who \nwork hard and work at the minimum wage have been falling farther and \nfarther behind.\n  People can ask, why is this relevant to the bankruptcy bill? In fact, \na third of all bankruptcies take place from people who have income \nbelow the poverty level.\n\n[[Page S2114]]\n\n  What we see on this chart is the fact that the real minimum wage has \nfallen now to just about $10,000 a year for a family of three. It is \nabout $5,000 below the poverty line. If you are able to get individuals \nup so they have more purchasing power, particularly against the \nbackground which has seen an explosion of health care premiums, housing \ncosts--in my own State of Massachusetts, we have the second highest \nhousing costs of any State in the country. The cost of the general \nstandard of living has put enormous pressure on these individuals that \nare hard-working and are at the lower end of the economic ladder. So \nthis has a direct relevancy to the bankruptcy bill--trying to raise \nindividuals to a point where they are going to be able to meet their \nfinancial obligations; that is extremely important. We have seen, as I \njust mentioned, over the period of these past 5 years what has happened \nwith health insurance, college tuition, housing, and gasoline.\n  Most of these minimum wage workers have no such thing as health \ninsurance, few are able to save for college tuition, housing has gone \nup dramatically, and many of them are dependent upon driving in order \nto get to available jobs. So they have been enormously impacted by the \nincrease in costs. We have seen that four million more Americans have \ngone into poverty over the last 4 years. As a result of the census, \nmore than 1 million more children have gone into poverty over the last \n4 years.\n  These statistics tell the story. What also tells the story is this \nchart, which shows that Americans' work hours have increased more than \nany other industrialized country in the world. This chart indicates, \nusing a baseline, what has happened from 1970, the last 30 years, in \nterms of people working. We found out that Americans are working longer \nand harder than in most other industrial nations in the world. What we \nfind is that they are working longer and harder and, look at the \nresults of working long and hard. They are producing more but making \nless. The increase in terms of productivity has been anywhere from 25 \nto 30 percent American workers. Do you think that has been reflected in \nany increase in the minimum wage? Absolutely not. That is because \nCongress has been unwilling to increase the minimum wage. As a matter \nof fact, when I offered this legislation even on the welfare bill, \nwhich my friend and colleague from Pennsylvania says is where it \nbelongs, the legislation was pulled last year, rather than having a \ndebate and vote on an increase in the minimum wage.\n  I offered it on State Department reauthorization because the other \nside--the Republican leadership--would not give us an opportunity or a \nvehicle on which to consider this legislation, or by itself, so it was \nnecessary to try to amend existing legislation. They said, oh, no, and \nthey pulled that legislation. When I offered it last year on the class \naction bill, they pulled the class action bill because they did not \nwant to vote on an increase in the minimum wage.\n  So we find that Americans are working harder; we find a dramatic \nincrease in productivity; we see explosions in cost; we see the \npurchasing power of the minimum wage going down to its second lowest \nlevel; and we see that so many of these individuals who are below the \nline of poverty end up in bankruptcy.\n  This is just the background. There will be those who will say we \ncannot really afford to have an increase in the minimum wage because it \nis going to add a great deal to the problems of inflation. Right? \nWrong.\n  First of all, this chart indicates exactly what the impact of the \nincrease in the minimum wage is in our budget. All Americans combined \nearn $5.4 trillion a year. A minimum wage increase to $7.25 would be \nless than one-fifth of 1 percent of national payroll. Do we understand \nthat? The payroll is $5.4 trillion a year and we are talking about less \nthan one-fifth of 1 percent. This doesn't have an adverse impact on \ninflation in terms of this country. We have seen from the various \nstudies, which we will refer to later, that neither does it have in \nterms of employment.\n  This is an issue, ultimately, about fairness. That is why this is so \nimportant. It is interesting that this Congress has not hesitated to \nvote itself a pay increase during this period of time, but not for the \nminimum wage earners. The height of hypocrisy will be this afternoon. \nThe height of hypocrisy will be this afternoon when those individuals \nin the U.S. Senate say no to $7.25 an hour for hard-working Americans \nafter they have accepted a $28,500 pay increase for themselves over the \nlast 8 years.\n  Do you understand that? They have been willing to vote on a pay \nincrease for themselves, and we will find out whether they are going to \nvote for hard-working Americans who are trying to make ends meet and \nprovide for their families and their children.\n  It is as stark as that. That is what happened. This is where the \nminimum wage has been since the last increase in 1997. It has been flat \nover all these years--but not for the Members of Congress. You can \nunderstand why Members don't want to vote on increasing the minimum \nwage; it is because of that.\n  It is not very surprising to me because we had an increase under the \nfirst President Bush. We had an increase in the minimum wage under \nPresident Ford and one under President Eisenhower. We have had it in a \nbipartisan way throughout history. But absolutely not now. The \nRepublican leadership in the House of Representatives and the Senate of \nthe United States says, no way. This is the record of where we have \nseen it: Dwight Eisenhower, Jerry Ford, the first President Bush, \nFranklin Roosevelt, John Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Jimmy Carter, and \nBill Clinton. It has been bipartisan over the period of history.\n\n  It is baffling to me why in the world we cannot get an increase now. \nWhat is the reason? What is the reason we hear so much about values? \nDon't we figure that working hard is a value in our society? Don't we \nthink that rewarding work is a value in our society? We will find out \nthis afternoon. We will find out this afternoon, at 5:30, whether our \ncolleagues think that rewarding the men and women who work hard, not \njust on one minimum wage job but often two or three minimum wage jobs, \nis a value.\n  A principal, in surveys of children of these minimum wage workers, \nasked the children what their biggest complaints are. It is not that \nthey are not able to get Christmas presents at Christmastime. It is not \nthat they cannot afford to buy a birthday present for a fellow \nstudent's birthday. It is not that they cannot afford any skates to be \nable to join the other children skating. It is that they say they don't \nsee their parents enough. They don't see their parents enough. There is \nnot enough time with their parents. That is repeated time in and time \nout, again and again, as one of the primary concern of the children of \nminimum wage workers.\n  Here we are debating the bankruptcy bill that has been written by the \ncredit card companies, which have $30 billion in profits this year and \nare looking to collect billions of dollars more as a result of this \nlegislation. That is going to turn our bankruptcy courts into \ncollecting agencies for the credit card industry. And we are going to \nsay, oh, no, no, we cannot afford $7.25 for working men and women.\n  We can afford billions of dollars for the credit card companies--and \nI mean billions of dollars, probably the most profitable industry in \nthis country--but we cannot afford to have an increase in the minimum \nwage. No, it adds to the payrolls of companies. It is going to be \ninflationary. Why are we setting a minimum wage? Let these people work \nharder.\n  At 5:30 p.m., we are going to have two votes. One is going to be to \nincrease the minimum wage to $7.25 an hour in three steps: 70 cents 60 \ndays after enactment, 70 cents a year later, and 70 cents a year after \nthat. My friend from Pennsylvania has offered an alternative amendment, \nthe Santorum amendment. For those who are giving some thought to the \nfact that maybe going to $7.25 is a little bit too much, maybe the \nSantorum amendment makes more sense. I hope they will listen to me now.\n  The Santorum amendment gives half of the increase to minimum wage \nworkers with one hand and then--listen to me--takes away minimum wage, \novertime, and equal pay rights from over 10 million workers with the \nother hand. It takes just one page of the\n\n[[Page S2115]]\n\nSantorum amendment--here is my amendment, Mr. President. It is three \npages to raise the minimum wage to $7.25. Here is the Santorum \namendment--85 pages. If he was only raising the minimum wage half of \nwhat I propose, he would be able to do it in three pages, too. That \nought to say something to our colleagues.\n  What else is in the amendment? It is extraordinary. It takes one \npage, as I mentioned, to raise the minimum wage, and 84 pages are \nspecial interest giveaways that take rights away from workers.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania has a record of opposing the increase \nin the minimum wage, and I understand that. That is his record. He has \nvoted against it at least 17 times in the last 10 years, so today is \nreally no different.\n  The Santorum amendment will increase the minimum wage by $1.10 cents \nan hour. It will benefit 1.8 million workers. Do we understand that--\n1.8 million workers. He goes up to $6.25. Ours goes to $7.25 and \nbenefits 7.3 million directly and an additional 8 million more \nAmericans; 3.4 million of those are parents with children. But Santorum \nbenefits only 1.8 million. He is not just saying we will take $6.25 in \nplace of $7.25; we only want that. Oh, no, he is only covering 1.8 \nmillion. That is enormously important.\n  So what does he do? The Santorum amendment makes more than 10 million \nworkers no longer eligible for the minimum wage, no longer eligible for \novertime pay, no longer eligible for equal pay rights by repealing the \nindividual coverage under the Fair Labor Standards Act and raising the \nthreshold to $1 million a year from $500,000. Those workers who work in \nthe small stores that are involved in interstate commerce who are \ncovered under minimum wage, not under Santorum, are excluded. If there \nis a State minimum wage, they are covered. We have a number of States \nthat do not have any minimum wage whatsoever. Then he raises the level \nfrom $500,000 to $1 million as a threshold for the coverage.\n  This is what he does: By eliminating the individual Fair Labor \nStandards Act coverage and raising the business exemption to $1 \nmillion, the Republican proposal jeopardizes worker protections for \nover 10 million workers. Those workers will lose minimum wage, \novertime, and equal pay protections.\n  What do I mean by they lose overtime? This is what the Santorum \namendment does. Under current law, if the employer wants to work out \nflexible time with their employees, they can do it as long as it is \ndone within the 40-hour workweek. That is all legitimate and fair. But \nunder the current law, if an employer wants to work a worker 50 hours \nthis week and 30 hours the next, they have 10 hours of overtime. Under \nthe Santorum amendment, they can work 50 hours one week and 30 hours \nthe next and no overtime. This affects millions of workers who are \ngoing to find out they are going to get a real pay cut. That is what is \nin the Santorum amendment.\n\n  The Santorum amendment also prohibits States from providing stronger \nwage protections than the Federal Government for waiters, waitresses, \nand other employees who rely heavily on their tips for earnings. Do we \nunderstand that, Mr. President? The Santorum amendment puts the long \nFederal arm right at the throats of the States and tells them there is \nno way they can provide the extra reimbursement to these workers.\n  In the State of Pennsylvania, employers are required to pay their \ntipped employees $2.83 an hour. Yet this amendment would deny the hard-\nworking waiters and waitresses the 70 cents an hour employee-provided \nwages. That is not true in every State, but Pennsylvania made that \ndecision. And here on the floor of the Senate is an amendment to deny \nthe people of Pennsylvania from carrying forward their judgment.\n  Mr. President, 22-year-old Julie Phillips in Johnstown, PA, is \nworking two part-time jobs--one at minimum wage making $5.15 an hour \nand another as a waitress at a Chinese restaurant. This amendment would \ndeny Julie 70 cents an hour in wages from her minimum wage job. She \nwould have to rely on unpredictable tips from her second job instead.\n  The amendment also gives a free pass to violators of a broad range of \nconsumer, environmental, and labor protections by prohibiting the \nFederal agencies from assessing civil fines for first-time reported \nviolations. It also preempts the ability of States to enforce these \nlaws. The States are enforcing these laws, but under the Santorum \namendment, they will be denied the opportunity to enforce those laws. \nThose laws are there to protect the workers, but he preempts the \nability of States to enforce these laws.\n  Once again, we are on the Senate floor with legislation written by \nspecial interests which will help them the most. The bankruptcy bill \nwas written by the credit card companies, the class action bill was \nwritten by corporations, deceiving and overcharging their customers, \nand now we have the minimum wage bill written by the restaurant \nindustry and retailers looking for a way to fatten their bottom lines. \nIf the Republicans were truly interested in raising the minimum wage, \nthey would not have loaded their proposal with these antiworker poison \npills that are special interest giveaways. It is hard to believe our \nRepublican colleagues are serious about this thinly veiled attack on \nlow-income workers.\n  There are many ways to help small businesses without denying rights \nto millions of minimum wage workers. We worked together in the past to \nprovide reasonable small business tax relief, along with the minimum \nwage. I would be willing to do that again. Three times in the last \nCongress, the Republican leadership brought down a bill rather than let \nus vote on it. So their actions speak louder than words.\n  A week ago, our Republican friends were touting their so-called \nantipoverty agenda. But as we see with their agenda, what they really \nare doing is creating a deeper poverty agenda. If they are truly \nserious about helping hard-working families rise above the poverty \nline, they will support our amendment to give a fair raise to America's \nlow-income workers.\n  It is shameful that in America today, the richest, most powerful \nNation on Earth, nearly one-fifth of all children go to bed hungry \nbecause their parents are working full time at the minimum wage and \nstill cannot make ends meet. That is a key part of any real antipoverty \nagenda: ending childhood poverty. But the Republican proposal will \nactually plunge even more children into poverty.\n  Mr. President, 3.4 million children have parents who would get an \nimmediate raise under our proposal. Hundreds of thousands of those \nchildren will be left behind by the Santorum amendment. The poison \npills in the Santorum amendment will be particularly harsh for \nchildren. Think about the single mother with two children working as a \nwaitress in Minnesota. Under the Santorum amendment, she will lose her \nguaranteed right to the minimum wage, leaving her paycheck smaller and \nher children less secure. Think about a garment worker working 80 hours \na week to provide for her family. Her husband, a janitor, relies on \novertime as well to pay for food, rent, and clothes for their children. \nThey will lose their overtime coverage under this amendment, and both \nparents will take a pay cut. Some antipoverty agenda.\n  According to the Families and Work Institute, among the most \nimportant aspects children would most like to change about their \nworking parents are these: They wish their parents were less stressed \nout by their work; they wish they were less exhausted by their work; \nand they wish they could spend more time with them. But this amendment \nwill deny overtime for more than 10 million workers, leaving them less \ntime to spend with their children.\n  What is more, this amendment would tie the hands of Federal and State \nagencies trying to enforce the Federal laws that protect families, \nchildren, and communities. It weakens the gun safety protections under \nthe Brady Act, which could lead to an increase in weapons sales to \ncriminals, jeopardizing our neighbors and children's safety. It weakens \nenvironmental laws that require companies to disclose their toxic \nemissions. It weakens reporting requirements under the Clean Water Act \nand Safe Drinking Water Act. It undermines consumer protection laws \nthat require companies to report on the safety of their food. These \nprovisions put all Americans, especially\n\n[[Page S2116]]\n\nchildren, at risk of increased exposure to pollution, toxic substances, \nand serious illness from unsafe foods.\n  We teach our children the importance of hard work. We encourage them \nto do their best in school and be good citizens. We tell them their \nreward will be good jobs that fulfill their hopes and dreams and enable \nthem to support healthy families. That is what America is about. But \nfor the 36 million Americans who live and work in poverty today, that \ndream is unfulfilled. They work as hard as any American--often harder--\nbut too often they are forced into bankruptcy because the minimum wage \nwill not cover their bills and give their families the support they \nneed.\n  We can no longer turn our back on our fellow citizens, but that is \nexactly what is happening in the Senate. Raising the minimum wage is \ncritical to preventing the economic free-fall that often leads to \nbankruptcy. Amending the bankruptcy bill to increase the minimum wage \nwill help many of the people this so-called reform is likely to hurt: \nlow-income families, minorities, and women.\n  As I mentioned, nearly a third of those who file for bankruptcy are \nin poverty at the time they file. That is half a million families who \nare already living below the poverty line and will be plunged into \nfurther hardship with this bankruptcy bill, and many of them are \nminimum wage earners.\n  In the current economy, millions of Americans are suffering: 8 \nmillion are unemployed, 45 million are without health insurance, and 13 \nmillion children live in poverty. Poverty has doubled for full-time, \nfull-year workers since the 1970s. Minimum wage employees work 40 hours \na week, 52 weeks a year, and they deserve to be fairly paid.\n  Low-income families are being squeezed in every direction by the \neconomy, and families are just barely balancing on a cliff of piling \nbills, hoping they will not topple over. Their costs are rising but not \ntheir wages.\n  To make matters worse, the credit card companies prey on low-income \nworkers. They know these workers are desperate. They offer loans at \nexorbitant interest rates that are made to seem cheaper than they are \nby three of the most deceptive words in the English language: minimum \nmonthly payment.\n  While workers struggle, credit card companies reap skyrocketing \nprofits from their hardships. This is not only an economic issue, it is \na family issue and women's issue. Divorced women are 300 percent more \nlikely than single or married women to find themselves in bankruptcy \ncourt, often because they are owed child support or alimony and cannot \ncollect it. They are trying to raise their children but they face a \ndaunting challenge. This bill will make it harder for them to meet that \nchallenge.\n  Sixty-one percent of those who will benefit from the minimum wage \nincrease are women and one-third of those women are mothers. The \nminimum wage is so low today that many workers have to work several \nminimum wage jobs in order to make ends meet.\n  Look what our program will do: Raise the minimum wage to $7.25. That \nis $4,400 to a minimum wage family. That is 2 years of child care. That \nis full tuition for a community college. That is a year and a half of \nheat and electricity. It is more than a year of groceries. It is more \nthan 9 months of rent. That may not sound like a lot for people around \nhere, but that means a great deal to the people who can benefit from \nthis.\n  History clearly shows that raising the minimum wage does not have a \nnegative effect on jobs, employment, or inflation. In the first 4 years \nafter the last minimum wage increase, the economy had its strongest \ngrowth in three decades. More than 11 million new jobs were added at a \nrate of 200,000 a month. Compare that to the 530,000 private sector \njobs lost since this administration took office.\n  Minimum wage will not cause more job losses, but staying the course \non failed economic policies will. Overwhelming numbers of our fellow \ncitizens in Nevada and Florida showed the way last November by voting \nfor a higher minimum wage in their States. It is time for the \nRepublican Party to stop obstructing a fair increase in the minimum \nwage for all employees across the Nation, and I hope that our Members \nwould support this.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senators Lieberman, Durbin, Sarbanes, \nand Harkin be added as cosponsors to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the Kennedy amendment. I \nappreciate very much the Senator's remarks and his commitment and \npassion on this issue, but I did want to make a couple of brief points \nbefore Senator Santorum, who is offering an alternative, has a chance \nto talk about the provisions of his amendment.\n  While I appreciate the belief of the Senator from Massachusetts, I do \nthink it is important to take a step back and allow this debate to \ninclude a sense of what the deeply held concerns are about raising the \nminimum wage, because it is not all a single-sided story. I do not \nsupport the Kennedy amendment because I do not support raising the \nminimum wage, and the reason is as follows: When the minimum wage is \nraised, workers are priced out of the market. That is the economic \nreality that seems to be missing, at least so far, from this \ndiscussion.\n  When the minimum wage is raised, some workers are priced out of the \nlabor market, and we could have a discussion about how many are priced \nout of the market, what mechanisms we might have to deal with that \nfact, but it is an economic fact and the proponents of raising the \nminimum wage like to dismiss this by saying, well, we have a hard time \nmeasuring it, or the economy is large, or we have not been able to \nmeasure significant increases in inflation as a result of increasing \nthe minimum wage.\n  I am not talking about inflation necessarily or economic growth. I am \ntalking about the workers themselves who are priced out of the market, \nand if one does not believe that or they want to dismiss the economics, \nthink about this: If there was not an economic impact, why are we not \ndebating raising the minimum wage to $20 an hour?\n  Well, the answer is obvious. Because if the minimum wage were raised \nto $20 an hour, even the proponents of the Kennedy amendment would have \nto admit it would be cost prohibitive. Thousands, if not millions, of \npeople would be priced out of the market. The number of jobs would \nshrink. Certainly the number of entry level jobs would be reduced.\n  Oh, but they say, we are not proposing raising the minimum wage to \n$20 an hour because we know that is not a good idea. Well, then why are \nthey not proposing to raise it to $10 an hour? Because at $10 an hour \nthey would still have to admit the negative economic effects on prices \nand on the total number of jobs, especially those at the entry level \nthat would be priced out of the market. So instead they seek a lower \nlevel where the negative consequences are much more difficult to \nmeasure but they still exist, because it is an economic fact of life \nthat when the minimum wage is raised, people are being priced out of \nthe markets.\n  The same economic fact is true for $8, $7, or $6 an hour. People are \nbeing priced out of the market. I think this is most disturbing because \nthose priced out of the market are the very ones who most need the \nopportunity. They are entry level workers. They are first-time job \nseekers. They are people making the transition from welfare to work and \nthey are teenagers experiencing their first time in the labor force. \nThey are the ones who most need that job opportunity to build a \nfoundation to develop the experience that will enable them to earn even \nmore money in the future.\n  If one does not believe that, they can go to any small business and \nask them if they are hiring in at minimum wage--and there are very few \nfirms that do hire in at minimum wage, but if they do, how long those \nemployees actually earn at the minimum wage level. It is not long \nbecause once a person has shown 3, 4 or 6 months of ability in a role \nwith an employer, their value has been proven and they are very quickly \ngoing to move above whatever the entry level threshold was.\n  Those who are going to be priced out of the labor market by an \nincrease in the minimum wage are those who most\n\n[[Page S2117]]\n\nneed that first job opportunity, and that is why I strongly disagree \nwith the Senator from Massachusetts and his amendment. The impact may \nbe small, and our economy is $11 trillion. It may only be 10 jobs that \nare affected or 20,000 or 30,000 who never get that first job \nopportunity at a job. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to \nmeasure 10,000, 20,000, or 30,000 jobs in an economy the size of \nAmerica's, but it is there. The economic consequences are real. Again, \nif one does not believe it, if they believe there are no economic \nconsequences, then they should be willing to step down to the Senate \nfloor and offer an amendment to raise the minimum wage to $20 or $30. \nOr why even stop there?\n\n  One final point I do want to make is in regard to a phrase that was \nused by the Senator from Massachusetts. It was a question or a phrase \nabout rewarding work. The question was whether we were willing to stand \nup in the Congress or, I suppose, the Senate in particular, and reward \nwork by supporting an increase in the minimum wage.\n  I have a concern about this phrase because it suggests that as \nFederal legislators it is our job to reward work. That may sound nice, \nbut it suggests that it is our job to set prices, that it is our job to \nset wages, that it is our job to decide whether the work any citizen is \ndoing in the economy, in the private sector, is worth a particular \namount of money, whose work is worth more than someone else's and what \nkind of rewards does the Federal Government give the taxpayer for doing \ntheir job. That is not the role of the Federal Government. We should \nnot be deciding who gets rewarded for work, whose work is of value and \nwhose work is not of value.\n  In fact, there are few countries left on Earth where the central \ngovernment has the responsibility of rewarding work in and of itself, \nand those are countries such as Cuba and North Korea that decide only \nthe federal government should be able to determine what one earns or \ndoes not earn, how much one can charge and or not charge for a given \ngood. Our job is to pass good legislation that creates an economic \nenvironment where people have incentives to commit capital to start \nbusinesses to create economic opportunity and to create jobs and a good \nquality of life.\n  It sounds nice to say we should reward work in the Senate, but the \nonly way to do that in passing Federal legislation is to start and to \ntry to set wages, to try to set prices, and to try to control the \nlevers of the economy. We have seen where that slippery slope can be \ntaken. We do not have to look farther than the former Soviet Union and \nthe former eastern European countries that have rejected that kind of \ncentralized state economy.\n  I appreciate the passion and the commitment of those on the other \nside. I think they are wrong on the economics because the economics \nhurt the very individuals who most need these entry level, first-time \njob opportunities. They are certainly wrong with the idea that setting \nprices for labor, setting prices for goods and deciding whose work has \nvalue and whose work does not have value should start in Washington, \nD.C. That is not the way our market economy works.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to offer an alternative to the \nKennedy amendment on minimum wage. I listened in part to my colleague \nfrom Massachusetts describe that. Obviously I have a slightly different \ntake on what my amendment does than the Senator from Massachusetts \nsuggests, and I will go through that point by point and point out where \nthe Senator from Massachusetts may have exaggerated some of the claims \nabout what destruction this amendment would do to workers in my State \nor any State.\n  I start out by suggesting why I am offering an increase in the \nminimum wage. On this first chart it is important to see this green \nline which is the percentage of hourly workers who are paid the minimum \nwage. Since the minimum wage was instituted--actually not since it was \ninstituted but in the last 25 years we can see that the percentage of \nworkers now covered by the minimum wage is actually the lowest it has \nbeen in quite some time. It is 2.7 percent of hourly paid workers who \nnow get paid the minimum wage. When one looks at that number, it sort \nof cries out a bit and says it is time to bring it back up to be not \nthe absolute bottom where no one is paying that and there is \neffectively no minimum wage--very few people are paid it--to a point \nwhich sort of comports with at least recent history. That is what we \nare trying to accomplish with our amendment, which is to bring it back \nup to about here.\n  Our $1.10 increase over a period of 2 years would cover about 7.4 \npercent of all workers, which is actually slightly higher than it has \nbeen over the last 15 years and is a little above historic trends. \nSenator Kennedy's increase would actually put it to about almost 17 \npercent of workers in the economy who would be making minimum wage, \nwhich at least going back to the 1970s would be much higher than it has \never been as a percentage of wages.\n  So I think what we are suggesting is something that comports with the \ncurrent economy, certainly the way the economy has worked over the last \n20-plus years, as opposed to something that harkens back to long ago \ndays where this was not just a minimum, it actually had, as Senator \nSununu suggested, a dramatic impact on the economy and a potentially \nvery inflationary impact if one looks at where the wages were of this \npercentage of payroll and we have hyperinflation. You remember the 20-\npercent mortgages and all the other things that were going on during \nthe time. That set the wages at a very high level. So look at how we \nare providing a responsible floor for workers without having, as \nSenator Sununu suggested, an impact on the economy, which could be \ninflationary and damaging to all workers, as well as, particularly, \nlower wage workers, looking at high rates of inflation, as well as \nmaking sure we do not disadvantage businesses by pricing them out of \nthe ability to have workers, and also pricing laborers out of the \nmarketplace.\n\n  When you have extraordinarily high rates, as Senator Sununu \nsuggested, $20-an-hour, $30-an-hour minimum wage, you are going to be \npricing a lot of people out of the workforce.\n  I think what we are suggesting is a responsible approach. It keeps up \nwith the tradition over the past few years of a responsible floor for a \nminimum wage. I am very comfortable that our proposal keeps the balance \nbetween the ability of lower skill employees to enter the workforce at \na wage in which they are compensated for the skills they bring to the \njob, and at the same time not forcing employers--because, again, see, \nwe are pretty far down on the number of people working at this level--\nnot forcing employers to forego employment with people in that slightly \nincreased amount we are suggesting. So it is not going to hurt \nemployment, it is not going to hurt their businesses dramatically, and \nto the extent it does, as Senator Kennedy, at least, described the \nprovisions--I don't know that he accurately described the provisions--\nwe do have provisions in the legislation that deal with the smaller \nbusinesses.\n  It is a general rule in the Federal Government that we have lots of \nrequirements--family and medical leave is one example, but there are \nothers, labor laws--that exempt small businesses. We either do it by \nthe number of employees or, in the case of the Fair Labor Standards \nAct, by the amount of revenue that employer happens to take in.\n  In this case, we do raise the cap from $500,000 of revenue for your \nbusiness as being exempt from this provision to $1.2 million. That \nprovision was set, by the way, back in 1990. If you would have indexed \nthat for inflation, it would be $1.5 million today. So we are not even \nkeeping up with inflation. We are actually well below inflation in the \nproposal that is being put forward, but we are capturing more small \nbusinesses that are not affected.\n  This just affects the States that sort of tie their minimum wage laws \nto the Federal laws. If you have a State that has no minimum wage--I \nthink there are six or seven of those--they would stay at the $500,000 \nlevel. We left that provision in place, in a sense to protect workers \nbecause the States have not spoken on this. But for States that are \ntied to the Federal level, we raised it. Obviously, if the States want \nto go back, they are certainly welcome to do\n\n[[Page S2118]]\n\nso. But it does provide an exemption for smaller businesses--those that \nare mom-and-pop stores, those who are just starting to build their \nbusiness--from the Fair Labor Standards Act.\n  It is important to understand. There are other things I will go \nthrough, but before I move off into the other areas of the bill I want \nto talk about how important it is not to dramatically increase the \nminimum wage the way Senator Kennedy has suggested.\n  What we have seen about overtime is that this is where we are today \nwith the real value, if you add in a combination of the minimum wage \nand the earned-income tax credit. Why do we say the earned-income tax \ncredit? You heard the Senator from Massachusetts talk about trying to \nsupport a family, trying to make a living. I am sure he is not going to \ngo out and try to argue for the teenage son of a wealthy businessman, \nthat we have to make sure they earn a minimum wage because that wealthy \nbusinessman's son needs the money. He may need it in his own right, but \nthat is not the purpose of the minimum wage. That is not what it is \nfor.\n  The argument for the minimum wage is we have to make sure those out \nthere in society whom the Senator from Massachusetts talked about--the \nyoung lady in Johnstown, PA, making sure she had coverage. By the way, \nthe provision we authored that Senator Kennedy said applied to her with \nthe tip credit doesn't apply to the State of Pennsylvania. It is \nwritten specifically to exclude States that have spoken on the tip \ncredit. It is only those that have not that this covered. So the young \nwoman in Johnstown, PA, is not covered by the provision. So the example \ngiven by the Senator is inaccurate.\n  But, again, going back to the central point, which is what are we \ntrying to accomplish with the minimum wage, what we are trying to \naccomplish is helping those people trying to support a family or \nthemselves out there working at low-wage jobs, welfare-to-work--that is \nthe example that is used. I am someone, in my office, who takes that \nresponsibility of making sure those who are on welfare have \nopportunities for employment and, in fact, in my office we have hired, \nover the course of my time in the Senate, eight people off of welfare-\nto-work. I take that responsibility as an employer, and also going out \nand talking to employers about the importance of giving people who are \ntransitioned off of welfare, trying to make a living for themselves and \ntheir families, the opportunity to do so.\n  One of the ways we have done that is through the earned-income tax \ncredit. What the earned-income tax credit does is target those who are \ntrying to sustain a family. It helps them by building, on top of the \nminimum wage, some Federal support. But it is targeted support. That \nearned-income tax credit doesn't go to the teenager who is claimed on \nhis father's income taxes who is a wealthy businessman. It goes to the \nmom who has two kids, who needs some help from the Federal Government \nto be able to support those children.\n  This is much more targeted relief, if you will, than the blunt \ninstrument of a minimum wage increase.\n  Having said that, in this chart you see a decline--go all the way \nback to 1939. You see the earned-income tax credit comes in and you see \nthe difference it makes up here recently. We are suggesting to bring it \nback up by $1.10. If you add $1.10 to $7.22, you are at $8.32, which \nwould be higher than it has ever been with the combination of earned-\nincome tax credit and minimum wage.\n  So, again, to suggest somehow or another, as the Senator from \nMassachusetts suggested, that his increase that would bring it off the \nchart, if you will, is a responsible increase--it is a blunt instrument \nthat would benefit teenage kids of millionaires much more than it would \nbenefit these moms here. Why? Because as you get into the higher income \narea, the earned-income tax credit goes away, it starts to phase out. \nSo this blunt instrument of the minimum wage helps folks who are not \nthe point of what a minimum wage is all about. When people come out \nhere and say they need the minimum wage, they don't talk about the son \nof the wealthy businessman as the point. They talk about this mom. \nIncreasing the minimum wage, yes, helps everyone--if you want to say \n``helps.'' Obviously, it will hurt many because they will not be able \nto keep their job at this high rate of pay, for the maybe low skills \nthat the employee may bring to the business.\n\n  But here is what we do. What we do is balance it. We raise it \nslightly to bring the level up to at least this level, which is where \nit was several years ago when we last raised the minimum wage, without \naffecting employers and the ability for low-skill workers to get the \njobs they need and to hold on to them and not to disproportionately \nbenefit a lot of workers out there making minimum wage who are not the \npoint of the minimum wage, and that is folks who are doing so sort of \nas a side line and are not in need of Government interference in the \nmarket to make sure that they have plenty to eat and a place to sleep.\n  It is a much more surgical attempt. I think what we are attempting \nmakes a lot more sense, to help those in need more directly, more \nsurgically, than the blunt instrument the Senator from Massachusetts \nhas suggested. I encourage our colleagues, when they look at our \namendment, I encourage Republican and Democrat colleagues to look at \nwhat we want to accomplish.\n  Let me talk about another provision the Senator from Massachusetts \nseemed to focus on quite a bit, which is the issue of flextime. The \nSenator from Massachusetts talked about how flextime in this \nlegislation is going to force workers into working more than 40 hours a \nweek and deny them all of these--I will not repeat it. Read the \ntranscript. Read the Senator's arguments about how devastating this \nwould be to people, to have flextime imposed upon them.\n  No. 1, this provision as written does not impose anything. What it \nsays is that the employer and the employee have to enter into a written \nagreement, where both have to sign, to agree that the employee will \nwork more hours in 1 week--no more than 10 in addition to the 40 hours, \nin exchange for commensurate hours off the following week. Again, it is \nmutual agreement. It has to be in writing. Of course, the employee can \ndecide to withdraw himself or herself from that agreement.\n  I happen to believe that flextime is a good thing. We have several \nemployees in my office who job share, who use flextime. Federal \nemployees have been able to use flextime for a long time. It is \nsomething that is very popular in the Federal workforce. What we are \ntrying to do is make it available to others outside. Why? I can tell \nyou an example in my own office. The people who job share and have \nflexible hours are moms who are in the workplace. Obviously, we have \nseen a dramatic change in the workplace in the United States since the \nminimum wage laws and the 40-hour workweek was put in place. This entry \ninto the workforce of nontraditional workers, if you will, has given \nrise to a lot of workers seeking to have their hours reflected with \ntheir obligations at home. What we are trying to do is have the laws of \nthe Federal Government reflect the changing dynamics in the workplace \nwithout forcing anybody into a situation where they are not getting \nfairly compensated.\n  But as I talked to I don't know how many parents who are friends and \nneighbors and constituents, they suggested to me the most important \nthing they would like to get out of the workplace is more flexibility \nand more time to be able to do the things that their other job--most \npeople think their more important job, and that is being a husband or a \nwife or a father or a mother--requires them to do at home.\n  The most amazing thing is the Senator from Massachusetts opposes \nthis. I know many who are supporters of the Kennedy amendment and \noppose this, also. We just went on to the AFL-CIO Web site and just \npulled off some things. This is their Web site. You can read the small \nprint, the exact Web page:\n\n       Alternative work schedules encompass work hours that do not \n     often necessarily fall inside the perimeters of the \n     traditional and often rigid 8-hour workday or 40 hour work \n     week. Such schedules allow working people to earn a paycheck \n     while having the flexibility to take care of children, older \n     relatives and other needs.\n\n  The AFL-CIO says they want that, and we are providing that. And all \nof a sudden, maybe because we are providing it, maybe because it is in \na Republican alternative, maybe this is not\n\n[[Page S2119]]\n\na good idea. Again, this is right off the AFL-CIO Web site:\n\n       Changes in the workforce and in the kinds of hours people \n     work are making alternative work schedules increasingly \n     important for working families trying to balance job and \n     family responsibilities.\n       Suggested family friendly provisions: Compressed work week.\n       Common examples of things asked are schedules that allow \n     workers to work eight 9-hour days and one 8-hour day for an \n     extra day off every 2 weeks.\n\n  Under the provisions we have in this law, that is exactly what we \nhave, allowing a mother or father who wants to stay at home instead of \nworking 10 8-hour days a week, work 9 10-hour days. Work extra hours \nthe days that you work for the day off. Again, that is not allowed \nunder the current law. We would have provided that flexibility. Again, \nit would be upon a mutual agreement of both the employee and the \nemployer.\n  Look, there are some suggestions as to how we can make this more \nexplicit, although from everything I read it is very explicit in the \nlegislation as to how that would work. I am certainly happy to sit down \nand talk with the Senator from Massachusetts and see what we can work \nout in the future.\n  What we do in these provisions--yes, we do provide some tax benefits \nfor smaller businesses. We allow for small business expensing. We allow \nfor restaurants to be depreciated. Again, who is going to be affected \nby this predominantly? It is going to be the restaurant industry that \npays employees at this level, and the travel and tourism industry. \nThose are the folks who will be most affected. Those are the ones paid \nat the lower end of the wage scale. So, yes, we do provide some support \nfor them because it is going to cost some of these businesses a \nsubstantial amount of money.\n  We want to provide some relief from a Government mandate, mandating \nadditional cost. So we want to provide additional relief in doing so.\n  What I think we are trying to do is find an acceptable compromise to \nbe able to pass in the Senate.\n  I candidly don't believe--and I told the Senator from Massachusetts \nwhen I spoke to him last week--this is the appropriate place for his \namendment. I understand there are a lot of dynamics at play here. But \nthe Senator from Massachusetts feels compelled to offer it on the \nbankruptcy bill. I don't think there is any secret, after listening to \nthe debate over the past week, that we very much would like to keep \nthis bill on the Senate floor the way it came out of committee and the \nway it has been forged over a period of three Congresses. This \ncompromise has almost passed this year, and time and time again for the \nlast three Congresses. Now we have an opportunity to actually get this \nthing signed--passed by the House in the form it is right now on the \nfloor of the Senate, and then to the President.\n  I was hoping the Senator from Massachusetts would not offer his \namendment and would allow this amendment to the minimum wage laws to be \noffered at a different time. I think we are marking up the welfare \nreform bill this week. It is an extension of the 1997 act. It is an \nappropriate place, in my opinion. We are talking about welfare-to-work, \nand we are talking about helping low-income individuals transition into \nthe workplace and providing them with a quality of life that is family \nsustaining. I was hoping the Senator from Massachusetts would wait \nuntil that time, and maybe we could sit down and work out some sort of \ncompromise that the President would sign. During the campaign, he \ntalked about his willingness to sign a minimum wage proposal similar to \nwhat I put forward. I don't think he would support what the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts proposed.\n  If you want to actually do something to bring this level up, and do \nit in a sort of targeted way that actually helps the people you are \nreally wanting to help focus on--that is, those who are trying to \nprovide for themselves and their families, not working summer jobs or \npart-time jobs or going to school; that is really what we are focusing \non--we can do that in a way that I would argue does not have a poison \npill attached to it.\n  I take great exception to what the Senator from Massachusetts said. \nThese are not poison pills. These are responsible, proworker, pro-\nsmall-business provisions that greatly help the people in this new and \ndynamic workplace of America. It is a very different one than when the \n40-hour week was established.\n  The Senator wants to offer his amendment and lock in a vote. But I \nhope, candidly, that we don't agree to either amendment at this time, \nalthough I would certainly vote for my amendment and vote against the \namendment offered by the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  But I am hopeful that we can get the requisite number of votes down \nthe road on a welfare bill, actually pass this legislation, and get it \nover to the House. House leadership has not expressed a willingness to \nbring this up.\n  Again, as we work on this, we have an opportunity to get it to \nconference and hopefully be able to do something which provides much \nmore targeted relief to workers who are in need, as opposed to Senator \nKennedy's approach which is very blunt, forceful, and destructive, I \nwould argue, and brings a measure of damage to a lot of lower skilled, \nlower income workers. And it would be very damaging to business at the \nsame time in that the economy is recovering very nicely right now.\n  This is a modest approach. It has half the increase the Senator from \nMassachusetts is suggesting. It focuses on those who are most in need. \nAt the same time, it doesn't hurt the small business community. In \nfact, it provides a much needed incentive for them to be able to \ncontinue to hire employees and grow, which is obviously the ticket to \nmiddle-class America.\n  There are other provisions in the bill that I certainly want to talk \nabout a little later. But we have other speakers. I don't want to use \nup all the time.\n  With that, let me yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will take a moment or two to respond to \nmy good friend from New Hampshire and then also to the Senator from \nPennsylvania with regard to the points they have made.\n  First of all, I will respond to the Senator from New Hampshire about \nthe question of whether the increase in minimum wage is really good for \nlow-income working people and whether this isn't going to create more \nproblems for working people because of the increase in the minimum \nwage.\n  He mentioned, if this was such good medicine--$7.25--why aren't we \ngoing for $20 or $25? The obvious simple answer for that is we are \ntalking about a minimum wage, we are not talking about a maximum wage.\n  I haven't even gotten into discussing what has been happening at the \nupper end of the economic ladder and the stories over the weekend that \nshowed the bonuses are going to the wealthiest individuals in the \ncorporate world. They have increased astronomically in a period of the \nlast few years.\n  Since the midthirties, we have had a minimum wage because we believed \nas a matter of social justice men and women who are going to work in \nthis country and have families should at least have some minimum \nstandard, some minimum safety net; that this society is not the society \nof survival of the fittest, but it is also a ``we'' society, not just a \n``me'' society.\n  There has been a recognition of the importance of the minimum wage.\n  I will include in the Record the support for the increase of the \nminimum wage.\n  Mr. President, 552 economists agree, including a number of Nobel \nlaureates. This is a summation of what they say.\n  We believe that a modest increase in the minimum wage would improve \nthe well being of low-wage workers and would not have the adverse \neffect that critics have claimed. In particular, we share the view of \nthe Council of Economic Advisers' economic report, that the weight of \nevidence suggests that the modest increase in the minimum wage has had \nvery little or no effect on employment.\n  That is what an outstanding group of economists have said. Let us not \njust take what they have said, let us take a look at the facts in terms \nof employment and job growth.\n  If you look over at this chart, you will find the increase in the \nminimum wage in October of 1996. We had an increase in the minimum \nwage. In October of 1997, it went up again. The minimum wage increased \nto $4.75 in 1996, and then it went up to $5.15 an hour.\n  This red line is an indication of the job growth during this period \nof time.\n\n[[Page S2120]]\n\n  I don't accept the arguments that my good friend from New Hampshire \nhas made--that this is going to mean the loss of jobs. It just has not \nbeen so.\n  If you look at the historic lows of unemployment after the minimum \nwage, if you look again in 1996, the minimum wage went to $4.75, and \nunemployment went up. It picked up a tenth of a point, but then it \nstarted down.\n  The minimum wage goes up to $5.15, and what happened? It continues to \ngo down.\n  Here is the last time that we have the increase in the minimum wage, \nand we see it had absolutely no impact--none, zero--in terms of \nunemployment, as we reported, for good reason, because it is less than \none-fifth of 1 percent of total payroll. So it has no impact in terms \nof unemployment, and it has virtually no impact in terms of inflation. \nBut it does have an important impact in terms of social justice.\n  This chart is interesting. It indicates that the States with the \nhigher minium wage add more jobs. These are the 39 States with the \nminimum wage at $5.15. Their employment growth has been 4.1 percent, \nand some have been somewhat higher at 6.2 percent.\n  We have debated this time in and time out. The most inclusive studies \nwere the Card-Krueger studies and the conclusions they have made. They \nare from Princeton, NJ.\n\n       Contrary to the central prediction of the textbook model of \n     the minimum wage, but consistent with a number of recent \n     studies based on a cross-sectional time series comparison of \n     affected and under-affected communities of unaffected markets \n     or employees, we find no evidence that the rise in New \n     Jersey's minimum wage reduced employment.\n\n  This is pretty well established. It has a dramatic impact in other \nareas.\n  I listened with interest to the Senator from Pennsylvania talking \nabout the increase in the minimum wage. Better than 60 percent of the \nincrease in the minimum wage goes for the lowest 40 percent on the \neconomic ladder.\n  Let us look at what has been happening in our country in the recent \ntimes since the last increase in the minimum wage.\n  This is in the area of hunger. We have the survey of hunger and \nhomelessness by the Conference of Mayors. This is December 2004. This \nis in their summary:\n  Officials in the survey estimate that during the past year, requests \nfor emergency food assistance increased by an average of 14 percent, \nwith 96 percent of the cities registering an increase; requests for \nfood assistance by families with children increased by an average of 13 \npercent; 56 percent of the people requesting emergency food were \nmembers of families, children and parents; 34 percent of adults \nrequesting food assistance were employed.\n  These are people who just can't make it with the $5.15 increase in \nthe minimum wage.\n  Then I heard about flextime. We are all for flextime. The argument is \nvery simple on the issue of flextime. Our Republican friends want \nflextime when the employer can decide it. They have flextime now under \ncurrent minimum wage. They can work that out with regard to flextime, \nup to 40 hours. Then, if it is going to be more than 40 hours, they \nhave the overtime. But they negotiated that out. That is permitted \ntoday under the law.\n  But that isn't what the Senator's amendment would say. If the \nemployer wants that individual to work 50 hours 1 week, and 30 hours \nthe next week, the employer can make up their mind.\n  Why is it always the individual employer who makes it up?\n  It was nice to hear my friend from Pennsylvania say they work it out \nover in their office, and sometimes they work longer hours.\n  I would say, by and large, they work it out--the employees work it \nout.\n\n  I doubt very much for many of us in the Senate, if we just told our \npeople what they were going to have to do, if they did not do it in the \nsense of expectation and teamwork, I don't think we are going to be \nvery much value to many of our constituents.\n  The fact is, under the Santorum amendment one person makes that \ndecision on flextime, and that is the employer. If the employee says, \nLook, I have a child who is in a play that I would like to go to, and \nthe employer says, No, you can't go--you don't go.\n  We tried for many years. I mentioned before the Senator arrived on \nthe floor of the Senate, I think he has been against any increase in \nthe minimum wage 17 times. It is a little difficult to get much \nencouragement.\n  I think the Murray amendment asked that an employee would be able to \ntake 24 hours off with sufficient notice because of a child with \nmedical appointments, or because a child might be in a play, or a child \nmight have some special event. I was here many times when the Senator \nfrom the State of Washington offered that amendment. It was voted down \nevery single time. The only way we get flextime is when the employer \ndoes it. That is not fair. That is not right. He is correct. That is \nwhat this bill does. And he will permit the employer to make that \njudgment.\n  I want to make another point or two about the U.S. Conference of \nMayors study.\n  Seventeen percent of the homeless people in cities, according to the \nConference of Mayors, are employed. Ten percent are veterans.\n  The demand for emergency shelter is increasing. Seventy percent of \nthe cities are reporting an increase in the last year, and the \npercentage of cities reporting an increase with homeless families with \nchildren is even greater.\n  This is what is happening. It isn't just the Senator from \nMassachusetts. This is the Conference of Mayors telling about what is \nhappening in urban and rural America. It is also about growth.\n  This is the general challenge. We have too many Americans who are now \nliving in poverty.\n  One in every 10 families, up to 44 million Americans, live poverty--\none out of every six children; one out of every five Hispanics; one out \nof every four Americans. The greatest impact of raising the minimum \nwage is going to be lifting up Hispanics and African American workers. \nThat is what the statistics demonstrate.\n  I don't know why we have the imperative of constantly saying no, that \nwe are just not going to help people who are working and want to work.\n  An interesting point--not a major one--is that when we raise the \nminimum wage, it not only affects the 15 million lowest income people; \nsome of those people then will not be eligible for some of the other \nprograms. So it saves the taxpayer some money. We move them out and \nwork with the earned-income tax credit. We have the earned-income tax \ncredit that works with families who have children. If there is an \nincrease in the earned-income tax credit, if you have two or three \nchildren, that is the way to go. For a single worker, if we are talking \nabout a single mom with one or two children, an increase of the minimum \nwage is the way to go.\n  As a society, if you are interested in trying to do something about \npoverty and working families, you are trying to do something about both \nof those.\n  My friend from Iowa is here and I want to mention to him, because he \nhas been a leader in the Senate regarding overtime compensation, under \nthe Santorum amendment, this will take away the overtime rights that \nexist for minimum wage workers because it excludes 10 million workers \nfrom the Fair Labor Standards Act--6 million last year--and it will \nresult in millions losing their overtime coverage.\n  The second point I mention to my friend from Iowa, in this \nlegislation there is a prohibition for States to enforce their tax \ncredit provisions. We have the tip credit for $2.12 or $2.13, and that \nis the Federal credit. Under the Santorum amendment, we are taking away \nany kind of enforcement of that, not just by the Federal Government but \nthe State government.\n  I brought this up earlier because I want to remind the Senator from \nIowa the amendment on the increase in the minimum wage happens to be 3 \npages long; his is 85 pages. That includes not only the tip credit, not \nonly eliminating from coverage those workers who work even in companies \nthat are capitalized at $500,000, if they are in interstate commerce--\nThat has been part of the minimum wage since the 1930s--but the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania wants to take out that kind of coverage. Hundreds of \nthousands of workers will lose their coverage.\n  I don't understand why he is targeting those individuals. Quite \nfrankly, the most incredible provision in this amendment is to \neliminate any kind of enforcement.\n  The Senator might have difficulty in following all of the points I am \nraising\n\n[[Page S2121]]\n\non the amendment, but on page 14 of the Santorum amendment it sounds \nvery appealing. Small Business Paperwork Reduction; skip over to page \n16 and we find out on the bottom of that, line 22, what it is about.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision, no State may impose a \n     civil penalty on a small business concern.\n\n  And it applies that to every kind of unsafe work conditions, \nincluding air pollution, toxic substances, unsafe food. What in the \nworld are we thinking of? Why would we include those? What is the \nreason we are doing that?\n  I don't understand it. I can understand the Senator from Pennsylvania \nsaying he wants a lower increase in the minimum wage, but then to have \nprovisions in his amendment which are so punitive to millions of \nworkers--not just on the overtime but in terms of protecting those \nworkers that get the tip credit of $2.12 and then depend on tips for \nthe rest of it, and to say, no, we are not going to enforce the $2.12.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Briefly.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I point out to the Senator page 20 of my \namendment discusses the tip credit. It specifically refers to only \nStates that are covered by this provision as States that do not have a \ntip credit. I believe it is seven States that are the only States \ncovered by this provision.\n  So I don't know where you get ``millions'' of workers.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If you read from page 21, the top line from 2 down to \nline 16, it effectively states: ``may not establish or enforce any laws \nthat require employers to tip credit employee.''\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I refer the Senator to line 20 through line 25. If the \nSenator would read that, he will find that any State which prohibits \nany portion of employee tips from being considered as wages, so that is \nthe operative language that limits this provision--just in the States \nthat do not allow a tip credit.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator understands that every State has to have the \ntip credit at the present time. They have to have the $2.12.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. My understanding is that is not the case and there are \nseven States that do not.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Under Federal law at the present time, every State has \nto have a minimum of $2.13 and then the States can add on top of that. \nMany of the States do. The State of Pennsylvania has added, I believe, \n60 or 70 cents on top of that.\n  So when you talk about not permitting any States to enforce the tip \ncredit, you are talking all the States. That is the way we read it.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I say to the Senator from Massachusetts--\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator can clarify that language, we would be \nglad to work with him.\n  I see my friend and colleague. We have pointed out the fact that we \nhave not increased the minimum wage now in 8 years. It is at the second \nlowest purchasing level in nearly 60 years. A third of all those that \ngo into bankruptcy are those below the poverty line. This has a direct \nrelevancy to the underlying bill because we are trying to raise up \npeople with the minimum wage. We are not going to get them up to the \npoverty line, but we will probably raise up some people as a result of \nthe increase.\n  Therefore, it is appropriate to this legislation. It is long, long \noverdue. It seems to me at a time we are doing so much for the credit \ncard industries, companies that have billions of dollars in profits, \nthat we ought to be willing to make work pay.\n  I know that bothers some Senators. It bothers the Senator from New \nHampshire who criticized this and said, Well, we do not want to be like \nthe Soviet Union and like communist countries.\n  It is interesting that Great Britain just went up to more than $9 for \nthe minimum wage last week. They have the most successful economy in \nEurope at the present time. They have taken 1.2 million children out of \npoverty. They have the lowest home mortgages in 50 years. They brought \nunemployment down. And they are trying to do better for the children \nthat are living in poverty. They have just raised their minimum wage in \nGreat Britain.\n  I will include the other countries that are not, allegedly, \nCommunist. That includes a good many of the European countries: \nBelgium, Ireland, U.K., Portugal, France, Spain, and Greece.\n  I don't think the argument was serious.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Did I hear the Senator correctly that someone was \nsuggesting the minimum wage is communistic?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I think the argument made by my friend--and I want to be \ncareful about how I explain it. He took issue when I said in the Senate \nChamber what I believed, that this is a value issue. We hear a great \ndeal about the importance of values, having work pay, respecting that \nwork is a value issue. It is a family issue that affects children. \nHowever, it is a value issue. It indicates that we believe work should \npay.\n  My good friend, and he is my friend from New Hampshire, said that \nsounded an awful like a government establishing pay like Communist \neconomies did. I don't want to go into it a great deal more.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator would yield, it seems we have settled that \nissue in this country. Going back how many years now have we had a \nminimum wage?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. More than 60 years.\n  Mr. HARKIN. More than 60 years we have had a minimum wage in this \ncountry.\n  I don't have the data with me right now, but I have seen the data \nthat indicates when the minimum wage was higher relative to, say, \ncorporate salaries and what CEOs were making, that, in fact, our \ncountry enjoyed a higher standard of living. Is it not true that if \npeople are making a more decent minimum wage, it lifts them out of \npoverty; they are better able to provide food and clothing and shelter \nfor their kids and their family, better able to pay tuition to go to \ncollege.\n  It seems to this Senator, and I ask my friend from Massachusetts, \nunder the underlying bill, the bankruptcy bill, we are providing all \nkinds of support, immunities, coverage, for creditors and especially \ncredit card companies; we are providing them all protection, but now \nwhen it comes to providing minimum protection for the lowest income \npeople in this country, we cannot seem to do it.\n  It seems incongruous that we would protect the biggest, but for the \nsmallest we cannot seem to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is absolutely right.\n  I want to catch my friend from Pennsylvania before he walks out. The \nSenator is quite correct. In a more basic way, this has been something \nRepublicans and Democrats have worked on together. President \nEisenhower, the first President Bush, President Ford--all supported an \nincrease. Since the time I have been here we have had bipartisan \ncoalitions. But as the Senator remembers, under the Republican \nleadership they have refused to do so.\n  I mention one thing to my friend from Pennsylvania. I have a letter, \nwhich I will include in an appropriate place, from Ohio State \nUniversity, from a professor of law who said the proposed Santorum \nlegislation would also reduce existing protections provided to tip \nemployees by prohibiting State and local governments from enforcing any \nState or local law that fails to grant a 100 percent tip credit. That \nis, employers would be allowed under State and local law to pay nothing \nto tip employees as long as their tips from customers add up to the \nminimum wage. This provision would even override the laws of States \nthat have eliminated the tip credit entirely or that require tip \nemployees to be paid minimum wage by their employers.\n  That is the reason I mentioned this earlier. If that was not the \nintention of the Senator, hopefully we can correct that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I will be brief. I know the Senator from \nIowa is here. I do not want to stop him from making his remarks. I just \nwant to respond to several of the things the Senator from Massachusetts \nsaid.\n  First, I would be happy to look at the letter from the Ohio State \nprofessor and see how he, in my opinion, misread the provision we had. \nI think I am very\n\n[[Page S2122]]\n\nclear on the intent. If there is some language clarification, I would \nbe happy to sit down and work on that. I know Senator Enzi, of course, \nfrom the HELP Committee worked on this language and would be willing to \ndo so also.\n  A couple of comments. The Senator from Massachusetts talked at length \nabout economists and others who are suggesting that we need--I think I \nam using the Senator's words--a modest increase in the minimum wage. I \ndid not see any of the charts that he brought out that supported his \nparticular minimum wage increase. And he used the term ``modest'' \nrepeatedly. I am not sure there would be too many economists in the \neconomy of today who would say a 40-percent increase in the minimum \nwage would be modest. I think a 40-percent increase, by definition, \nprobably is outside the bounds of what most people would consider \nmodest.\n  I would make the argument that a 20-percent increase--this is what we \nare suggesting--a 21-percent increase would probably be extending the \nbounds of modesty, but it would certainly be much more within what most \npeople consider to be the traditional definition.\n  I would just like to thank the Senator from Massachusetts for \nbringing up support for my amendment because I think, in comparing the \ntwo, the increase we are putting forth of $1.10 comports very well with \nwhat the economists are saying would not be damaging to the economy and \nfit in very well with what would not be damaging to employees and \nemployers. So the $1.10, fits the modest framework.\n  Secondly, the issue of flextime. Again, I would just point the \nSenator to the actual language in the amendment. On page 3 of the \namendment, it says:\n\n       Except as provided in paragraph (2), no employee may be \n     required to participate in a program described in this \n     section.\n\n  So it is purely voluntary. It says employers may do this. Employees \nmay participate. It provides for a written agreement arrived at with \ncollective bargaining. Obviously, the collective bargaining unit, the \nlabor union, would be responsible for any kind of flextime, which is \nthe way it would be under the law.\n  Here, with respect to an employee who is not represented by a labor \norganization: No. 1, ``a written agreement arrived at between the \nemployer and employee before the performance of the work involved if \nthe agreement was entered into knowingly and voluntarily by such \nemployee and was not a condition of employment.''\n  Now, again, I would ask the Senator from Massachusetts, if there is \nstronger language he would like us to use to make sure this is a \nvoluntary agreement and that the employee and employer enter into it \nwillingly--there are quadruple damages if the employer violates this.\n  Also, the Senator from Massachusetts talks about how onerous this is \non employees. The Senator from Massachusetts voted for this with \nrespect to Federal employees. He voted for this provision, as we see \nhere, flextime, for Federal employees on more than one occasion. As you \nknow, we now have this provision, this ``onerous'' provision, which, I \ncan tell you, my employees do not see as onerous. They see it as \nsomething that is of a great benefit to them and their families.\n  So again, if the Senator from Massachusetts has some tougher language \nhe would like--but I think the language I have read from my amendment--\nand I am not reading the summary. This is my amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 128\n\n  (Purpose: To promote job creation, family time, and small business \n      preservation in the adjustment of the Federal minimum wage)\n\n  In fact, Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk and ask for \nits consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Santorum] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 128.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. SANTORUM. So I am reading from the text of the amendment. And \nagain, the Senator from Massachusetts may quibble, and certainly has, \nwith the voluntariness of this program. I think the language certainly \nexpresses my intent and the intent of all those who are supporting this \namendment, that it is a voluntary program and an employee goes into it \nknowingly and voluntarily with a written agreement. If there is other \nlanguage that the Senator from Massachusetts would like, obviously we \nare not going to do that today, but I would be happy to sit down and \nsee if there is a word that is more voluntary than ``voluntary.''\n\n  I think usually when you use the word ``voluntary'' that sums up \nvoluntary very well. But if there is a better word for voluntary than \nthe word ``voluntary,'' then I am pretty happy to do so. If there is a \nbetter word--whether it is ``discretionary''--than the word ``may,'' I \nam happy to look at a better word than ``may.'' ``May'' is usually a \npretty good word when it describes ``you do not have to.'' ``May,'' \nthat is what we usually use. But if ``voluntary'' and ``may'' are not \nstrong enough words, I will be happy enough to sit down with the \nSenator from Massachusetts and come up with a better one.\n  I repeat, the Senator from Massachusetts has voted for this for \nFederal employees, and there are quadruple damages--quadruple damages--\nfor employers who violate this provision and impose this on their \nworkers unknowingly and involuntarily or as a condition of employment. \nSo I would just suggest there are pretty high and threatening damages \nto employers who abuse this provision.\n  One final point I want to make. The Senator talks about its \nimportance, that this is the only way we are going to help people out \nof poverty. I would suggest that is simply not the case. There are lots \nof ways, in fact, I would say very much more complicated ways that \npeople get out of poverty than just by the blunt instrument of the \nGovernment setting minimum wages.\n  In fact, looking at this chart, the welfare reform bill we passed in \n1996 shows just how effective other ways are. Requiring work is the \nbest way. The Senator put up poverty statistics. What he did not tell \nyou is what those numbers looked like before 1996 and the welfare \nreform law, which I stood on the floor and argued passionately for. And \nI was called a whole number of things as to what I was going to do to \nall these poor children.\n  What happened as a result of the welfare reform bill was that poverty \namong African-American children, the thing Senator Kennedy referred to, \nwas at its lowest rate ever by the year 2000. It has crept up slightly \nduring the economic decline of the early part of this decade, but it is \ngoing back down.\n  So the idea that the minimum wage solves these problems is just a \nfallacy. There are lots of things that work. One of them is work. \nAnother is marriage. We are going to have an opportunity on the floor \nof the Senate, when the welfare bill comes up, to talk about how we \nshift Government policy away from, at best--I think it is ``at best''--\nneutrality toward marriage, how we shift Government policy when it \ncomes to interacting with families and being neutral with respect to \nmarriage. See what the huge impact is on the poor, the huge impact on \npoor communities and poor children, when moms and dads are helped to \nstay together in marriage and, more importantly, when they are \nintroduced to the concept because many women and, unfortunately, men \nchoose not to marry when children are born out of wedlock.\n  So there will be plenty of time for debate on this issue of other \nthings we can do. But I can tell you, if you look at all these other \nthings we are studying, the thing that is most powerful is, No. 1, \njobs. The concern many have--and there are studies we can put into the \nRecord about what the impact of a dramatic increase--not a small \nincrease, as we are proposing, but a dramatic increase--in the minimum \nwage would have to the employment picture of these very people who came \noff welfare and their ability to find work and get out of poverty. It \nwill have a dramatically negative impact on them, a 40-percent increase \nin the minimum wage.\n  But again, there are positive things we can do as we look to the \nfuture.\n\n[[Page S2123]]\n\nThis bill, in my opinion, belongs on welfare legislation, requiring \nwork, more work, which is what is going to be required in this bill, as \nwell as some things to bring fathers back into the home with the Father \nInitiative that Senator Bayh and Senator Domenici and I have been \npushing for several years, as well as the marriage initiative that the \nPresident has talked about.\n  This is a complex picture and blunt instruments like minimum wages \nare not the answer. Yes, I am proposing an increase. I am doing one \nthat I think comports with balancing the interest of low-income workers \nhaving a better wage with making sure they have a job in the first \nplace because that is the most important thing. I think we have done so \nwith this $1.10 increase and the provisions I have.\n  Yes, it is a long amendment. But there are a lot of things in here \nthat I think will add to the quality of life of many workers and \ncertainly help small businesses absorb some of the costs of the \nincrease in the minimum wage.\n  So with that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Parliamentary inquiry: Who controls the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senators from Pennsylvania and \nMassachusetts control the time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time is left on either side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 32\\1/2\\ \nminutes and the Senator from Pennsylvania has 48 minutes 17 seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will take 12 minutes. Will the Chair please remind the \nSenator when 10 minutes is used up?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will so notify the Senator.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. President, with the increase in the unemployment rate that we \nlearned of last Friday, it is clear we are in the midst of a two-tiered \neconomic recovery. We have one recovery for high-income Americans, for \npeople on Wall Street, and we have a very different recovery for people \nworking on Main Street.\n  The Neiman Marcus crowd is popping champagne corks, but it is a very \ndifferent story for Wal-Mart and K-mart shoppers and for the Americans \nwho work at Wal-Mart and K-mart and in other jobs paying low wages. The \nnumber of Americans in poverty has increased by more than 4 million \nsince President Bush took office. Nearly 36 million people live in \npoverty, 13 million children. Among full-time year-round workers, \npoverty has doubled since the late 1970s, from about 1.3 million then \nto 2.6 million now. Every day that the minimum wage is not increased, \nit continues to lose value and workers fall further and further behind.\n  Unfortunately, the Bush administration's priority is not lifting \nworking Americans out of poverty; its priority is keeping labor costs \nlow for corporate America. But this is not surprising. The President \nhas been quite frank and open about taking care of what he calls his \n``base.''\n  I strongly support Senator Kennedy's amendment to raise the minimum \nwage to $7.25 in three steps. It is long overdue. It has been 5 years \nsince we last had a vote on the minimum wage, and it has been 8 years \nsince we last voted to raise the minimum wage. To have the same \npurchasing power it had in 1968, the minimum wage would have to be \nnearly $8.50 today, not $5.15. Since the last increase in 1997, the \nvalue has eroded by more than 15 percent.\n  I noticed that the Senator from Pennsylvania was saying that this \nwould increase the minimum wage by 40 percent. Actually, it is 37 \npercent that Senator Kennedy's amendment would raise the minimum wage. \nIn three stages, it would increase it by 37 percent. The Senator from \nPennsylvania said this was unprecedented. Under Franklin Roosevelt, it \nwent up 53 percent; under Truman, 47 percent. Under Eisenhower, it went \nup 33 percent. Under the first President Bush, it went up 25 percent. \nThe point is that since 1997, the last time we raised it, the value has \neroded by 15 percent. So if we are going to boost it up over the next 3 \nyears and it increases by 37 percent, you are really only going up by \n22 percent more than what it was in 1997. I don't think that is an \nundue burden on business in America.\n  Since 1997, the last time we raised the minimum wage, Members of \nCongress have raised their own pay seven times in the last 8 years by \n$28,500. Think about that. We vote to raise our pay seven times in 8 \nyears by $28,500, but for minimum wage workers earning $10,700 a year, \nwe can't vote to raise their minimum wage--shame on the Senate.\n  We have heard in the past that it is mostly teenagers and part-time \nworkers who are working for the minimum wage. That is not the case. The \nfacts are, 35 percent of those earning the minimum wage are the \nfamily's sole breadwinners, 61 percent are women, and almost a third of \nthose women are raising children.\n  The Senate Finance Committee may soon be marking up a welfare \nreauthorization bill. As the Senate contemplates welfare \nreauthorization, as we address the goal of moving people from welfare \nto work, it is especially important we act to raise the minimum wage. \nSince 1996, we reduced the number of welfare cases by half.\n  I was intrigued by the chart the Senator from Pennsylvania put up \nbecause many of the people who moved off of welfare did not move out of \npoverty. Why? Because the minimum wage is not a living wage; it is a \npoverty wage. But an increase to $7.25, such as Senator Kennedy wants \nto do, would make a dramatic difference. For a full-time year-round \nworker, that would add $4,370 in income. That could be a real value to \na family living in poverty. For a low-income family of three, let's say \none wage earner, single mother, two children, that would be enough \nmoney to pay for a year and a half of heat and electricity or a full \ntuition for a family member pursuing a community college degree.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania said what really lifts people out of \npoverty is more work, not raising the minimum wage. I ask: How can a \nsingle mother of two working a minimum wage job work more? What is she \nsupposed to do--work 16 hours a day at the minimum wage? How much more \ncan people be expected to work?\n  The amendment of the Senator from Pennsylvania changes the 40-hour \nworkweek to an 80-hour work period over 2 weeks, with the maximum that \nanyone can work in 1 week of 50 hours. Add it up. It doesn't take a \nmathematician. Eighty hours for 2 weeks; you can work up to 50 hours in \n1 week. So you work 50 hours 1 week, 30 hours the next week. Guess \nwhat. You just got cheated out of 10 hours of overtime. Before, you \nwould work 40 hours. If you worked 50, you would get 10 hours of \novertime. Now you don't get any overtime. That is what is happening to \nlow-income workers in America today.\n  First of all, we have a bankruptcy bill that slaps them in the face. \nIt makes them pay through the nose. I don't know if anyone read the \narticle in the Washington Post yesterday. I will ask consent to print \nthis article at the conclusion of my remarks. They mention a Ruth Owens \nin Cleveland who tried for 6 years to pay off a $1,900 balance on her \nDiscover card, sending the credit company a total of $3,492 in monthly \npayments from 1997 to 2003. Yet her balance grew to $5,564.28 even \nthough she never used the card to buy anything more. So she paid $3,492 \non a $1,900 balance, and she still has yet to pay off her balance.\n  They mention another person, a special education teacher, Fatemeh \nHosseini, who worked a second job to keep up with the monthly payment \nshe collectively sent to five banks to try to pay $25,000 in credit \ncard debt. Even though she had not used the cards to buy anything more, \nher debt nearly doubled to $40,574 by the time she filed for bankruptcy \nlast June.\n  That is what is happening to poor people. The credit card companies \nsuck them in with a credit card, go out and charge it up, nice and \neasy. They find they have a $1,900 bill to pay. They start paying a \nlittle bit here and there. They miss a couple of payments. All of a \nsudden they have $5,564 to pay.\n  Nearly 7.5 million workers would directly benefit from the Kennedy \namendment. In Iowa, 87,400 workers would benefit from the increase. \nThat is over 6 percent of Iowa's workforce. The minimum wage needs to \nbe raised to a level that is not a subsistence wage. The way to do that \nis to raise the\n\n[[Page S2124]]\n\nminimum wage to a level that respects work, honors it, and rewards work \nat a reasonable level.\n  Just last week our friends on the other side of the aisle were \ntouting what they called their ``Republican poverty alleviation \nagenda.'' I say watch what they do, not what they say. The President \nsent up a budget request replete with cut after cut to antipoverty \nprograms. Now the Senator from Pennsylvania has launched a new attack \non the minimum wage and the 40-hour workweek. Now the Senator from \nPennsylvania says he wants to increase the minimum wage, albeit only \n$1.10 an hour over the next 2 years, about half of the Kennedy \namendment. But again, he guts it by ending the 40-hour workweek and \ngoing to this 50-hour max, 80-hour work period over 2 weeks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes to this point.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Last year, the Bush administration's new rule effectively eliminated \novertime pay protection for some 6 million American workers. The \nSenator from Pennsylvania is opening a second front in the war on the \nminimum wage and the 40-hour workweek. While 1.2 million workers would \nqualify for the minimum wage increase under the Santorum amendment, \nanother 6.8 million workers would lose their current minimum wage \nprotection.\n  As I said, then we get the 80-hour work period for a 40-hour \nworkweek. This has only one purpose: to allow more employers to avoid \npaying overtime compensation. In my 30 years in Congress, I don't \nrecall such a bold, brazen assault on the compensation of American \nworkers than what we see in the Santorum amendment. It ought to be \ncalled the shock-and-awe amendment. Workers get the shock, and \ncorporate America sits back in awe at the latest gift from the party it \nfinanced in the last election.\n  I am proud to stand with Senator Kennedy to raise the minimum wage to \n$7.25. The present one, at $5.15, is a poverty wage. It doesn't respect \nthe dignity of their work, including the most humble. As Senator \nKennedy said, of all the issues we are debating, this is a values \nissue. Think about this compared to all the things we are doing to help \nthe credit card companies with the bankruptcy bill. Think about that. \nWe are going to stick it to low-income people, hard-working Americans \nlike Ruth Owens and Fatemeh Hosseini, and then we are going to stick it \nto them again by not allowing them to even have an increase in the \nminimum wage.\n  I would have hoped that the President would have come and asked for \nan increase in the minimum wage and got his party in the Congress to \nwork with us to increase it. We have done it under Republican \nPresidents in the past and Democratic Presidents. I don't know why we \ncannot do it again.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Washington Post \narticle entitled ``Credit Card Penalties, Fees Bury Debtors'' by \nKathleen Day and Caroline E. Mayer, which appeared yesterday, be \nprinted at this point in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Mar. 6, 2005]\n\n                Credit Card Penalties, Fees Bury Debtors\n\n                (By Kathleen Day and Caroline E. Mayer)\n\n       For more than two years, special-education teacher Fatemeh \n     Hosseini worked a second job to keep up with the $2,000 in \n     monthly payments she collectively sent to five banks to try \n     to pay $25,000 in credit card debt.\n       Even though she had not used the cards to buy anything \n     more, her debt had nearly doubled to $49,574 by the time the \n     Sunnyvale, Calif., resident filed for bankruptcy last June. \n     That is because Hosseini's payments sometimes were tardy, \n     triggering late fees ranging from $25 to $50 and doubling \n     interest rates to nearly 30 percent. When the additional \n     costs pushed her balance over her credit limit, the credit \n     card companies added more penalties.\n       ``I was really trying hard to make minimum payments,'' said \n     Hosseini, whose financial problems began in the late 1990s \n     when her husband left her and their three children. ``All of \n     my salary was going to the credit card companies, but there \n     was no change in the balances because of that interest and \n     those penalties.''\n       Punitive charges--penalty fees and sharply higher interest \n     rates after a payment is late--compound the problems of many \n     financially strapped consumers, sometimes making it \n     impossible for them to dig their way out of debt and pushing \n     them into bankruptcy.\n       The Senate is to vote as soon as this week on a bill that \n     would make it harder for individuals to wipe out debt through \n     bankruptcy. The Senate last week voted down several \n     amendments intended to curb excessive fees and other \n     practices that critics of the industry say are abusive. House \n     leaders say they will act soon after that, and President Bush \n     has said he supports the bill.\n       Bankruptcy experts say that too often, by the time an \n     individual has filed for bankruptcy or is hauled into court \n     by creditors, he or she has repaid an amount equal to their \n     original credit card debt plus double-digit interest, but \n     still owes hundreds or thousands of dollars because of \n     penalties.\n       ``How is it that the person who wants to do right ends up \n     so worse off?'' Cleveland Municipal Judge Robert J. Triozzi \n     said last fall when he ruled against Discover in the \n     company's breach-of-contract suit against another struggling \n     credit cardholder, Ruth M. Owens.\n       Owens tried for six years to payoff a $1,900 balance on her \n     Discover card, sending the credit company a total of $3,492 \n     in monthly payments from 1997 to 2003. Yet her balance grew \n     to $5,564.28, even though, like Hosseini, she never used the \n     card to buy anything more. Of that total, over-limit penalty \n     fees alone were $1,158.\n       Triozzi denied Discover's claim, calling its attempt to \n     collect more money from Owens ``unconscionable.''\n       The bankruptcy measure now being debated in Congress has \n     been sought for nearly eight years by the credit card \n     industry. Twice in that time, versions of it have passed both \n     the House and Senate. Once, President Bill Clinton refused to \n     sign it, saying it was unfair, and once the House reversed \n     its vote after Democrats attached an amendment that would \n     prevent individuals such as anti-abortion protesters from \n     using bankruptcy as a shield against court-imposed fines.\n       Credit card companies and most congressional Republicans \n     say current law needs to be changed to prevent abuse and make \n     more people repay at least part of their debt. Consumer-\n     advocacy groups and many Democrats say people who seek \n     bankruptcy protection do so mostly because they have fallen \n     on hard times through illness, divorce or job loss. They also \n     argue that current law has strong provisions that judges can \n     use to weed out those who abuse the system.\n       Opponents also argue that the legislation is unfair because \n     it ignores loopholes that would allow rich debtors to shield \n     millions of dollars during bankruptcy through expensive homes \n     and complex trusts, while ignoring the need for more \n     disclosure to cardholders about rates and fees and curbs on \n     what they say is irresponsible behavior by the credit card \n     industry. The Republican majority, along with a few \n     Democrats, has voted down dozens of proposed amendments to \n     the bill, including one that would make it easier for the \n     elderly to protect their homes in bankruptcy and another that \n     would require credit card companies to tell customers how \n     much extra interest they would pay over time by making only \n     minimum payments.\n       No one knows how many consumers get caught in the spiral of \n     ``negative amortization,'' which is what regulators call it \n     when a consumer makes payments but balances continue to grow \n     because of penalty costs. The problem is widespread enough to \n     worry federal bank regulators, who say nearly all major \n     credit card issuers engage in the practice.\n       Two years ago regulators adopted a policy that will require \n     credit card companies to set monthly minimum payments high \n     enough to cover penalties and interest and lower some of the \n     customer's original debt, known as principal, so that if a \n     consumer makes no new charges and makes monthly minimum \n     payments, his or her balance will begin to decline.\n       Banks agreed to the new rules after, in the words of one \n     top federal regulator, ``some arm-twisting.'' But bank \n     executives persuaded regulators to allow the higher minimum \n     payments to be phased in over several years, through 2006, \n     arguing that many customers are so much in debt that even \n     slight increases too soon could push many into financial \n     disaster.\n       Credit card companies declined to comment on specific cases \n     or customers for this article, but banking industry \n     officials, speaking generally, said there is a good reason \n     for the fees they charge.\n       ``It's to encourage people to pay their bills the way they \n     said they would in their contract, to encourage good \n     financial management,'' said Nessa Feddis, senior federal \n     counsel for the American Bankers Association. ``There has to \n     be some onus on the cardholder, some responsibility to manage \n     their finances. ``\n       High fees ``may be extreme cases, but they are not the \n     trend, not the norm,'' Feddis said.\n       ``Banks are pretty flexible,'' she said. ``If you are a \n     good customer and have an occasional mishap, they'll waive \n     the fees, because there's so much competition and it's too \n     easy to go someplace else.'' Banks are also willing to \n     work out settlements with people in financial difficulty, \n     she said, because ``there are still a lot of options even \n     for people who've been in trouble.''\n       Many bankruptcy lawyers disagree. James S.K. ``Ike'' \n     Shulman, Hosseini's lawyer, said credit card companies \n     hounded her and did not live up to several promises to work \n     with her to cut mounting fees.\n\n[[Page S2125]]\n\n       Regulators say it is appropriate for lenders to charge \n     higher-risk debtors a higher interest rate, but that negative \n     amortization and other practices go too far, posing risks to \n     the banking system by threatening borrowers' ability to repay \n     their debts and by being unfair to individuals.\n       U.S. Bankruptcy Judge David H. Adams of Norfolk, who is \n     also the president of the National Conference of Bankruptcy \n     Judges, said many debtors who get in over their heads ``are \n     spending money, buying things they shouldn't be buying.'' \n     Even so, he said, ``once you add all these fees on, the \n     amount of principal being paid is negligible. The fees and \n     interest and other charges are so high, they may never be \n     able to pay it off.''\n       Judges say there is little they can do by the time cases \n     get to bankruptcy court. Under the law, ``the credit card \n     company is legally entitled to collect every dollar without a \n     distinction'' whether the balance is from fees, interest or \n     principal, said retired U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Ronald \n     Barliant, who presided in Chicago. The only question for the \n     courts is whether the debt is accurate, judges and lawyers \n     say.\n       John Rao, staff attorney of the National Consumer Law \n     Center, one of many consumer groups fighting the bankruptcy \n     bill, says the plight consumers face was illustrated last \n     year in a bankruptcy case filed in Northern Virginia.\n       Manassas resident Josephine McCarthy's Providian Visa bill \n     increased to $5,357 from $4,888 in two years, even though \n     McCarthy has used the card for only $218.16 in purchases and \n     has made monthly payments totaling $3,058. Those payments, \n     noted U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stephen S. Mitchell in \n     Alexandria, all went to ``pay finance charges (at a whopping \n     29.99%), late charges, over-limit fees, bad check fees and \n     phone payment fees.'' Mitchell allowed the claim ``because \n     the debtor admitted owing it.'' McCarthy, through her lawyer, \n     declined to be interviewed.\n       Alan Elias, a Providian Financial Corp. spokesman, said: \n     ``When consumers sign up for a credit card, they should \n     understand that it's a loan, no different than their mortgage \n     payment or their car payment, and it needs to be repaid. And \n     just like a mortgage payment and a car payment, if you are \n     late you are assessed a fee.'' The 29.99 percent interest \n     rate, he said, is the default rate charged to consumers ``who \n     don't met their obligation to pay their bills on time'' and \n     is clearly disclosed on account applications.\n       Feddis, of the banker's association, said the nature of \n     debt means that interest will often end up being more than \n     the original principal. ``Anytime you have a loan that's \n     going to extend for any period of time, the interest is going \n     to accumulate. Look at a 30-year-mortgage. The interest is \n     much, much more than the principal.''\n       Samuel J. Gerdano, executive director of the American \n     Bankruptcy Institute, a nonpartisan research group, said that \n     focusing on late fees is ``refusing to look at the elephant \n     in the room, and that's the massive levels of consumer debt \n     which is not being paid. People are living right up to the \n     edge,'' failing to save so when they lose a second job or \n     overtime, face medical expense or their family breaks up, \n     they have no money to cope.\n       ``Late fees aren't the cause of debt,'' he said.\n       Credit card use continues to grow, with an average of 6.3 \n     bank credit cards and 6.3 store credit cards for every \n     household, according to Cardweb.com Inc., which monitors the \n     industry. Fifteen years ago, the averages were 3.4 bank \n     credit cards and 4.1 retail credit cards per household.\n       Despite, or perhaps because or, the large increase in \n     cards, there is a ``fee feeding frenzy,'' among credit card \n     issuers, said Robert McKinley, Cardweb's president and chief \n     executive. ``The whole mentality has really changed over the \n     last several years,'' with the industry imposing fees and \n     increasing interest rates if a single payment is late.\n       Penalty interest rates usually are about 30 percent, with \n     some as high as 40 percent, while late fees now often are $39 \n     a month, and over-limit fees, about $35, McKinley said. ``If \n     you drag that out for a year, it could be very damaging,'' he \n     said. ``Late and over-limit fees alone can easily rack up \n     $900 in fees, and a 30 percent interest rate on a $13,000 \n     balance can add another $1,000, so you could go from $2,000 \n     to $5,000 in just one year if you fail to make payments.''\n       According to R.K. Hammer Investment Bankers, a California \n     credit card consulting firm, banks collected $14.8 billion in \n     penalty fees last year, or 10.9 percent of revenue, up from \n     $10.7 billion, or 9 percent of revenue, in 2002, the first \n     year the firm began to track penalty fees.\n       The way the fees are now imposed, ``people would be better \n     off if they stopped paying'' once they get in over their \n     heads, said T. Bentley Leonard, a North Carolina bankruptcy \n     attorney. Once you stop paying, creditors write off the debt \n     and sell it to a debt collector. ``They may harass you, but \n     your balance doesn't keep rising. That's the irony.''\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Again, I urge my colleagues to disavow the Santorum \namendment and support the Kennedy amendment. It is the least we can do \nfor the least among us--to raise their minimum wage, give value to \ntheir work. This is a values issue. This is at the heart of it. It is \nan issue of what kind of country we want, what kind of Congress we are, \nand what kind of Senators we are.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak as in morning business for the purpose of introducing \nlegislation. My time would be charged against Senator Santorum's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Hagel pertaining to the introduction of S. 540 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask that the pending amendments be set aside so I can \noffer a germane filed amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 66\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 66.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for himself, Mr. \n     Rockefeller, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Dayton, and Mr. Kennedy, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 66.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To increase the accrual period for the employee wage \n                        priority in bankruptcy)\n\n       On page 498, strike lines 23 and 24, and insert the \n     following:\n       (1) in paragraph (4), by striking ``within 90 days'';\n  Mr. HARKIN. I offer this amendment on behalf of myself, Senators \nRockefeller, Leahy, and Dayton, and I ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Kennedy be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask that the amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 44\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, there is a point that I would hope our \ncolleagues would pay close attention to, and that is that the Santorum \namendment will eliminate the equal pay provision for women working for \ncompanies with sales of less than $1 million. This is enormously \nimportant.\n  The Republican amendment gives pennies to minimum wage workers with \none hand. With the other, it takes thousands of dollars away from \nminimum wage, middle-class, and women workers. As I mentioned earlier, \nit slowed it up with antiworker poison pills, and the pill that is the \nhardest to swallow of the Republican amendments effectively denies over \n10 million more workers minimum wage, overtime pay, and equal pay \nprotections by eliminating the Fair Labor Standards Act coverage \ncompletely.\n  Currently, all employees who work for employers that are engaged in \ninterstate commerce and have gross annual sales of at least $500,000 \nare guaranteed Fair Labor Standard protections. But even in businesses \nthat have less than $500,000 in annual sales, the employees still have \nindividual Fair Labor Standard coverage if they are engaged in \ninterstate commerce.\n  The Santorum amendment raises the $500,000 annual sales threshold to \n$1 million, as he mentioned, and virtually eliminates this individual \nFair Labor Standard coverage, even for workers who are engaged in \ninterstate commerce. It makes one exception for workers engaged in \nindustrial housework.\n  It allows businesses to pay their workers less than the Federal \nminimum wage, requires them to work longer hours without overtime pay, \nand to be able to pay men and women differently.\n  The gross annual sales threshold was created as a way to determine \nthe employers that are engaged in interstate\n\n[[Page S2126]]\n\ncommerce, not as a way to exempt the workers from the Fair Labor \nStandards Act.\n  For over 60 years, Congress has amended the Fair Labor Standards Act \nto provide even more workers with the minimum wage. Instead of trying \nto exclude over 10 million workers from the guaranteed minimum wage, we \nshould raise it.\n  I refer to the paragraph of the Fair Labor Standards Act, paragraph \n206, that says each employer shall pay to each of his employees whose \nwork is engaged in commerce, in the production of goods for commerce--\nthat is those who are being paid who are working for companies earning \nless than $500,000. In the same paragraph it says:\n\n       No employer having employees subject to any provisions of \n     this section shall discriminate.\n\n  Those are eliminated. So we don't have equal pay for equal work in \nthe United States. There are only a few areas where we do. It is in \nthis particular area that we do and the Santorum amendment eliminates \nit for those individuals. I say to our colleagues here in the Senate \nwho care about equal pay for equal work for women, this is a bad deal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I would say in response to the Senator from \nMassachusetts, my understanding of this legislation, the way it is \nwritten, there was an error made in the drafting of the statute such \nthat the threshold had been basically ignored because of the provision \nto which the Senator from Massachusetts refers. It was a difference \nbetween an ``and'' and an ``or'' as to how it was written. My \nunderstanding is that the intent of the Congress was to exempt small \nbusinesses as we do from a variety of different labor laws. I mentioned \nbefore the one I am most familiar with, the Family and Medical Leave \nAct, which has an employee threshold. There are others that have \nthresholds in the Federal law, where we chose not to include very small \nbusinesses in some of the mandates the Federal Government imposes, a \nvariety of different labor mandates. We do so because of the nature of \nthe small business. A lot of these are mom-and-pop businesses, a \ngarage, very small employers, where the burden of complying with a \nvariety of Federal statutes having to do with labor laws when it comes \nto a small operation can be an onerous one and costly one. It can be a \nbarrier to starting a business.\n  So many, including Senator Harkin and Senator Reid, your leader, have \nsupported this small business exemption as a clean exemption with no \n``or'' provision, ``as engaged in interstate commerce.''\n  Why? Because we understand that Federal law and these kinds of \nprovisions can be very costly to very small businesses and can be a \nbarrier of entry to businesses and can involve them in a cost which \nthey may not be willing to assume.\n  So there has always been, to my knowledge, in almost every, if not \nevery, Federal labor law a small business exemption, what the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts has said there should not be in this case. That is a \nvery legitimate position. I do not think the Members of this body would \nagree--on either side of the aisle, I might add--that there should be \nno exemption for any business from this provision of the Fair Labor \nStandards Act. That is what we attempt to correct, to make that comport \nwith what was broadly agreed was the intent. Unfortunately, it has \nnever been remedied.\n  If the Senator from Massachusetts wants to make the argument that \nthere should be no businesses exempt from the Federal Fair Labor \nStandards Act, fine. Make that argument and we will have that debate \nand we will find out how many votes we have, whether there should be a \nsmall business exemption or not. But don't suggest what I am doing here \nis some sort of subterfuge other than to clarify that there are \nexemptions for legitimate reasons for very small businesses. The \nthreshold was set at half a million dollars back in 1990. If you index \nthat to inflation, it would be $1.5 million today. We set it at a \nmillion, which is lower than the rate of inflation. That is hardly \noverreaching on the part of this amendment.\n  If the Senator wants to say there should be no exemption, that all \nbusinesses should be covered and there should be no small business \nexemption to any labor law, fine, if that is what the Senator from \nMassachusetts wants. Understand the consequences, that Democrats and \nRepublicans for years have understood here, which is these mandates on \nvery small startup businesses in particular, but any small business, \ncan be damaging to the economy in our poorest neighborhoods, in the \ncleaning services, in the landscape businesses, and a whole host of \nother small businesses where people are trying to make ends meet by \npursuing their entrepreneurial spirit. By putting these kinds of \nrequirements and labor laws and regulations on these small businesses, \nwe damage and destroy the very small businesses in this country.\n\n  I do not think that is where most on his side of the aisle are. That \nmay be where the Senator from Massachusetts is. If that is where he is, \nfine, but I would be very proud to defend that provision that says the \nsmallest businesses in America should not have these kinds of mandates \nimposed on them by Federal law.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am sorry that I just arrived. I am trying to catch up \nwith this debate. Would the amendment reduce the number of workers in \nAmerica eligible for overtime pay and reduce the number of businesses \nin America required to pay the minimum wage?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I think I was pretty clear about that. The answer is \nyes. Because we raise the threshold from a half million, small \nbusiness, to a million. As I said before, the half million threshold \nwas set in 1990. It has not been indexed. I hear a lot of comments \nabout why we should index things here. We should index the minimum \nwage, we should index a whole host of other things that have the \nbenefit of, in this case, increasing workers' pay. If that is the case, \nif we thought $500,000 was a legitimate threshold in 1990, I don't know \nwhy it should not be indexed to include in real terms that same class \nof small businesses at this time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a further question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I am happy to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator is prepared to double the size of the \nbusiness from $500,000 to $1 million because it should keep up with \ninflation, would the Senator be prepared to double the minimum wage of \n1990 to what it should be today?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I say to the Senator from Illinois, we are increasing--\nin fact, my amendment does increase the minimum wage by 20 percent.\n  Mr. DURBIN. By 100 percent?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I don't recall exactly what the increase was. I will \ncheck and see what the wage was in 1990 as compared to what it is \ntoday. We are proposing a modest increase. If the Senator is suggesting \nit should be a smaller increase, I will be happy to negotiate a smaller \nincrease if it makes the Senator comfortable.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is not suggesting it should be a \nsmaller increase. He is suggesting there should be no exemption at all \nand that there was a provision--and that is what the debate is about--\nthat if they included anyone in interstate commerce, even one employee, \nthat they should be covered. In fact, that is my understanding of how \nthe Labor Department has interpreted this provision. In a sense, there \nhas not been any threshold.\n  Again, if the Senator from Illinois would like to have a threshold \nthat indexes with the minimum wage, I would be happy to accept that as \na reasonable index. But I think to suggest it should not change at all \nover a period of time does, of course, begin to gather and cover more \nand more businesses that are small by nature and then again it would be \na barrier to entry and a difficulty in sustaining those businesses over \ntime.\n  I am willing, if there is a legitimate concern about this as to how \nmuch we are raising the cap, again, we are willing to negotiate that. \nThat is not what the Senator from Massachusetts is saying. What the \nSenator from Massachusetts is saying is there should not be any \nthreshold at all; we should keep the zero threshold which exists today \nin law.\n\n[[Page S2127]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The history for interstate workers is that from 1938, \nwhen the minimum wage was first passed, the minimum wage has applied to \nthem. That is being changed by the Senator from Pennsylvania. We \nunderstand that. That is being changed. It is going to have a profound \neffect on millions of workers.\n  It is not only by the provisions, the coverage of the Fair Labor \nStandards Act, it is not only the payment, but it is also the equal \npayment.\n  Second, there have been different rules with regard to retail \nworkers. There was the overall figure of $1 million that was used on \nretail workers. That was reduced to $500,000 and even down to $250,000. \nSo we have been dealing with this for many times.\n  The point of the matter is, under the Santorum amendment, the way it \nis constructed, there will be millions and millions and millions who \nwill be outside the coverage of the Fair Labor Standards Act. That is \nplain and simple.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I only have a few minutes left now. The point I was \nmaking earlier, when I offered our amendment, it is 3 pages long, to \ndeal with the increases in the minimum wage for workers. The Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania has an 85-page law. He has opposed the minimum wage \n17 times in 10 years. Minimum wagers, beware.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, does the Senator from Massachusetts \nyield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I have to withhold my remaining time.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I would like to correct the record. I \nhave supported the minimum wage on more than one occasion during my \ntime in Congress. When I started in the House, the last minimum wage \nthat passed I supported. Under the Clinton administration, I voted for \nan increase. I have voted for an increase in the minimum wage in the \npast. I voted for a similar minimum wage increase in the last session \nof Congress, or the time before. I have not had any ideological \nproblems supporting minimum wage. I want to correct the record about \nwhat the Senator from Massachusetts said.\n  I would also say with respect to workers not being covered as a \nresult of this provision of raising the threshold, as you know and as \nthe Senator from Massachusetts knows, there are operative State laws \nwhich provide worker protections in addition to Federal law. In fact, \nfor the States that do not have operative State laws which provide \nthese worker protections, we leave the threshold at 500-fold. We don't \nchange the threshold for the States that do not have operative worker \nprotections for the things that the Fair Labor Standards Act applies \nto.\n  I want to make the record clear. No one is falling through the cracks \nhere. The States that only have Federal law covering this area do not \nchange. The ones that do have State laws change accordingly. Again, \nmany of those State laws will remain in place and cover workers who are \nnot covered under the Fair Labor Standards Act under their own State \nlabor protection laws.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 \nminutes, and I ask the Chair to notify me when I have used 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does this time come out of the time of the \nSenator from Massachusetts?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, Members of the Senate will have a choice \nin just a few minutes about the future of the minimum wage.\n  There was a time when we didn't even debate this. There was a time \nwhen Democrats and Republicans agreed that every once in a while you \nhave to raise the minimum wage. The cost of living goes up in America. \nRepublican and Democratic Presidents alike said: Can't we come together \nand reasonably increase the minimum wage so that the poorest among us \nhave a fighting chance for a decent life?\n  We used to do it that way. When we stopped doing it 8 years ago when \nRepublicans took control of Congress, they decided this was a partisan \nissue, that good Republicans didn't support an increase in the minimum \nwage; only Democrats supported it. Today, we have a choice. The choice \nis very stark.\n  Senator Santorum comes to the Senate floor and says let us raise the \nminimum wage for 1.8 million Americans. That is a pretty good thing. At \nleast they are going to get some help. But look at Senator Kennedy's \nalternative. In his alternative, 7.3 million Americans would have an \nincrease in the minimum wage.\n  The Santorum Republican approach helps 1 out of 4 of the workers who \nSenator Kennedy's approach helps. But it gets worse. In order for \nSenator Santorum to work up the political courage to bring this to the \nfloor, he said: I have to turn around and do something on the business \nside. So what I will do is to exempt 10 million workers in America from \ncoverage for overtime pay.\n  Think about that. You can work 50 hours a week at straight time. That \nis the deal we are going to offer you for a slight increase in the \nminimum wage. Does that make sense?\n  He goes further and says we are going to say that fewer businesses in \nAmerica are required to pay the minimum wage. What a deal. After \nwaiting 8 years, he helps 1 out of 4 of the workers who Senator Kennedy \nhelps, and for the 1.8 million he helps, he pushes 5 times as many \noverboard. He says: You are not going to get overtime. I will vote for \nan increase in minimum wage, but that is just part of the deal.\n  It is really appropriate that we have this debate on the bankruptcy \nbill, isn't it, when you think about it? We are going to force some of \nthe most marginal workers, so many of the hardest working people in \nAmerica, into a position where they can't pay their bills; then our \nbeautiful Bankruptcy Code reform pushed by the credit card industry \nwill make sure they are saddled with debt for a lifetime. That is what \nthis debate comes down to.\n  In order to bring up the courage on the Republican side to offer any \nminimum wage increase, they had to offer to the business community this \ndisqualification for overtime pay the incentive that many businesses \nwould not pay a minimum wage, not to mention adhere to the equal pay \nprovisions. Some of these minimum wage workers across America are \nyoung, single mothers struggling to raise kids. Sometimes they are \nworking one or two minimum wage jobs. They would like to be paid equal \npay in their workplace. Senator Santorum thinks that goes too far when \nit comes to small businesses. I think this is wrong.\n  We need to get back to the bipartisan consensus we had on minimum \nwage. If you stand for moral values--wasn't that the big issue in the \nlast campaign?--wouldn't one moral value be as follows: If you get up \nand go to work every day in America, if you follow the rules and show \nup for work, you shouldn't live in poverty in America. That is a fact. \nSome people working every single day at a minimum wage job are living \nbelow the poverty line.\n  Poverty has doubled since the late 1970s. The poverty rolls have \nincreased by 4 million people since President Bush has taken office. \nThe low minimum wage is a big part of that. Minimum wage employees who \nwork 40 hours a week earn $10,750 a year. Think about how you would get \nby on $10,700 a year. In fact, we say officially that this is $5,000 \nless than you need to raise a family of three. We acknowledge that. If \nyou go to work, work hard, and are paid the minimum wage, you are going \nto live in poverty.\n  We believe on the Democratic side of the aisle that America, if it is \na just nation, should move to the point where hard-working Americans \nget a decent paycheck.\n  That is what Senator Kennedy has been fighting for for 8 years. I \nwould be happy to be part of that fight.\n  I say in conclusion that we talk a lot in the Senate about what our \npriorities should be. The top priority of this Senate now is to make \nthe bankruptcy laws more difficult for those swamped by medical bills. \nWe have tried to offer amendments to stand up for the activated Guard \nand Reserve people who are forced into bankruptcy. The Republican side \nrejected every single amendment we offered. Now we come with a \nsensible, just amendment to, frankly, raise the minimum wage up to a \ndecent level in America, and what we are offered on the other side of \nthe aisle is an unacceptable alternative.\n\n[[Page S2128]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today the Senate will consider two minimum \nwage amendments to the bankruptcy reform bill, S. 256. Senator Ted \nKennedy's minimum wage amendment proposes to increase the minimum wage \nby $2.10 per hour in three steps over 26 months, and Senator Rick \nSantorum's amendment would raise the minimum wage by $1.10 an hour over \n18 months.\n  I have always believed that increasing the minimum wage is not an \neffective way to improve living standards for the Nation's working \npoor. Simply put, raising the minimum wage is a Federal government \nmandate which creates negative ripples throughout the national economy \nby making goods and services more expensive for families. Raising the \nminimum wage closes the doors of many small businesses, and forces \ncompanies to move jobs offshore to less costly countries. Such an \nincrease makes it more difficult for many lower skilled U.S. workers to \nget started in the job market.\n  Small businesses are the engine for economic growth in America and \nrepresent a powerful vehicle for opportunity. A minimum wage increase \nwould negatively affect small businesses across the nation and in my \nhome State of Utah.\n  For example, Wangsgard's grocery store of Ogden, UT, offers a full \nline of groceries, along with a meat shop, oven-fresh bakery, fresh \nproduce, a deli and snack bar, coffee counter, garden center and Ace \nHardware. Without a doubt, this store really is a one-stop solution.\n  Phillip Child, president and owner of Wangsgard's grocery store, \ninforms me that a minimum wage increase would force him to reduce jobs. \nIn fact, Mr. Child confirms that of his 93 employees, those who are \nearning minimum wage are either in high school or living at home with \ntheir parents. These employees are not supporting families. With the \ngoal to open a second Wangsgard's grocery store in the near future, Mr. \nChild is concerned that an increase in minimum wage would certainly cut \nthe number of new jobs available to the community.\n  I believe education and job-training programs are the key to raising \ntake-home pay. Of course, it's much easier to pose as the champion of \nthe poor and worry about the consequences later. Yet if Congress does \nmove to increase the minimum wage, it should adopt a small, more \ngradual increase, and offset the negative consequences of a wage hike \nwith measures to protect the small businesses that generate a majority \nof all new jobs and employ most Americans. That is why I support the \nSantorum amendment and oppose the Kennedy amendment.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of \nSenator Kennedy's amendment that would amend the Fair Labor Standards \nAct of 1938 to provide for gradual increases in the Federal minimum \nwage.\n  An increase in the Federal minimum wage is long overdue.\n  It has now been over 7 years since Congress last raised the minimum \nwage to its current level of $5.15 per hour. Since that last increase, \nCongress's failure to adjust the wage for inflation has reduced the \npurchasing power of the minimum wage to record low levels. In fact, \nafter accounting for the loss of real value due to inflation, the \npurchasing power of the minimum wage has not been this low since the \nwage increase of 1945.\n  When Congress last raised the minimum wage in 1996, the wage was \nraised from $4.75 to its current $5.15. At the time, this modest \nincrease had real results. The adjustment increased the take home pay \nof nearly 10 million hard working Americans. But with inflation, the \nreal dollar value of that increase is long gone.\n  So that we are clear, raising the minimum wage is a family issue. So \noften in this body we talk about family issues. This is our chance to \nact.\n  No family gets rich from earning the minimum wage. In fact, the \ncurrent minimum wage does not even lift a family out of poverty. A \nperson earning the current minimum wage, working 40 hours a week, 52 \nweeks a year, earns only $10,700--nearly $4,000 below the poverty line \nfor a family of three.\n  Seven out of every 10 minimum wage workers are adults, and 40 percent \nof minimum wage workers are the sole breadwinners of their families. \nMoreover, a disproportionate number of minimum wage workers are women. \nSixty percent of the 11 million minimum wage workers are women, and \nmany are single mothers who must put food on the table, make rent \npayments, and provide childcare. Increasing the minimum wage by a mere \n$1.50 per hour would mean an extra $3,000 a year for working families. \nThese additional dollars can provide tangible help to these families in \nthe form of groceries, rent, and the ability to pay one's utility \nbills.\n  The problems posed by our insufficient minimum wage are stark in my \nhome State of New Jersey.\n  According to New Jersey Department of Labor statistics, there are \njust over 181,000 people making minimum wage in the State. While some \nStates have set higher minimum wage levels, New Jersey is like most \nStates--its minimum wage mirrors the Federal minimum wage. But New \nJersey is also different because the cost of living in New Jersey far \nexceeds the national average and working families in the State are \nunable to make ends meet at the current minimum wage. As a result, \nminimum wage workers in New Jersey are worse off than minimum wage \nworkers living in other parts of the country.\n\n  Let me quantify the severity of this problem in a high-cost State \nsuch as New Jersey. Last year, Legal Services of New Jersey released a \nself-sufficiency study that found that--without private or public \nassistance--a New Jersey family of four needs a yearly salary of \nanywhere from $37,516 to $56,670 to make ends meet. Now remember, as I \nmentioned earlier, an individual earning the current minimum wage, \nworking 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, earns only $10,700. What that \nthen means is that in New Jersey, a family of four that has both \nparents working full-time for the minimum wage would still face an \nannual shortfall likely in excess of $20,000 in order to cover basic \nliving needs.\n  While the Kennedy amendment seeks to provide a real wage increase to \nworkers that will help them keep up with the rising cost of living in \nour Nation, the Santorum amendment offered by my Republican colleagues \nis a cruel hoax on hard-working Americans.\n  It is politics over policy, and it is just plain wrong.\n  The Santorum amendment only provides about half of the minimum wage \nincrease of the Kennedy amendment. It also denies minimum wage, \novertime and equal pay rights from over 10 million workers.\n  The Santorum amendment will increase the minimum wage by a mere $1.10 \nper hour. This amendment will benefit only 1.8 million workers--5.5 \nmillion fewer than the Kennedy amendment.\n  The difference between an increase to $7.25 and an increase to $6.25 \nfor a minimum wage worker has a real impact on people's lives, \nparticularly in a State such as New Jersey. It means on average 15 \nfewer months of child care; over a year less of tuition at a community \ncollege; 10 fewer months of heat and electricity; 6 fewer months of \ngroceries; and 5 fewer months of rent.\n  The Santorum amendment denies more than 10 million workers minimum \nwage, overtime pay and equal pay rights by ending individual Fair Labor \nStandards coverage and raising the enterprise coverage threshold to $1 \nmillion from $500,000.\n  The Santorum amendment would be the death of the 40-hour workweek and \nthe American weekend. After the Administration's denial last year of \novertime protections for 6 million workers, this proposal would further \nundermine overtime protections by allowing employers to refuse to pay \nworkers up to 10 hours of earned overtime pay every 2 weeks.\n  That means a pay cut of $3,000 a year for a median income earner--\n$43,000 per year--and an $800 pay cut for minimum wage workers. \nEmployers are already free to offer more flexible schedules under \ncurrent law--the only difference is that now they have to pay workers \novertime when they work more than 40 hours in a week.\n  Finally, the Santorum amendment prohibits states from providing \nstronger wage protections than the Federal standard for tipped \nemployees like waiters and waitresses.\n  There are some items in the Santorum amendment that can help our \nsmall businesses. But this amendment has been so bloated down with\n\n[[Page S2129]]\n\nprovisions that are harmful to American workers that as a whole it is \nnot just bad for workers, it is ultimately bad for business.\n  All of our hard working families nationwide need and deserve a \nminimum wage that reflects the increased cost of living in America. It \nis the least we can do for people who work hard and make a positive \ncontribution to our great Nation.\n  Let's not dishonor them or their efforts. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Kennedy amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the amendment \noffered by Senator Kennedy which would increase the minimum wage by an \nunprecedented 41 percent. Apart from its numerous other problems, this \nproposal is fundamentally flawed because it presumes that Congress, by \nsimply imposing an artificial wage increase, will meaningfully address \nthe real issues of the lowest paid workers. That is simply not the \ncase.\n  Regardless of the size of a wage increase Congress might impose, the \nreality is that yesterday's lowest paid worker, assuming he still has a \njob, will continue to be America's lowest paid worker tomorrow. \nAdvancement on the job and earned wage growth can simply not be \nlegislated. We do a disservice to all concerned--most especially the \nchronic low-wage worker--to suggest that a Federal wage mandate is the \nanswer. What we need to focus on is not an artificially imposed number \nbut on the acquisition and improvement of jobs and job-related skills. \nIn this context, we should recognize that only 68 percent of the \nstudents entering the ninth grade 4 years ago are expected to graduate \nthis year. For minority students, this number hovers around 50 percent. \nIn addition, we continue to experience a dropout rate of 11 percent per \nyear.\n  These noncompletions and dropout rates and the poor earnings capacity \nthat comes with them cannot be fixed by a Federal wage policy. We \nalways have to keep this in mind. The phrase ``minimum wage worker'' is \nan arbitrary designation. A more accurate description and one that \nshould always be at the center of this debate is that we are seeking to \naddress those workers who have few if any skills that they can use to \ncompete for better jobs and command higher wages. The effect may be low \nwages, but the cause is low skills. In short, the problem is not a \nminimum wage. The problem is minimum skills.\n  I had a Workforce Investment Act bill that the Senate 2 years ago \npassed unanimously. We cannot get a conference committee to do upgrades \nin skills for 900,000 people a year. That would have upped the minimum \nwage, and it would have upped it in a true way. If we are to approach \nthis debate in a constructive and candid way, we need to know certain \nbasic principles of economics. Wages do not cause sales. Sales are \nneeded to provide wages. Wages do not cause revenue. Revenue drives \nwages. Wages can cause productivity, but the productivity has to come \nfirst to be able to afford the wages.\n  Skills, however, operate differently than wages. Skills do create \nsales. Sales produce revenue. Skills do create productivity. Skills get \ncompensated with higher wages or else the employee simply goes \nelsewhere for true higher wages. Wage increases without increased sales \nor higher productivity have to be paid for by higher prices. Higher \nprices wipe out wage increases. Skills, not artificial wage increases, \nproduce the true net gains in income.\n  The minimum wage should be for all workers what it is for most: A \nstarting point; a starting point in an individual's lifelong working \ncareer. Viewed as a starting point, it becomes clear that the focus \nneeds to be less on where an individual begins his or her working \ncareer. Instead, more emphasis should be placed on how an individual \ncan best progress.\n  Real wage growth happens every day and it is not the function of a \nGovernment mandate. It is the direct result of an individual becoming \nmore skilled and therefore more valuable to his or her employer.\n  As a former small business owner, I know that these entry level jobs \nare a gateway into the workforce for people without skills or \nexperience. These minimum skills jobs can open the door to better jobs \nand better lives for low-skilled workers if we give them the tools they \nneed to succeed.\n  We have a great example in Cheyenne, WY, of minimum skilled workers \nwho were given the tools and the opportunity to reach the American \ndream. Mr. Jack Price, the owner of eight McDonald's restaurants in \nWyoming--everyone likes to use McDonald's for the example--had three \nemployees who started working for McDonald's at minimum wage. Now those \nthree employees, those minimum wage employees, own a total of 20 \nrestaurants. They got the skills.\n  This type of wage progression and success should be the norm for \nworkers across our country. However, there are some minimum skilled \nworkers for whom stagnation at the lower tier wage is a longer term \nproposition. The answer for these workers, however, is not simply to \nraise the lowest wage rung, which raises all the other rungs, which \ndrives up the price and takes away their advantage; rather, these \nindividuals must acquire the training and skills that result in \nmeaningful and lasting wage growth.\n  We must equip our workers with skills they need to compete in this \ntechnology-driven global economy. It is estimated that 60 percent of \ntomorrow's jobs will require skills that only 20 percent of today's \nworkers possess. It is also estimated that graduating students will \nlikely change careers some 14 times in their life, and 10 of those jobs \nhave not even been invented yet.\n  To support these needs, we need a system in place that can support a \nlifetime of education, training, and retraining for workers. The end \nresult would be the attainment of goals that provide meaningful wage \ngrowth. As legislators, our efforts should better focus on ensuring \nthat the tools and the opportunities for training and enhancing skills \nover a Worker's lifetime are available and are utilized.\n  We tried to do that through the Work First Investment Act that got \nblocked in the last Congress; 900,000 people trained to higher skilled \njobs each year. That would have been a lot of people getting higher \nwages each and every year.\n  Since 1998, the Democrats have been pushing a drastic increase in the \nFederal minimum wage except--listen to this--except when they were in \nthe majority, when they controlled this body. In the 18 months from \nmid-2001 through all of 2002, while the Democrats held the \nmajority they did not bring the minimum wage vote to the floor. The \nquestion must be asked, who would really be helped? Who would be hurt \nby this amendment we have today to raise the minimum wage by an \nunprecedented 41 percent, to $7.25 an hour.\n\n  First, we must realize that the large increase in minimum wage will \nhurt low-income, low-skilled individuals, the very workers proponents \nclaim they want to help. Let us be clear: Mandated hikes in the minimum \nwage do not cure poverty. They clearly do not create jobs.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has said most economists would agree \nthat an increase in the minimum wage rate would cause firms to employ \nfewer low-wage workers or employ them for fewer hours. That is the CBO \nestimate of October 18, 1999. In 1999, based on a dollar increase, CBO \nfound that a plausible range of estimates for the potential job losses \nholds that a 10-percent increase--not a 41-percent increase, a 10-\npercent increase--in the minimum wage would result in a half to 2 \npercent reduction in the employment level of teenagers and a smaller \npercentage reduction for young adults ages 20 to 24. These estimates \nimply employment losses for an increase in the minimum wage of the \namount provided in the 1999 proposal of roughly 100,000 to half a \nmillion jobs. Applying that same analysis today could actually double \nthis prediction. Upwards of one million low-wage workers, mostly \nteenagers and young adults, can expect to lose their jobs or lose \nopportunities due to the proposal before the Senate for the $2.10 an \nhour increase.\n  What every student who has ever taken an economics course knows, if \nyou increase the cost of something--in this case, the minimum wage--you \ndecrease the demand for those jobs. Misleading political rhetoric \ncannot change the basic principles of supply\n\n[[Page S2130]]\n\nand demand. The majority of economists continue to affirm the job-\nkilling nature of mandated wage increases.\n  A recent poll concluded that 77 percent--that is nearly 17,000 \neconomists--believe that a minimum wage hike causes job loss. The \nargument these economists understand is this: By requiring employers to \npay a higher wage for positions they consider entry level, the mandate \nforces employers to search for higher skilled employees. Moreover, \nmandated higher entry-level wages force employers to redefine the \nnature of the job and the expectations they have for their entry-level \nworkers. Unskilled and low-skilled workers without the new \nqualifications will, therefore, be the first to be displaced and the \nlast to be employed.\n  In short, Congress can mandate how much employers pay entry-level \nemployees, but they cannot mandate which workers employers pay.\n  Even Dr. Rebecca Blank, a former member of President Clinton's \nCouncil of Economic Advisers, has admitted that without the earned-\nincome credit there would be greater pressure to increase the minimum \nwage, which has growing disemployment effects as it rises, since it \ninduces employers to substitute away from less-skilled labor toward \nother technologies.\n  Let me repeat what President Clinton's Economic Adviser said, because \nthis is something proponents on the Senate floor are unwilling to meet. \nMinimum wage increases induce employers to substitute away the less-\nskilled labor toward other technologies. Low-skilled workers will be \ndisplaced and lose jobs or will not be hired in the first place.\n  This massive Federal wage proposal is based on a false assumption \nthat a business that employs 50 minimum wage workers before this wage \nincrease is enacted will still employ 50 minimum wage workers \nafterwards. Whether a business is in Washington or Wyoming, employers \ncannot absorb a 41 percent increase in their costs without a \ncorresponding decrease in the number of jobs or of benefits they can \nprovide workers.\n  So we know there are losers when we raise the minimum wage, but who \nare the individuals who benefit? While minimum wage supporters often \nclaim the wage floor must be raised in order to lift employees out of \npoverty, this is simply not the case. Again, the average family income \nof potential beneficiaries from a $7.25-an-hour minimum wage rate is \nover $41,000 a year. Clearly, the minimum wage is not a poverty level \nwage for most employees.\n  Minimum wage earners who support a family solely based on the wage \nare actually few and far between. Fully 85 percent--this is very \nimportant--of the minimum wage earners live with their parents, have a \nworking spouse, or are living alone without children. Forty percent \nlive with a parent or relative. Twenty-one percent live with another \nwage earner. Twenty-four percent are single or are the sole breadwinner \nin a household with no children. And they lack skills. They have \nminimum skills. They get paid for minimum skills.\n  Research shows that the poor targeting and other unintended \nconsequences of the minimum wage make it terribly ineffective at \nreducing poverty in America--the intended purpose of the policy. In \nfact, two Stanford University economists concluded that a minimum wage \nincrease is paid for by higher prices that hurt poor families the most.\n  A 2001 study conducted by Stanford University economists found that \nonly one in four of the poorest 20 percent of families would benefit \nfrom an increase in the minimum wage. Three in four of the poorest \nworkers would be hurt by a wage hike because they would shoulder the \ncosts of the resulting higher prices.\n  Artificial wage hikes drive prices up. They have to. You cannot pay \nthe wages without it. Everything but Government spending has to be paid \nfor. To pay a higher minimum wage and other wages that have to go up \nbecause of it means prices have to be raised. We should not trick \nworkers into thinking they are earning more when they still cannot pay \nthe bills at the end of the month.\n  As we discuss the Federal minimum wage, we must keep in mind the \ndangers, also, of a ``Washington knows best'' and a ``one size fits \nall'' mentality. An increase in the Federal minimum wage is a classic \nlesson that Washington does not know best and that one size does not \nfit all. A Federal wage mandate does not account for the cost of living \nthat varies across the country. It costs over twice as much to live in \nNew York City than it does in Cheyenne, WY. However, a Federal minimum \nwage hike that applies from coast to coast is like saying a bag of \ngroceries in New York City must cost the same as a bag of groceries in \nCheyenne. Local labor market conditions and the cost of living \ndetermine pay rates, not Federal minimum wage laws dictated from \nWashington.\n  Incidentally, that is why Maine has a higher wage rate than the \nFederal Government. That is why a lot of States have a higher rate. It \nfits their State. The States can do it without our help. Isn't that \namazing.\n  Now, proponents of a large, federally mandated increase in the \nminimum wage repeatedly state that the wage floor is too low and that \nminimum wage earners earn below the poverty line. This argument \nneglects to figure in the effects of the earned-income credit.\n  Proponents of large minimum wage increases argue that we should \nreturn the starting wage to its 1968 value, when the minimum wage was \nat its all-time high when adjusted for inflation. However, it is \nimportant to note, that the real value of the current minimum wage in \n2004 dollars plus the real value of the Earned income credit for a \nfull-time minimum wage employee with two children comes close to \nmatching the 1968 value Democrats claim they are targeting.\n  As my colleagues are no doubt aware, the earned income credit is a \nFederal income tax credit for low-income workers that reduces the \namount of tax an individual owes, and is frequently returned in the \nform of a refund. This can supplement incomes by as much as $4,290, for \na single adult with two dependents which works out to a cash credit \nequal to more than $2 per hour paid directly to the worker.\n  For every dollar in wages earned by a low-income family with two \nchildren, the Federal Government provides a tax credit of 40 percent.\n  Workers with one child have an effective minimum wage rate of $6.90 \nper hour, $5.15 per hour, plus a 34-percent credit of $1.75 per hour.\n  Workers with two or more children have an effective minimum wage rate \nof $7.22 per hour, $5.15 plus a 40-percent credit of $2.07 per hour.\n  As a household's income rises above around $15,000 per year, the \nearned income credit begins to be phased out.\n  It would take a minimum wage increase of around a dollar per hour to \nreach the ``appropriate'' 1968 rate, when the earned income credit is \napplied.\n  The earned income credit has retained the value of the minimum wage \nfor employed workers with families by supplementing their income while \navoiding the adverse effects of minimum wage hikes. In fact, using the \nearned income credit allows us to more effectively target assistance to \nthose workers raising families on low incomes.\n  Contrast this targeted policy with massive increases in the minimum \nwage that inefficiently distribute ``assistance'' to individuals \nwithout children--mostly teenagers from wealthy families. In summary, \nthe earned income credit is ignored by wage-hike proponents because it \nproves the flaws in their arguments. Regardless of whether their \narguments made sense in 1938, or even in 1968, their rhetoric has been \noverridden by newer policies such as the earned income credit. I prefer \nto promote modern policies that help the poor, and not to dwell on \nstale arguments that no longer ring true.\n\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle suggest that the only \ntime low-income workers receive wage increases is when Congress \nmandates an increase in the minimum wage. It is preposterous and \ndemeaning to argue that only Congress can give low-wage workers a pay \nraise. More often than not, it is the workers' own dedication, hard \nwork, and willingness to learn that results in their earning higher \nwages. Workers who were making the minimum wage when it was last hiked \nin 1997 have learned job skills, received valuable experience, and, as \na result, have earned raises above the minimum wage.\n\n[[Page S2131]]\n\n  Whenever they seek to increase the minimum wage, the Democrats \nannounce the number of workers who will ``benefit'' from the mandate. \nInterestingly, however, that number has shrunk dramatically over the \npast 6 years.\n  On September 3, 1998, Senator Kennedy issued a press release counting \nthe number of minimum-wage-increase beneficiaries at 12 million. That \nwas when his wage hike went up to $6.65 per hour instead of today's \n$7.25 per hour increase. Today, however, he puts the number at only 7.5 \nmillion. That is 4.5 million fewer workers affected by a minimum wage \nincrease. Where did they go?\n  Where did the other 4.5 million individuals go? They earned raises, \non their own, without Congress imposing a Federal wage hike. In fact, \nstatistics show that most minimum-wage workers will earn raises in \ntheir first year on the job. These minimum-skilled workers will earn \nraises as their skills and experience increase.\n  I share the same goal as Senator Kennedy--to help American workers \nfind and keep well-paying jobs. Minimum skills--not minimum wages--are \nthe problem. Education and training will solve that problem and lead to \nthe kind of increased wages and better jobs we all want to create for \nour Nation's workers. Lets get the Workforce Investment Act passed and \nconferenced so the President can sign it and get higher skills training \naccelerated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, it is a false economy, and if we really \nwanted to raise it, we would have done something with the Workforce \nInvestment Act, the job training. We would have raised skills, and then \nemployees would have been compensated well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will use leader time for this \npresentation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have not been on the floor all day to \nlisten to the debate, but I have listened to part of it. I am stunned \nby some of the remarks by those opposed to raising the minimum wage. To \nindicate that people who are drawing minimum wage live with their \nparents or others--they do because they make so little money. And all \nthe denigration of these entry-level jobs--these are jobs that people \nhave to have filled. They may be low, entry-level jobs, but they are \njobs people need. People are not hiring these people out of the \ngoodness of their heart, to say: Well, here is somebody. We'll hire a \nfew minimum wage employees.\n  There are a few people like that, but the reason you have these \nminimum wage jobs is because people need results. The employer needs \nthe work done. The employee needs the job.\n  I have heard on this floor a number of times today people saying: It \nis pushing a drastic increase in the minimum wage. The minimum wage was \nvalid when it was initiated many years ago. It is valid today. We \nshould at least keep up with the cost of living. Using the logic of \nthose who oppose the increase in the minimum wage with these \n``drastic,'' as they say, minimum wage increases, the longer you wait, \nthe less chance there would be to raise it because it would become more \n``drastic,'' in their words, all the time. All we are trying to do, all \nSenator Kennedy is trying to do, is keep up with the cost of living.\n  My friend, the distinguished Senator from Wyoming, indicated that \nduring the short time we were in control--of course, a lot of the time \nwe were in charge there was no legislative business going on, but keep \nin mind that every time we have attempted, no matter who is in the \nmajority in the last 8 years, the Republicans have stopped it, either \nthrough an actual filibuster or through some parliamentary maneuver. \nThey have opposed raising the minimum wage.\n  I think the logic of so doing, that it is a ``drastic'' increase--I \nrepeat--means that the longer you wait until you attempt to raise the \nminimum wage, the less chance it would have to pass because it would \nbecome, in their minds, more drastic. Think of the poor people who are \ntrying to earn a living with this minimum wage. It becomes very drastic \nfor them.\n  I was heartened last week to see my Republican colleagues express \ntheir commitment to addressing the issue of poverty. Press conferences \nwere held. But I believe the time has come for them to back up their \nwords with action and vote to increase the minimum wage to $7.25 an \nhour. It is not going to happen. We understand that the marching orders \nhave been given, and they will all walk up here and vote against \nincreasing the minimum wage.\n  In a country that values work and the opportunity to get ahead, a \nhard day's work should bring a decent day's pay, whether it is an \nentry-level job or a job that is a more skilled job. In America, this \nis not the case as it relates to entry-level work. We have mothers and \nfathers working full time in minimum wage jobs but still living in \npoverty, still struggling to get ahead.\n  I met with some of these workers in Nevada last month. When you talk \nwith them, you begin to understand that increasing the minimum wage is \nnot about helping teenagers earn more from their summer jobs, it is \nabout helping families realize the promise of America. This fact was \ndriven home during a conversation I had with a woman from Reno named \nNatasha. She is married, has a child, and works as a server in a \npopular restaurant. She works hard. In fact, the restaurant is one of \nmy favorites. It is in a little strip mall. The restaurant is called \nPinocchio's. It is a wonderful restaurant.\n  She has served me on a number of occasions. She works hard, as does \nher husband. But with a minimum wage job, she has trouble making ends \nmeet and affording basics, such as food, clothing, and housing. She has \ntried to get ahead by taking classes at a community college in the \narea, but she had to cut back because she could not afford to go to \nschool and also pay for what she needed to take care of her family. She \nearns the minimum wage, plus her tips.\n  Now, I would say to my friend from Wyoming, the employer is not going \nto eliminate her job if the minimum wage is increased. He needs \nsomebody to wait those tables, and she is willing to do this because \nshe needs the work. And the tips are not that bad. She is trying to \nlive the American dream by going to school and getting ahead but unable \nto do it because the minimum wage in this country is not enough money.\n  Her story is like many others we have all heard, if we listen--\nstories of families caught in the cycle of poverty, a cycle we can \nbegin to end today by increasing the minimum wage.\n  An increase in the minimum wage will help 7 million Americans. This \nmay not sound like a lot of money, but to these people it is a lot of \nmoney. An increase of this size can help a family heat their home, pay \nfor transportation to work, or can help a mother afford childcare so \nshe does not have to worry about her kids while she is away.\n  The majority is calling to increase the minimum wage to $6.25 and \nfurther attempting to end the 40-hour workweek with what they call \nflextime. These measures are unacceptable. Raise the minimum wage, not \nplay games with making it easier for employers to stagger the work of \nemployees. They have already, through the President, eliminated \novertime in many instances.\n  First, a nominal increase in the minimum wage will help millions of \nAmericans. This is important. Ending the 40-hour workweek, replacing it \nwith flextime, would deny over 10 million minimum wage workers the \nability to earn overtime pay.\n  We can do better. Helping our families live more productive lives \nmust be our top priority. Providing workers a wage that is consistent \nwith the rising cost of living is both fair and just. I urge my \ncolleagues to pass this increase in the minimum wage.\n  The distinguished Senator from Massachusetts has spent a lifetime in \nthe national legislature helping people who don't have lobbyists. When \nSenators walk up to this door here--sometimes we come in by subway--\nmany times we are overwhelmed by lobbyists, so many that we can't work \nour way through them. But we will not see lobbyists here representing \nminimum wage workers.\n  I send to my friend through the Chair my appreciation for a lifetime \nof work\n\n[[Page S2132]]\n\nhelping those who don't have lobbyists, people who are working like \nNatasha trying to make ends meet. The minimum wage should be increased. \nIt is a shame that we have to fight for it so hard. Frankly, we have \nnot been successful for 8 years. I say to my friend--and I don't like \nto hear myself say this--they have their marching orders over there. We \nare going to lose again.\n  The people who are in these entry-level jobs are again going to be \nwithout an increase. There are people out there who had hope. I am \nsorry. The marching orders have been given, and there will be no \nincrease.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask the Chair to let me know when I have used 7 \nminutes.\n  Mr. President, we have had a good discussion with my friend and \ncolleague, the Senator from Pennsylvania. During the course of the \ndebate, I did mention that a range of different groups are supporting \nour position. I will include those endorsements in the Record. One I \nwould like to mention is from the Catholic Bishops. This is their \nposition:\n\n       The Catholic Bishops have been long time supporters of the \n     minimum wage. In Catholic teaching, the principle of a living \n     wage is integral to our understanding of human work. Wages \n     must be adequate for workers to provide for themselves and \n     their families in dignity. Because the minimum wage is not a \n     living wage, the Catholic Bishops have supported increasing \n     the minimum wage over the decades.\n       We are aware that some accommodations are being offered to \n     alleviate possible adverse effects on small businesses . . . \n     that might occur with a modest increase in the minimum wage. \n     However, other changes and modification being contemplated \n     that will affect overtime pay or the 40 hour workweek are \n     unwarranted and unwise. Other workers should not lose minimum \n     wage protection or overtime pay as the price of increasing \n     the wages of America's lowest paid workers. At the very \n     least, such changes to the Fair Labor Standards Act should be \n     considered in the formal legislative process, not attached to \n     a popular increase in the minimum wage as a condition of \n     passage.\n\n  They indicate their support for our amendment.\n  In just a few moments the Senate will have an opportunity to vote \neither in favor of the Santorum amendment or my amendment. I believe a \nvote for the Santorum amendment is a vote to deny the minimum wage to \nmore than 10 million workers. Those workers are looking to us for a \nfair raise to reward their hard work and to help care for their \nfamilies.\n  But the Santorum amendment takes away their minimum wage rights \nentirely. A vote for the Santorum amendment is a vote to deny overtime \npay to more than 10 million workers. These workers rely on overtime pay \nto make ends meet, and overtime pay is compensation for many long hours \naway from their families.\n  A vote for the Santorum amendment is a vote for a pay cut for workers \nwho rely on tips--waitresses, taxi drivers, and hairdressers. This is \ncontrary to our values as Americans. We believe that work should have a \nreward. The Santorum amendment dishonors that. It is an insult to the \nlow-wage workers of this country.\n  The amendment I offer is about everything that we stand for as a \nnation. It is about opportunity. It ensures that every American at \nleast has the opportunity to move up and achieve the American dream. It \nis about fairness. What is fair about working hard 52 weeks of the year \nand still living in poverty? What is fair when Members of Congress \nraise their own salaries seven times, by $28,000, over the last 8 years \nand refuse to vote for an increase in the minimum wage? What is fair \nabout that? What is fair about executives who pay themselves millions \nof dollars but can't find a way to pay a decent minimum wage?\n  It is about making our economy work for everyone, not just the \nprivileged few. There is no doubt that this is one of the central moral \nquestions of our time. It is how we treat the least of those among us. \nIt is why religious leaders have supported a minimum wage increase. The \nSantorum amendment fails the fundamental obligations of a just and fair \nsociety. Under the guise of raising the minimum wage, it cuts overtime \npay and leaves out too many individuals.\n  Who are these minimum wage workers? First of all, they are men and \nwomen of dignity. They assist in the classrooms every day to teach the \nchildren. They work in nursing homes to help care for the elderly who \nhave sacrificed for their children and have made such a difference for \nthis country. This issue is about women working in our society, because \na majority of those who will benefit from this minimum wage increase \nare women. It is a women's issue. It is a children's issue because a \nthird of those women have children. It is a children's and a women's \nissue--and a family issue. It is a civil rights issue because so many \nof the men and women who receive the minimum wage are men and women of \ncolor. And most of all, it is a fairness issue.\n  If there is a value which the American people understand, it is \nfairness. The American people believe if you work 40 hours a week, 52 \nweeks of the year, you should not have to live in poverty. They are \nliving in poverty today with the second lowest minimum wage in nearly \nthe last 60 years.\n  The amendment I offer will provide a helping hand to men and women of \ndignity to live in a decent and fair respect.\n  I hope the Senate will accept it.\n  I yield back my time and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on \nthe last two votes. I had traveled with the President to Pittsburgh, PA \ntoday so that I was absent during the vote on the Kennedy amendment. \nHad I been present, I would have voted for the Kennedy amendment. I \narrived 7 minutes into the vote on the Santorum amendment. I would like \nto have made the vote for the first amendment but voted for the \nSantorum amendment. As between the two, my preference would have been \nthe Kennedy amendment because it raised the minimum wage more, and \nafter a 7\\1/2\\ year hiatus, it seemed to me that that amendment was in \norder.\n  I commend Senator Kennedy for his continuing efforts on the minimum \nwage, and I commend my distinguished colleague for his efforts which \nbridged a considerable gap. I wanted to explain or comment for the \nrecord why I was absent on the Kennedy amendment but present on the \nSantorum amendment, even though I would have preferred the Kennedy \namendment to the Santorum amendment. But I would have in any event \nvoted for both of them.\n  The last time Congress voted to raise the minimum wage was in 1996, \nraising it from $4.25 to $4.75 to eventually $5.15. Since 2000, the \nnumber of Americans in poverty has increased by 4.3 million for a grand \ntotal of 36 million people, which includes 13 million children. Among \nfull-time, year-round workers, poverty has doubled since the late 1970s \nfrom about 1.3 million then to more than 2.6 million. Since 1981 on 10 \ndifferent occasions, I have voted to increase the minimum wage.\n  History clearly demonstrates that raising the minimum wage has no \nadverse impact on jobs, employment, or inflation. In the 4 years after \nthe last minimum wage increase passed, the economy experienced its \nstrongest growth in over three decades. More than 11 million new jobs \nwere added, at the pace of 232,000 per month.\n  Nearly 7\\1/2\\ million workers will directly benefit from this minimum \nwage increase while 8 million more will benefit indirectly. That is a \ntotal of 15\\1/2\\ million Americans who would get a raise due to this \nlegislation and would enable a working family to afford almost 2 more \nyears of childcare, full tuition for a community college degree, and \nmany other staples for a healthy standard of living. Unfortunately, the \ncurrent minimum wage fails to meet these standards.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will be very brief. Late last week, \nthis body, in its wisdom, defeated our amendment to close the \nmillionaire's loophole, an amendment that would allow certain trusts to \nbe set up by anybody, but, of course, they are expensive and only those \nvery wealthy who have a purpose would do it and shield their assets in \nthe trust and then declare bankruptcy and shed their debt.\n  It meant that if you were very wealthy, and you could afford some \nfancy lawyers, you were a lot better off than somebody who went \nbankrupt who made $40,000, $45,000, $50,000, or $55,000. I was hoping \nthe amendment could have been adopted, but it was not.\n  After that point, a number of my colleagues from the other side said, \nlet's try to work something out. We tried this morning but did not \nreach agreement. So Senator Talent, my friend from Missouri, just \noffered his amendment, which I regret to say does not close the \nmillionaire's loophole at all. It is something of a subterfuge. There \nare two basic problems with it.\n  First, you would have to prove that the intent of the filer of the \ntrust was to avoid bankruptcy. I do not have to tell anyone here who is \na lawyer that to prove that intent, especially when the filer would \nwant to make sure that intent could not be proven and would leave no \npaper trail, no documents or anything else, would be next to \nimpossible. So in a sense, it would not close the loophole at all.\n  But there is a broader point. Whether the intent was to do it or not, \nwhy should someone be able to shield millions of dollars of assets and \ndeclare bankruptcy? We are trying to close abuses here. Why are the \nabuses of the wealthy any less worthy of being closed than, say, of the \nmiddle class, someone who might gamble their meager assets away?\n  This amendment removes the requirement that you must prove the intent \nof setting up the trust was simply to avoid your assets being taken in \nbankruptcy, as well as doing one other thing. The amendment has another \nproblem with it which deals with pensions, and our amendment corrects \nthat as well.\n  Their amendment on pensions would subject pensions to these rules, \nand we do not want to do that. That is quite different than somebody \nhiding their assets in these trusts. But some of these trusts are used \nby pension plans. We do not bring pension plans into it. In fact, we \ntake them out.\n  The Talent amendment has kept the pension proposal. I am sure we will \nbe debating the Talent amendment and my second-degree amendment to the \nTalent amendment at some point as we\n\n[[Page S2139]]\n\nmove forward on the bankruptcy bill, but I wanted to let my colleagues \nknow what has happened.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, will the Senator from New York yield for \na question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we went through a debate last time over \nthe retirement benefits, the savings plans. I thought we capped those \nat $1 million.\n  My question to the Senator from New York, Mr. President, is, how \nconfident is he under the bankruptcy bill as written that these trusts \nwill be held by bankruptcy judges as not subject to being part of the \nassets of the debtor's estate? Is this something about which the \nSenator from New York is concerned? And we are not sure or do we have \nany law that will give the Senator cause to believe that they would not \nbe captured as part of the estate?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. The lawyers we have consulted have said it is pretty \nclear-cut that these assets would be held immune from bankruptcy. But \nprobably more important than my opinion, there was an article in the \nNew York Times written by a Pulitzer Prize-winning author who is an \nexpert on the Tax Code who checked this out with many different \nsources, as I read the article, and said it is pretty clear that these \nassets would be held immune from bankruptcy.\n  Let me remind my colleague, only five States allow the setting up of \nthese trusts, but neither Alabama nor New York. Citizens in our States \ncould set up these trusts in Utah. I do not remember all the other \nStates. I remember Utah because Senator Hatch came over to me and said: \nthat is my State you are picking on. They could set up these trusts, \nuse the trusts in those States, and they would be immune from \nbankruptcy, no matter what the jurisdiction.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator from New York. It is a matter that \ncould be significant, and I am glad we are discussing it.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. If my colleague will yield for a minute, I would prefer \nnot to second degree the amendment of my friend from Missouri. I would \nlike to come to a compromise that truly closes this loophole. I know my \nfriend from Iowa, the leader on this bill, had mentioned in his remarks \nthat he was interested in closing this. My colleague from Utah had \nmentioned that he was interested in closing this, and rather than \nhaving a debate on the amendment of the Senator from Missouri and my \nsecond degree, if we could come to a compromise that truly closes the \nloophole without going further, I would be happy to do that.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator for that offer and will look \nforward to taking him up on that.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                     Amendments Nos. 110, 111, 112\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Leahy, I send a \nmodification of amendment 26 to the desk. This amendment has been \ncleared on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment will be so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 26), as modified, is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To restrict access to certain personal information in \n                         bankruptcy documents)\n\n       On page 132, between lines 5 and 6, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 234. PROTECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION.\n\n       (a) Restriction of Public Access to Certain Information \n     Contained in Bankruptcy Case Files.--Section 107 of title 11, \n     United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(c)(1) The bankruptcy court, for cause, may protect an \n     individual, with respect to the following types of \n     information to the extent the court finds that disclosure of \n     such information would create undue risk of identity theft or \n     other unlawful injury to the individual or the individual's \n     property:\n       ``(A) Any means of identification (as defined in section \n     1028(d) of title 18) contained in a paper filed, or to be \n     filed, in a case under this title.\n       ``(B) Other information contained in a paper described in \n     subparagraph (A).\n       ``(2) Upon ex parte application demonstrating cause, the \n     court shall provide access to information protected pursuant \n     to paragraph (1) to an entity acting pursuant to the police \n     or regulatory power of a domestic governmental unit.\n       ``(3) The United States trustee, bankruptcy administrator, \n     trustee, and any auditor serving under section 586(f) of \n     title 28--\n       ``(A) shall have full access to all information contained \n     in any paper filed or submitted in a case under this title; \n     and\n       ``(B) shall not disclose information specifically protected \n     by the court under this title.''.\n       (b) Security of Social Security Account Number of Debtor in \n     Notice to Creditor.--Section 342(c) of title 11, United \n     States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``last 4 digits of the'' before ``taxpayer \n     identification number''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following: ``If the notice \n     concerns an amendment that adds a creditor to the schedules \n     of assets and liabilities, the debtor shall include the full \n     taxpayer identification number in the notice sent to that \n     creditor, but the debtor shall include only the last 4 digits \n     of the taxpayer identification number in the copy of the \n     notice filed with the court.''.\n       (c) Conforming Amendment.--Section 107(a) of title 11, \n     United States Code, is amended by striking ``subsection \n     (b),'' and inserting ``subsections (b) and (c),''.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the recent debacles at ChoicePoint and Bank \nof America remind us that we must vigilantly protect our personal \ninformation at all points of vulnerability. The bankruptcy process, \nwhich inherently involves the exchange of highly personal information, \nshould be no different.\n  This is a bipartisan amendment that balances the need to protect \npersonal\n\n[[Page S2140]]\n\ninformation with the needs of creditors, regulators and law enforcement \nto access critical information. The amendment is strongly supported by \nthe non-partisan Judicial Conference, and also by the Center for \nDemocracy and Technology.\n  I am pleased that my colleagues Senator Snowe and Senator Cantwell \nhave agreed to cosponsor this amendment, and that Chairman Specter and \nSenator Grassley worked so closely with us to improve the amendment \neven further. They have all been leaders on privacy issues, and I \nappreciate their support.\n  Our bipartisan amendment does two things. It enhances court \ndiscretion to balance the need to know against the need to protect \npersonal information, and it requires truncation of social security \nnumbers in publicly filed documents. This protection is particularly \nimportant in an electronic filing environment, where information once \nfiled is immediately available to the public via the Internet.\n  The amendment allows the court, for cause, to protect personal \ninformation. For example, the court can seal or redact information, \nsuch as the home or employment address of a debtor, because of a \npersonal security risk, including fear of injury by a former spouse or \nstalker. The amendment would also give the court the leeway to protect \nother information normally considered private, such as personal medical \nrecords.\n  Our bipartisan amendment still protects law enforcement and creditors \nwhere necessary. A law enforcement provision ensures that police and \nregulators can get needed information directly from the bankruptcy \ncourt, and a creditor protection provision specifies that creditors, \nincluding the IRS, receive the full Social Security number of a debtor \nin the initial notice of the case. Finally, we also clarify that these \nprotections should not limit the access of the trustees, administrators \nand auditors to necessary information.\n  We must be careful that our efforts to require documentation for \naccuracy and accountability do not inadvertently create problems for \nprivacy and security. As modified, the amendment properly balances \nthese concerns, and protects the needs of those who need to know.\n  This has been a cooperative, bi-partisan effort, I extend special \nthanks to Senator Snowe, Chairman Specter, and Senator Grassley for all \ntheir hard-work in reaching an agreement, and I am pleased to submit \nthis modification.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I support the amendment offered by my \ncolleague Senator Leahy, to ensure that the private, personal \nidentification information filed in bankruptcy proceedings does not \nfall into the hands of identity thieves, violent stalkers, and other \npersons with criminal intentions. I, along with my colleague Senator \nCantwell, join as cosponsors to the Leahy amendment and urge its \nadoption by the Senate. This amendment is endorsed by the Judicial \nConference of the United States, which is presided over by Chief \nJustice Rehnquist, and to which Congress regularly defers in the \nwriting of the rules of our Federal court system.\n  Bankruptcy court filings, like most other court proceedings, are \npublic record, and most papers filed in these cases are publicly \navailable record. This is a good thing, because the administration of \njustice in our country should not be a secret affair. It is the \npublic's right to know how its courts are meting out justice. The \nBankruptcy Code affirmatively adopts this policy.\n  At the same time, bankruptcy proceedings are unique in that the \nexplicit financial information of the debtor and its creditors are \nfiled with the court, and likewise available for public review. Such \ninformation includes not only a person's name and address, but \ninformation such as the person's social security number, date of birth, \ndriver's license number, and electronic addresses and routing codes. \nThis information has long been available for public review at our \nNation's courthouses. However, in today's information age, more and \nmore Federal courts are making all of their public documents available \non-line as well. While this is an advancement in efficiency in most \nregards, it opens up a great potential for abuse for identity thieves \nand others who access the Internet with the intent to commit fraud, \nphysical harm, or other crimes.\n  More and more agencies today gain access to such personal information \nthrough publicly available documents. And as the recent computer \nhacking incident at Choice Point Corporation demonstrates, such \npersonal information can be obtained even from companies in the \nbusinesses of collecting and securely storing such information. \nMoreover, access to such personal, sensitive information could pose \nserious risks to victims of domestic abuse, stalking, and other violent \ncrime. Because any person with a computer can obtain these court \ndocuments, a person's safety and the safety of her property could be \nseriously put at risk.\n  Senator Leahy, Senator Cantwell, and I have devised this amendment to \nhelp prevent these harmful invasions of privacy from ever occurring. \nCurrently the Bankruptcy Code allows courts to issue protective orders \nto prevent public disclosure of trade secrets and confidential research \nand commercial information. Our amendment would expand the court's \nauthority to provide for similar protection of the personally \nidentifiable information that I just described, as well as give the \ncourt the ability to shield other information if its release would \ncreate an undue risk of either identity theft or of injury to an \nindividual's person or property. It further provides that when publicly \navailable notices are filed with the court, only the last four digits \nof a person's social security number are required to be included in the \ndocuments. A separate filing with the full social security number will \nbe sent privately to each party in interest in the bankruptcy \nproceeding. This amendment also creates an exception to ensure that law \nenforcement can gain access, and it has the support of the Department \nof Justice.\n  Furthermore, I have worked closely with the sponsors of the \nunderlying bill, which I support, to ensure that this amendment does \nnothing to harm the efficient functioning of the credit and banking \nindustries. Credit reporting agencies often rely on taxpayer \nidentification numbers--most often social security numbers--to \ndetermine a person's creditworthiness. To ensure accuracy in such \ncredit reports, we have modified the original language of this \namendment to address the industry's concerns without in any way \nweakening the protections that we seek to enact. The new language \nstrikes the appropriate balance for all concerned, and I understand \nthat the industry finds the modification acceptable.\n  Giving the sensitive nature of bankruptcy filings and the increased \nthreat of identity theft in today's society, this is a common sense \nmeasure to the underlying bankruptcy reform bill, which I support. I am \npleased that all sides have come to agreement, and that this amendment \nwill be adopted.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues on the \nSenate Judiciary Committee and others who have worked together for many \nyears, despite considerable differences in the area of bankruptcy \nreform, to produce a bill that has passed the Senate a number of times. \nAll that said, the bill is far from perfect, and the Senate should take \nfull advantage of this opportunity to take a number of steps to amend \nthis bill and improve it. I have supported amendments that improve the \nbill in areas where it affects particularly vulnerable consumers and \nretirees, and I believe we should also address incidents of corporate \nabuse. There are also ways to bring the bill up to date with modern \ntechnology and crime.\n  For example, I proudly join my colleague from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, in \nrecommending to all my colleagues the pending Leahy-Cantwell-Snowe \nprivacy amendment, Amendment No. 26. This amendment is an appropriate \nresponse to the recent erosion of informational privacy in our society, \ndemonstrated by the ChoicePoint and Bank of America personal \ninformational security breaches, where the personal information of \nthousands of people was misappropriated by identity thieves.\n  Consumers should not have to surrender their privacy rights, just to \ngain access to our Nation's bankruptcy system. There are a number of \nreasons why it is simply sound practice for bankruptcy courts to join \nother Federal courts that already have a viable\n\n[[Page S2141]]\n\nmechanism to file personal information of debtors and others under \nseal. Identity theft is a predictable outcome when criminals have \nvirtually unfettered access to an obvious public database of people who \nare already vulnerable in public bankruptcy court files. In some \ninstances, a debtor might be a battered woman, a victim of a stalker or \nanother victim of domestic violence, and the disclosure of that \nperson's private information may subject her to further abuse. Congress \nhas recognized the need to render private such personal information in \ncourt filings in much of the Federal court system, and this body should \nnow add the bankruptcy courts to the list of properly protected public \nentities. Although I recognize that bankruptcy courts have some \ndiscretion to protect ``scandalous or defamatory matter,'' the point or \npreserving privacy of this information should also be to protect \ninformation that could be used to injure the consumer, either \nfinancially or even physically. It is also clear that such courts do \nnot have the same ability to do protect information for cause as do \nother Federal courts. It is time to fix this unjustifiable distinction \nbetween the privacy rights of litigants in one kind of Federal court \nand another. I ask my colleagues to support Leahy-Cantwell-Snowe, \nbecause people's economic and even their physical security may be in \njeopardy otherwise. Let's not wait for the inevitable abuse of this \nloophole, which could lead to stolen identities, or physical harm, \nbefore we act.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for the Leahy-Cantwell-Snowe amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak very briefly about the \namendments I have offered this evening to the pending bankruptcy bill. \nI have found as I traveled back in Illinois and around the country that \nsome people follow the C-SPAN floor debate very closely. Just over this \nweekend, having traveled to Arizona and Nevada, I am amazed to find \npeople who heard my speech on the bankruptcy bill, which always \nintrigues me that so many people suffer from insomnia that they watch \nC-SPAN gavel to gavel, but in all honesty I admire them for their \ninterest in our Government, and I hope that they follow this debate. \nBut if one is a newcomer to this bankruptcy bill debate, I will say a \nfew words about the bill and the amendments which I have offered.\n  When it comes to the bill itself, which is 510 pages, it will amend \nthe bankruptcy law of America. It is a bill which has been considered \nfor years. We have had versions of this bill over the last 9 or 10 \nyears. I know because years ago I worked with Senator Grassley on one \nof the first modifications to the Bankruptcy Code. Some of these \nchanges passed the Senate and failed in the House. Some have passed the \nHouse and Senate and been vetoed by President Clinton. The bill has had \nits ups and downs. It never did become law in that period of time.\n  Now for the second bill of the session, one of the highest priorities \non the Republican side of the aisle--they are pushing for the \nbankruptcy reform bill. When one thinks of all the challenges in \nAmerica, the obvious question is, why are we considering bankruptcy \nreform before we would even consider health care in America or doing \nsomething about the economy creating jobs or addressing the budget \ndeficit in America or even addressing Social Security? Why is this \nbankruptcy bill such a high priority? Well, the reason is this bill \nmakes fundamental changes in the law as to which Americans will qualify \nfor bankruptcy.\n  Bankruptcy, of course, was created in the law of many civilized \nnations such as the United States because in the old days if one went \ndeeply into debt they could be put in prison. People decided that was \nbarbaric. They said there should reach a point, if one cannot pay their \ndebts, they can be exonerated or have those debts wiped clean from \ntheir record and start new, start fresh. That is what bankruptcy is all \nabout.\n  Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code is that situation. One walks into \nthe court and they say, here are all of my debts, here are all of my \nassets, and the court should basically liquidate whatever they have, \npay off as much of the debt as possible, and at the end of the day they \nwalk out of the court without much left on this Earth but without any \ndebts, wipe the slate clean. That is bankruptcy.\n  There are other provisions in the Bankruptcy Code, notably chapter \n13. Under chapter 13, one walks into court and says: I have more debts \nthan I can pay, but I can pay something. The court then says: We will \nwork out a schedule for what you will pay over a period of time. That \nis chapter 13. So one does not walk out with their debts relieved, but \nthey may walk out with fewer debts to pay and a schedule to pay them. \nThe court monitors their progress under chapter 13. So in chapter 7, \none walks out with the slate clean. Chapter 13, they walk out still \npaying off their debts.\n  In came the credit card companies and the major banks to Congress \nabout 10 years ago and said, we believe that too many people are having \nthe slate wiped clean and that they should continue to pay off their \ndebts, even if they think they should be relieved of all liability. The \npurpose of this bill is to say that people walking into bankruptcy \ncourt are now going to have a much more difficult time wiping the slate \nclean to start over. More likely than not, particularly if they are \nmaking more than the median income in America, which is not a huge, \nprincely sum, the credit card industry comes in and says, we want to \nmake sure that if someone comes into court and wants to file \nbankruptcy, when it is all said and done, they will still have credit \ncard bills to pay, and not just credit card bills. They could be \nmedical bills. They could be any number of different bills. So they \npushed hard for 10 years to get this bill passed by the Senate in the \nhopes that fewer Americans will have an opportunity to start fresh and \nto start new. So we have been debating for over a week changes in this \nbill, changes that were designed to take into consideration special \ncircumstances.\n  I give credit to my friends on the Republican side of the aisle. They \nhave rejected every single change. Let me say what they have rejected \nso far. I offered an amendment that said if one served in the Guard or \nReserve, if they are in the military and they are serving their country \noverseas and as a result of their service their family or their \nbusiness goes into bankruptcy, we are not going to be so harsh on them. \nWe are going to give them an easier time of it in bankruptcy because \ntheir circumstances serving our country, risking their lives for \nAmerica, warrant better consideration than some other circumstances. I \nthought that was a reasonable amendment. I hear all my fellow \nSenators praising our men and women in uniform, how they are standing \nbehind them. Well, I had veterans groups and military family groups all \nsupporting my amendment. They said this is a reasonable thing to do. A \nlot of people who are activated end up losing their businesses, and \nthey should be given some consideration in bankruptcy court.\n\n  I lost that amendment 58 to 38. Every Republican Senator voted \nagainst it. I cannot quite understand why, but that was their position.\n  Then came Senator Kennedy. Senator Kennedy said we just did a survey, \nand the No. 1 reason people file bankruptcy now is because of medical \nbills. Senator Kennedy said if someone has gone through a medical \ncrisis in their life and they have medical bills they cannot pay, we \nwill at least say that when they go into bankruptcy court because of \nthose bills, they can protect a small home, $150,000 home, which in \nsome communities in America would be a very small home. It says that \neven though one has been through an illness, they had all of these \nmedical bills, they have been forced into bankruptcy, they will have a \nroof over their head. That amendment was rejected, too. The thought \nthat we would give people and their families facing medical \ncatastrophes a break to be able to keep a home was rejected.\n  I then offered an amendment that said, what if the creditor is what \nwe call a predatory lender, somebody who breaks the rules, breaks the \nlaw--for example, offers a second mortgage on a home at an unreasonable \ninterest rate, hidden charges, balloon payments that prey upon people \nlike senior citizens--what are we going to do when they come to \nbankruptcy court? Why should we allow them to take away the home of a \nperson if they have broken the law in giving the loan?\n  I thought that was pretty obvious. A person coming into bankruptcy \ncourt\n\n[[Page S2142]]\n\nas a creditor doesn't have clean hands if they have broken the law with \nthe loan they are trying to enforce. I thought at least we would stand \nfor the law, that we would only enforce legal loans, not illegal loans.\n  Rejected. It was rejected largely on a party-line vote. Every \nRepublican Senator but one voted against it.\n  As you can see, as we have gone through these amendments, whether we \nare talking about men and women in the military, whether we are talking \nabout people with medical bills, whether we are talking about victims \nof predatory loans, even if we are talking about people who are victims \nof identity theft--we are all following the news accounts of \nChoicePoint where a lot of personal information has been disclosed \nabout individuals. It scares a lot of folks that someone will grab \ntheir Social Security number and their identity and run up some bills. \nIt happens. Unfortunately it happens a lot.\n  Senator Bill Nelson of Florida said if you are a victim of identity \ntheft, you should be given a break in bankruptcy court. They weren't \ndebts you incurred; they were debts incurred by someone who stole your \nidentity. I thought that was a reasonable amendment, too.\n  Rejected. Every Republican voted against it. They don't want to take \ninto consideration the real-life tragedies and misfortunes that bring \nsomeone into bankruptcy court. They want to make sure that at the end \nof the day the credit card companies and the major financial \ninstitutions will get more money from people walking into bankruptcy \ncourt.\n  Senator Akaka offered an amendment and said, shouldn't these credit \ncard companies disclose more in their monthly statements, these \ncompanies that just inundate us with applications for credit cards? \nShouldn't their monthly statements at least say: If you make the \nminimum monthly payment, this is how long it will take to pay off the \nloan and here is how much you will pay in interest? Is that \nunreasonable? I don't think it is.\n\n  These companies are making huge amounts of money. In 2003 the credit \ncard companies made $30 billion in profit.\n  So Senator Akaka offered an amendment that said at least these credit \ncard monthly statements should tell the consumer more so they make the \nright choices for themselves and their families.\n  Rejected, again, on a party-line vote, with only one Senator from the \nRepublican side of the aisle voting for it.\n  You think to yourself, if you can't hold the credit card companies to \neven that minimum standard, what is this debate all about? We are not \ncreating exceptions for real-life situations. We are not giving \nconsumers more tools to decide what is a reasonable amount of credit. \nAll we are doing is saying, at the end of the day, the credit card \ncompanies are going to get their bill and they are going to get more \nmoney out of people filing in bankruptcy court.\n  Time and again in this debate, many of my colleagues, whom I respect \nmuch, have said: Senator Durbin, you have it all wrong. If people make \nless than the median income in America, they will not be affected by \nthis bill. They are going to be off the hook. You have to be making \nover the median income to possibly get into a situation where you are \ngoing to have to pay off more of your debts.\n  I have listened to that over and over. My staff and I, over the \nweekend, read the bill. It turns out that is not the case. In order to \nprove that you are below median income, you have to go through an \nexpensive and extensive process under this bill. So I felt that it was \nonly reasonable to say to my colleagues: Why don't we give those below \nmedian income a better chance to prove that they should not be covered \nby the provisions in this bill?\n  We make clear in amendment No. 110 that debtors in bankruptcy falling \nbelow median income need only provide calculations or other information \nshowing the debtor's situation satisfies the below-median-income \nstandard.\n  In other words, you don't have to hire a lawyer. You don't have to \nincur thousands of dollars of legal debt if you are below median \nincome. You establish that to the court and then you move forward.\n  Second, the amendment says that a court may not dismiss a case based \non any forms of means testing if the current monthly income of the \ndebtor falls at or below the median family income of the applicable \nState. What the language in my amendment does is reinforce every \nargument we have heard from the other side of the aisle. Time and again \nthey have said: If you make low income in America, you will not be \naffected by this bill.\n  We say: Fine, then let's change the bill and clarify that so a person \nfiling for bankruptcy doesn't have to go through all of the pain and \nall of the expense of filing all the documents required under this \nbill.\n  We had a program under President Clinton not that long ago called the \nCOPS Program--you may remember it--bringing more police back to the \ncommunities of America. It was a wildly successful program. It brought \nthousands of policemen to the State of Illinois and many other States. \nWe ended up having a one-page application for that program. We prided \nourselves on the fact that we were not absolutely swamping people in \ncommunities with all kinds of Federal paperwork and applications. With \none page you could qualify for a COPS grant in your community.\n  What we are saying here is, shouldn't a person in bankruptcy court, \nalready probably embarrassed by the process, already worried about \npaying the legal bills, if they are below median income, shouldn't we \nsimplify the process for them?\n  I am going to give my colleagues a chance to vote on that.\n  The second thing we do is to return to the issue of veterans and \nmembers of the Armed Forces on active duty, and whether they are going \nto be treated the same in bankruptcy as other people. I will go back to \nthe argument. I think if someone is serving our country, risking their \nlives for America, to protect me and my home, that we should do \neverything we can to help them. So we say, in this case, if your \nindebtedness as a veteran or a member of the military is primarily \nincurred while you are on active duty, that you can go into the \nbankruptcy court and escape the worst parts of the means test. It is a \nway to consolidate some of the arguments made earlier and to try to \nappeal to my friends on the Republican side of the aisle, for one last \ntime, to be sensitive to some of the real hardships that have been \ncreated for families of Guardsmen and Reserves who have been activated.\n  The last point is one I almost offer in desperation, amendment No. \n112. I cannot believe my colleagues have rejected all of these \namendments when they relate to men and women in the armed services, but \nthe last amendment relates to disabled veterans, men and women who \nbecome disabled as a result of their service in America and face \nbankruptcy. It is a final appeal to my friends on both sides of the \naisle: If you cannot work up sympathy for men and women in uniform \nserving our country, at least have some concern for those who are \ndisabled and come back and face bankruptcy. Don't put them through \nthese unreasonable tests and standards in this bill. I would think all \nof us could agree that disabled veterans should be given some sort of a \nhelping hand in this bankruptcy process.\n\n  So we will try again with the amendments that we offer. I know some \nof them will be debated at length. I just sincerely hope this week the \nsupporters of this bill will at least take a little time and consider \nthe possibility of amending this bill.\n  To my knowledge, the only perfect law that was ever written were the \nTen Commandments, and they were not written by Senators. They were \nwritten by somebody in higher office.\n  This bill, as good as it may be, can be better. It should be better. \nIt should be more sensitive to some of the real-world challenges that \nwe face. I hope we will consider these amendments favorably, enact them \nsoon, and make them part of this legislation. It will make a bill which \nI think is unfair in many respects a lot fairer.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 26, As Modified\n\n  One last thing. I ask unanimous consent the Leahy-Snowe privacy \namendment No. 26, as modified, be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 26), as modified, was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n[[Page S2143]]\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would just say Senator Durbin is an \nexcellent advocate, but this is the fourth time that this bill in \nsubstantially this form has been before this body. It has been marked \nup in the Judiciary Committee four times. We have had weeks on it each \ntime it has come up for debate here. After several weeks of debate, the \nlast time it came up it passed 83 to 15.\n  The issues that he raises are really covered by the bill. If someone, \nanyone is disabled and they have a continuing extra medical expense, \nthat would be considered in whether or not they would ever have to pay \nany of their debts back. If their income is below median income, they \nwould never be required to pay their debts back. All they would have to \ndo is introduce some evidence from their pay stubs or their income tax, \nwhat their income is. Certainly we have a right to ask that before we \ndischarge, wipe out, eliminate all debts, as people do when they come \ninto bankruptcy.\n  I really would just say that we have given great consideration to \nthese issues. We could disagree, but these amendments, for the most \npart, have been up before. I do not believe that most are going to be \naccepted. But there is every right of my colleague's side to offer \nthem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/07/senate-section/article/S2143-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

STEAD\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Francis P. \n``Frank'' Stead, who passed away at the age of 90 on January 31, 2005, \nfollowing an extended illness.\n  Frank Stead and I were neighbors in Springfield, IL starting in 1969 \nwhen I returned home to Illinois after graduating from Georgetown \nUniversity Law School. He was a good neighbor, a good friend, and he \nwill certainly be missed by the many people whose lives he touched.\n  Frank was one of the many unsung heroes of an era that journalist Tom \nBrokaw has dubbed ``The Greatest Generation.'' Coming of age during the \nGreat Depression and serving our country during World War II, Frank \nshared in the values of a generation that helped make our country what \nit is today: a sense of honor and bravery, a commitment to service, and \nabove all, a love of family and country.\n  In 1943, at the height of the U.S. action in World War II, Frank \nenlisted in the U.S. Navy and was assigned to the Pacific theater, \nleaving behind his sweetheart, Dorothy Mlaker. While on duty in the \nPacific, Frank sent a letter to Dorothy proposing marriage. Later, \nafter receiving her acceptance letter, Frank ordered an engagement ring \nfrom the catalog of a Chicago jeweler. He sent payment to the jeweler \nvia money order, with instructions for the ring to be mailed to \nDorothy. When he was able to take leave, Frank returned to Springfield \nand wed Dorothy on July 26, 1944.\n  Frank was honorably discharged from the U.S. Navy in 1945, having \nbeen awarded the Asiatic-Pacific and Good Conduct Medals. Upon his \nreturn to civilian life, Frank began his 25-year career as a salesman \nwith several of Springfield's finest men's clothiers, including \nRobert's Brothers, Arch Wilson's, and Myers Brothers.\n  Frank again answered the call to serve his country when he joined the \nU.S. Naval Reserve in 1949. He was called to active duty during the \nKorean war in 1952, and he was stationed with the Department of Defense \nin Arlington, VA. In 1979, Frank retired from the Naval Reserve, having \nserved 30 years and achieved the rank of chief petty officer yeoman.\n  Frank demonstrated his commitment to service not only through his \ncareer in the military, but also through his many civic activities. He \nserved the community of Springfield as an active member of AFSCME, as a \nparishioner of Christ the King Catholic Church and Blessed Sacrament \nCatholic Church, and as a life member of the Knights of Columbus. In \naddition, Frank Stead served on the board of directors and was past \npresident of Saint John's Hospital Samaritans. He also served on the \nboard of directors of the Illinois chapter of AARP.\n  In 1974, Frank Stead was appointed executive director of the \nSpringfield Election Commission, serving in that post for 15 years \nbefore retiring in 1989. Later, he would serve as a Democratic Precinct \nCommitteeman in Springfield. I came to know Frank and his wife, \nDorothy, well through their involvement in Springfield politics. They \nvolunteered countless hours for my campaign when I was running for the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  Frank and Dorothy Stead shared nearly 60 years of marriage before \nDorothy passed away on February 4, 2004. They are survived by their \nfour children: one son and three daughters, along with seven \ngrandchildren and four great-grandchildren.\n  I am honored to have had the opportunity to know this fine member of \nour Nation's ``Greatest Generation.'' His military service, civic \ninvolvement, commitment to his faith, and love of family have left an \nenduring impression on those of us who had the pleasure of knowing him. \nHe will be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/07/senate-section/article/S2143-3", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2143-S2144]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                      corporal travis eichelberger\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a truly heroic \nKansan, CPL Travis Eichelberger.\n  Corporal Eichelberger, a member of the 1st Battalion of the 2nd \nMarine Division, was one of the thousands of valiant young men and \nwomen who fought for the cause of liberty in Operation Iraqi Freedom. \nSadly, in March 2003, while lying in a shallow foxhole in the sand, a \n67-ton Abrams tank rolled over him, crushing his pelvis and severely \ndamaging his lower body. Corporal Eichelberger, a native of Atchison, \nKS, returned home to the United States for rehabilitation and, in April \n2003, was awarded a Purple Heart for his war injuries.\n  Recently, the Marine Corps realized their terrible mistake. While \nthis brave young man's wounds occurred in a combat zone, he was not \ninjured by hostile fire, a necessary qualification for the Purple \nHeart. For the sake of the award and all those who have been honored by \nit, the Marine Corps decided to revoke Corporal Eichelberger's Purple \nHeart. GEN Michael W. Hagee, Commandant of the Marine Corps, has \nappropriately personally offered his apologies to Corporal \nEichelberger. I, too, extend my sincere sympathies to Corporal \nEichelberger and his family during this trying and confusing time. This \nerror has caused significant embarrassment to my fellow Kansan, as well \nas to the Marine Corps, and we must take care that it is never \nrepeated.\n  After speaking with Corporal Eichelberger, I sense that his is a \nresilient spirit--and no one can doubt his courage. Corporal \nEichelberger's service and dedication will long be remembered and \nhonored. His unwavering commitment to our great Nation is a badge of \nhonor he can proudly wear for the rest of his life.\n  I commend Corporal Eichelberger for his distinguished service and \nsacrifice.\n\n\n                 second lt. richard b. ``brian'' gienau\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today in tribute to a noble Iowan \nwho has given his life for his country. 2LT Richard ``Brian'' Gienau \nwas killed on Sunday, February 27, in Ar Ramadi, Iraq, when his \nmilitary vehicle was struck by an explosive device. He was 29 years \nold, a fellow alumnus of my alma mater, the University of Northern \nIowa, and a member of A Company, 224th Engineer Battalion, Army \nNational Guard, Burlington, IA.\n  Second Lieutenant Gienau is remembered as a hard-working family man \nwith a history of military service. He joined the U.S. Navy in 1994 and \nenlisted in the Iowa Army National Guard in 1999. After graduating in \n2003 from University of Northern Iowa, he was commissioned in the \nReserve Officers' Training Corps as a second lieutenant. He was \nmobilized last October.\n  Second Lieutenant Gienau is survived by his mother, Debbee Way, of \nDunkerton, IA, and his father, Richard Gienau, of Waterloo, IA. He also \nleaves behind a young son. My prayers go out today to his family and \nfriends in their time of loss. Let us today remember\n\n[[Page S2144]]\n\nhis life as we honor his sacrifice on behalf of all of us.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  The assault of two gay men in San Francisco, CA last Wednesday was \napparently motivated by the sexual orientation of the victims. Two gay \nmen were approached by a group of men late in the evening. The group of \nmen, which was comprised of men in their early 20s yelling anti-gay \nslurs, began assaulting the two gay victims. To escape the assault, the \ntwo victims ran inside a nearby bar, but were followed by the group of \nassailants. Both of the men suffered injuries to their face as a result \nof the beating.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/07/senate-section/article/S2144-3", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2144-S2145]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               SERVICEMEMBERS RETURNING TO THE WORKFORCE\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to discuss how fortunate we are as a \nnation to have a highly-skilled veteran population able to lend their \ntalents to the workforce. I am very pleased to report that many \nemployers in the defense industry are actively recruiting this Nation's \nveterans. A recent Washington Post article entitled ``A Few Good \nRecruits'' highlights the benefits of the defense industry hiring \nveterans. Companies hiring veterans get highly skilled workers with a \ndeep understanding of the service.\n  But the reward of hiring veterans is not to be limited to the defense \nindustry. Veterans have skills that make them assets in a variety of \noccupations. Leadership, integrity, and teamwork--all of which the \nmilitary teaches--are universal qualities for every industry. I \nencourage the private sector to consider this in the future when \nhiring. Veterans possess the skills needed in public service and I \nencourage officials at all levels of government to recruit veterans.\n  Our veterans bravely defended our freedoms during their service and \nit is a great strength of this Nation that after military service is \nover, our veterans enter the workforce with skills to succeed. It is my \nhope that both public and private sector employers will take full \nadvantage of this.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article from Washington Post be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 28, 2005]\n\n                          A Few Good Recruits\n\n                          (By Ellen McCarthy)\n\n       Army Capt. Lonnie Moore lost his right leg and--he \n     thought--his career last April when his convoy was ambushed \n     on the road to Ramadi, in central Iraq. The injury led to \n     some dark days in Walter Reed Army Medical Center as Moore, \n     29, began his recuperation and contemplated life outside the \n     military.\n       Within months, however, he had received job offers from a \n     munitions company, an information technology firm, and the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs itself. And that's without \n     sending out a resume.\n       ``People tend to seek us out,'' Moore said of the veterans, \n     particularly those who have been injured, returning from Iraq \n     and Afghanistan. ``They know we'll be an asset to their \n     companies, and that we're not going to let our injuries stand \n     in the way. . . . Everybody I've known that's gotten out, \n     they're not having a hard time finding jobs.''\n       Through broad initiatives and individual requests, \n     corporations have been actively recruiting veterans of the \n     Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts, turning military hospitals \n     like Walter Reed into de facto hiring centers.\n       Job offers aren't being handed out carte blanche, and \n     companies say talent and fit are still the main priorities. \n     But executives seeking out wounded soldiers claim that many \n     of the skills acquired in the military are applicable in the \n     private sector--particularly within companies that serve the \n     government. A soldier who has led a platoon into war is \n     probably capable of leading a unit at a private company, \n     executives say. With government contracting in the midst of a \n     boom, the security clearances and knowledge that soldiers \n     bring home with them are also highly valued.\n       ``They've got to be able to talk the language. And you \n     can't teach a person that language, it's a language you can \n     only learn by being part of that culture,'' said Paul \n     Evancoe, director of military operations at FNH USA Inc., a \n     McLean weapons manufacturer with about 350 employees in the \n     United States and 16 in the Washington area. The company is \n     among those interested in hiring Moore.\n       The quest to seek an injured vet was both company-driven \n     and personal, said Evancoe, who received a Purple Heart after \n     being shot in Vietnam. Many FNH employees are veterans, so \n     the company's atmosphere and values largely mirror that of \n     the military, he added.\n       ``If you take a guy and immerse him back into that culture \n     . . . it's going to be very positive. It's going to help the \n     healing,'' Evancoe said. ``It's not like I can hire every \n     single guy, but when I have a job, I'm going to search out a \n     veteran.''\n       The Labor Department does not have statistics on the job \n     placement rates of veterans disabled in Afghanistan or Iraq. \n     However, the unemployment rate for veterans was lower than \n     that for nonveterans in 2003, the most recent statistics \n     available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That year, \n     veterans had an unemployment rate of 4.5 percent, compared \n     with 5.9 percent for nonveterans.\n       The same study found that 9 percent of veterans suffered \n     from a service-related disability; their unemployment rate \n     was comparable to that of their non-injured peers.\n       Jeannie Lehowicz, a vocational counselor stationed at \n     Walter Reed Army Medical Center, said she has a steady stream \n     of inquiries from executives and recruiters--sometimes dozens \n     a week, and typically more than the 50 to 75 soldiers she is \n     working with at any given time.\n       Most of the companies are government contractors around the \n     Capital Beltway, she says, but calls have come in from firms \n     throughout the country. One day it might be a giant defense \n     contractor from Bethesda, and the next a small biomedical \n     firm from Montana, she said.\n       ``It's overwhelming. You want to respond and say `Oh here's \n     this guy I've got for you,' but that's not always the case,'' \n     Lehowicz said.\n       More than 11,190 service members have been wounded in Iraq \n     and Afghanistan, according to Pentagon statistics. Some have \n     months of rehabilitation left before they'll be released from \n     the hospital, Lehowicz said, and others are more interested \n     in going back to school than getting a job right away. Many \n     are adamant that they will stay in the military despite their \n     disabilities, she added.\n       Even if they choose another route, the prospect of having \n     opportunities can be an important buoy for wounded soldiers, \n     Lehowicz and others say.\n       Potential opportunities were on display at a career fair \n     held at Walter Reed in December. Thrown together in a matter \n     of weeks, the event's organizers expected a dozen or so \n     companies to participate. But more firms requested space at \n     the event, and by the night of the fair, more than 30 \n     companies, including BAE Systems PLC, Science Applications \n     International Corp. and Oracle Corp., had set up booths to \n     pass out brochures and collect names.\n       ``The equipment that we work on and maintain for the \n     military is the same as they would have used,'' said Eugene \n     C. Renzi, president of defense systems at ManTech \n     International Corp., a Fairfax government contractor that \n     sent recruiters to the career fair. ``So when they get out of \n     the military, we can put them right to work and utilize the \n     skills they already have.''\n       Joe Davis, spokesman for the Veterans of Foreign Wars, said \n     outreach efforts among government contractors is partly \n     driven by executives with military backgrounds. There is a de \n     facto alumni network, he said, and a\n\n[[Page S2145]]\n\n     collective memory of the way disabled veterans were treated \n     after previous conflicts, particularly Vietnam.\n       ``Who runs the country now? It's the Vietnam era and they \n     vowed never again, and so you got all the corporations, every \n     nonprofit, all the associations and lobby arms doing \n     everything they can,'' for this generation of soldiers, Davis \n     said.\n       Contractors like ManTech have another incentive to recruit \n     former soldiers, regardless of disability: Many have security \n     clearances that are in short supply in the workforce, but \n     necessary in order to do an increasing number of \n     government projects.\n       ``If you have a security clearance, you are miles ahead of \n     a person applying to a company without a security \n     clearance,'' said Edward F. Lawton, head of the Washington \n     area chapter of the American Military Retirees Association. \n     ``And even if you're missing a limb, that doesn't mean you're \n     incapable of supporting the military through a company.''\n       But it may mean that jobs are more readily available for \n     soldiers with technical skills and for those willing to work \n     in the Washington area, where many government contractors are \n     based.\n       That proved to be the case for Brian Garvey, an Army \n     Captain who met his future employer at the Walter Reed career \n     fair.\n       The platoon leader and father of two young girls was \n     deployed to Iraq last March and for months worked at the \n     Baghdad airport, processing human resources files for \n     soldiers stationed throughout that country.\n       On Sept. 18, Garvey's unit was assigned a different task--\n     to show a contractor a damaged fence on a highway bridge \n     between the airport and the heavily guarded Green Zone. After \n     assessing the damage, Garvey had just given the signal for \n     his soldiers to return to their vehicles when a suicide \n     bomber drove a car onto the bridge and detonated an \n     explosive--killing two of the crew and wounding 13.\n       Three days later Garvey was at Walter Reed, recovering from \n     a series of surgeries to repair his hand and remove dozens of \n     pieces of shrapnel from his skin.\n       ``I would say a lot of the time was spent thinking `What am \n     I going to do? What is the best avenue for my family,''' \n     Garvey recalled of his four-month stay at the hospital. ``Up \n     to this point I had been somewhat selfish. It was what I \n     wanted to do. My wife and kids had been making the \n     sacrifices.''\n       Garvey had already been thinking about looking for a \n     private-sector job when he stopped by the career fair, hoping \n     to pick up a few business cards and some ideas. Like most of \n     the 150 soldiers crammed into the hall, Garvey was without a \n     resume or firm career goals.\n       He grabbed brochures from such big contractors as Northrop \n     Grumman Corp. and Raytheon Co., but spent the longest time \n     talking to a representative from Alliant Techsystems Inc. \n     (ATK), a Minnesota company that makes weapon systems and \n     munitions. He filled out a card with his basic information \n     and three days later got an e-mail from ATK, asking for a \n     phone interview.\n       A day-long interview at the company's Elkton, Md., site \n     followed; just before Christmas, Garvey was offered a job. \n     Soon he'll become a program manager at ATK, acting as a \n     liaison between the company's engineers and its primary \n     client--the U.S. military.\n       ``Mentally it does me a lot of good, knowing that I'm not \n     out there searching frantically for a job,'' said Garvey, who \n     is now back at Fort Hood, waiting for his unit to rotate back \n     from Iraq in March before he will be discharged. ``It gives \n     me a sense of security. I know what my future has to offer.''\n       That sense of the future is what a lot of recently wounded \n     soldiers are looking for, said Lehowicz, the VA vocational \n     counselor. When they first return from the battlefield, many \n     focus solely on getting better to return to their unit, she \n     said, but over time they often start thinking about other \n     options.\n       Moore, the Army Captain, says thoughts of his future now \n     absorb much of his day at Walter Reed. Some days he thinks he \n     would like to stay in the military, to resume life with his \n     friends and become an example for other amputees. But some of \n     the job offers have topped $70,000 and he worries this \n     opportunity may not come around again.\n       ``Veterans are getting good jobs right now,'' said Moore, \n     who will likely remain in the hospital through March. He \n     recently had a second interview with FNH USA, where he is up \n     for a position as deputy director of military operations.\n       ``I'm not sure if I stay in [the Army] for another five \n     years, if the jobs will still be here.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/07/senate-section/article/S2145-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2145]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MEDICAID DRUG REBATE PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am taking this opportunity to talk \nabout the mess we have in the Medicaid Program, a mess that does not \nproperly account for billions of taxpayer dollars. First, allow me to \nremind everyone about a report released last summer by the Government \nAccountability Office, GAO. That report on Medicaid Program integrity \nfound that Medicaid's size and diversity made it vulnerable to fraud, \nwaste and abuse. Further, the GAO found that the Centers for Medicare & \nMedicaid Service, CMS, allocated only $26,000 and only eight employees \nto work on Medicaid program integrity.\n  As I said at the time, it does not make sense for CMS to invest so \nlittle in Federal oversight when so many Federal taxpayer dollars are \nat stake. If one considers that Medicaid has surpassed Medicare as the \nsingle largest Government health program in the United States, it makes \nno sense at all. The Congressional Budget Office projects the Federal \nshare of total Medicaid payments for Fiscal Year 2005 at greater than \n$183 billion. Medicaid's vulnerability to fraud, waste and abuse have \nalso ranked it on the GAO's list of high-risk programs for the past 2 \nyears.\n  The Medicaid Program continues to pay too much for prescription \ndrugs. CMS estimated that Medicaid expenditures for prescription drugs \nin Calendar Year 2003 totaled more than $31 billion, triple the $9.4 \nbillion spent in 1994. Each year drug companies pay approximately $6 \nbillion in rebates.\n  Today, the GAO released a damning report on Medicaid drug spending. \nCongress established the Medicaid drug rebate program in 1990 to help \ncontrol spending on drugs. Note that the word choice and intent here \nwas control, not out of control. It should come as no surprise that the \nGAO's report shows that the drug program has been and continues to be \nbadly mismanaged.\n  The report--requested by Congressman Waxman and me--identified \nfundamental problems in the program. The mismanagement has been \nbipartisan and has spanned multiple administrations. According to the \nGAO, it is a program virtually without regulation. CMS has been sitting \non draft regulations since 1995 a decade ago.\n  It is also a program virtually without oversight. The GAO found that \nthe Office of Inspector General has issued only four audit reports on \ndrug-company reported prices since the inception of the program. Of \ncourse, the OIG says in its defense that its efforts have been hampered \nby unclear CMS program guidance and a lack of documentation by drug \ncompanies.\n  According to the GAO, even when the OIG has managed to identify \nproblems related to the drug companies' reported prices and \nmethodologies for price reporting, CMS has not done much of anything to \nresolve them.\n  The drug rebate program is governed by a contractual agreement \nbetween the States and each drug company that wants to participate in \nMedicaid. One of the things that boggles the mind is that this contract \nallows drug companies to rely upon reasonable assumptions''\n  Each drug company may craft its own ``assumptions'' as long as they \nare consistent with the ``intent'' of the law. Consequently, because \ndrug companies can pick their own methods, they in effect set their own \nprices and amount of rebates they pay.\n  According to the GAO, ``CMS does not generally review the methods and \nunderlying assumptions that [drug companies] use to determine [the \nreported prices], even though these methods and assumptions can have a \nsubstantial effect on rebates.''\n  Furthermore, quoting the GAO again, ``CMS sometimes identifies price \nreporting errors . . . but does not follow up with [drug companies] to \nverify that errors have been corrected''.\n  In sum, the GAO report confirms that neither CMS nor the OIG know the \nextent to which Medicaid overpays for prescription drugs because the \nprogram lacks effective management and oversight. A worse state of \naffairs is not likely. Drug companies have been profiting for the past \nyears on Medicaid drug pricing. We are dealing with a system that \nunnecessarily costs taxpayers untold hundreds of millions A not \nbillions of dollars annually. The Medicaid drug rebate program is quite \nsimply a mess--a Medicaid mess.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider this GAO report and its \nrecommendations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/07/senate-section/article/S2145-2", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2145-S2146]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       IN MEMORIAM TO FRANK SOUZA\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to honor \nthe memory of one of California's great labor leaders and dedicated \nsocial justice activists, Frank Souza. Frank passed away on February \n19, 2005. He was 79 years old.\n\n[[Page S2146]]\n\n  Frank Souza was born in New Bedford, MA in 1925. In 1948, he and his \nwife Virginia drove across the country to California in search of \nbetter job opportunities. Upon his arrival, he took a job with \nGreyhound as a bus mechanic, and worked there for 13 years. In 1953, \nFrank became involved in the International Association of Machinists \nand Aerospace Workers, AFL-CIO.\n  When I first met Frank many years ago, before I was in elected \noffice, I was struck by his kindness and dedication to working people. \nThat kindness and dedication grew with each passing year. Frank's \ncommitment to social justice earned him the trust and respect of fellow \nlabor activists and allowed him to rise quickly through the ranks at \nthe machinists union. It was not long before Frank was a nationally \nknown leader of the machinists union in northern California. In his \ncapacity as Directing Business Representative of District 190, the \nlargest automotive district of the machinists union in America, Frank \nwas a constant source of pride for both his fellow machinists and the \ncommunity at large.\n  Although Frank retired in 1989 after 25 years with the machinists \nunion, he remained an active union leader, holding impressive positions \nas a machinists union delegate to the National AFL-CIO, vice president \nof the California Labor Federation for the AFL-CIO, chair of the \nWestern States Trucking Committee for the National Auto Transporters, \nchair for the Sea Land West Coast negotiating committee, and treasurer \nfor the California Alliance of Retired Americans.\n  It is not just Frank's accomplishments in the field of labor that \nmade him stand out. Frank was one of the most wonderful people that I \nhave come in contact with in all of my years of public service. His \nwarmth and intelligence were a true inspiration to me. When he talked \nto me about injustice in the workplace, or in the world, his eyes would \ntear up. I knew that I could never let him down.\n  Frank Souza was a deeply loved labor leader who championed the causes \nof America's working families, not only in this country, but throughout \nthe world. We can take comfort in knowing that future generations will \nbenefit from his spirit, his vision, and his leadership. He taught us \nabout the dignity and soul of working people, and in his memory we \nwon't forget.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/07/senate-section/article/S2146-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2146]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ELIZABETH A. ``BETSY'' DUKE\n\n Mr. ALLEN. Elizabeth A. ``Betsy'' Duke was recently chosen to \nbe the chairwoman of the American Bankers Association.\n  The ABA serves as the largest banking trade association in the \ncountry, representing most community banks, as well as virtually all \nlarge banks of our Nation. She will oversee the day-to-day leadership \nof the ABA, and all of its 330 employees.\n  Ms. Duke's one-year term marks the first time that a woman has held \nthis highly visible position, as well as the first since 1951 that the \npost has been held by a Virginian.\n  I am confident that Betsy Duke's extensive background in the banking \nindustry, including serving as former director of the Federal Reserve \nBank of Richmond and former president of the Virginia Bankers \nAssociation has prepared her well for this new and challenging \nleadership role.\n  After graduating from the University of North Carolina in 1974 with a \ndegree in drama, Betsy moved back to her native Virginia Beach and \nfound an acting job in a dinner theater. In order to support her dream \nof becoming an actress, Betsy went looking for a day job. After being \nturned down by a local dry cleaner, she finally found work as a part-\ntime drive-up bank teller.\n  The theatrical show in which Betsy was participating in ended about a \nyear later, but by then she had come to a couple of conclusions: that \nher dream of becoming a great actress would never materialize, and that \nshe really enjoyed her job as a teller. Betsy was soon able to secure a \nnew-accounts job at Bank of Virginia Beach, which changed her life in \nmore ways than one. It was there that she met her mentor, Burt \nHarrison, who served as the bank's CEO, and a young operations officer \nand her future husband, Larry Harcum.\n  As Betsy began taking on more responsibility, she began taking \nbanking courses and was named the bank's accounting officer, but things \nbecame complicated when she began dating Larry. The bank had a strict \npolicy regarding this activity, so after a few months, Betsy left the \nbank to go work at a local car dealership, but was asked to return a \nfew months later by her mentor and bank CEO, Burt Harrison. The very \nnext day, however, Larry quit. Burt quickly caught on, but allowed the \ntwo to stay under the condition that they keep their budding romance \nquiet. About a year later, the two married, but not after receiving the \nboard's approval for the two of them to be able to keep their jobs at \nthe bank. One of the directors actually got confused and thought he was \nvoting on whether or not the two should get married, and voted no.\n  Betsy's friend, mentor, and boss Burt died suddenly of a heart attack \nin 1991, and Betsy, who by then had been named president, suddenly \nfound herself thrust into the role of CEO. She and Larry ran the bank \nsuccessfully for another 10 years until what was now referred to as the \nBank of Tidewater was acquired by SouthTrust in 2001. Betsy served as \nexecutive vice president for community bank development at SouthTrust.\n  It was around this time that Betsy Duke became vice-chairman of ABA. \nPrior to this, she had served as a member of ABA's board of directors. \nThe following year, she was named chairwoman of the ABA.\n  Betsy Duke is currently executive vice president, Merger Project \nTeam, Wachovia Bank in Virginia Beach. As I previously mentioned, she \nwas executive vice president for Community Bank Development at \nSouthTrust, but upon the bank's merger with Wachovia, she transferred \nto the merger integration team.\n  Beyond her current role as chairman of ABA, her involvement with the \norganization spans two decades. She began as an instructor for ABA's \nNational School of Bank Investments and has continued in this role to \nthis day. In addition, she has been a member of the trade group's \nCommunity Bankers Council, Communication Council, and Grassroots Task \nForce. Finally she has led the ABA's Government Relations Task Force, \nand served on its board of directors.\n  In addition to her bachelor's degree in fine arts from the University \nof North Carolina, she has a master's degree in business administration \nfrom Old Dominion University.\n  Betsy Duke loves banking. She truly believes that the industry is one \nof the most important in this country. Betsy believes that no other \nassociation comes close to serving the banking industry as does the \nABA. I am pleased that Betsy Duke is heading up this great group, not \njust because she is a Virginian, but because she brings the real life \nexperience needed to continue the successful tradition of the ABA. \nCongratulations Betsy, you have made your friends, family, and Virginia \nproud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/07/senate-section/article/S2146-2", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2146-S2147]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING MICHAEL CREASEY\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today I honor Michael Creasey for \nhis work as the Executive Director of the John H. Chafee Blackstone \nRiver Valley National Heritage Corridor. For the last 10 years, Michael \nhas been a driving force in the Blackstone Valley, completing projects, \nbuilding advocacy and partnerships, and instilling pride in the people \nwho live beside this historic river.\n  Michael has devoted his career to public service and national park \nstewardship since 1986. After honing his skills in Utah and New Mexico, \nhe was assigned to the Blackstone Corridor in 1995 as Deputy Director \nand became the Executive Director in 1999. What a gift he has been! His \nboundless energy and devotion to the Blackstone Corridor, and his skill \nin working with the Corridor Commission and its large group of \nstakeholders, have spawned a revitalization that includes the creation \nof new jobs, the preservation and enhancement of historic sites, and \nthe restoration of valuable wildlife habitat.\n  In April 2000, shortly after I came to the Senate, Michael took me on \na tour of the Valley to point out some of the Federal and private \nsector investments that had been made in the Heritage Corridor. I could \nnot help but be impressed with his energy and passion as we viewed the \nBlackstone River Bikeway--or Riverway, as he has dubbed\n\n[[Page S2147]]\n\nit--along with renovated mills, a canoe and boat landing, and parks \nthat have been developed since the authorization of the Blackstone \nHeritage Corridor in 1986. The progress I observed that day was a \nresult of collaboration among the residents of the Valley, State \nagencies and the Federal Government, and is proof that industrial \nrivers like the Blackstone can be saved if we all work together.\n  Above all else, Michael is a ``river guy'' who understands the \nsignificance of the ``power of place'' and the potential of people to \nshape their communities. In a recent news article announcing his \nappointment as superintendent of the Lowell National Historical Park, \nhe states, ``It's been a great honor to serve the Corridor Commission \nfor nearly a decade. I have always been impressed with the passion, \ncreative ideas and commitment that the people have had for achieving \nthe Heritage Corridor vision.''\n  The Blackstone River Valley Heritage Corridor is a unique institution \nthat has brought together many divergent groups and raised the national \nprofile of this very special region. I thank Michael for his years of \nservice to this historic slice of Massachusetts and Rhode Island, and I \nalso wish him luck in his new endeavors in Lowell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/07/senate-section/article/S2147-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2147]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DR. ADRIAN ROGERS\n\n Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, some say we are living in the \npost-Christian era, but you would not have known it yesterday if you \nwere among the 13,829 worshippers, as I was, at the retirement tribute \nto pastor Adrian Rogers at Bellevue Baptist Church in Memphis. I am a \nPresbyterian--but Presbyterian or Baptist, believer or nonbeliever, one \ncould not help but be inspired by the services on Sunday and especially \nby Dr. Rogers himself.\n  Adrian Rogers is one of America's best-known preachers. His ``Love \nWorth Finding Ministries'' is broadcast in more than 150 counties in \nboth English and Spanish. He has authored 17 books, 48 booklets and 78 \ncassette tapes. He has been elected three times to lead the Southern \nBaptist Convention.\n  Dr. Rogers came to Bellevue in Memphis in 1972 when the Church was in \nMidtown, the enrollment was 9000 and the annual budget was $625,000. \nToday the church spreads across 375 acres in Cordova, the enrollment is \n29,000 and the budget is $21 million.\n  What impresses me most is not this growth but the man himself. Like \nhis friend Billy Graham, Adrian Rogers has not allowed his fame to \ndiminish him personally. The most moving statements yesterday came from \nhis children who testified that this man who everyone knows can talk \nthe talk always walks the walk at home. Those who know him best say \nthat he practices what he preaches. When he told his congregation, ``I \nam what I am by the grace of God,'' it was not mock humility.\n  There was much love expressed yesterday for Joyce Rogers, who Adrian \nsaid ``is the only girl that I have ever dated.'' She has sung in the \nchoir, taught Sunday school and been his partner since their marriage \nin 1951.\n  Our founders made sure that we do not have a state church but that we \ndo have freedom of religion. As a result of this constitutional \nguarantee, there is a church of some denomination on almost every \nAmerican corner. This freedom has also proved to be a nurturing \nenvironment for independent leaders such as Adrian Rogers whose good \nlives attract us and inspire us and lead us to be among the world's \nmost religious people.\n  No mortal is perfect. I know of one blemish on my friend Adrian \nRogers: He is a Florida Gators fan. In the spirit of yesterday, the \nChristian thing to do is to forgive him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/07/senate-section/article/S2147-2", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2147]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING JOHN ``RED'' BOURG\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life of \nMr. John ``Red'' Bourg, who passed away last October. Red Bourg served \nhis family, his State and his country well, and deserves the \nrecognition of this body.\n  Red was a devout Christian, and he made a wonderful home in Baton \nRouge with his wife Mildred and their two children, Brenda and Ronnie. \nRed loved and cared for the people of the State of Louisiana and the \nUnited States, and worked to improve their quality of life until the \nday he died.\n  In addition to being a great family man, Red Bourg served our country \nin peace and in war. As a young man, he joined the United States Marine \nCorps and fought in the Korean War, serving with honor and distinction. \nYears after returning, Red was selected to become the Louisiana State \nCommander of the Marine Corps League, an impressive honor, for an \nequally impressive person.\n  However, Red was best known for his work with the Louisiana AFL-CIO. \nHe worked his way up the union ladder, beginning as a member of the \nLocal 995 International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, and climbing \nall the way to become the president of the Louisiana AFL-CIO. Red \njoined the staff at the AFL-CIO in 1967, becoming the assistant to the \npresident and in 1997, some 30 years later, he became President of that \ngreat organization. I think that says a lot about the hard work and \ndetermination of the man.\n  I once again honor my friend, Mr. John ``Red'' Bourg, for his efforts \non Louisiana's behalf. I knew Red my entire adult life and can attest \nthat he is truly missed. I know I speak for many others when I say that \nRed Bourg will always be fondly remembered for the outstanding service \nhe has rendered to his State and his Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/07/senate-section/article/S2147-3", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2147]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HONORING SIBAL HOLT\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \nservice of Sibal Holt, who is the first female and the first African \nAmerican to serve as the President of the Louisiana AFL-CIO. Firsts \nlike these have become commonplace for this barrier-breaking woman.\n  She has long been a trailblazer in the State of Louisiana. She became \nthe first African American to be hired into the Bell System and also \nthe first registered lobbyist in the State of Louisiana, both \nremarkable achievements given the climate of the times.\n  Sibal Holt has been a selfless steward of her community. She formerly \nserved as the president of the Louisiana American Red Cross, as well as \nother charitable organizations, such as Volunteer Baton Rouge and the \nBaton Rouge Women's Resource Center. Sibal is probably most recognized \nfor her pioneering efforts in voter registration. Holt once led a \nstatewide voter registration drive, resulting in an astounding 70,000 \nnew voters for Louisiana.\n  But it is the AFL-CIO where she has left her biggest imprint. Sibal \nbegan her work at the AFL-CIO in 1975, not surprisingly becoming the \nfirst minority selected to join the Executive Board of any State's AFL-\nCIO. Twenty-two years later, in 1997, she became the union's Secretary/\nTreasurer, serving in that capacity until she was elected president of \nthe Louisiana AFL-CIO in November 2004, replacing John ``Red'' Bourg \nafter his untimely death.\n  I once again congratulate my friend, Sibal Holt, for her \ngroundbreaking accomplishments on behalf of the working class in the \nState of Louisiana. It is people such as Sibal that continue to make \nLouisiana such a dynamic State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/07/senate-section/article/S2147-4", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2147]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME\n\n  The following bill was read the first time:\n\n       S. 539.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal \nthe percentage depletion allowance for certain hard rock mines, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing legislation to \neliminate from the Federal tax code percentage depletion allowances for \nhardrock minerals mined on Federal public lands. I thank Senator \nCantwell for joining me as a cosponsor on this legislation.\n  President Clinton proposed the elimination of the percentage \ndepletion allowance on public lands in his fiscal year 2001 budget. \nPresident Clinton's fiscal year 2001 budget estimated that, under this \nlegislation, income to the Federal treasury from the elimination of \npercentage depletion allowances for hardrock mining on public lands \nwould total $487 million over 5 years and $1.20 billion over 10 years. \nThe Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that it would save $410 \nmillion over 5 years and $823 million over 10 years. Percentage \ndepletion allowances are contained in the tax code for extracted fuel, \nminerals, metal and other mined commodities. These allowances have a \ncombined value, according to estimates by the Joint Committee on \nTaxation, of $4.8 billion.\n  These percentage depletion allowances were initiated by the \nCorporation Excise Act of 1909. That's right, these allowances were \ninitiated nearly one hundred years ago. Provisions for a depletion \nallowance based on the value of the mine were made under a 1912 \nTreasury Department regulation, but difficulty in applying this \naccounting principle to mineral production led to the initial \ncodification of the mineral depletion allowance in the Tariff Act of \n1913. The Revenue Act of 1926 established percentage depletion much in \nits present form for oil and gas. The percentage depletion allowance \nwas then extended to metal mines, coal, and other hardrock minerals by \nthe Revenue Act of 1932, and has been adjusted several times since.\n  Percentage depletion allowances were historically placed in the tax \ncode to reduce the effective tax rates in the mineral and extraction \nindustries far below tax rates on other industries, providing \nincentives to increase investment, exploration and output. Percentage \ndepletion also makes it possible, however, to recover many times the \namount of the original investment.\n  There are two methods of calculating a deduction to allow a firm to \nrecover the costs of its capital investment: cost depletion and \npercentage depletion. Cost depletion allows for the recovery of the \nactual capital investment--the costs of discovering, purchasing, and \ndeveloping a mineral reserve--over the period during which the reserve \nproduces income. Under the cost depletion method, the total deductions \ncannot exceed the original capital investment.\n  Under percentage depletion, however, the deduction for recovery of a \ncompany's investment is a fixed percentage of ``gross income,'' namely, \nsales revenue from the sale of the mineral. Under this method, total \ndeductions typically exceed the capital that the company invested.\n  The rates for percentage depletion are quite significant. Section 613 \nof the\n\n[[Page S2150]]\n\nU.S. Code contains depletion allowances for more than 70 metals and \nminerals, at rates ranging from 10 to 22 percent.\n  In addition to repealing the percentage depletion allowances for \nminerals mined on public lands, my bill would also create a new fund, \ncalled the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund. One-fourth of the revenue \nraised by the bill, or approximately $120 million, would be deposited \ninto an interest-bearing fund in the Treasury to be used to clean up \nabandoned hardrock mines in States that are subject to the 1872 Mining \nLaw. The Mineral Policy Center estimates that there are 557,650 \nabandoned hardrock mine sites nationwide and the cost of clearing them \nup will range from $32.7 billion to $71.5 billion.\n  There are currently no comprehensive Federal or State programs to \naddress the need to clean up old mine sites. Reclaiming these sites \nrequires the enactment of a program with explicit authority to clean up \nabandoned mine sites and the resources to do it. My legislation is a \nfirst step toward providing the needed authority and resources.\n  In today's budget climate, we are faced with the question of who \nshould bear the costs of exploration, development, and production of \nnatural resources: all taxpayers, or the users and producers of the \nresource? For more than a century, the mining industry has been paying \nnext to nothing for the privilege of extracting minerals from public \nlands and then abandoning its mines. Now those mines are adding to the \nNation's environmental and financial burdens. We face serious budget \nchoices this fiscal year, and one of those choices is whether to \ncontinue the special tax breaks provided to the mining industry.\n  The measure I am introducing is straightforward. It eliminates the \npercentage depletion allowance for hardrock minerals mined on public \nlands while continuing to allow companies to recover reasonable cost \ndepletion.\n  Though at one time there may have been an appropriate role for a \ngovernment-driven incentive for enhanced mineral production, there is \nnow sufficient reason to adopt a more reasonable depletion allowance \nthat is consistent with depreciation rates given to other businesses. \nThis corporate subsidy is simply not justified.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 534\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Elimination of Double \n     Subsidies for the Hardrock Mining Industry Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to establish grant programs for the development of \ntelecommunications capacities in Indian country; to the Committee on \nIndian Affairs.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Native \nAmerican Connectivity Act. Senator Cantwell joins me in sponsoring this \nmeasure.\n  Over 70 years ago, we passed the Communications Act of 1934 and \ncommitted ``to make available . . . to all the people of the United \nStates . . . a rapid, efficient, Nationwide, and world-wide wire and \nradio communication service with adequate facilities at reasonable \ncharges. . . .'' It is now 2005, and the Federal Government has yet to \nfulfill this commitment in Indian country.\n  Relying on 2000 Census data, the Federal Communications Commission, \nFCC, estimates that, on average, only 67.9 percent of Indian households \nlocated on Indian reservations have telephone service compared to a \nnational average of 95 percent. Even more alarming is that household \ntelephone rates for some tribes, such as the Kickapoo Reservation in \nTexas and the Navajo Nation, are as low as 33 percent and 38 percent, \nrespectively. Available data also shows that many Native Americans lack \naccess not only to basic telephone service but also to advanced \ntelecommunications services and information technology.\n  As a result, many Native Americans lack access to emergency 911 \nservices, are unable to secure employment because they do not have \ntelephone service or Internet, and cannot otherwise participate in many \ndaily activities that non-Native Americans take for granted. Moreover, \nthe lack of telecommunications infrastructure impedes the economic \ndevelopment of tribal communities, educational opportunities, language \nretention and preservation, and access to adequate health care.\n\n[[Page S2151]]\n\n  Tribal governments and their citizens must have access to the \nnecessary resources to develop their telecommunications capacities. A \nrecent report by the Harvard Project on American Indian Economic \nDevelopment credited tribal self-governance for improvements in \nsocioeconomic growth at rates that far exceed progress being made \nnationally. This bill will provide the resources necessary to enhance \nand strengthen tribal self-determination to address telecommunications \nneeds. As a result, tribal governments should be able to make further \ngains in socioeconomic conditions.\n  I urge my colleagues to give their favorable consideration to this \nmeasure.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 535\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Native American Connectivity \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1)(A) disparities exist in the areas of education, health \n     care, workforce training, commerce, and economic activity of \n     Indians due to the rural nature of most Indian reservations; \n     and\n       (B) access to basic and advanced telecommunications \n     infrastructure is critical in eliminating those disparities;\n       (2) currently, only 67.9 percent of Indian homes have \n     telephone service, compared with the national average of 95.1 \n     percent;\n       (3) the telephone service penetration rate on some \n     reservations is as low as 39 percent;\n       (4) even on reservations and trust land, non-Indian homes \n     are more likely to have telephone service than Indian homes;\n       (5) only 10 percent of Indian households on tribal land \n     have Internet access;\n       (6) only 17 percent of Indian tribes have developed \n     comprehensive technology plans;\n       (7) training and technical assistance have been identified \n     as the most significant needs for the development and \n     effective use of telecommunications and information \n     technology in Indian country;\n       (8) funding for telecommunications and information \n     technology projects in Indian country remains inadequate to \n     address the needs of Indian communities;\n       (9) many Indian tribes are located on or adjacent to Indian \n     land in which unemployment rates exceed 50 percent;\n       (10) the lack of telecommunications infrastructure and low \n     telephone and Internet penetration rates adversely affects \n     the ability of Indian tribes to pursue economic development \n     opportunities; and\n       (11) primary, secondary, and postsecondary education, job \n     training, health care, disease prevention education, and \n     cultural preservation are greatly enhanced with access to and \n     use of telecommunications technology and electronic \n     information.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to promote affordable and universal access among Indian \n     tribal governments, tribal entities, reservation-based \n     schools, tribal colleges and universities, and Indian \n     households to telecommunications and information technology \n     in Indian country;\n       (2) to encourage and promote tribal economic development, \n     self-sufficiency, and strong tribal governments;\n       (3) to enhance the health of Indian tribal members through \n     the availability and use of telemedicine and telehealth;\n       (4) to improve the quality of kindergarten, primary, \n     secondary, postsecondary, and job-related training, through \n     enhanced and sustained information technology infrastructure; \n     and\n       (5) to assist in the retention and preservation of native \n     languages and cultural traditions.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Native \nAmerican Omnibus Act of 2005 to amend a variety of Federal statutes \naffecting Indian tribes and Indian people. This Act contains nineteen \nprovisions, including technical amendments to several laws, extensions \nof expiring authorizations, and provisions relating to particular \nIndian tribes, and certain Native American programs.\n  Section 101, amends the Indian finance act of 1974 to clarify that \nnon-profit tribal entities are eligible for the BIA Loan Guaranty \nprogram. It also raises the limit on the amount of loans to $1.5 \nbillion from $500 million.\n  Section 102 extends the authorization for the Indian Tribal Justice \nTechnical and Legal Assistance Act to through fiscal year 2010.\n  Section 103 extends the Indian Tribal Justice Act for three more \nyears.\n  Section 104 cures a problem specific to New Mexico and the 1924 \nIndian Pueblo Lands Act. Recently, the New Mexico State Court of \nAppeals ruled that a change from Indian to non-Indian title for a \nparcel of land within a Pueblo land grant area eliminated that parcel's \nstatus as ``Indian Country.'' This ruling created a jurisdictional void \nfor criminal acts occurring on\n\n[[Page S2153]]\n\nland within the original Pueblo land grant once its' title has changed. \nConsistent with existing law, this amendment clarifies that the state \nmaintains jurisdiction over non-Indians, the tribe has jurisdiction \nover Indians and its members, and the federal government has \njurisdiction pursuant to the Major Crimes Act. This amendment does not \nexpand Indian civil jurisdiction and only applies to criminal \njurisdiction. I understand that it is uniformly support by all affected \nparties.\n  Section 105, conveys approximately 1290 acres of the Lock and Dam #3 \nlands to the Prairie Island Tribe. The provision prohibits gaming or \nstructures for human habitation on the conveyed lands.\n  Section 106 is a technical amendment to allow binding arbitration in \nall contracts and not just leases on the Gila River Indian Community \nreservation.\n  Section 107 conveys several parcels of land in the State of \nWashington to be held in trust for Puyallup Indian Tribes.\n  Section 108 amends Native American graves Protection and Repatriation \nAct by clarifying that the term ``Native American'' refers to a member \nof a tribe, a people, or a culture that is or was indigenous to the \nUnited States.\n  Section 109, the amends the Fallon Paiute Shoshone Tribe's water \nrights settlement act to permit the expenditure of six percent of the \naverage market value of the Fund over three years.\n  Section 110, the Washoe Tribes Lake Tahoe Access Act, corrects the \n1990 settlement and includes 24.3 acres of land near Lake Tahoe for the \nTribes. The amendment does not affect the number of acres conveyed to \nthe Tribe in the original settlement.\n  Section 111 amends the Indian Arts and Crafts Act. A major source of \ntribal and individual income comes from the sale of handmade Indian \narts and crafts, but millions of dollars are diverted each year from \nthese artists and tribes by those who reproduce and sell counterfeit \nIndian goods. Enforcing the criminal law that prohibits the sale of \nIndian arts and crafts misrepresented as an Indian product is often \nstalled by the other responsibilities of the FBI including \ninvestigating terrorism activity and violent crimes on Indian lands. \nThis amendment supplements the existing federal investigative authority \nby authorizing other federal investigative bodies, such as the BIA, in \naddition to the FBI, to investigate these offenses.\n  Section 112, the Colorado River Indian Reservation Boundary \nCorrection Act, corrects the south boundary of the Reservation by \nreestablishing the boundary as it was delineated in the original \nsurvey.\n  Section 113, reauthorizes the Native American Programs Act of 1974 \nand establishes the Inter-Departmental Council of Native American \nAffairs.\n  Section 114 amends the Native Hawaiian Education Act to include \nresearch and education activities relating to Native Hawaiian law.\n  Section 121 amends the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Act to include the \nregistration of Indian students in the Spring semester.\n  Section 122, the Native Nations Leadership, Management and Policy Act \nof 2005 authorizes funding for leadership training, strategic and \norganizational development, and research and policy analysis to assist \nAmerican Indian nations to achieve effective self-governance and \nsustainable economic development. This provision renews authorized \nfunding for NNI's programs for a period of 10 years, beginning in \nfiscal year 2007. Dedicated funding for NNI is necessary to ensure the \ncontinuation of these important programs without further draining funds \nfrom the Udall Foundation's other educational activities.\n  Section 132 authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security, to \nestablish a pilot program to enhance an Indian tribe's response to \nborder activity. Some Indian tribes that inhabit land on or easily \naccessible to the United States and Canada or Mexico, bear \nextraordinary costs in responding to illegal immigration crossing and \ndrug smuggling and almost always divert funds intended for local \nservices to do so. While Federal and State law enforcement resources \nmay supplement tribal efforts, tribal police, fire and emergency \nservices provide the first and often only response because of their \naccess to the border. A tribe's proximity to the border and its \nresponsibility to the community for public safety and welfare, requires \nthat they respond. This program would enhance tribal first responder \ncapabilities, provide assistance for aerial and ground surveillance \ntechnologies, and communication capabilities, and facilitate \ncoordination and cooperation with Federal, State, local and tribal \ngovernments in protecting the border. The Secretary may establish the \nselection criteria for participation in the program including the \ntribes' proximity to the border and the extent to which border crossing \nactivity impacts existing tribal resources.\n  Section 201, Authorization of 99 year leases, amends Title 25 USC \nSection 415 providing for leases of restricted lands by adding several \nadditional tribes to the list of tribes that have requested 99-year \nlease authority.\n  Section 202, Certification of rental proceeds, amends Title 25 USC \nSection 488 to permit actual rental proceeds from a lease to constitute \nthe rental value of that land, and to satisfy the requirement for \nappraisal of that land.\n  Section 211, will permit the Navajo Nation's Sage Memorial Hospital \nto be considered a tribal contractor under the Indian Self-\nDetermination Act, which will allow the hospital to obtain the benefits \nof coverage under the Federal Tort Claims Act and secure VA drug \ndiscounts.\n  Section 221, amends the American Indian Probate Reform Act of 2004 by \ncorrecting provisions relating to non-testamentary disposition, \npartition of highly fractionated Indian land, and Tribal probate codes.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to enact this important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord as follows:\n\n                                 S. 536\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to increase the number of well-trained mental health \nservice professionals (including those based in schools) providing \nclinical mental health care to children and adolescents, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the landmark report Mental Health: A \nReport of the Surgeon General brought the hidden mental health crisis \nto the attention of the U.S. public. According to that report, 13.7 \nmillion of the Nation's children and adolescents, twenty percent, have \na diagnosable mental disorder, the most common of which include Anxiety \nDisorder, Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and \nDepression. Unfortunately, only one out of five of those in need will \nreceive mental health care. One of the primary reasons for this across \nthe Nation is that mental health services to help treat children are in \nshort supply. Long waiting lists for children seeking care, even those \nin crisis, are not uncommon. In New Mexico, it's estimated that 56,000 \nchildren and adolescents have a mental or emotional disorder. Of these, \nalmost 20,000 have serious emotional disorders. As of June 2003, there \nwere only 13 licensed child and adolescent psychiatrists to serve the \nentire State of New Mexico. In addition, there are fewer trained \npsychologists and social workers per 100,000 population in New Mexico \nthan the country as a whole. Children with untreated mental disorders \nare at a higher risk for school failure and dropping out, violence, \ndrug abuse, suicide, and criminal activity. A 2002 report documented \nthat approximately one in seven youth in New Mexico detention centers \nincarcerated because mental health care is not available. From January \nto December 2001, 718 New Mexico youth were collectively incarcerated \nfor 31.3 years just to wait for a mental health treatment opening. \nClearly, something needs to be done to address this growing shortage of \nthese important health professionals.\n  The Surgeon General states that there is a dearth of child \npsychiatrists, appropriately trained clinical child psychologists, or \nsocial workers. Nationwide, 3,543 urban, suburban, and rural localities \nhave been designated Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas by the \nFederal Government due to their severe lack of psychiatrists, \npsychologists, social workers and other professionals to serve children \nand adults. According to the U.S. Bureau of Health Professions, the \ndemand for the services of child and adolescent psychiatrists is \nprojected to increase by 100 percent by 2020, while the number of these \nprofessionals is expected to increase by only 30 percent resulting in a \nshortage of over 4,000 child and adolescent psychiatrists by that year. \nThe National Center for Education Statistics within the U.S. Department \nof Education reports that the national average student-to-school \ncounselor ratio in U.S. schools is 513:1, more than double the \nrecommended ratio of 250:1.\n  In the United States, there are approximately 7,000 child and \nadolescent psychiatrists and only 300 new child and adolescent \npsychiatrists are trained each year. In 2000, the Bureau of Health \nProfessions projected that between 1995 and 2020, the use of child and \nadolescent psychiatrists will increase by 100 percent.\n  While the Nation as a whole is experiencing a shortage of mental \nhealth professionals, the problem is most acute in the rural areas. In \nNM for example, 4/5 of the psychiatrists in NM are located in \nBernalillo and Santa Fe Counties. This area is also home to 70 percent \nof the psychologists, 53 percent of counselors and 47 percent of the \nsocial workers--leaving the rest of the State at a severe disadvantage.\n  It is in response to the mental health workforce crisis that I rise \nwith my colleagues Senator Collins of Maine, Senator Harkin of Iowa, \nSenator Dodd of Connecticut, Senator Kennedy from Massachusetts, \nSenator Reed from Rhode Island and Senator Sarbanes of Maryland, to \noffer The Child Healthcare Crisis Relief Act. This bill creates \nincentives to help recruit and retain child mental health professionals \nproviding direct clinical care, and to improve, expand, or help create \nprograms to train child mental health professionals. It provides loan \nrepayment and scholarships for child mental health and school-based \nservice professionals as well as internships and field placements in \nchild mental health services and training for paraprofessionals who \nwork in children's mental health clinical settings. This bill also \nprovides grants to graduate schools to help develop and expand child \nand adolescent mental health programs. It allows for an increase in the \nnumber of Child and Adolescent Psychiatrists permitted under the \nMedicare Graduate Medical Education Program and, extends the Board \nEligibility period for residents and fellows from four years to six \nyears.\n  Finally, this bill asks the Secretary to prepare a report on the \ndistribution and need for child mental health and school-based \nprofessionals with respect to specialty certifications, practice \ncharacteristics, professional licensure, practice types, locations, \neducation, and training, broken down by State so that we may better \ncomprehend the mental health workforce needs that are facing our \nNation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 537\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Child Health Care Crisis \n     Relief Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Center for Mental Health Services estimates that 20 \n     percent or 13,700,000 of the Nation's children and \n     adolescents have a diagnosable mental health disorder, and \n     about \\2/3\\ of these children and adolescents do not receive \n     mental health care.\n       (2) According to ``Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon \n     General'' in 1999, there are approximately 6,000,000 to \n     9,000,000 children and adolescents in the United States \n     (accounting for 9 to 13 percent of all children and \n     adolescents in the United States) who meet the definition for \n     having a serious emotional disturbance.\n       (3) According to the Center for Mental Health Services, \n     approximately 5 to 9 percent of children and adolescents in \n     the United States meet the definition for extreme functional \n     impairment.\n       (4) According to the Surgeon General's Report, there are \n     particularly acute shortages in the numbers of mental health \n     service professionals serving children and adolescents with \n     serious emotional disorders.\n       (5) According to the National Center for Education \n     Statistics in the Department of Education, there are \n     approximately 513 students for each school counselor in \n     United States schools, which ratio is more than double the \n     recommended ratio of 250 students for each school counselor.\n       (6) According to a year 2000 estimate of the Bureau of \n     Health Professions, the demand for the services of child and \n     adolescent psychiatry is projected to increase by 100 percent \n     by 2020.\n       (7) The development and application of knowledge about the \n     impact of disasters on children, adolescents, and their \n     families has been impeded by critical shortages of qualified \n     researchers and practitioners specializing in this work.\n       (8) According to the Bureau of the Census, the population \n     of children and adolescents in the United States under the \n     age of 18 is projected to grow by more than 40 percent, from \n     70,000,000 to more than 100,000,000 by 2050.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to educate health professionals concerning substance \nuse disorders and addiction; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n\n[[Page S2162]]\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \naddress the problem of substance abuse in our country.\n  The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation has called substance abuse \nAmerica's No. 1 health problem. I don't think that overstates it.\n  Most of us knows someone--a family member, maybe a neighbor, a \ncolleague, or a friend--who is addicted to drugs or alcohol. In fact, \nnearly 15 million people in this country abuse alcohol or are \nalcoholics. More than 19 million use drugs, and an estimated 4 million \nare in need of treatment but not receiving it.\n  Drug and alcohol abuse has far-reaching consequences. It exacerbates \nsocial ills. It is a public safety problem. It is a public health \nproblem. It is a public expenditure problem. There is an undeniable \ncorrelation between substance abuse and crime. Eighty percent of the 2 \nmillion men and women behind bars today have a history of drug and \nalcohol abuse or addiction or were arrested for a drug-related crime. \nIllegal drugs are responsible for thousands of deaths each year. They \nfuel the spread of AIDS and hepatitis C. They contribute to child \nabuse, domestic violence, and sexual assault. And we all pay the price.\n  It costs this Nation almost $275 billion in law enforcement, criminal \njustice expenses, medical bills, and lost earnings each year. That \nmeans that preventing and treating substance abuse makes sense. It \nmakes good criminal justice sense. It makes public health sense. It \nmakes budgetary sense. Not to mention the fact that it is the right \nthing to do.\n  Yet there remains a reluctance to recognize substance abuse as a \nhealth issue. There is a reluctance to accept addiction as a disease. \nIt is a reluctance that has kept public policy from asserting that \naddicts should be in treatment. Whether addicts are in prison or out, \nit seems to me, treatment is the only legitimate choice.\n  But it is not only about increasing access to treatment. It is also \nabout moving treatment into the medical mainstream. Unless family \ndoctors, nurses, physician assistants, and social workers can identify \naddiction when they see it, unless they know how to intervene, we will \nnever make any real progress.\n  That aspect of the challenge came into sharp focus for me when I read \na report a few years ago by the National Center on Addiction and \nSubstance Abuse at Columbia University, CASA.\n  That report said that fewer than 1 percent of doctors presented with \nthe classic profile of an alcoholic older woman could diagnose it \nproperly. Eighty-two percent misdiagnosed it as depression, some \ntreatments for which are dangerous when taken with alcohol. A follow-up \nstudy showed that 94 percent of primary care physicians fail to \ndiagnose substance abuse when presented with the classic symptoms, and \n41 percent of pediatricians fail to diagnose illegal drug use in \nteenage patients.\n  No one recognizes this problem better than the doctors themselves. \nFewer than one in five--only 19 percent--feel confident about \ndiagnosing alcoholism. And only 17 percent feel qualified to identify \nillegal drug use. Having said that, even if they diagnose it, most \ndoctors don't believe that treatment works.\n  Among practitioners, as well as policymakers, we need to get the \nmessage out loud and clear: Addiction is a chronic relapsing disease, \nand as with other such diseases, while there may not be a cure, medical \ntreatment can help control it.\n  The medical professionals have to be educated to recognize the signs \nof substance abuse and to pursue the effective therapies that are \navailable. That is why I am introducing legislation to help train \nmedical professionals to prevent and recognize addiction and refer \npatients to treatment if they need it. Representative Patrick Kennedy \nwill introduce companion legislation in the House of Representatives.\n  Like treatment, training works. According to a study published in the \nBrown University Digest of Addiction Theory and Application, 91 percent \nof health professionals who took part in training on addiction at \nBoston University were using the techniques they learned 1 to 5 years \nlater.\n  Every family doctor does not need to be an addiction specialist, but \nthey do need to be able to recognize the signs. And they need to know \nwhat help is available.\n  My legislation does the following three things: authorizes $9 million \nin grants to train medical generalists to recognize substance abuse in \ntheir patients and their families and know how to properly refer them \nfor treatment; authorizes $6 million to fund substance abuse faculty \nfellows at educational institutions to teach courses on substance \nabuse, incorporate substance abuse issues into to required courses at \nthe institution, and educate health professionals about issues related \nto non-therapeutic uses of prescription medications; and establishes \ncenters of excellence at medical centers or universities across the \nUnited States to (1) initiate, promote and implement training, research \nand clinical activities related to special areas of substance abuse and \n(2) provide opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration in \ncurriculum development, clinical practice, research and policy \nanalysis. The bill authorizes $6 million for this purpose.\n  These are additional steps--and, in my view, crucial ones to help \nbridge the divide between research and practice. They will help chip \naway at the incredible substance abuse-related costs we face each year \nin human as well as monetary terms.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me to support this important \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 538\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Health Professionals \n     Substance Abuse Education Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Illegal drugs and alcohol are responsible for thousands \n     of deaths each year, and they fuel the spread of a number of \n     communicable diseases, including AIDS and Hepatitis C, as \n     well as some of the worst social problems in the United \n     States, including child abuse, domestic violence, and sexual \n     assault.\n       (2) There are an estimated 19,500,000 current drug users in \n     America, nearly 4,000,000 of whom are addicts. An estimated \n     14,800,000 Americans abuse alcohol or are alcoholic.\n       (3) There are nearly 27,000,000 children of alcoholics in \n     America, almost 11,000,000 of whom are under 18 years of age. \n     Countless other children are affected by substance abusing \n     parents or other caretakers. Health professionals are \n     uniquely positioned to help reduce or prevent alcohol and \n     other drug-related impairment by identifying affected \n     families and youth and by providing early intervention.\n       (5) Drug addiction is a chronic relapsing disease. As with \n     other chronic relapsing diseases (such as diabetes, \n     hypertension and asthma), there is no cure, although a number \n     of treatments can effectively control the disease. According \n     to an article published in the Journal of the American \n     Medical Association, treatment for addiction works as well as \n     treatment for other chronic relapsing diseases.\n       (6) Drug treatment is cost effective, even when compared \n     with residential treatment, the most expensive type of \n     treatment. Residential treatment for cocaine addiction costs \n     between $15,000 and $20,000 a year, a substantial savings \n     compared to incarceration (costing nearly $40,000 a year), or \n     untreated addiction (costing more than $43,000 a year). Also, \n     in 1998, substance abuse and addiction accounted for \n     approximately $10,000,000,000 in Federal, State, and local \n     government spending simply to maintain the child welfare \n     system. The economic costs associated with fetal alcohol \n     syndrome were estimated at $54,000,000,000 in 2003.\n       (7) Many doctors and other health professionals are \n     unprepared to recognize substance abuse in their patients or \n     their families and intervene in an appropriate manner. Only \n     56 percent of residency programs have a required curriculum \n     in preventing or treating substance abuse.\n       (8) Fewer than 1 in 5 doctors (only 19 percent) feel \n     confident about diagnosing alcoholism, and only 17 percent \n     feel qualified to identify illegal drug use.\n       (9) Most doctors who are in a position to make a diagnosis \n     of alcoholism or drug addiction do not believe that treatment \n     works (less than 4 percent for alcoholism and only 2 percent \n     for drugs).\n       (10) According to a survey by the National Center on \n     Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University \n     (referred to in this section as ``CASA''), 94 percent of \n     primary care physicians and 40 percent of pediatricians \n     presented with a classic description of an alcoholic or drug \n     addict, respectively, failed to properly recognize the \n     problem.\n\n[[Page S2163]]\n\n       (11) Another CASA report revealed that fewer than 1 percent \n     of doctors presented with the classic profile of an alcoholic \n     older woman could diagnose it properly. Eighty-two percent \n     misdiagnosed it as depression, some treatments for which are \n     dangerous when taken with alcohol.\n       (12) Training can greatly increase the degree to which \n     medical and other health professionals screen patients for \n     substance abuse. It can also increase the manner by which \n     such professionals screen children and youth who may be \n     impacted by the addiction of a parent or other primary \n     caretaker. Boston University Medical School researchers \n     designed and conducted a seminar on detection and brief \n     intervention of substance abuse for doctors, nurses, \n     physician's assistants, social workers and psychologists. \n     Follow-up studies reveal that 91 percent of those who \n     participated in the seminar report that they are still \n     using the techniques up to 5 years later.\n       (13) The total economic costs of untreated addiction is \n     estimated to be $274,800,000,000. Arming health care \n     professionals with the information they need in order to \n     intervene and prevent further substance abuse could lead to a \n     significant cost savings.\n       (14) A study conducted by doctors at the University of \n     Wisconsin found a $947 net savings per patient in health \n     care, accident, and criminal justice costs for each \n     individual screened and, if appropriate, for whom \n     intervention was made, with respect to alcohol problems.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to--\n       (1) improve the ability of health care professionals to \n     identify and assist their patients in obtaining appropriate \n     treatment for substance abuse;\n       (2) improve the ability of health care professionals to \n     identify and refer children and youth affected by substance \n     abuse in their families for effective treatment; and\n       (3) help establish an infrastructure to train health care \n     professionals about substance abuse issues and the impact on \n     families.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to strengthen and permanently preserve social \nsecurity; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, when I began my first campaign for the U.S. \nSenate in 1995, I published a booklet entitled ``Where I Stand.'' I \nwrote it because the first obligation of a candidate is to tell voters \nwhat you believe. In that booklet, I wrote:\n\n       The Social Security system must be preserved, protected, \n     and improved. We have made this covenant with our senior \n     citizens. However, the long-term future of the Social \n     Security system is in peril. If we do not get this issue \n     resolved soon, this Nation faces an entitlement disaster, \n     eroding the trust between grandchildren and grandparents. We \n     must explore every option in order to fix and strengthen our \n     Social Security system. This will require bold leadership.\n\n  A decade later, those words still define my position on Social \nSecurity. Social Security has been one of the most important and \nsuccessful Government programs in the history of America. Almost every \nAmerican family over the last 70 years has been touched by Social \nSecurity. In signing the Social Security Act of 1935, Franklin \nRoosevelt said:\n\n       None of the sums of money paid out to individuals in \n     assistance or insurance will spell anything approaching \n     abundance. But they will furnish that minimum necessity to \n     keep a foothold, and that is the kind of protection Americans \n     want.\n\n  A fundamental point that President Roosevelt made was that Social \nSecurity was not intended to replace the personal responsibility of \nindividuals saving for and preparing for their own retirements. Social \nSecurity was never intended to be a substitute for a retirement or \nsavings plan. It is a safety net for people. Social Security is an \ninsurance contract that protects the most vulnerable in our society \nfrom falling into poverty. But Social Security is actuarially \nunsustainable with its present commitments to future generations.\n  Today, I am introducing comprehensive Social Security reform \nlegislation. I began my day in Nebraska this morning with some of the \npeople who would be most affected by my bill--America's next \ngeneration. It is their generation that will be asked to sustain the \nfuture of Social Security.\n  My generation, the baby boom generation, has been the largest and \nmost productive workforce in the history of man. The impending \nretirement of the 77 million-strong baby boom generation will impact \nevery aspect of our economy, Government, and society--Medicare and \nMedicaid, health care, our workforce, and our competitive position in a \nworld filled with countries much younger than ours. The next generation \nof Americans will respond to these challenges as every generation of \nAmericans has responded to challenges--with innovation and hard work.\n  However, my generation has a moral obligation to ensure that future \ngenerations do not have to bear an increasingly heavy burden of \nproviding retirement resources for future generations. That is why we \nmust reform Social Security. It is a 1935 model trying to operate in a \n21st century world. It will soon be incapable of delivering the \npromises and resources that it was built to provide 70 years ago.\n  Last week, in testimony before the House Budget Committee, Federal \nReserve Chairman Alan Greenspan urged Congress to act on modernizing \nentitlement programs sooner rather than later. He warned that, unless \nwe act now to meet the huge unfunded liabilities facing our entitlement \nprograms, there will be severe economic consequences for our Nation. \nChairman Greenspan is right.\n  America's largest entitlement programs--Social Security, Medicare, \nand Medicaid--are on a trajectory that cannot be sustained. For fiscal \nyear 2006, the Congressional Budget Office tells us that 64 percent of \nthe $2.5 trillion Federal budget will be obligated to mandatory \nspending, of which 42 percent is for Medicare, Medicaid, and Social \nSecurity. Those are tax dollars that are committed--money that cannot \nbe used for anything else.\n  Each year, the percentage of the Federal budget obligated to funding \nentitlement programs grows larger and larger. The current unfunded \nliability for Social Security over the next 75 years--this is the \nhorizon that the Social Security Administration uses to calculate \nbenefits and expenditures--is $3.7 trillion. That means over the next \n75 years, we are obligated to make the commitments of the retiree \nbenefits a reality. Yet we have $3.7 trillion of debt. We don't know \nwhere and how we are going to get that $3.7 trillion. We are now $3.7 \ntrillion in debt in the current obligations over the next 75 years for \nSocial Security. Medicare's unfunded liability is nearly $28 trillion. \nThese liabilities are in addition to America's current national debt of \n$7.5 trillion.\n  Medicare costs are growing faster than any other Government or \nentitlement program. As we see health care costs continue to rise, \ncoupled with the growing number of retirees, it will only continue to \nput more and more pressure on our Federal budget and squeeze out money \nfor important discretionary Government programs such as education, \nroads, parks, and housing.\n  Last Congress, we passed an enormous expansion of Medicare. I voted \nagainst it. I thought it was bad policy and would add hundreds of \nbillions of dollars to an already unsustainable program. I am \nsupportive of efforts to reopen the Medicare reform bill and fix \nit. But for political reasons, I doubt that will happen soon, although \nwe will be forced to deal with it in the future.\n\n  The Social Security system is not in crisis today, but there is \nclearly a crisis on the horizon. In 2018, more money will be paid out \nof Social Security than comes in. In 2042, the Social Security trust \nfund will be insolvent. Beyond the next 75 years, there is only a black \nhole of unfunded liability for future generations. The longer we do \nnothing, the more difficult it will be to protect Social Security and \nthe promise our Government made to future generations of Americans.\n  This reality is daunting, but there is good news in all of this. The \nsystem can be fixed. It is within our power to preserve the Social \nSecurity net for this Nation. It has been done before. In 1983, \nPresident Reagan worked with congressional Democrats and Republicans to \nmake tough choices and extend the life of Social Security. Dealing with \nthis problem now means less dramatic and difficult choices later. The \nearlier we confront the reality of the coming crisis, the more options \nwe will have to come up with a wise and sustainable course of action.\n  Allow me to now lay out the main points of the Social Security reform \nbill that I will introduce today.\n  My bill would ensure the vitality of Social Security for future \ngenerations. There are no easy choices to fix the demographic \nchallenges and realities facing Social Security. Understanding this, we \nmust make choices that address the problem responsibly and fairly.\n  My bill would make changes to Social Security only--only--for those \nAmericans under the age of 45. No American age 45 or older will see a \nchange in Social Security or their benefits. For Americans under 45, my \nbill would provide the option of voluntary personal accounts. Providing \npersonal accounts is good policy for both the long-term viability of \nSocial Security and for individuals. Government should be about \nempowering individuals and enhancing personal freedoms and their \nfutures. Personal accounts help do this for those under 45.\n  My bill would continue to provide a guaranteed Social Security \nbenefit from the Social Security trust fund. Under my plan--under any \nplan--Americans still need the security of knowing that the portion of \ntheir Social Security benefits that comes from the traditional Social \nSecurity system will be guaranteed. My bill will continue to guarantee \nsurvivor and disability benefits as they currently are.\n  Social Security provides benefits for more than 6 million spouses and \nchildren of breadwinners who have died\n\n[[Page S2165]]\n\nprematurely or have become disabled. For these families, their benefits \nshould not be touched.\n  I know something about this. When I was 16 years old, my father died. \nThe Social Security benefits my mother received were critical in \nhelping her raise four young boys in Nebraska. I well remember my \nmother's relief when that Social Security check arrived each month.\n  We must remember that the first obligation of Social Security is to \nthe most needy Americans. My bill does not raise taxes. I believe we \ncan fix Social Security without raising taxes. We need to begin \nreforming Government programs so they do not become so large and so \nexpensive that future taxpayers will be unable to pay for them. Young \nwage earners and small businesses are the most vulnerable to tax \nincreases, and they would be the ones most adversely affected by higher \ntaxes to save Social Security.\n  Additionally, whenever we increase the cost of labor, we hurt our \ncompetitive position in the world and make job creation more difficult. \nThis is not abstract economic theory; it is reality that has an impact \non every future American.\n  Those are the principles that form the foundation of the bill I will \nintroduce today. Here is how it would work.\n  Upon passage of the bill, Americans 44 and younger would be given two \nvoluntary options. One, they can invest 4 percent of their payroll tax \ninto a personal investment account modeled on the same accounts now \noffered to all Federal Government employees. I participate and my staff \nparticipates in this program. The remainder of their payroll tax \ncontribution would continue to go into the traditional Social Security \nsystem. Option 2, individuals can continue to invest their entire \npayroll tax in the traditional Social Security system.\n  If they choose the personal account option, then individuals will be \nable to invest in the same five funds that collectively make up the \ncurrent Federal Thrift Savings Plan--again, the program that I am in, \nMembers of Congress are in, and Federal Government employees are in.\n  The first is the common stock index fund. Over the last 10 years, \nthis fund has earned an average annual rate of return of 11.99 percent.\n  The second fund is the fixed income index investment fund. Over the \nlast 10 years, this fund has earned an average annual rate of return of \n7.72 percent.\n  The third is the Government securities investment fund, and over the \nlast 10 years, it has earned an average annual rate of return of 5.75 \npercent.\n  The fourth is the small capitalization index. Over the last 10 years, \nit has earned an average annual rate of return of 11.84 percent.\n  Fifth is the international stock index fund. Over the last 10 years, \nit has earned an average annual rate of return of 5.45 percent.\n  These five funds provide a range of excellent investment options.\n  My bill would also provide a default account for those Americans who, \nfor whatever reason, do not want to deal with choosing a fund or funds \nfor their accounts. This fund would invest differently in an \nindividual's early working years than in their later working years.\n  The Thrift Savings Plan has been a success for Government employees. \nLast year, returns on the different accounts ranged from just over 4 \npercent to 20 percent, and in the last 10 years, the returns have been \nbetween 5.5 and 12 percent. Compare this with the 3-percent return \nprovided by Treasury bonds that Social Security now invests in today.\n  These private accounts are in addition to the guaranteed Social \nSecurity benefits and personal savings pensions and retirement account \nprograms individuals build up during their working years.\n  Under my bill, personal accounts would be administered by a board \nwithin the Social Security Administration called the Social Security \ninvestment board. The board would be composed of the Secretary of the \nTreasury, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, the Chairman of \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission, and two Senate-confirmed \nappointments nominated by the President. One of the President's \nappointments would serve as chairman of the board.\n\n  Upon retirement, those who choose to enroll in a personal account \nwill have two accounts: their personal account and their traditional \nSocial Security benefits account. They will be required to convert a \nportion of their personal account to an annuity which, when added to \ntheir guaranteed Social Security, would be at least 135 percent of \npoverty. There is no such guarantee in our Social Security system \ntoday. The remainder of the personal account will be theirs to spend as \nthey wish. It could be used to help with health care costs and \nretirement living costs, or it could even help an account holder's \nchildren or grandchildren put a downpayment on a home or pay college \ntuition.\n  There are those who say that allowing individuals to invest through \npersonal accounts is too risky. Their concerns are serious, and they \ndeserve a serious response. Under my plan, no person is required to \nhave a personal account. An individual who does not want to invest can \nkeep all of their money in the traditional Social Security system.\n  I believe the policies which enhance personal freedom and \nresponsibility encourage the ethic of saving and limit the role of \nGovernment in their lives. These are the policies which will be more \nflexible and successful for America's future.\n  It is true that there is no guarantee with market-based investments; \nhowever, the historic success of markets is not a theory, it is a fact. \nColumnist George Will pointed out in a recent Washington Post column \nthat in no 15-year period over the past eight decades has the growth of \nstocks ever been negative. In no 20-year period has the average growth \nbeen less than 3 percent, which exceeds the rate of return on Social \nSecurity assets today. This includes down times, significant down \nperiods in the stock market.\n  We are blessed in America. We are blessed in America because the vast \nmajority of Americans live healthier, longer lives than they did a few \ndecades ago. Continued advances in medicine, education, and personal \nhealth will continue to increase not only the length of our lives, but \nalso the quality of our lives, providing opportunities for older \nAmericans to remain healthy, vital, and productive members of the \nworkforce.\n  When Social Security was created in 1935, there were too many workers \nand not enough jobs. According to the Social Security Administration, \nin 1950, there were 16.5 workers per retiree. Incentives were created \nto move people out of the workforce. This dynamic is changing. Today \nthere are 3.3 workers for every retiree. In 25 years, there will be \nabout 2 workers for each retiree.\n  Why is this important? This is important because Social Security is a \ntransfer program. The money comes in and the payroll taxes from the \nworkers go out at the end of the month to the retirees.\n  So when there are less workers, there is less money coming into the \nsystem. My bill makes three adjustments to Social Security that will \nmake it solvent for future generations. First, my bill would raise the \ncurrent full benefit retirement age by 1 year from 67 to 68. Second, my \nbill would maintain the current earlier retirement age at 62 but would \nadjust benefits for those who choose to retire early.\n  Currently, workers who retire early today receive 70 percent of their \nfull retirement benefits. My bill will provide these early retirees \nwith 63 percent of the traditional benefits.\n  Third, currently an individual's base Social Security benefit is \ndetermined by two factors: their average income over 35 years and the \nwage index. My bill adds a third component, life expectancy. We are \nliving longer. That means as we live longer, we will draw more from the \nSocial Security fund.\n  Over the life of the program Social Security benefit calculations \nhave never been adjusted to reflect increased life expectancy. By \nfactoring increased life expectancy into the base benefit calculation, \nthe rate of increase in benefit payments will be slow. No other changes \nwill be made to the annual consumer price indexing of benefit \nincreases.\n  In addition to making Social Security solvent, these adjustments can \nhelp confront the challenges of increasing Medicare costs and shortages \nin the workforce. It is important to protect\n\n[[Page S2166]]\n\nthe option of early retirement, but our laws need to encourage \nindividuals to stay in the workforce, not leave it.\n  Medicare costs, Medicaid costs, and labor shortages can be \nsignificantly reduced by keeping people healthy, vital, happy, and \nproductive in the workforce. My bill pays for these changes in Social \nSecurity by using the existing $3.7 trillion unfunded liability to \nensure the long-term health of the Social Security system. Doing \nnothing will mean at the end of 75 years, Social Security will have \nchewed up $3.7 trillion in taxpayer money to help keep Social Security \nsolvent, but it will not, and we will still have an insolvent program \nwith trillions of dollars more of unfunded liabilities staring us in \nthe face.\n  In recent testimony before the Senate, Alan Greenspan said Social \nSecurity's total unfunded liability could be as high as $10 trillion \nover the life of the program. I have introduced this bill because I \nbelieve that leaders have a responsibility to deal with the great \nchallenges of their time, not defer them, not make excuses for them, \nbut to try to fix them and come up with solutions.\n  I do not hold my bill up as the only way to address the solvency of \nSocial Security. It is one way. There may be better ways. No \ncomprehensive bill will be immune from critical evaluation, nor should \nit be. However, I think my bill is a commonsense, responsible, and \nfiscally accountable place to start.\n  All Americans need to ask tough questions about the future of Social \nSecurity. We need to begin the process of refining ideas to forge the \nbest, most responsible policy for the future of Social Security.\n  President Bush deserves great credit for making the modernization of \nSocial Security a central part of his second-term agenda. There is no \npossibility for success in modernizing Social Security without strong \nPresidential leadership.\n  As I said at the beginning of my speech, Social Security is one of \nthe most important and successful Government programs in American \nhistory. Since 1935, it has provided a safety net for our society's \nmost vulnerable. We have a high moral obligation to ensure that future \ngenerations continue to benefit from this safety net and social \ncontract we have with our citizens. But in order to do this, we must \nfix the system.\n  This is a personal issue for me. Forty years from now a young mother \nin Columbus, NE, may be left to raise four children on her own. I want \nher family to have the same access to the same safety net that my \nfamily had, and the promise that no matter where one starts in life, \nwith a little help they can finish where they want.\n  I am 58 years old. I am at the front of the baby boom generation. My \ndaughter is 14 years old. My son is 12 years old. I do not want to fail \ntheir generation. That means addressing these entitlement program \nissues now, while we have time to do it in a wise, careful, and \nresponsible way. This is a defining debate for today's leaders. Doing \nnothing is irresponsible and cowardly. It is in America's interest to \ndeal with our challenge today. We have it in us to do what needs to be \ndone. We can preserve, protect, and improve Social Security for all \nfuture generations of Americans.\n  I send my bill to the desk and ask that it be assigned to the \nappropriate committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be received and appropriately \ndealt with.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 540\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue code of 1986 to extend \nfor 5 years the credit for electricity produced from certain renewable \nresources, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I am joined by Senator Smith of \nOregon and several of our colleagues in introducing legislation to \nextend the soon-to-expire tax credits in Federal law that incentivize \nthe development and use of renewable energy.\n  Mr. President, as you know, Federal policymakers have been working \nover the past couple of years to pass comprehensive energy reforms that \nwill encourage greater domestic energy production, increase energy \nefficiency and improve the nation's overall energy security by reducing \nour dependence on imported sources of energy.\n  This country imports more than 60 percent of its oil from abroad, and \nAmericans have watched as oil and gas prices--and their energy bills--\nhave skyrocketed, in large part due to the threat of disruptions to \nenergy supplies in volatile regions of the Middle East. The evidence \nalso suggests that the United States is ramping up its demand for \nimported natural gas. At a recent Senate Energy Subcommittee hearing, \nfor example, we heard about plans to build thirty-one new liquefied \nnatural gas terminals in this country. The reason for this activity is \nthat the United States is projected to import about 28 percent of our \nnatural gas supply by the year 2025. Clearly, something must be done to \nreduce our reliance on energy imports. I hope that we will complete \nwork on a comprehensive energy bill in this Congress that will help us \ndo so.\n  However, there are some fiscal policies already in place that will \nhelp us move toward greater energy independence and diversity. Current \nlaw's Federal income tax credit for facilities producing electricity \nfrom wind and other renewable energy sources is among the most \nimportant of these polices. In fact, we are told by energy developers \nyear after year that the renewable energy production tax credit, PTC, \nis absolutely essential for bringing renewable energy-generated \nelectricity to the marketplace at a competitive rate. Today, for \nexample, our country has over 6,700 megawatts of wind energy capacity, \nor enough electric capacity to serve about 1.6 million homes. And all \nthat electricity is generated on U.S. soil, producing U.S. jobs.\n  Last year, Congress extended the availability of the PTC and expanded \nit to cover other forms of renewable energy--including geothermal and \nsolar. I supported this effort. However, I am frustrated that Congress \ncontinues to undermine its own effort to develop domestic renewable \nenergy resources by failing to ensure that the PTC is available for a \nlonger term.\n  In North Dakota, we have abundant renewable energy resources \nincluding wind. In fact, North Dakota's wind development potential is \nso great that many energy experts call North Dakota the ``Saudi \nArabia'' of wind energy. And the PTC is critical for the continued \ngrowth of this industry in North Dakota, Oregon, and elsewhere. But the \nPTC, which is found in Section 45 of the Tax Code, is also scheduled to \nexpire at the end of this year.\n  That is why Senator Smith and I are introducing a bipartisan bill \ntoday to extend the Section 45 tax credits for producers who place new \nrenewable energy facilities in service before January 1, 2011. Our \nfive-year extension bill also continues the indexing of the credits for \ninflation and extends alternative minimum tax relief as provided under \ncurrent law. Finally, the bill includes provisions to ensure that tax-\nexempt cooperatives, municipal utilities and Indian tribes can receive \nthe benefit of the tax credits for their investments in renewable \nenergy.\n  Billions of dollars of expected investments by the renewable energy \nindustry will, once again, be put on hold if we fail to extend the \ncredit. Inexplicably, Congress has allowed the PTC to expire three \ntimes since its inception in 1992. When this happens, the industry \nsuffers a huge drop in investment and many good-paying jobs are lost. \nFailing to promptly extend the credit this year will prevent new \nrenewable energy facilities from coming on line and lead to layoffs by \nthe businesses that support this industry, including wind tower and \nturbine blade manufacturers.\n  The bottom line is that short-term extensions of the renewable energy \ntax credit creates a boom and bust cycle of short-term planning, \npainful layoffs and higher than necessary project costs. Financial \nlenders stop providing the capital needed for wind energy projects \nabout 4 to 6 months before the credit is scheduled to expire because of \nthe uncertainty surrounding the future availability of the credit. This \nuncertainty inevitably leads to a rush to complete projects at higher \ncosts, and those costs are passed along to consumers.\n  In conclusion, I will be working hard with Senator Smith and others \nto get this legislation passed by the Senate as soon as possible. \nUnless we act quickly, renewable energy developers will, once again, be \nforced to suspend or cancel new projects that move us toward energy \nindependence and create significant economic opportunities for a rural \nstate like North Dakota.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that this legislation has already been \nendorsed by the American Wind Energy Association, the American Corn \nGrowers Association and others interested in renewable energy \ndevelopment. I urge my colleagues to work with us to get this measure \nenacted into law early in this session of the 109th Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 543. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand \nthe availability of the cash method of accounting for small businesses, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to re-introduce a bill that I \noffered last year that I hope will be the first in a series of \nproposals to simplify the Tax Code for small business owners. Once \nenacted, these provisions will reduce not only the amount of taxes that \nsmall businesses pay, but I believe they also will reduce the \nadministrative burden that saddles small companies in trying to satisfy \ntheir tax obligation.\n  Let me begin by saying how pleased I am that the President has made \nsimplifying the Tax Code one of his top priorities for his second term. \nClearly, a world-class economy such as that of the United States \nrequires a world-class revenue collection system, meaning we need a Tax \nCode that is simple, consistent, and fair. For that reason, I look \nforward to seeing the recommendations that the President's tax reform \npanel will offer on how best we can reform the current Tax Code to \nimprove its efficiency and strengthen our overall economy.\n  In the interim, the proposal that I am re-introducing today will \nsimplify the code by permitting small business owners to use the cash \nmethod of accounting for reporting their income if they generally earn \nfewer than $10 million during the tax year. Currently, only those \ntaxpayers that earn less than $5 million per year are able to use the \ncash method. By increasing this threshold to $10 million, more small \nbusinesses will be relieved of the burdensome record-keeping \nrequirements that they must deal with currently in paying their income \ntaxes.\n  Before I talk about the specifics of this particular provision, let \nme first explain why it is so critical that we simplify the Tax Code. \nAs you know, Mr. President, small businesses are the backbone of our \nnation's economy. According to the Small Business Administration, small \nbusinesses represent 99 percent of all employers, employ 51 percent of \nthe private-sector workforce, and contribute 51 percent of the private-\nsector output.\n  Yet, the despite the fact that small businesses are the engine that \ndrives our improving economy, the current tax system imposes entirely \nunreasonable burdens on them when they try to\n\n[[Page S2171]]\n\nsatisfy their tax obligations. As you know, the current tax code \nimposes a large, and expensive, burden on all taxpayers in terms of \nsatisfying their reporting and recordkeeping obligations. The problem, \nthough, is that small companies are disadvantaged most in terms of the \nmoney and time spent in satisfying their tax obligation vis-a-vis \nlarger firms.\n  For example, according to the Small Business Administration's Office \nof Advocacy, small businesses spend more than 8 billion hours each year \nfilling-out government reports, and they spend more than 80 percent of \nthis time on completing tax forms. What's even more troubling is that \ncompanies that employ fewer than 20 employees spend nearly $6,975 per \nemployee in tax compliance costs, and this amount is nearly 60 percent \nmore than companies spend with more than 500 employees.\n  These statistics are disconcerting for several reasons. First, the \nfact that small businesses are being required to spend so much money on \ncompliance costs means they have fewer earnings to reinvest into their \nbusiness. This, in turn, means that they have less money to spend on \nnew equipment or on worker training, which unfortunately has an adverse \neffect on their overall production and the economy as a whole.\n  Second, the fact that small business owners are required to make such \na sizeable investment of their time into completing paperwork means \nthey have less time to spend on doing what they do best--namely running \ntheir business and creating jobs.\n  Let me be clear, however, that I am in no way suggesting that small \nbusiness owners are unique in having to pay income taxes, and I am \ncertainly not expecting them to receive a free pass. In order to \nbenefit from the freedoms and protections that our great country \nprovides, individuals and businesses alike are required to pay taxes, \nand this duty inevitably imposes some minimum administrative and \nopportunity cost. What I am asking for, though, is a fairer, simpler \nTax Code that allows small companies to satisfy this obligation without \nhaving to expend the amount of resources that they do currently.\n  For that reason, the package of proposals that I hope to introduce \nwill provide not only targeted, affordable tax relief to small business \nowners, but they also will simplify the rules that exist currently. By \nsimplifying the Tax Code, small business owners will be able to satisfy \ntheir tax obligation in a cheaper, more efficient manner, and they \nconsequently will be able to invest more time and resources into their \nbusiness.\n  As I mentioned earlier, the provision that I am introducing today \nwill permit more taxpayers to use the cash method of accounting rather \nthan the accrual method. Generally, current law permits only those \ntaxpayers that earn fewer than $5 million in gross receipts during the \ntax year to use the cash method in reporting their income. In addition, \ncurrent law precludes taxpayers that have inventory from using the cash \nmethod. This means that thousands of small businesses that should be \nentitled to report their income and expenses under the cash method of \naccounting are required to follow the accrual method, which tends to \nimpose additional financial and administrative costs that should be \neliminated.\n  My bill changes these existing rules so that more small businesses \nwill be able to use the cash method. In short, my bill increases the \ngross receipts test under current law to $10 million and indexes this \nhigher threshold to account for inflation. As the current $5 million \nthreshold is clearly outdated, it makes little sense to have such an \nobsolete standard for this most important provision.\n  My bill also changes current law to permit those taxpayers with \ninventory to qualify for the cash method of accounting. Notably, \nhowever, my bill will not give these taxpayers an opportunity to simply \nrecover costs associated with these otherwise inventoriable assets in \nthe year of purchase. Rather, my bill will require these taxpayers to \naccount for such costs as if they are a material or supply that is not \nincidental. This standard already exists under current law, and it is \none with which many small businesses are already familiar. As such, \nthis less-burdensome standard should ease the existing compliance \nburden for eligible taxpayers and allow them to devote more time and \nresources to their business.\n  Importantly, these changes will not reduce the amount of taxes a \nsmall business pays by even one dollar. Indeed, the overall amount of \ntaxes a qualifying small business pays will remain the same. Rather, \nthis bill simply permits more taxpayers to report income and account \nfor costs in the year of the receipt or expenditure. Clearly, this \nmethod is much easier and simpler for small taxpayers, and it will \nreduce both their time and monetary expenditures spent on complying \nwith the Tax Code.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/07/senate-section/article/S2171-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2171-S2172]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED & PROPOSED\n\n       SA 58.

Therefore, additional votes should be \nexpected throughout the afternoon tomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/07/senate-section/article/S2198-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2198]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:45 A.M.
