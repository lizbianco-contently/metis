Mr. President, I wish to take a few moments to comment on \nthe bill we will be voting on later this morning, the Oman Free Trade \nAgreement.\n  On June 29, the Senate passed the Oman Free Trade Agreement by a vote \nof 60 to 34. Today, we will bring the Oman Free Trade Agreement to the \nfloor again for final passage of the House bill.\n  We have a long history with Oman. Our relationship has extended for \nnearly 200 years. It dates back to 1833, when a treaty of friendship \nand navigation was signed with Muscat. Oman was the first Arab country \nto send an ambassador to the United States.\n  Over the years, Oman has offered us valuable support. When we needed \na local airbase for an attempt to rescue U.S. Embassy hostages in Iran \nduring the Carter administration, Oman volunteered. When we needed a \nsafe ground for our troops during Operation Enduring Freedom in \nAfghanistan and Operation Iraqi Freedom, Oman volunteered.\n  Today, Oman cooperates closely with us and other allies on \ncounterterrorism and has publicly supported the democratic transition \nin Iraq. Although not a formal member of the coalition, Oman has been a \ncommitted, dependent ally in the global war on terror.\n  In Oman, we have found a solid partner on terrorist finance issues. \nOman partners with its neighbors on transborder terror threats, and \nOman's Government and religious leaders consistently and courageously \ndenounce acts of terror and religious intolerance.\n  It is clear that through nearly 200 years of formal relations, we \nhave enjoyed a close and cooperative partnership that continues to \nexpand.\n  The free-trade agreement before us builds on the progress already \nmade. It strengthens our relationship with a key friend and ally in the \nregion, and it is a model for free trade in the entire Persian Gulf \nregion.\n  It is not our first bilateral agreement in the region. We struck \nsimilar deals with Jordan in 2000, with Morocco in 2004, and with \nBahrain in 2005. Like these earlier deals, the Oman agreement will open \nand expand opportunities for exports of many American products. \nAmerica's workers, manufacturers, consumers, farmers, ranchers, and \nservice providers will all benefit.\n  As soon as the agreement takes effect, Oman and the United States \nwill provide each other immediate duty-\n\n[[Page S9690]]\n\nfree access on virtually all products in our tariff schedules. This \nincludes all consumer and industrial products. We will phase out \ntariffs on the remaining products within 10 years. Former Trade \nRepresentative Rob Portman called it ``a high-quality, comprehensive \nfree trade agreement that will contribute to economic growth and \ntrade.''\n  Unfortunately, some have sought to undermine the agreement. They have \npropagated myths that don't stand up to scrutiny. For example, despite \nclaims to the contrary, Oman does not implement any aspect of the Arab \nboycott of Israel. Oman publicly affirms and has reaffirmed its \nposition in a letter from its Commerce Minister in September 2005. \nMoreover, Oman neither tolerates nor allows the use of slave labor. \nOman has made substantial commitments to the United States on labor \nreform, and it has promised to enact key reforms by October 31, 2006.\n  Rejecting the trade agreement would send a strong negative signal to \nour friends in the Middle East. Oman is a forward-looking Arab country \non a range of social and economic issues. We must demonstrate our \nsupport to Oman, just as Oman has supported us.\n  As the 9/11 Commission advised, expanding trade with the Middle East \nwill ``encourage development, more open societies, and opportunities \nfor people to improve the lives of their families.'' Passing the \nagreement before us will promote economic reform and development in the \nPersian Gulf, and it will advance our goal of a freer and more open \nMiddle East. Quite simply, it will move our allies forward, and it will \nmove America forward.\n  I urge my colleagues to demonstrate their commitment to these goals \nby voting to pass the Oman Free Trade Agreement later this morning.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/19/senate-section/article/S9690-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I commend my colleague, Senator Dorgan of \nNorth Dakota, for a hearing he held yesterday. It was a hearing of the \nDemocratic Policy Conference. This is the 10th hearing he has held. I \nattended with several other Senators. The hearings are held on Monday \nbecause they cannot be held during the ordinary course of business of \nthe Senate.\n  The reason, I am afraid, is very clear. Senator Dorgan is considering \nan issue which no other committee in Congress will consider. Senator \nDorgan is raising questions which no other committee on Capitol Hill \nwill even suggest. Senator Dorgan and the Democratic Policy Conference \nare calling witnesses to testify openly on issues which the majority in \nthis Republican-led Congress will not even consider. What could that \npossibly be? It turns out to be the conduct of our war in Iraq and, \nparticularly, the waste and mismanagement of Federal tax dollars.\n  Yesterday, there were several former employees of Halliburton. We all \nknow them now; they are infamous. This is the company with the no-bid \ncontracts--$7 billion worth--and friends in high places all over this \nadministration. This is the company which made millions of dollars off \nof taxpayer funds and, sadly, often at the expense of our soldiers.\n  Yesterday, the testimony was very clear. There was one witness who \ntalked about this fitness center that was put up for our troops and an \nInternet center for our troops, and Halliburton was going to run it. It \nturns out they dramatically inflated the number of soldiers walking \nthrough the door so they could make more money on the center, ripping \noff the taxpayers. It turns out that the supplies they were given for \nour troops, Halliburton ended up consuming for their own employees, \nhaving Super Bowl parties, using the food and drink that had been \nprepared for our troops.\n  One of the witnesses yesterday said there was a certain arrogance of \nthe Halliburton contractors when it came to our troops. They were \nannoyed when the soldiers asked for certain things. It was all about \nprofit. It was all about them.\n  Why in the world hasn't a single committee in the Senate called \nHalliburton in to answer for these things? Because Halliburton has \nfriends in high places. People don't ask these rude and embarrassing \nquestions of this powerful special interest corporation.\n  I thank Senator Dorgan and the Democratic Policy Conference for \ncontinuing to bring in the whistleblowers. One would think there would \nbe a Member of the Republican Senate embarrassed enough at \nHalliburton's conduct in this war in Iraq that they would join us in a \nbipartisan effort. Sadly, this do-nothing Republican Congress has been \na coverup Republican Congress as well. They don't want to talk about \nit. They don't want to raise the questions.\n  Do you think the feature in the Washington Post this last Sunday \nwould have invoked at least some response from the Republican chairmen \nof major committees in the Senate? It was an expose. It showed that \nwhen we created this provisional authority in Iraq to create a civil \nsociety, it turned out to be a patronage operation, worse than Brown \nand FEMA when it came to Katrina.\n  What they did was screen employees who were headed over to Iraq to \nspend billions of dollars and ask them probing questions about their \nqualifications. And do you know what the questions were. Here are some \nof the questions: How did you vote in the last primary? Did you vote \nfor President Bush? What is your position on the issue of abortion? \nWhere do you stand in terms of the Republican Party of America?\n  These were the questions asked of people we sent over to manage \nbillions of dollars, our taxpayers' dollars, and rebuild Iraq. Is it \nany wonder we are in the fourth year in a war with no end? Is it any \nwonder that Iraq today is still in shambles from the viewpoint of its \ncivil government? Is it any wonder when one looks at this gross \nincompetence, the same type of incompetence, patronage, and favoritism \nwe saw, sadly, with Hurricane Katrina when Americans were \ndisadvantaged?\n  There was a time in the history of this great institution when no \nPresident could get by with what this administration is getting by \nwith. There was a time when a Democratic Senate would challenge a \nDemocratic President, when a man named Harry Truman would stand up and \nsay: We are going to look at profiteering and waste in waging the war \nagainst the Nazis and those who are their allies, even if we have a \nDemocratic President, even if it might embarrass him.\n  Sadly, those days are gone. This Congress stands mute. This Congress \nrefuses to ask the hard questions of this administration. This Congress \nrefuses to acknowledge the obvious. We have lost 2,686 American \nsoldiers in Iraq, and over 20,000 have returned home seriously injured. \nWe have spent over $325 billion. The scandalous conduct of contractors \nover there, deserving of investigation, has been made a matter of \npublic record because of Senator Dorgan's hearings, and this \nadministration and this Republican Congress refuse to ask the hard \nquestions. Clearly, it is time for a change.\n  It is a time for new leadership that will ask these hard questions on \nbehalf of our soldiers and our taxpayers.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Five minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Illinois. I \nappreciate him attending the hearing yesterday. As he indicated, we \nwould prefer not to do oversight hearings. That is a job for\n\n[[Page S9691]]\n\nother committees. But because they have not done it, we have a \nresponsibility to do them, and will.\n  We have done 10 oversight hearings with respect to contracting in \nIraq. I am convinced the stories we have heard at these hearings \nundermine our American soldiers, undermine our troops, and cheat our \ntaxpayers. I don't, for the life of me, understand why there is not \naggressive activity in this Chamber and at the Pentagon to root out the \nwaste, fraud, and abuse we have seen. It is almost as if there is a \nsleepwalk going on through these issues.\n  I have held hearings, and we have described all of the issues. \nYesterday, a woman who worked for Halliburton went to Halliburton and \nsaid: What is happening is Halliburton is billing, in some cases, five \ntimes the amount they should be billing to the Federal Government for \ncertain activities in Iraq.\n  For complaining to her superiors about the taxpayers being cheated by \nthis contractor, she was put under guard by four civilians working for \nHalliburton, kept overnight, put on an airplane, fired, and shipped out \nof Iraq. That is what she got for being a whistleblower to talk about \nhow the taxpayers were being cheated.\n  I am going to speak more about those issues this week with respect to \nall the hearings I have held. It is not for the purpose of injuring \nanybody. It is for the purpose of protecting our troops and our \ntaxpayers.\n  Briefly, I want to describe something I am going to send over to the \ninspector general of the Defense Department today. This is a letter \nthat was given to us yesterday at the hearing. It is a letter from \nHalliburton--Kellogg, Brown and Root, a subsidiary of Halliburton. It \nis from Mr. Standard, a civilian contract employee who was a \ntruckdriver in Iraq who was wounded.\n\n  By the way, Halliburton hires these contract civilian employees \nthrough their subsidiary in the Cayman Islands. Why do they have a \nsubsidiary in the Cayman Islands? That is a tax haven country. They get \nAmerican contracts from our Government and run them through the Cayman \nIslands so they don't have to pay taxes.\n  This is from Mr. Standard, a truckdriver wounded in Iraq driving a \nconvoy as a civilian contract employee for Halliburton. Here is what \nHalliburton has written to this truckdriver:\n\n       I hope this finds you well and enjoying a swift recovery. \n     Per our conversation today, I included the medical records \n     release form. This form authorizes me to share your medical \n     records with the Pentagon Review Board for the purpose of \n     awarding you the Secretary's Defense of Freedom Medal.\n\n  Halliburton is saying to the truckdriver: We would like you to sign a \nrelease so that we, Halliburton, can send information on your medical \nsituation to the Defense Department and get you a Defense medal for the \nDefense of Freedom.\n  Here is what they said to this wounded truckdriver, an employee of \ntheir subsidiary Kellogg Brown and Root: Authorization and release \nreform, use and disclosure of protected information. It is a lengthy \nform. The truckdriver who signed this said: I am going to allow you to \nturn my medical records over to the Defense Department. And then under \nsection 9, it says:\n\n       Release: I agree that in consideration for the application \n     for a Defense of Freedom Medal on my behalf that on behalf of \n     myself, my hires, executors, administrators, assigns, and \n     successors, I hereby release, acquit and discharge and do \n     hereby release, acquit and discharge KBR, all KBR employees, \n     the military, and any of their representatives, collectively \n     and individually, with respect to any claims and any and all \n     causes of action of any kind or character, known or unknown, \n     that I may have against any of them.\n\n  What they have said to the employee in a deceitful way, in my \njudgment, is: We would like you to sign a medical release form so we \ncan apply for a Defense Medal of Freedom for you. First, there is no \nsuch thing as being able to apply for a Defense Medal of Freedom. You \nare either entitled to it or you are not.\n  In any event, they are saying to the truckdriver, buried in No. 9, in \nexchange for that, you should assign away all your rights against this \ncompany or any actions of the company or any employee of the company.\n  This is unbelievably deceptive. Here is a company, Halliburton, \nsaying to a truckdriver that was wounded, an employee of theirs--by the \nway, the testimony yesterday by other truckdrivers who were wounded in \naction is that Halliburton knew they sent a convey right into hostile \naction on a road that was marked red and black, which meant no travel \nby a civilian convey. They deliberately sent them onto that road \nanyway. Seven people were killed in that circumstance.\n  Aside from all of that--and that is important in itself--this company \nhas written to its former employee, a wounded truckdriver, saying: We \nwould like to send your medical records to the Pentagon, and we would \nlike to get for you this Defense of Freedom Medal. So would you please \nsign this--not pointing out to him that he is signing away all of his \nrights to take action against that company or anybody in that company.\n  I have the standards of the Defense Medal of Freedom right here. Let \nme show the date. It is in 2001:\n\n       Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld announced today the \n     creation of the Defense of Freedom Medal to honor civilian \n     employees of the Department of Defense injured or killed in \n     the line of duty. It will be the civilian equivalent of the \n     military's Purple Heart. The first recipients to be honored \n     will be the Defense Department civilians injured or killed \n     recently as a result of the terrorist attack on the Pentagon. \n     At the discretion of the Secretary of Defense, the medal may \n     be awarded to nondefense employees, such as contractors, \n     based on their involvement in Department of Defense \n     activities.\n\n  This is unbelievably deceptive, and I believe deceitful, to try to \npersuade a former employee of this company to sign a release form \nsaying it is a release of medical records when, in fact, it is a \nrelease of much more.\n  I am going to ask the inspector general to investigate exactly what \nthis contractor has done.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority controls 15 minutes. \nThe Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/19/senate-section/article/S9691-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9691]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ACTIONS OF THIS CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I want to talk today a little bit about the \nprogress we are making relative to securing our borders in the United \nStates as a result of efforts made by this Congress and the \nadministration. Before I do, I want to comment briefly on the \npresentation of the Senator from Illinois relative to the actions of \nthis Congress and its passage of legislation or its investigative \nactivity.\n  It is truly disingenuous when the assistant leader of the Democratic \nside comes to the floor and says we have done nothing as a Congress \nwhen almost every major piece of legislation that has been brought to \nthe floor of this Senate has been filibustered by the other side of the \naisle. Bill after bill after bill has been stymied, stopped and, in \nfact--it is no secret--there is an open understanding around here that \nthe purpose of the Democratic leadership has been to make it virtually \nimpossible to pass legislation in the Senate in order that the Senate \nappear to be an ineffective body--their feeling being that if they can \nobstruct enough things, they can make an argument that Congress isn't \nfunctioning and they should be put in charge.\n  It is an ironic position, of course, and has been on a number of \ntimes characterized as being similar to the situation when a man who \nshot both his parents, when brought before the court, asked for mercy \nbecause he declared himself an orphan. The fact is that the Democratic \nleadership of this body has decided to actively obstruct and try to \nstop almost any legislation of any significance that has come to the \nfloor and, as a result, many things have been stopped because, as we \nall know, this is a body which functions essentially on a 60-vote \nmajority, not a 51-vote majority. So, therefore, even though the \nRepublican Party has 55 votes, we cannot pass something if there is \nunited opposition. It has happened again and again.\n  I do find it a bit disingenuous to make this argument--it is their \nright to make it--but I think an honest reflection of what is actually \nhappening around here makes the argument rather superficial and \ninadequate in its essence and its purpose.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/19/senate-section/article/S9692-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9692]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S9692]]\n                          SECURING OUR BORDERS\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I wish to talk about the progress we have \nmade relative to securing our borders because this is one of those \nsituations where the facts on the ground have not yet caught up with \nthe public perception, which is understandable. That happens a lot in \nall sorts of areas where things are moving in the right direction, \nwhich were broken but are being repaired; there is still a perception \nthat things are fundamentally broken. We are moving in the right \ndirection relative to the borders.\n\n  Since 2005, we have made rather significant strides toward putting in \nplace the infrastructure and the people necessary to secure the \nborders. I have the good fortune to chair the Subcommittee on Homeland \nSecurity. It may well be the only major appropriations bill that gets \nout of this Congress before we adjourn in October. That bill and the \nprecursors to it, including the appropriations bills which we passed \nover the last 2 years and the supplementals that have gone with those \nbills, have allowed us to significantly expand our commitment to \nhomeland security.\n  This has been an aggressive step taken by the Republican Congress and \nthe administration. Back in 2005 we took a look at the problem when I \nassumed the leadership of this subcommittee, and we basically \nreoriented this whole funding stream within the Homeland Security \nDepartment, relative to the issue of weapons of mass destruction and \nborder security. We concluded that those were the two major threats on \nwhich we as a committee should focus. So we took significant amounts of \nfunds at that time and moved them into those accounts. Initially, back \nin 2005, the administration wasn't too excited about that, but after \nthey took a hard look at what we were doing, they felt it was a good \nidea and they decided to join us in our efforts.\n  Now, since 2005, that effort has accelerated and has gained strength \nand has actually made significant gains. By the time this next bill \npasses, which I hope will pass before we leave at the end of September, \nit is expected we will have put in place almost 4,000 new border \nagents, which is a 40-percent increase in border agents--people \nphysically on the ground; we will have put in place almost 10,000 new \ndetention beds so that when we catch people, we don't have to release \nthem. That was really an inappropriate policy that was being followed, \nwhich was when somebody was caught coming across the border, they were \nsimply either taken back across the border if they were Mexicans, or \nthey were released and told to come back and appear for a court date if \nthey were not Mexican. And what we found was that nobody came back for \nthose court dates. So with the 10,000 additional beds we put in place, \nthat policy of catch and release will be curtailed.\n  We have added hundreds of miles of new fence, and we will continue to \nadd new fencing where it is appropriate. We have dramatically increased \nthe Customs and Border Patrol agents so that we are now up to 18,000 \nCustoms officers, I am talking about--not Border Patrol--Customs \nofficers who monitor our ports of entry, in addition to our Border \nPatrol individuals. We have greatly increased the commitment to the \nCoast Guard, which is the first line of defense relative to our ports \nand also plays a major role, of course, along the access points of our \ncoastline for people who are coming into the country illegally. We have \nadded $7.5 billion to the Coast Guard accounts which are going to give \nthem the new capability they need for the boats and the aircraft, \nspecifically upgrading their aircraft, upgrading their helicopters. All \nof this is in order to give the Coast Guard the ability to intercept \npeople who may be coming here to do us harm.\n  We dramatically increased our commitment in the area of nuclear \ndetection. We set up the Nuclear Deterrence Office, which basically is \na focused effort on the question of how to deter a nuclear attack and \nalso respond to it should it ever occur--God forbid it should ever \nhappen. That is obviously the intention of some of our enemies. They \nwant to accomplish that. We need to be focused on trying to stop that \nfrom happening. We have dramatically expanded the intelligence \ncapability of the Department of Homeland Security Analysis Center by \nadding over a half a billion dollars for that. These are increases that \nare making a difference in our capacity as a country to know who is \ncoming into the country, what is coming into the country, and whether \nthe people who are coming into the country represent a threat or \nwhether they are just people who are coming to pursue appropriate \nlawful activity in the area of commerce or just in the area of visiting \nus or taking advantage of our educational system.\n  These are major steps forward. All problems haven't been solved yet, \nand we all understand that. But if we continue on this path toward \nsignificantly upgrading our capabilities in the area of our feet on the \nground, our boots on the ground, and technology supporting those \nboots--and later this week there is going to be the release of the \naccounting for the security program for the entire border, which will \nbe a major step forward. It will mean we will be able to start \nconstruction of major technology improvements along the borders to use \nour advantages in technology to be able to police our borders. Then, in \naddition, recognizing that should somebody actually breach our borders \nwith some weapon that might harm us, we will have the capacity to try \nto mitigate the effects of that through better technology and the \nresearch that surrounds that effort.\n  We have basically made a huge commitment in this area, dramatically \nincreasing our funding, dramatically increasing our personnel, and \ndramatically increasing our technological capability. It is very likely \nthat within the next year--in fact, it is probable, not likely--the \nresults of this are going to become very clear to the American people. \nBut as with many things--the perception that the border remains an open \nsieve, which it was and it shouldn't have been, but it was, especially \nalong the southern border; and the perception that we don't have in \nplace the technology to protect ourselves, which we didn't; the \nperception that we had not adequately upgraded the Coast Guard to do \nits job, which we hadn't--all remain the perception in the marketplace, \nand understandably so.\n  But the facts on the ground are that we are significantly upgrading \nour capabilities along the borders; that we have significantly upgraded \nour technological capability and we are continuing to expand that \ndramatically; that we are significantly improving the capacity of the \nCoast Guard, and that systems such as US-VISIT, which basically tracks \nwho is coming into the country through a fingerprint process, are up \nand running and appear to be giving us significant results.\n  So I think we should talk about the good that is happening and our \nefforts to do the right thing along the borders, which is secure them \nand the progress that we are making. We should recognize that although \nwe are not there yet, we are clearly on a path toward accomplishing our \ngoal, which is to make sure that the people who come into this country, \nfirst, come in legally and, secondly, when they come in they do us no \nharm and their purpose is to do us no harm; and thirdly, that the \nproduct that is coming into this country is for the purpose of \ncommerce, not for the purpose of harming us.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, it is disheartening to be back on the floor \nof the Senate again to talk about the looming humanitarian catastrophe \nin the Darfur region of Sudan. Despite the partial peace agreement \nsigned in May between the Sudanese Government and one rebel faction, \nthe 3-year civil war\n\n[[Page S9693]]\n\nin Darfur has intensified in recent months. By any account, the \nsituation is rapidly deteriorating.\n  Today, Darfur faces a more complex and brutal environment where rebel \ngroups have splintered, and one has joined forces with the Sudanese \nArmy, strengthening jingaweit militias that have long used rape, murder \nand mayhem to gain control of the region.\n  On August 28, Sudanese Government forces launched a major offensive \nin Darfur to finish off any opposing rebels, in direct violation of the \nDarfur Peace Agreement and cease-fire accord. As a result, tens of \nthousands more civilians have been forcibly displaced, bringing the \ntotal to more than 2 million people. And, of course, for those who have \nbeen displaced, disease and dysentery are rampant, causing the death \nrate to increase.\n  Relief organizations that have not already left the region face near \nimpossible hurdles to reach hundreds of thousands of desperate people \nin need of food, water, and medical attention who are also vulnerable \nto the intensifying and indiscriminate aerial bombings. It is a scene \nstraight out of Hell.\n  The well-intentioned, 7,000-member African Union peacekeeping force \nis understaffed, under-equipped, and has been unable to stop the \nviolence in Darfur. The fact is they don't even have the \ncommunications, airlift, mobility, or support that most military would \nhave. Estimates of the number of people who have died from war and \ndisease in Darfur range as high as 450,000. That is 75 percent of the \npopulation of my own State of Vermont.\n  The United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 1706 that \nwould replace the African Union force with a much larger U.N. force \nempowered to protect civilians. The Sudanese Government not only \nrejected the resolution but demanded that the African Union withdraw \nfrom the country after its mandate expires at the end of this month.\n  While the United Nations, the African Union, and most of the \ninternational community are united in support of a larger U.N. \npeacekeeping force, the government in Khartoum has repeatedly refused. \nI think they probably fear that the U.N. can pose a challenge to its \nown ability to act with impunity and its own ability to carry out \nmurder and mass extinction of people.\n  It is ludicrous that a lone despot, Sudan's President Omar Hassan al-\nBashir, can obstruct the deployment of a U.N. peacekeeping force to \nstop genocide from continuing in his country. He has even gone so far \nas to threaten to attack any U.N. force that enters Sudan. This is a \nman who has made it very clear he supports the genocide and will try to \nstop anybody who wants to bring a halt to it.\n  Despite the Bush administration's diplomatic efforts in pressing for \nurgent international intervention to ease the Darfur crisis, China and \nRussia managed to thwart passage of a stronger U.N. Security Council \nresolution. And on August 20, the Arab League Committee on Sudan backed \nthe Sudanese President's refusal of a U.N. peacekeeping force. They \nfurther distanced themselves from any responsibility for the situation \nin Darfur. It is amazing. People are dying. People are being killed. \nThey are being raped. They are being murdered. They are being starved \nand they are dying of all kinds of diseases. Nobody takes \nresponsibility. All the forces that can do something about it--Russia, \nChina, the Arab League, Sudan itself, that could stop this--wash their \nhands of it.\n  The diplomatic inertia on Darfur is illustrative of just how much \nAmerica's credibility and influence has eroded in the eyes of the \nworld, largely because of our misguided policy in Iraq. We can't \nthreaten anybody. We can't cajole anybody. We have lost our \ncredibility. We have squandered the trust and confidence of our allies, \nparticularly those in the Arab world, and now the administration's \nleverage with which to solve other regional and global crises has \nweakened. Darfur is one example. The impasse over Iran's nuclear \nprogram is another.\n  It is tragic how much damage this administration's policies have \ncaused to America's leadership on so many issues that require the \ncooperation and support of other nations. The price in Darfur is an \nemboldened Sudanese regime that has managed to defy U.S. diplomatic \npressure and the deaths of thousands of innocent people. Urgent and \nimmediate action is essential to save Darfur from further catastrophe.\n  First, the President will today finally appoint a Presidential \nSpecial Envoy to Sudan. Many of us here, myself included, called for \nthe designation of a Special Envoy for Sudan for months, so this long \noverdue decision is welcome.\n  Secondly, although the African Union troops are too few and lightly \nequipped to stop the violence, they are serving as witnesses for the \nrest of the world at a time when the government in Khartoum commits \natrocities and makes it more difficult for humanitarian organizations \nand journalists to operate.\n  The United States and other nations must continue to support the \nAfrican Union until a U.N. peacekeeping force is deployed, knowing that \ncould take 4 to 6 months.\n  There should be no doubt that our first priority is to get U.N. \npeacekeepers on the ground as soon as possible. But in the interim, if \nAfrican Union troops are forced to leave at the end of September, the \nlast line of protection will be lost and an even worse period of \nlawlessness and slaughter will begin.\n  Third, the administration should call upon the European Union and \nUnited Nations Security Council to impose financial, travel, and \ndiplomatic sanctions against the Sudanese leadership, rebel forces, and \nothers responsible for the atrocities in Darfur.\n  Fourth, we must increase diplomatic pressure on countries friendly to \nKhartoum--particularly Russia, China, members of the Arab League--to \nuse their influence to convince Sudan to support a United Nations \npeacekeeping force. If they don't, Russia, China, and members of the \nArab League also have to bear complicity for genocide. Unfortunately, \nthese are the same countries where our own influence has weakened \ndramatically over the past 5 years.\n  Fifth, the administration should urge all United Nations member \nstates to accelerate implementation of Security Council Resolution 1706 \nfor the deployment of U.N. peacekeepers to Darfur. The White House \nshould be working vigorously to persuade other countries to commit \ntroops and funds for the U.N. force.\n  Finally, in circumstances such as these, the United Nations should be \nempowered to deploy troops to prevent the mass murder of civilians, \nirrespective of stubborn, self-serving opposition of the government of \nthe country.\n  When a country's corrupt, abusive leader, lacking any legitimate \nmandate from the people, flagrantly violates U.N. resolutions and a \ncease-fire agreement and embarks on a scorched Earth campaign which \nthreatens the lives of countless innocent people, the U.N. should be \nable to go in.\n  If Darfur was not in Africa but it was in Europe, we would have \nresponded differently. Although belated, our response, as the leader of \nNATO, to the ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia put a quick end \nto that ethnic cleansing.\n  Darfur is on a different continent, but the forcefulness of our \nresponse to genocide should not depend on where genocide occurs or the \nrace or ethnicity or nationality of the victims. Human beings are \ndying, irrespective of their color or their ethnicity or their \nnationality. The United States should stand up and do all we can to \nstop genocide.\n  I have no illusions about the difficulties of ending this conflict, \nnor do I question the sincerity of those who tried. But the efforts so \nfar have been woefully inadequate. The situation calls for more \nintensive, sustained, high-level attention than our country and other \ncountries have provided so far. It is genocide whether it is White \npeople or Black people, whether it is Europeans or Africans. Genocide \nis genocide.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/19/senate-section/article/S9693-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9693-S9694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am going to speak about the Oman Free \nTrade Agreement, but I wanted to first respond to my colleague from New \nHampshire who was on the floor of the Senate earlier this morning \nsaying there is no problem with respect to what we are accomplishing \nhere. He listed various accomplishments. He said: The only things we \ncannot accomplish are the things we are obstructed\n\n[[Page S9694]]\n\nfrom accomplishing because the minority will not let us.\n  First of all, that is not the case because, with respect to oversight \nhearings--which was the subject I raised and my colleague from Illinois \nraised this morning, oversight hearings--nobody is obstructing anybody \nfrom holding oversight hearings. That is the responsibility of the \ncommittees and the chairmen of the committees, to hold oversight \nhearings.\n  I have held some in the Democratic Policy Committee because the \nregular committees won't hold them, but let me describe a few of the \nthings I have found in the hearings I have held--some big, some small, \nall of them, in my judgment, cheating American taxpayers: Contractors \nin Iraq paying $45 for a case of Coca-Cola; contractors in Iraq paying \n$7,500 for a 1-month lease on an SUV; contractors in Iraq who are \nbuying towels for the troops, and instead of buying the hand towels for \nour troops to use that would cost a relatively small amount of money, \nthey triple the amount that the taxpayers pay for these hand towels for \nour soldiers because they want the company name on them, Kellogg Brown \nand Root, embroidered on the towels. So they triple the cost of the \ntowels.\n  Henry Bunting came and testified about that. He said he was the \npurchaser. They said: Purchase the towels with the embroidered name of \nour company on it. He said it costs more. They said: Don't bother about \nthat; it doesn't matter. It is a cost-plus contract. The taxpayer pays \nfor it.\n  The list of abuses is endless. At any point along the way did anybody \nsay we ought to look into this, issue subpoenas? No, no; dead silence.\n  Twenty-five tons, 50,000 pounds, of nails are laying in the sands of \nIraq because the contractor ordered the wrong size. What did they do? \nDumped them out. It doesn't matter, the taxpayers are paying for all of \nthat.\n  There were $85,000 new trucks left to be torched, put on fire on the \nside of the road because they had a flat tire and they did not have a \ntool to fix them. The contractor says: That is not a problem. The \ntaxpayers will pay for that.\n  Serving food to the soldiers? The contractor that gets the contract \nto provide food for the soldiers is providing food that has out-of-date \nstamps on the food. It doesn't matter. Serve it to the soldiers anyway.\n  Yesterday, a woman came forward who worked in Iraq, as I mentioned \nearlier today, Mrs. McBride. She said they were charging the Government \nfive times the amount of money, five times the billings of the number \nof soldiers who were using the recreational facilities. They were \ndouble counting and triple counting and, in some cases, submitting \nforms with five times the number of people. Why? To inflate the cost, \nto extract money from the American taxpayer.\n  All of this is going on and nobody seems to care. Oversight hearings? \nYou show me where the oversight hearings have been held. Show me. They \nhave not been held because nobody wants to embarrass anybody around \nhere. We have one-party rule--in the White House, House, Senate. Nobody \nwants to embarrass anybody.\n  You have sole-source, no-bid contracts given at the Pentagon. The top \ncivilian official, the top person in the Pentagon who rose to the top \ncivilian level in the Pentagon as a contracting officer, who everyone \nsaid is one of the finest contracting officers in the Pentagon, do you \nknow what she said? She said: The awarding of these sole-source, no-bid \ncontracts to Halliburton is the most substantial abuse that I have seen \nin my service in the public arena.\n  What happened to her? Nobody cares.\n  Under the reconstruction program, I am told, we, the American \ntaxpayers, spent $18 billion for reconstruction for Iraq. We ordered an \nair conditioner for a room in Iraq, and then it went to a contractor, a \nsubcontractor, another subcontractor, and pretty soon the American \ntaxpayer paid for air conditioners and that room now has a ceiling \nfan--yes, a ceiling fan. It is just unbelievable what is going on. \nAgain, nobody seems to care.\n\n  I mentioned before that in the 1940s, Harry Truman was a Senator in \nthis Chamber, and he put together the Truman Committee. It was \nbipartisan. They went after waste, fraud, and abuse. They wouldn't \ntolerate it. I am sure Franklin Delano Roosevelt was furious that a \nCongress was nipping at his heels, a Congress of his own party nipping \nat his heels on these issues. It didn't matter. Harry Truman, \nRepublicans and Democrats together, went after it.\n  I proposed three or four times in the Senate to have votes to \nestablish a select committee to do just that, but, sorry, no dice. \nNobody wants anything to do with this issue.\n  I will come to the floor and give a list of what we have discovered \nin 10 hearings and see if anybody stands up to say: Yes, that makes \nsense; we support all that. None of this makes sense. It cries out, it \nbegs for leadership. This undermines American soldiers and it cheats \nAmerican taxpayers and it is unbelievable what is going on and nobody \nseems to care very much. So when I have the opportunity to hear someone \nsay: We haven't held oversight hearings because we have been \nobstructed--nonsense. Or: We have held oversight hearings--nonsense \nagain. Neither excuse washes. Nobody is minding the store. Nobody is \nwatching the till.\n  The fact is, American taxpayers are taking a bath--and it is not just \nthe taxpayers. It is water connected to the Euphrates River taking \nwater to the military installations in Iraq. And, yes, the top American \nin the company, Halliburton, who is responsible for moving nonpotable \nwater to the soldiers in the military installations in Iraq, is the \nAmerican who wrote the report. I have seen the report. What he said was \nthe nonpotable water that is provided to the soldiers for the purpose \nof showering and brushing their teeth and washing their hands and doing \nthe kinds of things they do was more contaminated than raw water coming \nfrom the Euphrates River. And their internal report says: This was a \nnear miss. This was a near miss. It could have caused death or mass \nsickness.\n  This event, which was a near miss, could have caused death or massive \nillness, it has been denied that it even happened by the company. The \nPentagon doesn't seem to be very interested. The company denies it \nhappened, despite the fact that we have it in writing from the person \nwho was in charge and who still works for the company. It is \nunbelievable.\n  I didn't come to talk about that, but when I hear people say there \nhas been aggressive oversight, or any oversight in this Congress--it is \na sham. It is not the case.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/19/senate-section/article/S9694-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I believe I had reserved 1 hour of which I \nhad used 30 minutes previously. The vote is at noon, so I intend to \nspeak for the other 30 minutes, if that is appropriate?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me talk about the Oman Free Trade \nAgreement. There are nine additional free-trade agreements being \nnegotiated right now, nine of them. This past week there was an \nannouncement that the monthly trade deficit is now $68 billion a month; \na $68 billion monthly trade deficit. If ever there was a definition of \nfailure, this is it.\n  So here is what we have: We have the good old boys negotiating trade \nagreements--Republicans and Democrats. They happen to be Republicans \nnow because they are in power, but it has gone on for some long while. \nHere is what you see: Trade deficits, which are\n\n[[Page S9695]]\n\nrepresented by a mountain of red ink--or a deep valley of red ink in \nthe case of this chart--the highest trade deficit in history, an \nunbelievable trade deficit. No country has ever had these kinds of \ndeficits. They will have significant consequences for our country.\n  These deficits must be paid for with a lower standard of living in \nour country. Every single day, we send $2 billion out to foreign \ncountries because we import $2 billion more than we export. That means \nevery single day we are selling $2 billion of this country. We are \nselling America piece by piece.\n  Does this give anybody pause? Is anybody concerned? No. You know what \nwe need to do? Let's do another trade agreement. We have done trade \nagreements here, at this point on the chart, we have done them here, we \nhave done them here, and every single incompetent trade agreement this \ncountry signs up for ends up dramatically increasing our Federal \ndeficits. We are choking on them, pulling the rug out from under \nAmerican workers, shipping more American jobs overseas. And what is the \nresponse of this Congress? You know, let's do more of it. Why? Because \nwe live in a global economy, and this is free trade.\n  I once knew, in my little home, a three-legged blind dog with fleas \nthat they used to call Lucky. Labels didn't mean much to me--didn't \nmean much to that dog either, as a matter of fact. ``Free trade,'' that \nis the label on this nonsense. It is not free and it certainly is not \nfair.\n  This country has become Uncle Sucker on trade agreements. We have \nsigned up to almost anything. Most of our trade is foreign policy and \nsoft-headed foreign policy at that. I am in favor of trade. I want to \nexpand trade--the more the better, but I demand it be fair to this \ncountry. When it is not fair, I think we ought to insist. It doesn't \nmatter to me whether it is Oman or China or Europe or Japan or Korea or \nMexico or Canada, I think we ought to say it is a new day. And the way \nwe are going to trade with you is with circumstances that are fair to \nour country, to our workers, and to our country's interests.\n  Trade ought to be mutually beneficial. When we sign up to trade with \nsomebody, it ought to be mutually beneficial.\n  Let me tell you what is coming next year. Next year everyone in this \ncountry will have an opportunity to start buying Chinese cars because \nChina has announced that they intend to start shipping Chinese \nautomobiles to the U.S. marketplace. We have a trade agreement with \nChina about cars. Let me describe what it is.\n  It says: China, when you ship a car to the United States--it will \nhappen starting next year--we are going to hit you with a 2.5-percent \ntariff, a tiny little tariff, a 2.5-percent tariff you are going to \nhave to pay on the cars you ship into our marketplace. And, by the way, \nany American cars that we send to China next year, we agree we will pay \na 25-percent tariff.\n  So a country with whom we have a $2.5 billion trade deficit, we \nsigned up, on bilateral automobile trade, that they should be able to \ncharge a tariff 10 times higher on automobiles when we try to sell a \ncar in their country. That is unbelievably incompetent. That is what \nour country has agreed to.\n\n  That is just one little piece. Most people wouldn't know about \ndealing with bilateral automobile trade. It affects American jobs. It \npulls the rug out from under our workers. That is just one. There are \ndozens and dozens of similar examples.\n  Since I am speaking about automobiles, let me describe the situation \nwith Korea. South Korea sent us over 700,000 cars last year. I will \nshow you the chart. South Korea sent 730,000 cars last year into our \nmarketplace. Do you know how many American cars we sold in South Korea? \nWe sold them just 4,251 cars. Is it because they don't want American \ncars? No. It's because the Koreans largely closed their market to our \nproduct even as we opened our markets with theirs. Do we do anything \nabout it? No. We sit around twiddling our thumbs--sucking our thumbs in \nsome cases--and lament that this is going on. It is an unbelievable \nfailure.\n  Ninety-nine percent of the cars driven on the streets of South Korea \nare Korean-made cars. Why is that the case? That is exactly the way \nthey want it, and that is the way it will stay because our country \ndoesn't seem to care. We sign up to all of these trade agreements. In \nfact, we are doing a new agreement with Korea now. That is one of the \nnine. Does anyone really care about fair trade?\n  So in this context, let me talk about Oman now.\n  There are about 400 organizations, ranging from the League of Rural \nVoters to the National Farmers Union to the Sierra Club to the AFL-CIO, \nabout 400 organizations have come out in opposition to this trade \nagreement. What is the reason for that? Let me describe it with a \nletter which many of them signed which says the following:\n\n       Like NAFTA and CAFTA, OFTA [the Oman Free Trade \n     Agreement]--fails to include any meaningful labor and \n     environmental protections. The lack of effective labor \n     provisions in OFTA is particularly significant in light of \n     the recent revelations of massive labor abuses in Jordan--a \n     Nation with which the United States has a free trade \n     agreement. These violations involve widespread human \n     trafficking, 20-hour workdays and widespread failure to pay \n     back wages. More troubling is the fact the Oman FTA contains \n     weaker labor provisions than the Jordan FTA.\n\n  Let me describe what is going on in Jordan. This is actually a New \nYork Times piece. I have actually spoken to the people who went to \nJordan and saw these sweatshops.\n\n       Propelled by a free trade agreement with the United States, \n     apparel manufacturing is booming in Jordan, its exports to \n     America soaring twenty-fold in the last 5 years.\n       But some foreign workers in Jordanian factories that \n     produce garments for Target, Wal-Mart and other American \n     retailers are complaining of dismal working conditions--20-\n     hour days, of not being paid for months, and of being hit by \n     supervisors and jailed when they complained.\n\n  Here is what happens in Jordan. They fly in so-called guest workers \nfrom Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, put them in a corner of Jordan in \nsweatshops, in factories with closed doors, and then they fly in \nChinese textiles, and in sweatshop conditions, with imported workers \nfrom Bangladesh and imported textiles from China, they produce products \nwhich they ship to the United States.\n  Let me describe some of the conditions. Some of these workers \nimported from Bangladesh were promised $120 a month but in some cases \nwere hardly paid at all. One worker was paid $50 for 5 months of work. \nForty-hour shifts were common. Let me say that again. Forty-hour \nshifts--not weeks--were common. Forty-hour shifts in those sweatshops \napparently replaced the 40-hour workweek. There were frequent beatings \nof any workers who complained.\n  What is the relevance of all this to an Oman Free Trade Agreement? \nFirst of all, the country of Oman has about 3 million people. Of that \nrather small population, over one-half million are actually foreign \nguest workers. The majority of Oman workers involved in manufacturing \nand construction are not from Oman. The majority of the workers in Oman \nare foreigners brought in from Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and other very \npoor Asian countries, under labor contracts to work in construction and \nin factories.\n  Here is what our own country's State Department's 2004 Report on \nHuman Rights said about Oman. We are doing a trade agreement now with \nOman. Our own State Department reports that:\n\n       The law prohibits forced or compulsory labor, including \n     children; however, there were reports that such practices \n     occurred. The government did not investigate or enforce the \n     law effectively. Foreign workers at times were placed in \n     situations amounting to forced labor.\n\n  Our own State Department talks about forced labor in Oman. It doesn't \nmatter to the people who put this agreement together. They could care \nless. They do not intend to put in strong labor provisions with respect \nto this trade agreement.\n  There are no labor unions in Oman that would be protective of workers \nor negotiate for workers. In 2003, the Sultan of Oman issued a Sultanic \ndecree which categorically denies workers the right to organize and \njoin unions of their choosing. In some circumstances, workers in Oman \ncan join ``representative committees,'' but those committees, just as \nis the case in China--China is now advertising a lot of unions--those \ncommittees are not independent of the employers or of the Government. \nChina now has unions that\n\n[[Page S9696]]\n\nare part of the Communist government, and the Sultanic decree that \nprohibits unions in Oman allows representatives of workers to get \ntogether but not independent of employers or the Government.\n  By the way, the Sultan of Oman has written to our U.S. Trade \nAmbassador and promised that he will improve Oman's labor laws in \nOctober of this year. That would be next month. How do you calculate \nthat? That would be after the U.S. Congress votes, wouldn't it? They \nare going to improve their labor laws after we have voted. Yes, I guess \nI have heard that before. Maybe this country ought to be suggesting \nthat some of these things be improved before they negotiate free-trade \nagreements.\n\n  Under fast-track rules, the Congress, in its own lack of wisdom, \nsaid: We would like to put ourselves in a straightjacket. We can \nnegotiate agreements and treaties on nuclear arms without fast track, \nbut on trade agreements, we must negotiate in a way that says when we \ncome back to the Congress, we are prohibited from offering amendments. \nSo the Congress actually votes to put itself into a straightjacket and \nprohibit any amendments. I don't vote for that. I lead the fight \nagainst it because I think it is fundamentally undemocratic. But the \nCongress has already done that. That is why there will be no amendments \nto the Oman Free Trade Agreement.\n  Let me describe one other provision in the Oman agreement, and it has \nbeen in a couple of other agreements as well.\n  Earlier this year, there was a big fight in this country about Dubai \nPorts World, which is a company owned by the United Arab Emirates, \ntaking over major seaports in this country--six major U.S. seaports--\nNew York, New Jersey, Baltimore, New Orleans, and Miami--taken over to \nbe managed by a company owned by the United Arab Emirates. There was a \nhuge blowup as a result of that, a massive firestorm of protest. The \nPresident had already approved it, said: It is fine; don't worry about \nit; we think American ports can be managed by the United Arab Emirates \nor the company it owns, Dubai Ports World. I didn't think so, but the \nPresident said it is fine.\n  Brushing aside suggestions from Republicans and Democrats alike, \nPresident Bush endorsed the taking over of shipping operations at six \nmajor seaports by a state-owned business in the United Arab Emirates. \nHe pledged to veto any bill Congress might approve to block that \namendment. But still, in all, there was such a storm of protest by the \nAmerican people saying: With all of the terrorist threats, maybe we \nought to manage our own seaports; there was such a storm of protest \nthat Dubai Ports World announced they had reached an agreement and they \ndecided they would sell or negotiate to sell their interests in \nmanaging our ports.\n  Michael Chertoff, Homeland Security Secretary, said during that \nperiod that the proposed takeover of terminal operations at five U.S. \nports by a Dubai company would give U.S. law enforcement a better \nhandle on security at U.S. terminal operations. Let me talk about \nterminally bad judgment here. Here is the guy in charge of Homeland \nSecurity who says that allowing foreign interests to take over the \nmanagement of America's ports will fully actually provide better \nsecurity for our country. You talk about unbelievably bad judgment. \nEverybody has a right to be wrong, including the head of Homeland \nSecurity. Let's just hope that when he is wrong, it doesn't result in \nanother terrorist attack on this country.\n  Here is what is in the Oman Free Trade Agreement, a provision that \nsays that the U.S. government cannot block Oman's acquisition of the \nfollowing activities:\n\n       Landside aspects of port activities, including operation \n     and maintenance of docks, loading and unloading of vessels \n     directly to or from land, marine, cargo handling operations \n     and maintenance at piers.\n\n  That is the managing of a port. That provision says that we can't \nblock Oman from acquiring or an Oman company from acquiring--that is in \nthe trade agreement. This agreement says we will not be able to block, \nwithout abrogating this trade agreement, a company from Oman from \noperating America's seaports. This alone should defeat this trade \nagreement. It will not because there are 60 or 65 Members of this body \nwho will vote for any trade agreement, almost. This provision alone \nshould defeat this trade agreement.\n  Let me finish by talking about the consequences of this senseless \ntrade policy on jobs in this country. I know it is tiresome to some of \nmy colleagues to keep hearing about this, but I believe it is worthy to \ndescribe where we are headed in textiles, manufacturing, high tech, and \nother areas.\n  You will remember the television commercials advertising Fruit of the \nLoom underwear. It ran a lot of commercials talking about how wonderful \nFruit of the Loom underwear would be for each of us. They paid someone \nto dress as green grapes and someone to dress as red grapes. I guess \nthat is the little logo on Fruit of the Loom underwear. They danced, \nthe green and red grapes danced and sang and played music and various \nthings. I don't know who would actually accept money to dance as \ngrapes, but they found actors to dance as grapes, and they danced right \nout of this country. They don't make one pair of Fruit of the Loom \nunderwear in this country anymore, not one.\n  If you want Mexican food, go to the grocery store and buy Fig Newton \ncookies. They left this country. They went to Monterrey, Mexico.\n  Every Member of this Senate, I will bet, once had a Radio Flyer, a \nlittle red wagon. It was made in America for 110 years. You can still \nbuy them here, but they are not made here anymore; they left for \nChina--all made in China, the little red wagon, the Radio Flyer.\n  If you wear Tony Lama cowboy boots, you might be wearing Chinese \nshoes. I have told this story until everyone is tired of it. Americans \nused to make them, but they lost their jobs. When they were fired, the \nlast job they had was to take the ``American made'' decals off existing \ninventory. They had an hourly job plus benefits. The jobs left our \ncountry and went to China.\n  They still sell these Huffy bicycles in this country, but they are \nmade for 33 cents an hour by people working 7 or 8 days a week, 14 \nhours a day. The last thing those American workers did on their last \nday of work and leaving the parking lot was to leave a pair of empty \nshoes in the parking lot. They left a pair of empty shoes in their \nparking space. It was a way for workers to say to the company: You can \nship our jobs to China, but you are not going to fill our shoes.\n\n  It goes on and on and on--yes, with product after product, textiles \nand manufacturing, high tech. One-half of the Fortune 500 are now doing \nsoftware development offshore, overseas. It is pretty unbelievable.\n  In all of this, we give a tax cut, tax break. We not only manage bad \ntrade agreements to make it easy to ship jobs overseas, we say: If you \ndo that, we will give you a big fat tax cut. Four times I have tried to \neliminate that in the Senate, and four times the Chamber of Commerce \nand others who support that tax cut rounded up enough votes in the \nSenate to preserve it. I find that appalling. Nonetheless, that is what \nis happening with trade.\n  Ultimately, this country will not long remain a world economic power \nif it does not retain a world-class manufacturing base. This country \nwill not continue to expand the middle-class workers if it continues to \nincentivize the shipment of jobs overseas. The construct of many big \ncompanies of saying: We want to produce where it is cheap--China, \nIndonesia, Bangladesh; we want to sell in the established marketplace \nof Los Angeles, Chicago, Denver, Fargo, Pittsburgh, and run the income \nthrough the Cayman Islands to avoid paying taxes--will undermine the \neconomic interests of this country.\n  This country made great progress by expanding the middle class with \ngood jobs that paid well. We debate a lot of things in this Senate, but \nthere is nothing we debate with respect to a social program that is \nmore important than a good job that pays well. We would do well to \nremember that as we take a look at bad trade agreements and prepare \nourselves, once again, as the majority of this Chamber--but not me--\nvotes yes in favor of trade agreements which pull the rug out from \nunder workers, pull the rug out from under farmers, and undermine the \nlong-term economic interests of this country.\n  We have the same chorus of a tired song that is being sung today in \nthe\n\n[[Page S9697]]\n\nSenate about the virtues of another bad trade agreement. This one was \nwith a very small country of 3 million people. I have never been to \nOman. I don't know much about Oman. I am not opposed to the country of \nOman in any way. I am interested in standing up for the economic \ninterests of this country. This is one more chapter in a book of \nfailures on international trade. This country, this Senate, has a \nresponsibility, finally, to start getting it right.\n  I will vote against the trade agreement with Oman and hope that, even \nas this trade agreement will likely pass, as other trade agreements \nhave, an agreement that undermines our country's economic interests, in \nthe next nine trade agreements, all of which are being negotiated now, \nwe will finally see some negotiations that stand up for our interests.\n  It is long past the time, when we have a $68 billion-a-month deficit \nand nearly $800 billion-a-year trade deficit, it is long past the time \nto ask the questions: What is wrong? How do we make it right? What is \nnot working? How do we fix it?\n  This Congress, this administration, seems content, as has been the \ncase now for the last dozen years, in snoring through all of this, \nsaying it will be handled by someone else, sometime later, pretending \nsomehow the consequences do not matter.\n  The consequences do matter. There are significant consequences.\n  One can make a case when the Budget is debated here that whatever the \nbudget deficit is, it is money we owe to ourselves. One can make that \ncase. Economists make that case. It is not a case I make, but it is \nmoney we owe to ourselves. We cannot make that case with a trade \ndeficit. That is money we owe to others. Over one-half of our trade \ndeficit is now held by the Japanese and the Chinese, which is used to \nbuy American property, American stocks, bonds, to buy part of this \ncountry--drip, drip, drip, every day, $2 billion a day.\n  I will vote against this trade agreement and hope the next trade \nagreement that comes to the Senate will be an agreement that fixes \nprevious problems rather than negotiates new agreements. The problems \nin the previous agreements are legend: NAFTA, CAFTA, United States-\nCanada. It is absolutely legend, the problems that exist, and not one \nof them has been fixed. All of them continue to exist. We turn a blind \neye to all them as we negotiate new agreements. That disserves this \ncountry's economic interests.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, two-and-a-half months ago, the Senate \npassed the United States-Oman Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act. \nWe did so because we expected that this agreement will benefit our \neconomy. That is still true. And we should pass it again today.\n  Under the agreement, virtually all American merchandise exports will \nenter Oman duty free. Oman will eliminate most of its duties right \naway. And Oman will liberalize the remainder of its duties within 10 \nyears. This agreement gives free access to the growing Omani market to \nAmerican industrial equipment, medical devices, frozen beef, and snack \nfoods.\n  Oman has also agreed to go beyond its multilateral commitments to \nprovide greater American access to its services markets. It has \ncommitted to protect intellectual property. It has committed to combat \ncorruption and bribery. And it has implemented reforms of its labor \nlaws to address American concerns.\n  I support this trade agreement on its merits. It is a good agreement. \nAnd it will strengthen our ties with a valuable partner in the Middle \nEast. I urge my colleagues to vote for it.\n  Some may wonder why a small agreement like this has generated any \ncontroversy. In part, that is due to the process by which this \nagreement came before Congress.\n  The Finance Committee unanimously adopted an amendment to the Oman \nimplementing legislation. Then the administration rejected that \namendment outright. This disregard for the constitutional authority of \nCongress over international trade only weakens support for the \nadministration's trade policy.\n  But more broadly, the controversy over Oman reflects more general \nfrustration with trade agreements. In Congress, there is deep \nfrustration with the way that the administration has negotiated these \nagreements. And there is frustration with the way that the \nadministration has handled important issues like labor and the \nenvironment.\n  Americans are concerned about job losses. Americans associate \nglobalization with threats to their jobs. And Americans are concerned \nthat trade agreements might erode conditions in the workplace.\n  These issues will come to the fore as we approach the expiration of \nTrade Promotion Authority in the middle of next year. In the wake of \nthe controversy surrounding Oman and other trade agreements, it is high \ntime that we take a hard look at American trade policy. It is high time \nthat we ask ourselves how we can make it work better.\n  For starters, we have to refocus our trade policy. We have to make \nsure that it helps American workers and businesses meet the competitive \nchallenges that they face in the global marketplace. We have to rethink \nthe types of trade initiatives that we pursue in the future. We have to \nbuild grassroots support for trade. And we have to pay far greater \nattention to domestic initiatives to increase our savings, reduce our \ntrade deficit, improve education, and help the workers whom trade \nleaves behind.\n  I look forward to that debate. I look forward to laying the \nfoundation for a broader consensus on trade. And I look forward to the \nday when we can once again join together on the trade agreements of the \nfuture.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I oppose this deeply flawed trade \nagreement. When the Senate passed its version of this legislation a few \nmonths ago, I noted that one group had said that this trade agreement \nis as bad as CAFTA, except where it is worse.\n  The Oman trade agreement is the latest in a series of agreements that \nhave been based on the failed NAFTA-CAFTA model of trade that has \nshipped thousands of businesses and millions of jobs overseas, \ndevastating communities across our country. The record of that model of \ntrade is crystal clear. During the post-NAFTA era, our trade deficit \nhas exploded from $98 billion in 1994 to $805 billion in 2005. And yet, \nonce again we are debating more of the same.\n  As I noted in June, the Oman Free Trade Agreement is stamped from the \nNAFTA-CAFTA cookie cutter. It provides no real enforcement for the \nlabor or environmental provisions. And even the most modest efforts to \naddress the deficiencies of the NAFTA-CAFTA model were rejected by the \nWhite House. Most notably, an attempt by the Senate Finance Committee \nto deny trade benefits for products made with slave labor, approved \nunanimously by the Committee on an 18-to-0 vote, was rejected by the \nadministration, which submitted this agreement without that reasonable \nprotection.\n  You don't have to be a trade expert to know that our trade policy is \nalarmingly bad. When even the most reasonable addition is proposed by \nthe Finance Committee to deny preferential benefits for products made \nby slaves, the administration refuses to include it.\n  Mr. President, any consultative role Congress was to have as part of \nthe fast-track process has been shown to be meaningless. I very much \nhope my colleagues will remember this when we consider legislation to \nrenew fast-track implementing authority. Until then, we should reject \nthis and similarly flawed trade agreements.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to use my 10 minutes that \nhas been allocated to me on the Oman Free Trade Agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5684, \nthe United States-Oman Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act. The \nUnited\n\n[[Page S9698]]\n\nStates-Oman Free Trade Agreement will benefit U.S. farmers, workers, \nand businesses. It will lead to economic growth and enhance the \npredictability of the rule of law in Oman, a reliable ally of the \nUnited States in the Middle East.\n  The United States-Oman Free Trade Agreement will also serve as a \nmodel for other free-trade agreements in the Middle East.\n  In this way, the United States-Oman Free Trade Agreement will \ncontribute to the formation of a Middle East free trade area, a \ndevelopment that would provide major economic and political benefits \nfor the United States.\n  Let me begin by discussing the economic gains that this agreement \nwill bring to the United States. On the day that the agreement goes \ninto effect, Oman will no longer impose any tariffs on U.S.-produced \nconsumer and industrial products. The agreement will also benefit U.S. \nfarmers as some 87 percent Oman's tariff lines will go to zero for U.S. \nagricultural products on day one of the agreement. Oman's remaining \ntariffs on U.S. farm products will be phased out over 10 years.\n  In addition, the United States-Oman Free Trade Agreement will result \nin substantial improvements in market access for U.S. service providers \nand new protections for U.S. investors.\n  Given the benefits that it will provide to the United States, the \nagreement has been endorsed by groups as varied as the American Farm \nBureau Federation, the American Chemistry Council, the Association of \nEquipment Manufacturers, the National Foreign Trade Council, and the \nUnited States-Middle East Free Trade Coalition, an entity consisting of \nover 110 U.S. companies and associations supporting trade expansion in \nthe Middle East.\n  The United States-Oman Free Trade Agreement will result in new market \nopportunities for farmers, workers, and businesses throughout the \nUnited States, including those in Iowa.\n  For example, the Midamar Corporation--a small business located in \nCedar Rapids, IA, that specializes in halal foods--anticipates that the \nUnited States-Oman Free Trade Agreement will lead to new sales of Iowa-\nproduced foods in Oman. Profit margins in the food sector are very low, \nand Oman's current average applied tariff of 5 percent on many of \nMidamar's products cuts into the company's profits.\n  With Oman's tariffs on many of Midamar's products going to zero on \nday one of the agreement, Midamar will have significantly improved \naccess to the Omani market immediately upon implementation of the \nUnited States-Oman Free Trade Agreement.\n  At least two other Iowa businesses expect to benefit from the free-\ntrade agreement. The HNI Corporation of Muscatine is the second largest \nmanufacturer of office furniture in North America, and HNI is \nspecifically targeting the fast-growing market of the Middle East. HNI \nanticipates that the agreement will provide improved opportunities for \nit to sell its products in Oman.\n  Likewise, Lennox--which manufactures residential heating and cooling \nproducts in Marshalltown--predicts that it will gain from the United \nStates-Oman Free Trade Agreement. Thus, the United States-Oman Free \nTrade Agreement could have a direct impact on Iowans in Cedar Rapids, \nMuscatine, and Marshalltown. This agreement will benefit people in \nother States as well.\n  I am confident that the Oman Free Trade Agreement will ultimately \nlead to new market access opportunities for American products in yet \nmore Middle Eastern countries. President Bush is advocating the \ndevelopment of a United States-Middle East free trade area by 2013, and \nthe United States-Oman Free Trade Agreement is another building block \ntoward the accomplishment of this goal.\n  The United States has already implemented free-trade agreements with \nfour other countries in the Middle East--Bahrain, Israel, Jordan, and \nMorocco.\n  A completed United States-Middle East free trade area would result in \nsignificantly improved market access for U.S. farm, consumer, and \nindustrial products in a region of the world populated by 350 million \npeople that is growing quickly.\n  Such an arrangement would also benefit people throughout the Arab \nworld by providing needed economic reforms. So a United States-Middle \nEast free trade area is in the best interests of the people of the \nMiddle East, and it would advance American interests as well.\n  In addition to providing new economic opportunities for the United \nStates, the United States-Oman Free Trade Agreement will contribute to \nthe security of our country. Oman is a consistent ally of the United \nStates in an unstable part of the world. Given that the United States \nis currently engaged militarily in two countries in the region, now is \na particularly appropriate time for us to further cement our close ties \nwith Oman.\n  By improving economic conditions in Oman, I am convinced that the \nUnited States-Oman Free Trade Agreement will contribute to the \nstability of that country. Such stability will help solidify Oman's \nposition as a moderate Arab country and a friend of the United States.\n  The United States-Oman Free Trade Agreement is a strong agreement. It \nwill provide economic benefits for the United States. It will also \nbenefit Oman, a consistent ally of the United States.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 5684, the United States-Oman \nFree Trade Agreement Implementation Act.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

FISHER TO BE AN ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Alice S. \nFisher, of Virginia, to be an Assistant Attorney General.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of a \nperson from my hometown of Louisville, KY, Alice S. Fisher, who has \nbeen nominated to be Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal \nDivision at the Department of Justice.\n  As I remarked at her confirmation hearing last year, Ms. Fisher is a \nbattle-tested veteran of the war on terror. For the last year, she has \nagain been on the front lines of that struggle.\n  She has, really, an outstanding and impressive record. She first \njoined the Justice Department in July of 2001 as a Deputy Assistant \nAttorney General in the Criminal Division. She was placed in charge of \nits counterterrorism efforts. Just 2 months later came September 11.\n  After that horrific day, our Government responded forcefully and \nquickly. Ms. Fisher's role was absolutely vital to that fight. She was \nresponsible for coordinating all matters related to September 11 \ninvestigations and prosecutions. In addition, she headed up the \nimplementation of the USA PATRIOT Act.\n  As a Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Ms. Fisher also headed up the \nDepartment's efforts to combat corporate fraud just when the collapse \nof Enron and other corporate scandals were front-page news. She also \nhelped draft the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and worked closely with the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission.\n  In July of 2003, Ms. Fisher left the Department to become a partner \nat Latham and Watkins, where she concentrated on litigation and white-\ncollar crime.\n  Last spring, Alice Fisher again answered the call to join her country \nby rejoining the front lines on the war against terror when the \nPresident nominated her to head the Criminal Division.\n  As I mentioned earlier, the Criminal Division has many important \nresponsibilities, among them national security prosecutions, both \ncounterterrorism and counterintelligence, combatting gang violence and \norganized crime, prosecuting corporate fraud and identity theft, going \nafter public corruption and protecting kids from child pornography.\n  For the last year Ms. Fisher has impressively led the Department in \nall facets of its operations while serving as a recess appointment. In \nthis capacity, she has further demonstrated her expertise, \ndetermination and integrity. Alice Fisher is a proven leader.\n  Under her tenure, the counterterrorism section has convicted numerous \nterrorists, including Zacarias Moussaoui, the 20th September 11 \nhijacker. She created a new gang squad of experienced prosecutors to \ncombat national and international gangs such as MS-13. She supervised \nthe Enron task force resulting in the convictions of top executives Ken \nLay and Jeffrey Skilling. She heads the Katrina Fraud Task Force which \ncombats all fraud and corruption resulting from this national disaster. \nAs of the end of July, the task force has charged 371 defendants. Under \nher leadership the Public Integrity Section has prosecuted major public \ncorruption cases.\n  In addition, since the beginning of her tenure, the Department has \naggressively prosecuted crimes against children. It is now coordinating \n18 national child pornography operations.\n  Ms. Fisher was born and raised in my hometown of Louisville, KY, and \nis part of a close-knit family. Her father ran a chemical plant. Her \nmother worked the night shift as a nurse. She still has a lot of family \nback home in Louisville.\n  She earned her B.A. degree from Vanderbilt University and her law \ndegree from Catholic University. Her husband, Clint, also serves our \nNation as the Director of Aviation Policy for TSA. Last, but certainly \nnot least, she is the mother of two boys, Matthew, age nine, and Luke, \nage five.\n  In a relatively short time, Alice Fisher has accomplished a great \ndeal. She served her country after the September 11 attacks. She rose \nto become a partner in one of America's most prestigious law firms, and \nshe then chose to forego a more lucrative career in private practice to \ncome back in and serve her country again.\n  Alice Fisher knows that every day she works on behalf of her country \nshe is working to build a stronger and safer America for her two \nchildren and for all of ours. Thanks to her, America is a safer place \nthan it was on September 11, 2001.\n  A man who held the job for which Ms. Fisher has been nominated is her \nold boss, Michael Chertoff, a pretty good lawyer in his own right. \nAlice earned praise when he called her ``one of the best lawyers I've \nseen in my entire career.''\n  America needs Alice Fisher to be confirmed as the next Assistant \nAttorney General of the Criminal Division. I look forward to her \nconfirmation. She is a wonderful person, an accomplished lawyer, and a \nKentuckian of whom all America can be proud.\n  She has support from a number of groups I will make reference to, \nincluding the support of the Fraternal Order of Police, the Federal Law \nEnforcement Officers Association and the National District Attorneys \nAssociation. I ask unanimous consent those letters of endorsement be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 National District\n\n\n                                        Attorneys Association,\n\n                                  Alexandria, VA, August 17, 2006.\n     Hon.

Leahy,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Specter and Senator Leahy: I want to most \n     strongly support the nomination of Alice Fisher as the \n     Assistant Deputy Attorney General of the United States in \n     charge of the Criminal Division and urge her speedy \n     confirmation.\n       Ms. Fisher served her country well as the Deputy Assistant \n     General in the Criminal Division during a unique and tragic \n     time in this nation's history. During the period following \n     September 11, 2001, Ms. Fisher was responsible for managing \n     the Counter-Terrorism Section and worked on the development \n     of policy issues on criminal law enforcement and national \n     security.\n       Since her appointment as Assistant Attorney General in the \n     Criminal Division she has been responsible for the Department \n     of Justice's response to Hurricane Katrina and the aftermath \n     of widespread fraud; the development of a strategic plan to \n     address the burgeoning identity theft problem that confronts \n     this nation; child sexual exploitation issues; corporate \n     fraud; and public corruption issues.\n       Prior to Ms. Fisher's career in the Department of Justice \n     she also served Congress in her capacity as Deputy Special \n     Counsel to the United States Senate Special Committee to \n     investigate the Whitewater Development and Related Matters.\n       Given Ms. Fisher's experience in both the legislative and \n     executive branches of government and her exhibited level of \n     commitment to the Department of Justice I can think of no one \n     who would bring more ability to this position than she would.\n\n[[Page S9700]]\n\n       If you have any questions or concerns in regard to my \n     support of Ms. Fisher please do not hesitate to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Thomas J. Charron,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            Grand Lodge, Fraternal\n\n\n                                              Order of Police,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 1, 2006.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Ranking Member, Committee to the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman and Senator Leahy: I am writing on behalf \n     of the membership of the Fraternal Order of Police to advise \n     you of our support for Alice S. Fisher to be continued as the \n     next Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division at \n     the U.S. Department of Justice.\n       For more than one year, Ms. Fisher has served as Assistant \n     Attorney General for the Criminal Division as a recess \n     appointment. She has diligently served in this role and has \n     coordinated with law enforcement on a variety of issues, \n     including antiterrorism prosecutions, public corruption \n     cases, and child sex exploitation cases. Prior to this, Ms. \n     Fisher served as Deputy Assistant Attorney General of the \n     Criminal Division at the U.S. Department of Justice and was \n     responsible for managing both the Counterterrorism and Fraud \n     Sections at the Department. During her tenure, she was \n     responsible for coordinating the Department's national \n     counter-terrorism activities, including all matters relating \n     to September 11th investigations and prosecutions, terrorist \n     financing investigations, and the implementation of the USA \n     PATRIOT Act.\n       Her management of the Fraud Section included supervising \n     many investigations into corporate fraud, particularly in the \n     areas of securities, accounting, and health care. She worked \n     on a variety of policy matters relating to identity theft and \n     testified before the Senate Special Committee on Aging about \n     the impact of these crimes on our nation's senior citizens.\n       Currently Ms. Fisher's management of the Innocence Lost \n     Initiative, a cooperative effort to prevent and prosecute \n     child prostitution between the FBI, the Criminal Division's \n     Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section and the National \n     Center for Missing and Exploited Children, has led to 188 \n     open investigations, 547 arrests, 79 complaints, 105 \n     indictments, and 80 convictions in both the Federal and State \n     systems.\n       Ms. Fisher's experience as a litigator and policy-maker, as \n     well as her strong, positive relationship with the law \n     enforcement community, makes her an excellent choice to lead \n     the Criminal Division. The F.O.P. has no doubt that she will \n     continue to be an outstanding Assistant Attorney General, and \n     we urge the Judiciary Committee to expeditiously approve her \n     nomination. If I can provide any further recommendations for \n     Ms. Fisher, please do not hesitate to contact me or Executive \n     Director Jim Pasco in my Washington office.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Chuck Canterbury,\n     National President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           Federal Law Enforcement\n\n\n                                         Officers Association,\n\n                                  Lewisberry, PA, August 31, 2006.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: On behalf of the 25,000 members of the \n     Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association (FLEOA), I am \n     writing to you in support of the nomination of Alice S. \n     Fisher for the position of Assistant Attorney General of the \n     Criminal Division of the Department of Justice. Since her \n     nomination easily cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee in \n     May, we are now appealing to you in your leadership role as \n     the Senate Minority Leader to intervene and help bring this \n     important matter to the floor of the Senate for a full vote.\n       It our understanding that this process has stalled due to \n     the unfortunate invocation of partisan politics. As the \n     largest non partisan professional federal law enforcement \n     association, FLEOA would like to see Ms. Fisher's nomination \n     evaluated based on its merit. To that end, the membership of \n     FLEOA is convinced that Ms. Fisher's impressive credentials \n     would result in her being confirmed should the matter reach \n     the floor of the Senate.\n       Why is this matter important to the membership of FLEOA? \n     Several of our members have had the distinct pleasure of \n     working with Ms. Fisher, or have served on one of the many \n     task forces she oversees. Two notable examples are the \n     Katrina Fraud Task Force and the President's Identity Theft \n     Task Force. When you ask one our members about their \n     experience working with Ms. Fisher, the typical response is \n     an enthusiastic thumbs-up. Ms. Fisher has earned the \n     reputation as a tireless proponent of federal law \n     enforcement, and she commands the respect of our membership.\n       In her capacity as the Deputy Attorney General, Ms. Fisher \n     did an outstanding job leading the Enron Task Force. Again, \n     several FLEOA members who were involved in the Enron \n     investigation have nothing but the highest praise for Ms. \n     Fisher. A logical person that objectively reviews Ms. \n     Fisher's long resume of distinguished accomplishments can \n     only reach one conclusion: her confirmation as the Assistant \n     Attorney General for the Criminal Division will significantly \n     strengthen the law enforcement component of our nation.\n       While the threat of domestic terrorist attacks continues to \n     escalate, time does not take pause to accommodate indecision. \n     If we sit back and allow Ms. Fisher's recess appointment to \n     expire, then we become complicit in weakening the Department \n     of Justice. This is unacceptable to the membership of FLEOA.\n       We have reached a pivotal point in our government's history \n     where it has become increasingly difficult to recruit and \n     retain the best and the brightest minds to assume leadership \n     positions. If we don't make every effort to confirm the \n     nomination of Ms. Fisher, then who do we expect to get to \n     fill these important positions? More importantly, who will \n     the Attorney General have to turn to for assistance in \n     initiating and overseeing numerous federal law enforcement \n     task forces?\n       Senator Reid, the membership of FLEOA hopes that you will \n     consider the nomination of Ms. Fisher a priority matter. We \n     are prepared to provide you with additional recommendations \n     and anecdotal support if necessary. Please don't hesitate to \n     contact me or Executive Vice President Jon Adler if we can be \n     of further assistance. On behalf of the FLEOA membership, I \n     thank you for your leadership and your service to our great \n     country.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Art Gordon,\n                                               National President.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the pending question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is the nomination of \nAlice Fisher. The Senator from Vermont has 30 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will use part of that time.\n  Today we are considering the nomination of Alice Fisher for the \nposition of Assistant Attorney General of the Criminal Division of the \nU.S. Department of Justice. We have less than 2 weeks left in the \nlegislative session before we recess for the elections. The Republican \nleadership has once again delayed doing the work of the American people \nso they can consider a nominee about whom many questions remain.\n  We are being required to consider this nomination despite unanswered \nquestions regarding her role in the administration's controversial, \nquestionable detainee treatment policies. Of course, on these \nquestions, as on so many other matters involving torture and detainees \nat Guantanamo, the administration has refused to provide Congress with \nthe information it has sought.\n  As I said 2 weeks ago when the President re-nominated five extremely \ncontroversial choices for lifetime positions on the Nation's highest \ncourts, I continue to be disappointed in the misguided priorities of \nthe Bush-Cheney administration and, in fact, the rubberstamp Senate \nRepublican leadership. I really think all Americans--Republicans and \nDemocrats--would be better served if we used the few remaining weeks of \nthis legislative session to address vital, unfinished business, such as \nthe war in Iraq. That might be something the American people would \nreally like to see us debate, the war in Iraq. We haven't had a real \ndebate on it since we saw that huge sign a few years ago behind the \nPresident that said: ``Mission Accomplished.'' He was dressed up like \nTom Cruise in ``Top Gun'' and put up the sign that said: ``Mission \nAccomplished.'' I guess they decided it was all over; why debate it?\n  It would be nice if we enacted a Federal budget. The law says--the \nlaw says, and I say this to my law-and-order friends who control the \nagenda, my Republican friends who control the agenda--the law says we \nhave to have a budget passed by April. We didn't do it in April or May \nor June or July or August, now September. We are all law and order \naround here, but apparently we think we don't have to follow the law.\n  Of course, we are supposed to pass the 11 remaining required \nappropriations bills by the end of this month. It doesn't look like \nthat is going to happen.\n\n[[Page S9701]]\n\n  We talked about enacting lobbying reform and ethics legislation. I \nremember the Republican leadership having a wonderful press conference, \njust absolutely wonderful--just touched by it--especially knowing they \nwould never bring up the legislation.\n  It would be nice to address the skyrocketing cost of fuel. I don't \nthink any one of us goes home where we don't hear about the cost of \ngas, but we don't do anything about that.\n  People talk to me about health care. We don't do anything about that, \neither.\n  How about a bipartisan, comprehensive immigration reform bill? I \nstood outside the White House and praised President Bush for his \nsupport of a comprehensive immigration reform bill. He told several of \nus in a long meeting--and I think he was passionate about it--that we \nneeded to have one. When a 30-vehicle caravan of Vice President \nCheney's with sirens wailing came up to the Hill today, I don't think \nthey were saying: Let's pass a comprehensive immigration reform bill.\n  But what we can do is controversial nominations--not the items the \nlaw requires us to do but the things the fund-raising letters require.\n  In this case, we have an interesting nominee to be the head of the \nCriminal Division for the Justice Department. She has never prosecuted \na case. She has minimal trial experience. But she is going to be the \nhead of the Criminal Division of the Justice Department. Her career has \nbeen spent almost entirely in private practice.\n  She is a longtime protegee of Homeland Security Secretary Michael \nChertoff, who was in overall charge of cleaning up after Katrina, which \nI know will happen some day. So after being his protegee, she is \nrewarded with the post of heading the Criminal Division of the Justice \nDepartment.\n  I did not block her from coming out of the Judiciary Committee. We \nhad a voice vote on June 16 of last year. But then concerns arose about \nher role, while Mr. Chertoff's deputy, in meetings in which \ncontroversial interrogation techniques used on detainees at the Naval \nFacility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, were discussed and decided upon with \nthe Department of Defense. There remain questions about whether Ms. \nFisher attended those meetings and her role in determining how these \ndetainees would be questioned and treated. What did she know? When did \nshe know it? What did she do about it? They are simple questions: What \ndid she know? When did she know it? And what did she do about it? None \nof that has been answered.\n\n  This administration has yet to come clean to the Congress or to the \nAmerican people in connection with the secret legal justifications it \nhas generated and practices it employs. They can't dismiss these \noutrageous practices at Guantanamo as the actions of a few ``bad \napples''. With the Senate adoption of the antitorture amendment last \nyear, the recent adoption of the Army Field Manual, and 5 years of the \nBush-Cheney administration's resistance to the rule of law and \nresistance to the U.S. military abiding by its Geneva obligations, that \nmay be finally coming to a close. Of course, we can't even be sure of \nthat, given that despite the great fanfare surrounding the law against \ntorture, we had a Presidential Signing Statement that undermined \nenactment of the antitorture law and basically said the President and \nthose he designates can work outside the law.\n  Now, I remain troubled by the nominee's lack of prosecutorial trial \nexperience. There have been people who have held this position--Mr. \nChertoff, James Robinson, William Weld--who were seasoned Federal \nprosecutors. In her case, she would be supervising people who have to \nprosecute and make judgment calls on very complex cases. They would \nhave to decide whether to go forward. She will be the one to finally \nsign off on that, but she has never prosecuted a case. It is sort of \nlike saying you are going to be the head brain surgeon; however, you \nhave never really been in an operating room, you have never seen a \nbrain, but there you go.\n  Even more troubling, perhaps, is the fact that there are so few \nsenior officials at the Justice Department who do have experience in \ncriminal prosecution. I agree with the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Specter, who has noted: The lack of criminal \nexperience at the top of the Department ``does concern me.'' He said \nthat while there were lots of ``first-class professionals'' throughout \nthe ranks of prosecutors, ``there are tough judgment calls that have to \nbe made at the top, and it's good to have some experience on what \ncriminal intent means when you have to make those decisions.''\n  Both Senator Specter and I are former prosecutors. We understand \nthat.\n  I also share the concern of the distinguished senior Senator from \nMichigan, Senator Levin, with the uncertainty about Ms. Fisher's role \nas Mr. Chertoff's deputy in the development and use of controversial \ndetainee interrogation techniques. Despite repeated requests from \nSenator Levin, who is, after all, the ranking member and a past \nchairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, joined by others, the \nJustice Department refused to satisfy Senators on these points. As a \nresult, concerns remain whether Ms. Fisher had knowledge of the abuse \nof detainees at Guantanamo and what, if any, action she took. The \nrubberstamp Republican leadership of this Congress has gone along with \nthe administration and said: You can't have the information.\n  Sometimes holding this stuff back creates far more of a problem than \njust telling the truth out front. If FBI Director Mueller had been more \nforthcoming with me at, or after, the May 2004 hearing in which I asked \nhim what the FBI had observed at Guantanamo, we could have gotten to a \ndetention and interrogation policy befitting the United States years \nsooner than we have. But rather than answer a simple, clear question, \nit is easier to stonewall.\n  If the administration had been forthcoming with Congress in October \nof 2001 when it decided secretly to flout the FISA law and conduct \nwarrantless wiretaps of Americans, we could have avoided 5 years of \nlawbreaking, and we could have had a more effective surveillance \nprogram targeted at terrorists, not Americans.\n  In other words, every time they cover up, things get worse. Just tell \nthe truth, be open, and things get better. If the administration had \nanswered me when I asked over and over about the Convention Against \nTorture and about rendition, we could have come to grips with those \nmatters before they degenerated, as they have, into what has become an \ninternational embarrassment for the United States. Former Secretary of \nState Colin Powell, a former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, now \nacknowledges it threatens our moral authority on the war on terrorism. \nAgain, if the administration had honestly answered years ago, we could \nhave cleared it up, and we wouldn't be in a case where the rest of the \nworld looks at us now and asks us what we are doing.\n  Just today, a Canadian commission, having studied it, reports that a \nCanadian citizen, Maher Arar, who was returning from vacation--a \nCanadian citizen, a Canadian citizen--was arrested by American \nauthorities at JFK Airport in New York. He was held for 12 days, not \nallowed to speak to a lawyer or a Canadian consular official, and he \nwas then turned over not to Canada, which was 200 miles away, but to \nSyria where he was tortured, thousands of miles away.\n  So here is what the United States is faced with. We seized a person \nfrom another country in New York, we don't allow him to speak to a \nlawyer, and we don't allow him to speak with his consular official from \nhis own embassy. We don't send him back to his country, where if he is \nwanted for something they could arrest him--it is, after all, about a \n5-hour drive to the Canadian border--instead we ship him thousands of \nmiles away to be tortured in a Syrian prison, incidentally done without \nthe knowledge of the Canadians.\n  Now, I know how Senator Levin must feel because all of my efforts to \nget to the bottom of this case have also been brushed aside by the \nBush-Cheney administration. Over the years, I have yet to get a \nsatisfactory explanation. The Canadian commission, though, found he had \nno ties to terrorists. He was arrested on bad intelligence, and his \nforced confessions in Syria reflected torture, not the truth. We know \nif you torture somebody long enough, they will say anything you want.\n\n[[Page S9702]]\n\n  The United States should acknowledge what it did, but instead, it \nuses legal maneuvers to thwart every effort to get to the facts and be \naccountable for its mistakes. No matter how egregious the mistake, no \nmatter how many international laws are broken, nobody ever admits a \nmistake around here.\n\n  Now, I certainly understand, if somebody votes against this \nnomination, it may be a vote not so much against Ms. Fisher, but a vote \nagainst this administration's stonewalling and going it alone to the \ndetriment of the interest of the United States and the safety, \nsecurity, and rights of all Americans.\n  Last month, our Nation commemorated the one-year anniversary of \nHurricane Katrina and the devastation it wrought. We haven't done much \nto clean it up at Homeland Security, but it is the one-year \nanniversary. Last week, our Nation commemorated the fifth anniversary \nof the deadliest terrorist attack on American soil in our Nation's \nhistory. These twin tragedies--one caused by nature, one caused by \nterrorists--serve as somber, but ever present, reminders that our \nNation is still not secure. One year after this administration's \nappalling foot-dragging, incompetent, and wasteful response to \nHurricane Katrina, our Nation still has citizens on the Gulf Coast who \ndo not have homes to return to or jobs waiting when they get there. \nFive years after 9/11, our country still lacks an effective \ninternational strategy to protect the American people from terrorism. \nWe need to refocus our efforts and our resources where they belong: on \nproviding real security for the American people. America can do better. \nThe full agenda before us as we enter the final weeks of this \nlegislative session reflects how, even though one party controls the \nWhite House, the House of Representatives, and the Senate--even though \nwe have a one-party Government--these Republicans have failed, at our \nNation's most pressing hour, to provide this country with leadership.\n  Mr. President, I see the distinguished Senator from Texas on the \nSenate floor. I reserve the remainder of my time, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak in favor of \nthe confirmation of Alice Fisher, the President's nominee to be \nAssistant Attorney General in charge of the Criminal Division at the \nU.S. Department of Justice. I am glad to say that Ms. Fisher's \nconfirmation will finally overcome the unnecessary obstruction that she \nfaces in this Congress which has forced the President to reassess her \nappointment.\n  Ms. Fisher is an outstanding nominee for this position. In addition \nto her credentials, she has substantial previous public service \nexperience, particularly in the Criminal Division during a difficult \ntime following the terrorist attacks of September 11. That experience \nwill serve her well as Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal \nDivision.\n  The Criminal Division is one of the most important jobs of the \nDepartment of Justice. It handles a variety of issues, including \ncounterterrorism, violent crime, corporate fraud, and crimes against \nchildren. The Criminal Division's importance to the success of \nAmerica's fight in the war against terror makes it all the more \nimportant that the Senate end this obstruction and make Ms. Fisher's \nappointment permanent.\n  Beginning with her service as Deputy Special Counsel to the U.S. \nSenate's Special Committee to Investigate Whitewater, Ms. Fisher has \nexemplified the attributes needed to lead an organization with a \nmission vital and important, obviously, to the Department of Justice's \nCriminal Division. Prior to her latest Government service, she was a \nlitigation partner for 5 years at the DC office of Latham & Watkins, \none of the premier law firms in the country. She takes from that \nexperience a respect and deep knowledge of the law.\n  Since her recess appointment in November of 2005, necessitated \nbecause of holds on her nomination, Ms. Fisher has served as Assistant \nAttorney General with distinction, honor, and success. She immediately \nrefocused the division's mission in a way that reflects the priorities \nof the administration. For example, under Ms. Fisher, the Criminal \nDivision has made impressive headway in supporting the Nation's \nnational security mission, in combating violent crime, including gang \nviolence, and protecting our children from exploitation on the Internet \nand elsewhere.\n  What is troubling about the debate today on this nomination is that \nwe are having a debate about a nominee who so clearly deserves \nconfirmation. What is troubling about today's debate is that it is \nreflective of the continued obstruction of nominees by Democrats in the \nU.S. Senate. This obstruction has not only affected judicial \nnominations, which is perhaps better known, but also the confirmation \nof important executive branch nominees with significant national \nsecurity responsibilities. Ms. Fisher oversees vital counterterrorism \nand counterespionage divisions. But because her nomination has been \nblocked, these critical components have operated without a Senate-\nconfirmed supervisor for more than a year.\n  Consider the constant refrain from our colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle that this Republican-led Congress is not doing everything \nit can to protect America's national security. Beyond Ms. Fisher's \nnomination, this message stands in stark contrast with the democrats' \nrecord of obstruction on other key national security posts.\n  Perhaps the most inexcusable obstruction pertains to the nomination \nof Kenneth Wainstein, who would head the newly created National \nSecurity Division. Mr. Wainstein's confirmation would fulfill one of \nthe key recommendations of the WMD Commission, the Weapons of Mass \nDestruction Commission. It was the WMD Commission that recommended the \nreorganization of intelligence-gathering components within the \nDepartment of Justice. Mr. Wainstein has broad-based, bi-partisan \nsupport, yet he inexplicably still faces a Democrat filibuster-by-hold.\n\n  We cannot wait any longer for Democrats to release their hold on Mr. \nWainstein. In the 5 years since the attacks of September 11, the \nFederal Government has taken a number of steps to reorganize and \nimprove its resources to better fight terrorism. Our terrorist enemies \nare always changing and adapting, and so must we--if we are to keep the \nupper hand in the war on terror.\n  Some 15 months ago, the WMD Commission recognized that improvements \nshould be made to the Department of Justice's national security \napparatus. They recommended a reorganization of the Department and the \ncreation of a new National Security Division--which would bring \ntogether under one umbrella all the national security components of the \nDOJ.\n  The National Security Division that Mr. Wainstein would oversee is \ncritically important to the Department--and to America's national \nsecurity. It will integrate the key national security components--the \nCounterterrorism and Counterespionage Sections of the Criminal Division \nand the Office of Intelligence Policy and Review, which has the lead \nrole in implementing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, FISA--\nunder the leadership of a single Assistant Attorney General. Bringing \ntogether these mission-critical entities will enhance our ability to \nfulfill our top priority of preventing, disrupting and defeating \nterrorist acts before they occur.\n\n  The President approved the WMD Commission's recommendation more than \na year ago. And Congress embraced the concept and fully authorized the \nNational Security Division as part of the USA PATRIOT Act \nreauthorization. Congress has also approved a reprogramming request \nsubmitted by the DOJ and office space has been dedicated and \nrenovated--but unfortunately, it remains vacant. It remains vacant \nbecause holds have been placed on the nomination and we have seen a \nfilibuster-by-hold. The Department has done everything it can until \nthis Senate confirms Mr. Wainstein. Obstruction from the other side of \nthe aisle, Mr. President, is impeding efforts to improve national \nsecurity. Long-term planning is being delayed and uncertainty is \nbeginning to affect morale. The Department of Justice needs Mr. \nWainstein on board, to provide leadership, vision and guidance. Again, \nlike Ms. Fisher's stalled nomination, Democrat obstruction is impeding \nthis effort to improve national security.\n\n[[Page S9703]]\n\n  But Ms. Fisher and Mr. Wainstein are not the only nominees to face \nobstruction. Just looking back to a few others who were slotted to fill \npositions critical to our Nation's war on terror have likewise been \nfilibustered. For instance, the current Deputy Secretary of Defense, \nGordon England, was filibustered before the President was forced to \nrecess-appoint him. He was eventually confirmed. Undersecretary of \nDefense for Policy, Eric Edelman, was filibustered, recess-appointed, \nand finally confirmed; and Office of the Director of National \nIntelligence General Counsel, Ben Powell, likewise was filibustered, \nrecess-appointed and finally confirmed.\n\n  This obstruction is not limited solely to nominations. Who can forget \nhow proud Democrats were when they celebrated killing the \nreauthorization of the PATRIOT Act, one of the most important anti-\nterror tools for our front-line law enforcement and intelligence \nagents. Democrats also complain that we are not doing all we can to \nsecure the safety of our citizens, and then promote hyperbole and \nhysteria about the Terrorist Surveillance Program, which is well within \nthe President's authority during wartime, to conduct critical \nbattlefield intelligence-gathering against foreign threats to America.\n\n  I think the American people see through this Democrat obstruction. \nBut nominations to critical national security positions should not \nface partisan road blocks. I recently read a newspaper report on the \nnomination of Mr. Wainstein. It reported that the office was ready, the \nphone lines up and the computers humming, waiting on him to start. But, \nhis nomination is being blocked on reasons unrelated to him. This \nobstruction must stop.\n\n  I am glad Ms. Fisher will be confirmed later today and I hope that \nthe Senate will be able to move on to Mr. Wainstein's nomination \nquickly so that we do not leave critical national security offices \nunfilled.\n  In closing, I am pleased that President Bush has nominated Ms. Fisher \nto serve as Assistant Attorney General and I look forward to her \ncontinued service in that post. I ask my colleagues to support her \nnomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I listened to the Senator from Texas, but I \ndo not want to debate the Wainstein nomination today because we have \nthe Fisher nomination in front of us. I would just say one thing in \nresponse; that is, the delays in his confirmation vote are directly the \nresult of the administration's obstruction of Senate requests for very \nrelevant documents. Any delays can be placed right at the feet of the \nadministration that has stonewalled requests for information. I hope \nthe Senator from Texas and other Republicans would join in legitimate \nrequests for relevant information. The documents that are being sought \nare directly related to Mr. Wainstein and his role in the FBI as \nGeneral Counsel from mid-2002 to mid-2003 and when he was the Chief of \nStaff for the FBI Director from mid-2003 to 2004.\n  So the delays here are directly attributable to the obstruction and \nthe stonewalling of the administration in response to legitimate \nrequests for documents. These impediments to votes can be easily \nremoved by simply having the committee chairman join in the request for \nthese documents, but that has not been forthcoming.\n  Today the issue is Ms. Alice Fisher. It is another example where \nrequests for documents and for information have been denied. These are \nlegitimate requests which directly relate to Ms. Fisher and to whether \nshe should be confirmed. I want to get into the history of this matter \nin some detail. I yield myself 45 minutes for that purpose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today the issue of detainee abuse at \nGuantanamo Bay is very much on our minds and in the headlines as we \ndebate how we will treat detainees in the future. In this context, the \nnomination of Ms. Alice Fisher for the position of Assistant Attorney \nGeneral for the Criminal Division at the Department of Justice is not \njust a routine appointment. Alice Fisher was the deputy at the Criminal \nDivision while the abuse at Guantanamo was occurring and while concerns \nabout interrogation tactics were being raised within the Criminal \nDivision at that same time. We are being asked to confirm Ms. Fisher \ntoday with unanswered relevant questions about any knowledge she may \nhave had or actions she might have taken relative to those \ninterrogation tactics.\n  I want to share with my colleagues longstanding unanswered questions \nregarding Ms. Fisher's nomination to this position. The constitutional \nduty of the Senate to provide its advice and consent to nominations is \na solemn one. Instead of respecting this constitutional duty, the \nadministration has consistently sought to thwart it by denying us \nrelevant information.\n  The administration has put up barrier after barrier, hurdle after \nhurdle to efforts to get legitimate information that bears on Ms. \nFisher's fitness to serve in this important position. Why the \nadministration has stonewalled for so long instead of answering \nquestions and providing information can only be speculated by me. Is it \nbecause it is part of an effort to prevent information about \ninterrogation tactics from being provided to Congress, or does it \nrelate directly to Alice Fisher? I don't know the answer, but the fact \nof the stonewalling is undeniable. It is part of a pattern of secrecy \nthat this administration has engaged in in so many areas and so many \nways.\n  The information I have sought relates to what Ms. Fisher knew about \naggressive and abusive interrogation techniques in use at Guantanamo \nBay, Cuba, during the time that Ms. Fisher served as deputy head of the \nCriminal Division in the Justice Department from July 2001 to July \n2003. From publicly released FBI documents, we have learned that FBI \npersonnel raised serious concerns about these DOD interrogation tactics \nat weekly meetings between FBI and Department of Justice Criminal \nDivision officials. I have sought to find out what Ms. Fisher knew \nabout these FBI concerns over aggressive DOD methods; what, if \nanything, was reported to Ms. Fisher; and what steps, if any, she took \nin response.\n  If Ms. Fisher knew of aggressive interrogation techniques at \nGuantanamo and did nothing about it, or she knew about them but has \ndenied knowing, then I would be deeply troubled. The administration has \nrepeatedly obstructed efforts to get this information, information \nwhich is, in my judgment, relevant to Ms. Fisher's suitability for the \nposition to which she is nominated.\n  The administration has literally and figuratively covered up the \nGuantanamo abuses. This refusal by the administration to provide \nrelevant information is part of a larger pattern by the executive \nbranch of denying the Senate the information needed to carry out \nconfirmation and oversight responsibilities. Over and over again, the \nadministration seems to use every means at its disposal to deny \ndocuments or information to the Senate, or to withhold key portions of \ndocuments, or to limit access to information.\n  It threatens to erode the Senate's constitutional obligations and \nresponsibilities and the constitutional balance between the executive \nand legislative branches of Government. Senate acquiescence in the \nadministration's refusal to provide relevant information undermines the \nfundamental principle of Congress as a co-equal branch of Government.\n  The story of the administration's concealing information about \nGuantanamo abuses began during a previous confirmation, that of Judge \nMichael Chertoff in early 2005 to head the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. Judge Chertoff had been the head of the Justice Department's \nCriminal Division, where Alice Fisher served as his deputy from July \n2001 to July 2003. In preparing for the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee's hearing on Judge Chertoff's \nnomination, I became aware of a document bearing on what officials \nunder Judge Chertoff's supervision knew, and therefore about what he \nmight have known, about the mistreatment of detainees at Guantanamo. \nThis document had been made public in response to a Freedom of \nInformation Act, or FOIA, request.\n  The document, dated May 10, 2004, consists of a series of e-mails by \nan FBI agent--unnamed--recounting the concerns that FBI Agents as law \nenforcement personnel down at Guantanamo, had during 2002 and 2003. He \nwas recounting what the FBI Agents saw in\n\n[[Page S9704]]\n\nthose critical years when Ms. Fisher was the Deputy Director for the \nCriminal Division. It spoke about DOD interrogation techniques which \n``differed drastically'' from methods employed by the FBI. It recounted \n``heated'' conversations of FBI personnel with DOD officials.\n  There were heated conversations between FBI personnel and DOD \nofficials about aggressive interrogation techniques. This FBI agent \nsaid that the Department of Defense has their marching orders from the \nSecretary of Defense and that the two techniques again differed \ndrastically.\n  E-mails during those years recounting these heated conversations \nbetween the FBI which was objecting to the techniques being used at \nGuantanamo and DOD officials who were engaged in those techniques \nconfirmed the serious FBI concern about what they saw at Guantanamo. \nFBI agents expressed alarm about the military's interrogation plans, \nsaying in an e-mail dated December 9, 2002: ``You won't believe it.'' \nAlso in that e-mail dated December 9, 2002, they included an outline of \nthe coercive techniques in the military's interviewing toolkit.\n  So you have the FBI on the one hand talking to their headquarters \nabout coercive techniques being used against Guantanamo detainees, \ncomplaining about those details, and in one e-mail dated September 30, \n2002, FBI agents were asked whether or not they could even work with \nthe military interrogators. They were told that FBI agents had guidance \nto work with military interrogators ``as long as there was no `torture' \ninvolved.''\n  Think about it. We read the headlines in today's newspapers of the \ntechniques being used by the Department of Defense, the CIA and the \nDepartment of Justice. These are the headlines that we see in today's \npapers. These are the events from which those headlines flow. These are \ne-mails back in 2002 and 2003 referring to coercive techniques that the \nFBI objected to, talking about heated conversations that the FBI was \nhaving with the Department of Defense over those techniques. That is \nwhat today's story flows from.\n  Yet the FBI was finally told by their superiors that you can be \npresent as long as no torture is involved.\n  FBI agents complained of DOD techniques in a number of settings, \nincluding to the generals at Guantanamo, to the DOD General Counsel \nhere in Washington, and in video teleconferences with the Pentagon. \nAccording to FBI emails, a senior member of the Department of Justice \nCriminal Division was present at Guantanamo at the time of a ``heated'' \nvideo teleconference during late 2002. FBI officials were so concerned \nthat their agents at Guantanamo received guidance during this period \nfrom headquarters ``to step out of the picture'' and ``stand clear'' \nwhen these aggressive interrogation techniques are being used. That is \nhow deep this went.\n  This was all brought back to the Department of Justice when Alice \nFisher was the deputy head of the Criminal Division. And if the \nCriminal Division people were deeply involved in these debates, was Ms. \nFisher involved? What did she know about the aggressive tactics? What \ndid she know about the objection of the FBI agent, which is part of the \nDepartment of Justice, to these techniques? That is what we have tried \nto find out over the last year and a half.\n  The May 2004 FBI document I mentioned describes how senior FBI \nofficials communicated regularly with their Justice Department \ncounterparts in the Criminal Division during the period in question, \nthe period when Ms. Fisher was Deputy Director of Department's Criminal \nDivision. In these meetings, the FBI's deep concerns about techniques \nemployed by DOD personnel were discussed. Efforts to learn more began \nduring Judge Chertoff's confirmation as head of the Department of \nHomeland Security. He had been head of the Criminal Division during the \ntime of these events, from April of 2002 through March of 2003 that \nAlice Fisher was his deputy.\n  Let me read from the May 2004 document. This was the highly redacted \nversion which was available at the time of the Senate's consideration \nof Judge Chertoff's nomination. The document reads in part as follows:\n\n       In my weekly meetings with DOJ, we often discussed \n     [redacted, blanked out] techniques and how they were not \n     effective for producing intelligence that was reliable.\n\n  Then there is a series of blotted-out names of several individuals \nwith the abbreviation SES after the names indicating the individuals \nwere members of the Senior Executive Service. The document states that \nthe named individuals ``all from the Department of Justice Criminal \nDivision'' attended meetings with the FBI. Again, Alice Fisher was the \nDeputy Director of the Department of Justice Criminal Division at the \ntime.\n  The document continues:\n\n       We all agreed [blank, redacted, covered over] were going to \n     be an issue in the military commission cases. I know [blank] \n     brought this to the attention of [blank].\n\n  That was the document that we were given during the Chertoff \nnomination. Clearly, the redacted information--the deleted portions of \nthis document--was relevant. It included the names of senior Criminal \nDivision officials participating in those meetings with the FBI agents. \nThe administration withheld this information during Judge Chertoff's \nconfirmation hearing before the Homeland Security Committee of which I \nam a member.\n  On February 2, 2005 during his confirmation hearing, I asked Judge \nChertoff about this document. In that hearing, Judge Chertoff could not \nsay which Criminal Division officials were named in the document or \neven whether the weekly meetings referred to in the document occurred \non his watch as head of the Criminal Division. He could not recall any \ndiscussion about DOD's interrogation techniques at Guantanamo ``other \nthan simply the question of whether interrogations or questioning down \nthere was effective or not.''\n  Judge Chertoff further testified that he ``had no knowledge'' of the \nuse of any interrogation techniques other than those that he described \nas ``plain vanilla.''\n  We learned a few months after Judge Chertoff's confirmation that the \ninterrogation techniques the military was using at Guantanamo were \nanything but ``plain vanilla.'' The Defense Department investigation by \nGenerals Schmidt and Furlow into the FBI allegations of detainee \nmistreatment at Guantanamo during the period of 2002 to 2003 found that \ninterrogators at Guantanamo could subject detainees to numerous \naggressive interrogation techniques. These included nudity, sleep \ndeprivation, isolation, temperature extremes, both hot and cold, loud \nmusic and strobe lights and ``gender coercion;'' that is, inappropriate \ntouching by female interrogators.\n  The report found that the interrogation of one high-value detainee \ninvolved many of these techniques as well as forcing the detainee to \nwear a dog leash and perform dog tricks; also forcing him to wear \nwomen's underwear; strip searches; and 20-hour interrogations for 48 \nout of 54 days.\n\n  Here is what one of the persons in the Army helping to keep these \ndetainees in custody wrote about her experiences. She wrote:\n\n       On a couple of occasions, I entered interview rooms to find \n     a detainee chained hand and foot in a fetal position to the \n     floor with no food or water, or care. Most times, they would \n     urinate and defecate on themselves. They had been left there \n     for 18 to 48 hours or more. On one occasion the air \n     conditioning had been turned down so far the temperature was \n     so cold in the room that the barefooted detainee was shaking \n     with cold. When I asked the MPs on duty what was going on, I \n     was told the interrogators the day prior had ordered this \n     treatment and the detainee was not to be moved. The detainee \n     was almost unconscious on the floor with a pile of hair next \n     to him. He had apparently been literally pulling out his own \n     hair throughout the night.\n\n  ``Plain vanilla'' is all that Judge Chertoff heard about. But members \nof his Division heard about those techniques, and we didn't know that \nduring the Chertoff nomination because the information was denied to \nus.\n  Other FBI documents include a partially redacted letter dated July \n14, 2004 from Thomas Harrington, Deputy Assistant Director of the FBI's \nCounterterrorism Division to Major General Donald Ryder, Commanding \nGeneral of the Army's Criminal Investigation Command.\n\n       Detailee highly aggressive, interrogation techniques at \n     Guantanamo.\n\n  The subject line in the letter is ``suspected mistreatment of \ndetainees.''\n  The letter describes alleged incidences of abuse witnessed by FBI\n\n[[Page S9705]]\n\nagents as early as the fall of 2002. These include allegations of a \nfemale interrogator squeezing a male detainee's genitals, bending back \nhis thumbs; an interrogator reportedly wrapping a detainee's head in \nduct tape; the use of a dog to intimidate a detainee.\n  The letter describes a detainee suffering from extreme mental trauma \nafter being kept in isolation in a cell flooded with lights for 3 \nmonths.\n  The letter indicates these incidents and other FBI concerns were \ndiscussed with two officials in the DOD General Counsel's office in \nmid-2002.\n  There are two points to emphasize here. These events took place from \n2002 to 2003 when Ms. Fisher was the Department's Director of the \nCriminal Division.\n  These events were reported to top level people in the Criminal \nDivision.\n  The question is, What did she know about these events as Deputy \nDirector of that Criminal Division? That is what we have tried to find \nout since her nomination. That is where we have been thwarted and \nfrustrated and obstructed by the administration in getting information \nfrom them.\n  These are not some unknown people making these complaints to the \nDepartment of Justice's Criminal Division. This is our own FBI people \nwho are strongly objecting to these aggressive DOD interrogation \ntechniques. They were writing in. They were sending e-mails back to \ntheir headquarters about the military's coercive interrogations.\n  One e-mail said, ``You won't believe it''--the techniques used and \nwhat they were involved with. At the same time, FBI personnel had \nweekly meetings with senior Criminal division officials discussing the \nDepartment of Defense techniques. Again, Michael Chertoff was head of \nthat division at the time Alice Fisher was his deputy.\n  Other Department of Defense investigations into detainee abuse, in \nparticular the report of Major General George Fay and the Schlesinger \npanel, concluded that it was some of these aggressive techniques in use \nat Guantanamo which migrated to Afghanistan and Iraq and were part and \nparcel of detainee abuse at Abu Ghraib and elsewhere. If the techniques \nat Guantanamo that I have just described sound familiar, it is, because \nthe pictures of those techniques used at Abu Ghraib became painfully \nfamiliar to us and to the world.\n\n  That Judge Chertoff did not recall any discussions about DOD \ninterrogation techniques other than perhaps whether they were \neffective, never heard of a discussion about abuses, aggressive \ntechniques being used by the Department of Defense, Judge Chertoff did \nnot recall any knowledge, did not have any knowledge about who in his \ndivision might have engaged in such discussions or when those \ndiscussions might have taken place, should not have been the end of the \nSenate inquiry into this matter. If the Senate had access to the names \nlisted in the May 2004 FBI document at the time of Judge Chertoff's \nconfirmation, we would have tried to refresh Judge Chertoff's \nrecollection about the conversations referred to in these documents.\n  The Senate clearly had a right to find out the names of these \nDepartment of Justice Criminal Division officials and ask them what \nthey knew about these interrogations, what if anything they reported, \nwhat actions if any were taken. The Senate was frustrated and thwarted \nby an administration that wanted to cover up what was going on in the \narea of interrogation of detainees at Guantanamo.\n  In February of 2005, Senator Lieberman and I wrote to FBI director \nMueller requesting that he provide an unredacted version of the May \n2004 document referring to the weekly FBI Criminal Division meetings \nor, if a copy was not provided, then provide a legal justification for \ndenying us the unredacted document.\n  In letter dated 3 days later, February 7, 2005, the Department of \nJustice--not the FBI but the Department of Justice--wrote to deny the \nrequest. The Justice Department claimed that an unredacted copy could \nnot be provided because it contained ``information covered by the \nPrivacy Act . . . as well as deliberative process material.'' A few \ndays later, on February 10, Senator Lieberman and I wrote to the \nAttorney General requesting that he reconsider his decision not to \nprovide an unredacted copy of the May 2004 FBI document.\n  Despite repeated requests, the Justice Department refused to provide \neither an unredacted copy of the May 10, 2004 e-mail or information on \nthe names of the FBI and the Department of Justice personnel redacted \nfrom the document prior to the Senate confirmation vote on February 15, \n2005 of Judge Chertoff, the Secretary of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  The Justice Department's refusal to provide this information based on \nthe Privacy Act was a misuse of that statute. The Privacy Act was \ndesigned primarily to prevent the U.S. Government from disclosing \npersonal information about private individuals who have not consented \nto that disclosure. That act is not intended to authorize the \nGovernment to conceal from Congress the names of public officials \nengaged in Government conduct funded with taxpayers dollars. Invoking \nthe Privacy Act to deny the Senate relevant information regarding a \nnomination before the Senate was an abusive and dangerous precedent, \nand we were determined not to let it stand.\n  The excuses used to deny us an unredacted May 2004 document went \nbeyond any assertion that a U.S. Senate has ever accepted from any \nadministration as far as I can determine. There is no claim of \nexecutive privilege, and the document itself has no bearing on any \nadvice given to the President. The particular FBI document that Senator \nLieberman and I sought, and the other documents that I have referred \nto, dramatize the refusal of the administration to be straight with the \nAmerican people and with the Congress relative to the detainee abuse \nissue.\n  The thwarting of congressional oversight over this and so many other \nissues is deeply ingrained in this administration. The executive branch \nis determined to seize any crumb of justification to prevent Congress's \naccess to executive branch documents needed to carry out our \nconstitutional responsibilities of confirmation and oversight.\n  We found out a month after the Senate confirmed Judge Chertoff to \nhead the Department of Homeland Security the redacted portions of the \nMay 2004 FBI e-mail were, indeed, very relevant to Judge Chertoff's \nnomination. On March 18, 2005, the Justice Department finally responded \nto our February 10, 2005 letter, a letter from Senator Lieberman and \nmyself, asking the Department to reconsider its decision to withhold an \nunredacted copy of the May 2004 document. In its May 2005 response, the \nJustice Department stated it had reviewed the May 2004 FBI e-mail and \nprovided a new version of the document, somewhat less redacted than \npreviously.\n  While significant information continued to be withheld, including the \nname of the FBI agent who authored the e-mail, the new version \ncontained new information, including the names of the four Department \nof Justice Criminal Division officials who had regularly met with FBI \npersonnel concerned about Department of Defense interrogation \ntechniques.\n  Specifically, the named Criminal Division officials who, according to \nthis e-mail, were present at those meetings, discussing those \ninterrogation techniques, were Alice Fisher, who served as Judge \nChertoff's deputy, Dave Nahmias, then counsel to Judge Chertoff within \nthe Criminal Division, and two other senior Criminal Division \nofficials, Bruce Swartz and Laura Parsky. Also newly revealed was that \none Criminal Division official, Bruce Swartz, had brought concerns \nabout Department of Defense tactics to the attention of the Department \nof Defense Office of General Counsel.\n  On May 2, 2005, I wrote to Attorney General Gonzales requesting the \nname of the author of that May 2004 e-mail. Who was the FBI agent who \nwrote that e-mail naming those persons? I also requested an opportunity \nto interview both the FBI and the Department of Justice personnel named \nin that document, including, specifically, senior Justice Department \nofficials David Nahmias, Bruce Swartz, and Laura Parsky.\n  I don't think there is any doubt that information would be relative \nto the\n\n[[Page S9706]]\n\nnomination of Judge Chertoff. The administration essentially told us, \nhowever, to trust them, that the information and interviews we were \nseeking were not relevant to Judge Chertoff's nomination.\n  Yes, it was.\n  This saga, the pattern of withholding relevant information about \nGuantanamo abuses continued in relation to Alice Fisher's nomination in \nApril 2005 to fill the position vacated by Judge Chertoff, the head of \nthe Criminal Division of the Department of Justice.\n  Remember, Ms. Fisher was specifically named by the FBI agent in the \nMay 10, 2004 e-mail as having attended weekly FBI Department of Justice \nmeetings where DOD interrogation techniques were discussed. The name of \nthe agent, however, was still redacted. There was still, and is to this \nday, stonewalling and obstruction to legitimate requests of Senators \nwho must vote under the Constitution on the confirmation of these \nappointees.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have a chronology of my attempts to get \ninformation relative to the Alice Fisher nomination printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Chronology Relating to the Nomination of Alice Fisher for Assistant \n       Attorney General, Criminal Division--as of September 2006\n\n       Feb. 4, 2005: First Levin-Lieberman request (to FBI \n     Director Robert Mueller) for an unredacted copy of the May \n     10, 2004 FBI e-mail referring to weekly DOJ-FBI meetings at \n     which DoD interrogation techniques were discussed.\n       Feb. 7, 2005: DOJ response denies the Levin-Lieberman \n     request for unredacted copy of May 10, 2004 FBI e-mail.\n       Feb 10, 2005: Second Levin-Lieberman request (to Attorney \n     General Alberto Gonzales) for an unredacted copy of the e-\n     mail.\n       Mar. 10, 2005: DOJ response provides a revised version of \n     the May 10, 2004 FBI document with fewer redactions. New \n     version includes a reference to Alice Fisher as one of the \n     senior officials attending meetings where FBI agents \n     expressed concerns about interrogation techniques at \n     Guantanamo Bay.\n       April 4, 2005: Alice Fisher nominated for Assistant \n     Attorney General of DOJ Criminal Division.\n       April 6, 2005: DOJ letter to Senator Levin supplementing \n     the February 10, 2005 Levin/Lieberman letter, including third \n     version of May 10, 2004 document with additional text \n     restored. Name of e-mail's author remains redacted.\n       May 2, 2005: Levin letter to Attorney General Gonzales \n     requesting again that DOJ provide the names of the author of \n     the e-mail and other FBI personnel still redacted from the \n     May 10, 2004 document and for an opportunity to interview FBI \n     and DOJ personnel named in that document.\n       May 12, 2005: Judiciary Committee holds hearing on Fisher \n     nomination.\n       May 2005: In response to written questions from Judiciary \n     Committee member Senator Richard Durbin, Fisher states she \n     did ``recall general discussions about interrogations at \n     Guantanamo Bay'' but did ``not recall that interrogation \n     techniques were discussed'' at weekly meetings between DOJ \n     and FBI. She states she does ``recall being aware of FBI \n     concerns about interviews'' but ``cannot recall the content \n     of specific meetings about detainee interrogation at \n     Guantanamo Bay.''\n       June 7, 2005: In response to second set of written \n     questions from Senators Durbin and Kennedy, Fisher says she \n     does ``not recall FBI personnel or anyone else expressing to \n     me allegations about mistreatment of detainees at Guantanamo \n     Bay.'' She states that she ``cannot reconcile my recollection \n     with statements contained in the (May 10, 2004) e-mail. . . \n     .''\n       June 14, 2005: Senators Durbin, Kennedy, and Levin \n     interview Alice Fisher.

Among issues \n     Senator Levin recommends be reviewed is ``the extent to which \n     Ms. Fisher was aware of FBI concerns about detainee \n     interrogations and efforts to convey these concerns to DOD \n     and others.''\n       August 31, 2005: Alice Fisher receives recess appointment \n     from President Bush to become Assistant Attorney General of \n     DOJ Criminal Division.\n       Sept. 16, 2005: DOJ IG Fine letter to Levin indicating that \n     ongoing review of FBI personnel's allegations regarding \n     detainee abuse at Guantanamo will include issues relating to \n     ``the role of Alice Fisher, Assistant Attorney General for \n     the Criminal Division, and other Department officials \n     regarding detainee interrogation techniques.''\n       Sept. 19, 2005: Alice Fisher is re-nominated for Assistant \n     Attorney General of DOJ Criminal Division.\n       Sept. 29, 2005: Minority Leader Reid letter to Attorney \n     General Gonzales requesting that DOJ provide interested \n     Senators with the opportunity to interview relevant FBI and \n     DOJ personnel.\n       Dec. 15, 2005: At meeting with Attorney General Gonzales \n     and White House Counsel Harriet Miers, Senator Levin requests \n     meeting with FBI agent who authored the May 2004 e-mail \n     without DOJ representative present, but offers compromise of \n     having DOJ IG representative sit in on the meeting.\n       July 25, 2006: Senator Specter letter to Attorney General \n     Gonzales requesting to set up an interview between Senator \n     Levin and the FBI Agent.\n       July 25, 2006: Levin letter to Attorney General Gonzales \n     requesting to meet with the FBI Agent with Senator Specter, \n     and an IG representative present, or alternatively, a \n     representative from the FBI's Office of General Counsel \n     (OGC).\n       July 26, 2006: DOJ letter to Levin agreeing to the request \n     to make FBI Agent available to be interviewed with a \n     representative from the FBI OGC present, but asserting that \n     questions must be limited to those related to ``the agent's \n     factual knowledge of communications to Ms. Fisher about the \n     treatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay.''\n       July 26, 2006: Levin letter to DOJ clarifies that Senator \n     Levin intends to ask the FBI agent ``any question which I \n     consider relevant to the nomination of Alice Fisher.''\n       July 26, 2006: Senators Levin and Specter meet with the FBI \n     Agent, as well as FBI General Counsel Valerie Caproni. FBI \n     Agent recalls only one FBI-DOJ meeting where Alice Fisher was \n     present but states he had regular conversations with two \n     Criminal Division officials, David Nahmias and Bruce Swartz, \n     regarding DoD interrogation techniques. The FBI Agent told \n     Mr. Nahmias that the DoD interrogation of one detainee was \n     ``completely inappropriate.''\n       August 1, 2006: Levin letter to Attorney General Gonzales \n     again requesting to interview David Nahmias and Bruce Swartz.\n       August 30, 2006: DOJ Letter to Levin requesting a vote on \n     Ms. Fisher's nomination. The letter does not address Senator \n     Levin's request for interviews of David Nahmias and Bruce \n     Swartz.\n       Sept. 12, 2006: Levin letter to Attorney General Gonzales \n     reiterating request to interview David Nahmias and Bruce \n     Swartz, but proposing in the alternative that they provide \n     answers to questions included with the letter.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Let me summarize these efforts. Alice Fisher was first \nasked in written questions what she knew or heard about these FBI \nconcerns. In her answers, Ms. Fisher stated that she recalled regular \nmeetings between the FBI and Department of Justice Criminal Division \nofficials but did not ``recall that interrogation techniques were \ndiscussed at these meetings.'' She stated, also, that she did recall \n``general discussions'' with Judge Chertoff, who was heading the \nCriminal Division, about the ``effectiveness'' of DOD interrogation \ntechniques and methods compared to the FBI's methods.\n  On June 14, 2005, Senators Kennedy, Durbin, and I interviewed Ms. \nFisher regarding her recollections of FBI concerns about Department of \nDefense interrogation techniques. At that meeting, she stood by her \nstatement that she did not ``recall'' FBI officials expressing concerns \nabout Department of Defense methods at Guantanamo other than general \nconcerns about their effectiveness.\n  To attempt to resolve the conflict in those statements, I wrote to \nAttorney General Gonzales in June of 2005 requesting a response to my \nrequest originally made on May 2, 2005 for the name of the FBI agent \nwho authored the e-mail and for an opportunity to interview the \nCriminal Division officials named in that document, including David \nNahmias, Bruce Swartz, and Laura Parsky. So May of 2005 is the first \ntime I made the request for the name of the FBI agent who authored the \ne-mail and an opportunity to interview the named Criminal Division \nofficials that were listed in that document--Nahmias, Swartz and \nParsky.\n  On July 26, 2005, the Justice Department wrote the Judiciary \nCommittee\n\n[[Page S9707]]\n\nChairman Arlen Specter, responding to Senator Specter's request for \ninformation about the May 2004 e-mail. In that letter, the Department \nprovided a summary of an interview it had conducted with the FBI agent \nwho authored the e-mail regarding what he knew of conversations with \nAlice Fisher.\n  In that letter, the Department said:\n\n       [the FBI agent] did not have conversations with Ms. Fisher \n     nor does he recall conversations in Ms. Fisher's presence \n     about the treatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay. He did \n     participate in conversations with Ms. Fisher and other \n     department and FBI representatives about a specific detainee \n     and that detainee's links to law enforcement efforts. These \n     discussions focused on the information gathered regarding the \n     information and individual and his associations, but not on \n     his treatment or interrogation.\n\n  The letter also stated that the unnamed FBI agent's conversation with \nMs. Fisher:\n\n       . . . focused on the particular detainee described above \n     and predated the broader conversations [in the weekly \n     meetings] about DOD techniques with other department \n     representatives.\n\n  And the letter concluded by expressing the hope that this would \nresolve any outstanding questions about Ms. Fisher's nomination.\n  A few days later, the Attorney General wrote to the minority leader, \nDemocratic Leader Harry Reid, stating that the Department had taken \nsteps in response to the Senator's concerns ``sufficient for the Senate \nto make an informed decision'' on Alice Fisher's nomination. In \nessence, what the Justice Department was saying, they will do the \ninterview; trust them. It is up to them to decide on the sufficiency of \ninformation for the purpose of Senate confirmation. The Department was \nunwilling to trust Senators with the name of the FBI agent who had \nwritten e-mails despite the fact that the Senate, on a regular basis, \nhas access to sensitive documents and information which frequently \ncontains the names of FBI agents.\n  On this important issue of Senate advice and consent to a nomination, \nthe Department was refusing to provide Senators with information \nrelevant to our constitutional duty.\n  I requested that the nomination of Ms. Fisher not be considered until \nI had the opportunity to get the relevant information I had been \nseeking. The administration continued to refuse to provide the \ninformation and instead made a recess appointment of Alice Fisher to \nhead the Criminal Division in August of 2005, and she was renominated \nin September of 2005.\n  In December of 2005, Attorney General Gonzales offered to make the \nFBI agent available to be interviewed by me if a Department of Justice \nofficial could be present. I declined an interview under these terms \nbut told Attorney General Gonzales I could accept having someone from \nthe Department of Justice Inspector General's office present.\n  This led to more delay, more stonewalling by the Department of \nJustice until this past June. With the help of the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Specter, and others, the Justice \nDepartment finally agreed to make the FBI agent who authors the e-mails \navailable to be interviewed.\n  On July 26 of this year, more than 1 year after my request for the \nFBI agent's name, Senator Specter and I, along with FBI General Counsel \nCaproni, met with the FBI agent--1 year, delayed by the administration, \nsimply providing access to the FBI agent who wrote a critically \nimportant e-mail.\n  There was reference made about the Senate obstructing the nomination.\n  (Mr. CHAFEE assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the obstruction here should be directly \nlaid at the feet of the administration which, for 1 year, refused \naccess to an FBI agent who wrote a critically important memo regarding \ndetainee abuse at Guantanamo and whether Ms. Fisher had any knowledge \nof that and, if so, what she did relative to that knowledge.\n  The FBI agent said in the interview that he recalled Ms. Fisher \nattended only one of the weekly meetings, which dealt primarily with \nthe relationship between a particular high-value detainee and the 9/11 \nhijackers. He also stated that he had ``frequent conversations'' with \nDavid Nahmias, counsel to the Criminal Division's head, Mr. Chertoff. \nThat is now the issue which comes before the Senate.\n  Just a couple of months ago, it was finally provided to the Senate \nthat an FBI agent says he had frequent conversations about the issue of \ninterrogation techniques at Guantanamo with the counsel, the attorney \nto the head of the Criminal Division of which the current nominee was \nthe deputy. This is the same David Nahmias named in that FBI agent's \nMay 2004 e-mail regarding FBI concerns about aggressive DOD techniques. \nThe FBI agent added that he specifically shared with Mr. Nahmias his \nview that interrogation methods used on one detainee were ``completely \ninappropriate.'' This is the same David Nahmias I have repeatedly \nsought to interview since May of 2005.\n  Compare these statements of the FBI agent when interviewed in person \nto the assurances the Justice Department made in their July 2005 letter \nabout the FBI agent's discussions with the Criminal Division officials, \nincluding Alice Fisher. The Justice Department wrote that the \ndiscussions at the meeting attended by Alice Fisher ``focused on the \ninformation gathered'' from one specific detainee ``but not on his \ntreatment or interrogation. . . .'' The Justice Department never said \nthat the FBI agent had ``frequent conversations'' about interrogation \ntechniques being used at Guantanamo with David Nahmias, counsel to the \nhead of the Criminal Division, or less frequent conversations with \nBruce Swartz, also a Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Criminal \nDivision. That wasn't disclosed--very critical information, which is \nthe subject now of the debate. Why can we not get questions answered \nfrom David Nahmias, who we now believe, acting as counsel to Chertoff, \nhead of the Criminal Division, of which Alice Fisher was the deputy--\nwhy can we not get David Nahmias to answer questions as to whether he \nshared those deeply held concerns, which were shared with him by FBI \nagents at Guantanamo, with Alice Fisher, the deputy head of the \nDepartment?\n  Following the interview, I also learned of a December 11, 2002, e-\nmail to Mr. Nahmias from the FBI agent I interviewed, asking for his \ncomments on ``legal issues regarding Guantanamo Bay,'' which were \napparently set out in an attachment to that e-mail.\n  The FBI agent's statements to me in that December 11, 2002, e-mail \nreveal that FBI personnel raised concerns with senior Department of \nJustice Criminal Division officials, including David Nahmias and Bruce \nSwartz, that went beyond simply questions about the ``effectiveness'' \nof Department of Defense techniques, which was the only FBI concern \nthat both Chertoff and Ms. Fisher could recall during their \nconfirmation proceedings--the only concern they ever heard about the \neffectiveness of DOD techniques, despite a raging debate between the \nFBI and the Department of Defense about the aggressiveness of those \ntechniques and whether those techniques were abusive and indeed \nillegal.\n  To try to determine whether those FBI concerns were shared with \nNahmias, counsel to the Criminal Division, and were shared with the \ndeputy head of that Criminal Division, Ms. Fisher, I wrote to Attorney \nGeneral Gonzales on August 1, 2006, to renew for the third time my \nrequest to interview these two senior Criminal Division officials, \nDavid Nahmias and Bruce Swartz.\n  This is a highly relevant request. The FBI agent said he discussed \nthe Department of Defense interrogation tactics during regular meetings \nwith Mr. Nahmias and Mr. Swartz. Mr. Nahmias was counsel to Assistant \nAttorney General Chertoff, who was head of the Criminal Division. Alice \nFisher and Bruce Swartz were both deputies in that division. Alice \nFisher was in charge of overseeing terrorist suspect prosecutions. FBI \nobjections to aggressive DOD interrogation tactics were a major issue, \na raging issue, according to numerous e-mails sent back and forth from \nGuantanamo to Washington. This issue was so intense that FBI agents \nwere wondering whether they could even be present during interrogation. \nThey were so intense that FBI agents were writing back to headquarters \nsaying: Can you believe what is going on down there? These differences \nbetween the FBI and the Department of Defense were so intense\n\n[[Page S9708]]\n\nthat there were regular discussions, meetings, debates, and heated \nconversation over the tactics being used by the DOD at Guantanamo that \nthe FBI rejected, reacted to, and shared with their headquarters.\n  All we needed to do--and we still need to ask--is ask, Did Mr. \nNahmias and Mr. Swartz talk to the deputy head of the Criminal Division \nabout those concerns? Did they talk to Alice Fisher about those \nconcerns? Alice Fisher may not recall hearing about those concerns, \nabout abusive and aggressive tactics, but they might recall talking to \nher about them. If the administration has its way, we will never know. \nWe are never going to know whether David Nahmias and Bruce Swartz \ndiscussed with Alice Fisher what we now know they knew about in their \ncapacities--one as counsel to the Criminal Division, of which she was \nthe deputy, and the other as a deputy director of that division.\n  In an August 30 response, the Justice Department ignored my request \nto interview Mr. Nahmias and Mr. Swartz, urging instead that the Senate \nproceed to a vote on Ms. Fisher's nomination. On September 12, a week \nago, I wrote back, reiterating my request for an interview, offering in \nthe alternative that Mr. Nahmias and Mr. Swartz respond to just a set \nof questions I had provided. The Justice Department has not responded \nto this letter.\n  So the Justice Department stalled for 1 year in allowing me access to \nan FBI agent whose information is clearly relevant to this nomination; \nfor 1 year, they stonewalled; for 1 year, they stood in the way of \ninformation coming to the U.S. Senate; for 1 year, they set up a \nroadblock to a Senator who is making a request that is clearly relevant \nto the fitness of a person to serve as head of the Criminal Division of \nthe Department of Justice of the United States. And then finally I am \ngiven access to that agent 1 year later. And when that agent discloses \nthat he, in fact, shared concerns about aggressive interrogation \ntechniques with two other individuals who were working at the Criminal \nDivision with Ms. Fisher, and when I simply say I want to talk to those \ntwo people to see if they shared those concerns with Ms. Fisher because \nshe denied ever hearing concerns about aggressive techniques, of \ncourse, I have been denied that.\n  The stonewalling continues. Obstruction by the Department of Justice \nof access to information relevant to the nomination of Alice Fisher \ncontinues to this day.\n  When I wrote the Attorney General on September 12 saying: OK, if we \ncannot meet with these two witnesses, at least would you ask them to \nanswer questions as to whether they shared this information they had \nheard about these techniques being used at Guantanamo, there is no \nanswer from the Department of Justice. They are silent. The current \nform of stonewalling and obstruction by the Department of Justice of \ninformation that is relevant to this nomination is silence.\n  There is one other important background fact I wish to bring to the \nattention of the Senate. The Justice Department's inspector general has \nbeen investigating for over a year now the allegations by FBI personnel \nof having observed the mistreatment of detainees at Guantanamo, Abu \nGhraib, and elsewhere. The inspector general of the Justice Department, \nGlenn Fine, has assured me that this review will look into ``the role \nof Alice Fisher, Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division, \nand other Department officials regarding detainee interrogation \ntechniques.'' We have been waiting for the IG's findings for many \nmonths. The Senate is about to vote on Ms. Fisher's nomination before \nthe IG report comes out.\n  The delay in voting on the confirmation of this nominee is directly \nattributable to the administration stonewalling on requests for \nrelevant information from the Senate. Ms. Fisher is in place. She is in \noffice. She is in an acting capacity. I have had a standing request to \ninterview former Department of Justice Criminal Division officials, \nseeking relevant information, since May of 2005. This is not a last-\nminute request to talk to Messrs. Nahmias and Swartz. I have made four \nrequests since May of 2005 to interview the two of them.\n  What is new here is that now we know, in addition to them being named \nin the e-mail I referred to, now we know from an FBI agent, the unnamed \nauthor of that e-mail, that he shared with those two men at the \nCriminal Division--one being counsel and one being a deputy director--\nthat he shared with them the aggressive techniques, abusive techniques \nI have outlined, which were being utilized at Guantanamo.\n  Why stonewall? Why not simply just ask Mr. Nahmias and Mr. Swartz the \nquestions I have submitted to the Department of Justice? What is behind \nthis?\n  By the way, I ask unanimous consent that the questions I asked the \nAttorney General to submit to Mr. Nahmias and Mr. Swartz be printed in \nthe Record at this time.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Questions for David Nahmias\n\n\n                             1. Background\n\n       A. What was your position during Ms. Alice Fisher's tenure \n     as Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Criminal Division \n     (July 2001 to July 2003)?\n       B. What was your professional relationship with Ms. Fisher? \n     Did you report to her?\n\n\n         2. FBI Concerns Regarding DoD Interrogation Techniques\n\n       The FBI agent whom I interviewed on July 26, 2006, (the \n     ``FBI Agent'') stated that he had ``frequent contacts'' with \n     you, during which he shared his concerns regarding aggressive \n     Defense Department (DOD) interrogation techniques at \n     Guantanamo Bay.\n       A. Did you have frequent contacts with the FBI Agent? If \n     so, how frequently?\n       B. Were you aware of FBI personnel's concerns regarding \n     aggressive DoD interrogation techniques? If so, what were \n     these concerns?\n       C. Were you aware of FBI personnel's concerns regarding \n     legal issues associated with DoD interrogation techniques? If \n     so, what were those legal concerns?\n       D. Were you aware of FBI personnel's concerns about the \n     alleged mistreatment of detainees? If so, what were those \n     concerns? Did you ever hear of any incidents of detainee \n     mistreatment at Guantanamo?\n       E. Did you at any time discuss FBI concerns regarding DoD \n     interrogation techniques or the mistreatment of detainees \n     with Alice Fisher? If not, why not? If so, please describe \n     when these discussions occurred and what was said.\n       F. Did you at any time discuss FBI concerns regarding DoD \n     interrogation techniques or the mistreatment of detainees \n     with Bruce Swartz, Laura Parsky, or other DOJ officials in \n     the Criminal Division? If not, why not? If so, please \n     identify with whom you discussed these concerns, when, and \n     what was said.\n\n\n                        3. May 10, 2004 Document\n\n       A May 10, 2004 email authored by the FBI Agent stated: ``In \n     my weekly meetings with DOJ we often discussed DoD techniques \n     and how they were not effective or producing intel that was \n     reliable. Bruce Swartz (SES), Dave Nahmias (SES), Laura \n     Parskey (now SES, GS-15 at the time) and Alice Fisher (SES \n     Appointee) all from DOJ Criminal Division attended meetings \n     with FBI. We all agreed DoD tactics were going to be an issue \n     in the military commission cases. I know Mr. Swartz brought \n     this to the attention of DoD OGC.''\n       A. Please identify the FBI and DOJ personnel who attended \n     these meetings. How frequently did Alice Fisher attend these \n     meetings?\n       B. How often were DoD interrogation techniques discussed at \n     these weekly meetings? During what time period did these \n     discussions occur?\n       C. Did you believe that DoD interrogation techniques would \n     be an issue for the military commissions? If so, in what way?\n       During my interview with the FBI Agent, he recalled one \n     DOJ-FBI meeting where Ms. Fisher was present. The FBI Agent \n     stated that the main subject of that meeting was the possible \n     relationship between a particular high value detainee at \n     Guantanamo and the 9/11 hijackers, but also discussed was how \n     the Defense Department was ``pushing hard'' on the FBI on-\n     site commander to ``speed up'' getting information out of \n     this particular detainee and others.\n       D. Do you recall the DOJ-FBI meeting at which Ms. Fisher \n     was present and FBI concerns about DoD ``pushing hard'' on \n     FBI personnel to ``speed up'' getting information was \n     discussed?\n       E. What actions were taken in response to these concerns?\n\n\n                     4. December 11, 2002 Document\n\n       A December 11, 2002 email from the FBI Agent to you is \n     entitled ``Fwd: Legal Issues re: Guantanamo Bay'' and \n     requests your comments, apparently on an attachment to that \n     email.\n       A. Are you familiar with this email?\n       B. Did the legal issues raised in this email relate to DoD \n     interrogation techniques at Guantanamo Bay?\n       C. Did you bring this email to the attention of Ms. Fisher? \n     Did you discuss the legal issues raised in this email with \n     her? If so, what actions were taken in response?\n       D.

What was your professional relationship with Ms. Fisher? \n     Did you report to her?\n\n\n         2. FBI Concerns Regarding DoD Interrogation Techniques\n\n       The FBI agent whom I interviewed on July 26, 2006, (the \n     ``FBI Agent'') stated that he had ``contacts'' with you \n     during the period when FBI personnel at Guantanamo Bay were \n     raising concerns regarding aggressive Defense Department \n     interrogation techniques.\n       A. Did you have contact with the FBI Agent? If so, how \n     often?\n       B. Were you aware of FBI personnel's concerns regarding \n     aggressive DoD interrogation techniques? If so, what were \n     these concerns?\n       C. Were you aware of FBI personnel's concerns regarding \n     legal issues associated with DoD interrogation techniques? If \n     so, what were those legal concerns?\n       D. Were you aware of FBI personnel's concerns about the \n     alleged mistreatment of detainees? If so, what were those \n     concerns? Did you ever hear of any incidents of detainee \n     mistreatment at Guantanamo?\n       E. Did you at any time discuss FBI concerns regarding DoD \n     interrogation techniques or the mistreatment of detainees \n     with Alice Fisher? If not, why not? If so, please describe \n     when these discussions occurred and what was said.\n       F. Did you at any time discuss FBI concerns regarding DoD \n     interrogation techniques or the mistreatment of detainees \n     with David Nahmias, Laura Parsky, or other DOJ officials in \n     the Criminal Division? If not, why not? If so, please \n     identify with whom you discussed these concerns, when, and \n     what was said.\n\n\n                        3. May 10, 2004 Document\n\n       A May 10, 2004 email authored by the FBI Agent stated: ``In \n     my weekly meetings with DOJ we often discussed DoD techniques \n     and how they were not effective or producing intel that was \n     reliable. Bruce Swartz (SES), Dave Nahmias (SES), Laura \n     Parsky (now SES, GS-15 at the time) and Alice Fisher (SES \n     Appointee) all from DOJ Criminal Division attended meetings \n     with FBI. We all agreed DoD tactics were going to be an issue \n     in the military commission cases.''\n       A. Please identify the FBI and DOJ personnel who attended \n     these meetings. How frequently did Alice Fisher attend these \n     meetings?\n       B. How often were DoD interrogation techniques discussed at \n     these weekly meetings? During what time period did these \n     discussions occur?\n       C. Did you believe that DoD interrogation techniques would \n     be an issue for the military commissions? If so, in what way?\n       During my interview with the FBI Agent, he recalled one \n     DOJ-FBI meeting where Ms. Fisher was present. The FBI Agent \n     stated that the main subject of that meeting was the possible \n     relationship between a particular high value detainee at \n     Guantanamo and the 9/11 hijackers, but also discussed was how \n     the Defense Department was ``pushing hard'' on the FBI on-\n     site commander to ``speed up'' getting information out of \n     this particular detainee and others.\n       D. Do you recall the DOJ-FBI meeting at which Ms. Fisher \n     was present and FBI concerns about DoD ``pushing hard'' on \n     FBI personnel to ``speed up'' getting information was \n     discussed?\n       E. What actions were taken in response to these concerns?\n\n\n                   4. Discussions with DOD Officials\n\n       In the May 10, 2004, document regarding FBI concerns over \n     DoD interrogation techniques, the FBI Agent states ``I know \n     Mr. Swartz brought this to the attention of DoD [Office of \n     General Counsel (OGC)].'' In her written answers during the \n     confirmation process, Alice Fisher recalled discussing FBI \n     concerns about the effectiveness of DoD interrogation \n     techniques with members of the DoD OGC, or being present when \n     such discussions took place. Did you bring FBI concerns \n     regarding DoD interrogation techniques to the attention of \n     DoD OGC? If so, please identify any meetings or discussions \n     with DoD OGC in this regard, when and where those meetings or \n     discussion occurred, and what was discussed. Did Ms. Fisher \n     participate in any such meeting or discussion?\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, why is the administration more interested \nin keeping information from the Senate relevant to the knowledge of \nsenior Department of Justice Criminal Division officials, including \nAlice Fisher, of the administration's policies and practices on the \ninterrogation of detainees?\n  What is going to happen again is that the administration's \nobstructionism will result in the Senate acting without relevant \ninformation. I know there will be many who will say we have more than \nenough information, and for many in this body, they have every right to \nvote based on the information they have. But when any Member of this \nbody seeks relevant information on a confirmation, every Member of this \nbody ought to stand in unison behind that request.\n  We are all either going to be or have been in the position of seeking \nrelevant information to a confirmation. We have all been in this \nposition, and many of us will be in this position again. This should be \ntreated as an institutional matter.\n  There is no reason these questions that have been addressed to Mr. \nNahmias and Mr. Swartz should not be answered. I believe this body, as \na body, should ask the Attorney General to have these questions \nanswered. There is no reason any relevant information to a confirmation \nshould be denied to a Senator, providing the information is relevant \nand germane, and clearly this is.\n  Again, I want to emphasize, this is not a last-minute request. This \nis something which arose from a meeting that was held with the FBI \nagent in question back in July. But the request for these meetings with \nMessrs. Swartz and Nahmias were made as early as May of 2005. They have \nbeen asked for on four occasions since then.\n  Do David Nahmias and Bruce Swartz recall the FBI agent sharing his \nconcerns about aggressive DOD interrogation techniques? He does. Do \nthey remember? Did those two senior officials share those FBI concerns \nabout DOD techniques with Alice Fisher? If so, what was her response? \nThese are directly relevant questions.\n  The pattern of this administration is transparent. The administration \nstonewalls on providing requested information. It then accuses Senators \nof delay and demands that the Senate act to confirm their nominees \nwithout the information. The administration follows this pattern \nbecause it works, and it works because this institution allows it to \nwork.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The Senator has 32 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I reserve the remainder of my time, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I think Alice Fisher is a fine person. \nMy colleague and those on the other side are never happy with whatever \nthe President does to try to protect this country.\n  He looked the American people in the eye--after he was elected, we \nhad 9/11--and he said: I am going to use every power I have to \nprosecute, investigate, and stop those who threaten the safety of the \nAmerican people. That is my responsibility as Commander in Chief. I \ntook an oath to do that, and I intend to do that.\n  And he appointed some good people. Now all we have had is second-\nguessing, second-guessing, second-guessing, complaint, complaint, \ncomplaint, hold up nominees; never happy.\n  Somebody has to do something. I remember right after 9/11. What \nhappened? We had a national epiphany. We found out in a spasm of \npolitical activity years ago, just like in many ways today, the \nCongress, to placate critics and liberals and activists, prohibited the \nFBI from talking to the CIA. They prohibited CIA agents because they \nheard some of them had made a mistake somewhere--there were allegations \nof that--that they couldn't talk, when they were out doing undercover \noperations trying to obtain human intelligence in dangerous areas of \nthe world, with people who had criminal records and might have done \nsomething wrong.\n  What happened after 9/11? We said: Why didn't we have any human \nintelligence? What are the problems here? What we concluded was that \nboth of those proposals, for example, were wrong, and we promptly \nreversed them. We changed the law.\n  That is all I am saying about this flap--and I have been involved \nwith it on the Armed Services Committee, and I have been involved with \nit on the Judiciary Committee. We have had 30 or more hearings \ninvestigating the people of this country who are trying to preserve, \nprotect, and defend this Nation. That is who we investigate and \ncomplain about. Do we ever hear about how to better catch the \nterrorists? It is time we start thinking about defending and protecting \nthis country rather than to prosecute and block and obstruct those who \nhave been giving their every waking moment to make us safer.\n  My good colleague from Michigan is such an able Senator. I am sorry \nthis\n\n[[Page S9710]]\n\ndidn't all work out to his satisfaction. The Department of Justice, the \nadministration offered this, he didn't like that. They offered that, he \ndidn't like that. Maybe sometimes one gets to thinking there has been a \nlittle strategy around here--and I have seen it in case after case that \nbegan with Miguel Estrada--for the Members on the other side to demand \nrecords, statements, internal conversations, internal memoranda to \nwhich they are not entitled. They don't want people coming in and \ndemanding everything they said to everybody who came into their office. \nSo they come up with this, and they ask for all these items. Then when \nthey don't get them, they say: Obstruction, obstruction; we can't vote \nfor the nominee. Now they have created an excuse to vote against a very \nfine nominee, when the person is doing an excellent job and ought to be \nconfirmed so they can continue to be even more effective in the war \nagainst terror.\n  I have seen it time and again. With regard to the Sixth Circuit Court \nof Appeals, one of our Senators down here complaining had a whole host \nof those nominees held up for years. The court ended up deciding the \nUniversity of Michigan higher education, affirmative action case with \nfar less judges than should have been on that panel. There has been \nsome real concern expressed about that.\n  Obstructing, holding up, and delaying nominees is not the right thing \nto do. We have important governmental actions to do here.\n  Let me tell my colleagues about Alice Fisher. She has proven herself \nin the Criminal Division. Under her leadership, the division has made a \nnumber of great strides. The Criminal Division has been responsible for \nthe national coordination of all national security prosecutions, of all \nthe criminal cases in Federal court, including domestic and \ninternational terrorism and counterintelligence matters.\n  Alice Fisher has also worked closely with the intelligence community. \nThat is her responsibility. We had too much of a wall of separation. \nSure, she is to be engaged in these issues to assess potential threat \ninformation to our national security and disrupt potential attacks \nagainst this country.\n  Alice Fisher provides advice to U.S. attorneys. I was a U.S. attorney \nfor 12 years. There are 93 of them around this country covering the \nwhole country. She provides them advice on terrorism matters, including \nsuch areas as terrorist acts in the United States and abroad, weapons \nof mass destruction, principles of extraterritorial jurisdiction, and \nuse of classified evidence and intelligence information in \nprosecutions. Alice Fisher also established the Office of Justice for \nVictims of Overseas Terrorism.\n  During her tenure, the division's counterterrorism section, which \nFisher also had previously organized and supervised as Deputy Assistant \nAttorney General, has prosecuted numerous ``material support'' \nterrorism cases, cases against people who have given material support \nto terrorists to further their ability to attack and kill innocent \npeople in this country and abroad. Those prosecutions have been located \nthroughout the country and include alleged planners supporting \nterrorism in Georgia, Ohio, Florida, New York, Virginia, and \nCalifornia; defendants facing extradition from the United Kingdom and \nother foreign countries; international terrorist organizations, such as \nal-Qaida, Hezbollah, FARC--the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia--\nand domestic terrorists.\n  Under the direction of the Attorney General, the Justice Department \nis placing increased emphasis on targeting gangs. Fisher was chosen by \nthe Attorney General to head that effort. Under her guidance, the \nCriminal Division has created the National Gang Targeting, Enforcement \nand Coordination Center, a multiagency initiative led by the Criminal \nDivision, with participation from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, \nFirearms and Explosives, the Bureau of Prisons, the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Immigration \nand Customs Enforcement, and the U.S. Marshals Service. Those are \nagencies she coordinates.\n  The gang initiative will create law enforcement strategies and \nfacilitate operations across agency lines aimed at dismantling national \nand transnational violent gangs. Fisher also established a new gang \nsquad of experienced gang prosecutors who coordinate nationwide \nprosecutions and make them more effective.\n  Under her leadership, in partnership with various U.S. Attorney's \nOffices and the Drug Enforcement Administration, more than 130 \ndefendants were recently indicted and hundreds of thousands of dollars \nseized as part of an international operation targeting the trafficking \nof black tar heroin in the United States. The multistate investigation, \ncalled Operation Black Gold Rush, included arrests in 15 U.S. cities \nand 10 indictments in eight Federal judicial districts, along with \nState charges. More than 17 kilograms of black tar heroin, a potent \nform of heroin that is dark and sticky in appearance, were seized \nduring this operation.\n  As Assistant Attorney General, she also has been involved now, and \nearlier when she was the Deputy Assistant Attorney General, with the \nEnron task force. We remember when everybody talked about Enron that \nsomething had to be done about it. Many people doubted anything would \nbe done about it. President Bush announced that we were going to have \nintegrity in big business, and big business people who cheat and harm \ntheir employees and others in this country will be vigorously \nprosecuted. She was involved in that effort.\n  She supervised the Enron task force. It has investigated that entire \nscheme created by the executives of Enron to deceive the investing \npublic, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and others. The case \nhas resulted in convictions of top Enron executives. Many said that \nwouldn't happen, but they have been indicted, convicted, assets seized, \nand those include Ken Lay and Jeffrey Skilling, the two top people.\n  As a member of the corporate fraud task force--and we need to be \naggressive in prosecuting corporate fraud in America--Fisher \ncoordinates with other agencies on corporate fraud policies and \ninvestigations.\n  She has supervised recent corporate fraud prosecutions involving \ndefendants from AIG, BP, and Qwest. She is not afraid to take on the \nbig boys. She has done so effectively and courageously.\n  She is cochair of the Law Enforcement Subcommittee of the President's \nIdentity Theft Task Force. That is an important issue in our country. I \nhave a staff person, and someone stole her identity and used it. She \nspent years trying to clear her record and get the situation \nstraightened out.\n  Under her direction, this subcommittee is focusing on enhancing \ncoordination among law enforcement agencies, the Federal Trade \nCommission, and others to maximize the Government's capabilities to \ncurb the international problem of identity fraud.\n  Mr. President, I know you served so ably in Florida as a mayor and \nthen later as a member of the President's Cabinet. Florida and other \nareas received terrific losses during Hurricane Katrina. We will \nprobably spend over $100 billion on trying to help that whole region \nrecover and a whole city, New Orleans, that was flooded. Having been a \nprosecutor in Mobile on the gulf coast after hurricanes, I can tell you \nthat fraud does occur. You want to get money out to people who are \nhurting in a hurry. You can't ask for the same amount of time and \nevidence that you would normally ask. People need help right now. They \nhave no place else to go. But people take advantage of that. The scum \nof the Earth take advantage of the generosity of the American people by \noften slipping in as contractors or claimed beneficiaries, lying about \nlosses, to get money that is supposed to go to people who are hurting.\n\n  Well, just days after Hurricane Katrina hit the Nation, Attorney \nGeneral Gonzales established the Katrina Fraud Task Force. This task \nforce would send a message right off the bat that fraud would be \ninvestigated and prosecuted, and it was to focus on fraud and \ncorruption resulting from the hurricanes. He named Fisher the Katrina \nFraud Task Force chairman. As chairman, Alice Fisher quickly set up a \nforward-looking strategic plan and resource allocation for this \ninteragency task force, among all the other things she was doing, to \ninvestigate and prosecute fraud arising from Hurricane Katrina and \nrelated disasters. Under her guidance, the task force has made great \nstrides to combat fraud.\n\n[[Page S9711]]\n\n  As of July 25, the task force had charged 371 defendants in 29 \nseparate Federal districts. A majority of the cases charged to date \nhave involved emergency benefits fraud against both FEMA and the \nAmerican Red Cross--charitable donation fraud. People have gone out and \nclaimed they are raising money to help people, and they just steal it. \nWhat kind of sorry person is that, who would ask people to sacrifice \nand give help to someone else, and then steal the money? We have that, \nand she is working against it.\n  Other cases have involved Government contract fraud. We have people \ntaking advantage of the contracting process and cheating when they are \nsupposed to follow through and do certain amounts of work for the \nGovernment. They have certified they have done it, they get paid, and \nthen we find out they didn't do it. Some of them need to go to jail.\n  The task force has therefore been taking a number of proactive \nmeasures to identify, investigate and prosecute these kinds of cases.\n  Alice Fisher created the Katrina Fraud Task Force Joint Command \nCenter in Baton Rouge where analysts, agents, and inspectors from the \nInspector General and Federal law enforcement communities co-locate--\nthese are all of the agencies, State and local--they get together to \nfocus on procurement fraud and public corruption which could result \nfrom the over $100 billion reconstruction money flowing into the \naffected region. As of July 25, 2006, the Command Center has received \nand referred 6,424 complaints to various Federal agencies.\n  The task force has provided training for the Inspector General \ncommunity. Each one of these agencies have their own Inspector General, \nand many of those Inspector Generals are not familiar with hurricane \nwork. They train all of them so that the Commerce Department, the \nAgriculture Department, the Coast Guard, and other agencies involved \nwith this relief effort can have watchdogs within their agencies \ntrained to prevent fraud.\n  I am going to tell my colleagues, we have had a problem in this \nNation, and we still do, of public corruption. There are public \nofficials, whether in hurricane areas or not, who are taking money, \nextorting bribes and that sort of thing. Unfortunately, that is true. \nFor the most part, we are a Nation of high integrity, but there are \nthose who don't meet those standards and need to be prosecuted. I would \nsay, in many cases, the Federal investigators are the ones who really \nhave the best opportunity, the independence, the distance, from the \nsituation to handle these cases, and they just have to do it. They have \nbeen rightfully praised over the years for their leadership in that \narea.\n  Under Fisher's leadership, the Public Integrity Section has \nprosecuted major public corruption cases, including the ongoing Jack \nAbramoff investigation, which has to date resulted in five pleas of \nguilty and in a conviction after trial of David Safavian, the former \nchief of staff of the General Services Administration--the GSA, a big \nGovernment agency here in Washington, their chief of staff. In \naddition, Fisher supervised the successful prosecution of former \nAlabama Governor Don Siegelman and former HealthSouth CEO Richard \nScrushy for conspiracy and public corruption offenses.\n  Fisher was recently named by the Deputy Attorney General to establish \na national procurement fraud initiative. Now, we have a lot of money \nthat is paid out as a result of Government procurement by our military \nand other agencies, and there is a good bit of fraud there, so she is \nforming a national initiative on that.\n  Since Fisher's tenure began, the Department of Justice has made \nheadway in aggressively prosecuting crimes against children. A lot of \npeople say the Department of Justice shouldn't be involved in those \nkinds of things; that it is not important, and we need to focus on \nother big issues. But I submit the Department of Justice's leadership \nand work in these cases can make quite a difference.\n  For example, the Criminal Division is currently coordinating 18 \nnational child pornography operations targeting hundreds and, in some \ncases, thousands of customers or participants in mass child pornography \ndistribution schemes. In addition, as of July 26, 2006, the Innocence \nLost Initiative targeting children victimized through prostitution has \nresulted in 228 open investigations, 543 arrests, 86 complaints, 121 \ninformations or indictments, and 94 convictions in both the Federal and \nState systems.\n  Fisher is working on the implementation of the Adam Walsh Act. We all \nknow John Walsh, what a tragic story he has lived through and, as a \nresult of it, has become a national leader, well-known throughout this \ncountry for his work in the protection of children. So she is working \nnow to create the mechanism to fully implement the Adam Walsh Act, \nwhich was passed by Congress just recently to combat child \nexploitation, and the Department's new initiative targeted at \nprotecting children from predators, Project Safe Childhood, another \ntime-consuming and challenging activity.\n\n  Fisher serves as a key member of the Department of Justice \nIntellectual Property Task Force and oversees the Computer Crimes and \nIntellectual Property Section of the Criminal Division. Under Fisher's \nleadership, the Department has increased its prosecution of these cases \nand enhanced international partnerships in this area. It is important \nthat we do operate internationally.\n  As Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Justice Department's \nCriminal Division, Fisher developed and implemented a strategic plan to \nfocus and prioritize the mission of the Division's approximately 750 \nemployees. This management plan has organized the Division around the \nfollowing priorities and goals: Supporting the national security \nmission. Supporting the national security mission--that wasn't the No. \n1 goal of the Department of Justice Criminal Division when I was a \nprosecutor. This is as a result of the leadership of the President and \nthe Attorney General and Alice Fisher.\n  So the top goals are supporting the national security mission, \nprotecting this country from attack, ensuring Government integrity, \nprosecuting fraud and corruption, ensuring market integrity. That is--\nin the free market, the banks, financial communities, businesses, \nsecurities, making sure that there is integrity in that. They have a \nrecord of achievement. Combating violent crime is still a part of the \nduties, particularly gangs and drug trafficking and protecting against \ncrimes on the Internet and crimes against children.\n  So this is a very fine, hard-working public servant who gives her \nevery waking hour to trying to promote justice and protecting this \ncountry from attack. What she can say and what she can't say in \nresponse to probing and fishing expeditions from Members of Congress \nabout meetings and conversations and top-secret security activities \nthat she may be involved in is not her decision; it is really the \nExecutive Branch deciding how much of these actions should be made \npublic. So it is not her fault.\n  I submit to my colleagues that she wasn't involved in any of these \nissues that people are so hot about. She didn't set the policies. She \ndidn't write the memos. She was lower down in the chain of command at \nthat time. That wasn't her responsibility. She is being drawn into this \nnow so that we can continue to have complaints about the efforts of \nthis President and his team to aggressively find, identify, prosecute, \nand convict those who would threaten the people of this United States.\n  So I am impressed with Alice Fisher. She was a young, aggressive \nwoman when I met her. She didn't have a whole lot of experience. I \nquestioned her about that. But I could sense that she had the drive to \nbe successful, to serve our country, and she has utilized every \nopportunity she could to further the interests of law enforcement and \njustice in America. I think she is a good nominee. In a different time, \nshe would go through just like that; it would not be a problem. But \nhere we are with an election coming up, and the theme here is that this \nadministration is abusing prisoners and being mean to unlawful \ncombatants and terrorists, and they are trying to maintain that theme \nand drag her into it. They shouldn't do that.\n  She needs to be confirmed. She needs to have the full authority of \nthe office of chief of the Criminal Division of the Department of \nJustice. She will be\n\n[[Page S9712]]\n\nmore effective if she has been confirmed and holds the office \npermanently. She will do a great job, I believe. Her record has proven \nthat. I urge my colleagues to support this nominee.\n  Mr. President, I thank the chair and yield the floor, and I note the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to speak in \nsupport of the nomination of Alice Stevens Fisher to be Assistant \nAttorney General of the Criminal Division of the United States \nDepartment of Justice.\n  Ms. Fisher has an outstanding academic record. She received a \nbachelor's degree from Vanderbilt in 1989. At Vanderbilt, she was a \nmember of the Gamma Beta Phi Honorary Society. She received her law \ndegree from the Catholic University of America's Columbus School of Law \nin 1992. She served as Note & Comment Editor of the Catholic University \nLaw Review, which was a mark of distinction. After law school, she was \nan associate with Sullivan & Cromwell from 1992-1996.\n  She served as Deputy Special Counsel to the United States Senate \nSpecial Committee to Investigate the Whitewater Development Corporation \nfrom 1995 to 1996.\n  She was an associate of the law firm of Latham & Watkins from 1996 to \n2000, and was made a partner in 2001.\n  From 2001 until 2003, she served as the Deputy Assistant Attorney \nGeneral in the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice.\n  She went back to Latham & Watkins from 2003 to 2005. On August 31, \n2005, she was appointed as the Assistant Attorney General for the \nCriminal Division via recess appointment, which is her current \nposition.\n  She is a member of a number of bar associations, and she has \nextensive writings on a number of subjects.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a full statement of her qualifications \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Alice Stevens Fisher, Nominee--Assistant Attorney General, Criminal \n                                Division\n\n       Alice Stevens Fisher was nominated by President Bush to be \n     Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, Department of \n     Justice on April 5, 2005. The President appointed Ms. Fisher \n     to that position via a recess appointment on August 31, 2005.\n       Ms. Fisher has had a distinguished legal career and brings \n     over ten years of experience to the Department of Justice.\n       After graduating from the Catholic University of America's \n     Columbus School of Law in 1992, Ms. Fisher became a member of \n     the law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell.\n       In 1995, Ms. Fisher served as Deputy Special Counsel to the \n     U.S. Senate Committee Investigating Whitewater Development \n     Corporation and Related Matters, where she supported the \n     Senate's investigation and assisted in drafting the final \n     report.\n       In 1996, Ms. Fisher returned to private practice and joined \n     the law firm of Latham & Watkins. At Latham, Ms. Fisher's \n     practice focused on the representation of corporations in \n     government investigations and complex civil litigation. In \n     2001 she became a partner.\n       From 2001 until 2003, Ms. Fisher served as Deputy Assistant \n     Attorney General in the Criminal Division of the Department \n     of Justice.\n       As Deputy Assistant Attorney General, she supervised the \n     Divisions Counter-Terrorism Section, Fraud Section, Appellate \n     Section, Capital Case Unit, and Alien Smuggling Task Force.\n       In 2003, Ms. Fisher returned to Latham & Watkins as a \n     partner.\n       On April 5, 2005, President Bush nominated Ms, Fisher to be \n     Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, Department of \n     Justice. She was appointed to that position via a recess \n     appointment on August 31, 2005.\n\n\n                        Support for Alice Fisher\n\n       ``It is with the greatest enthusiasm that I write this \n     letter in support of Alice Fisher. . . From personal \n     experience, I know that she will serve the President and the \n     country with great dedication, integrity, and talent. Her \n     judgment and skills as both a lawyer and a leader are \n     unparalleled.''

Ms. Fisher's nomination has been delayed for a very long \nperiod of time. In the meantime, Ms. Fisher has been serving as \nAssistant Attorney General for more than a year. She has handled some \nvery high profile investigations and has done an outstanding job.\n  When she appeared before the Judiciary Committee, she presented \nherself very well. She is extremely well-qualified for the position.\n  Since her nomination, some objections have been raised and her \nnomination has been delayed because an email memorandum, authored by an \nFBI agent, lists her as an attendee at a meeting where Department of \nDefense Guantanamo interrogation techniques were discussed. Ms. Fisher \nwas not responsible for the interrogations conducted at Guantanamo by \nthe Department of Defense or the FBI. She did not approve or direct the \ninterrogation or interrogation techniques, and she was not involved in \nthe approval of the Office of Legal Counsel's memorandum, the so-called \nBybee memorandum.\n  Senator Levin, before withdrawing a hold on Ms. Fisher's nomination, \nwanted to talk to the FBI agent who was identified in the file in \nconnection with Ms. Fisher's nomination. However, when the matter \nbecame protracted and delayed, the Attorney General asked me if I would \nmeet with Senator Levin and the FBI agent. It was the practice of the \nDepartment of Justice not to make an FBI agent available to Senators \nbut only to the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. I decided to honor \nthat request even though I did not see the connection between Ms. \nFisher and either the FBI or the Department of Defense's interrogation \ntechniques.\n  Senator Levin wished to have the FBI agent appear, not with the \ncustomary representative from the Department of Justice, Office of \nLegislative Affairs, but instead with someone from the Department of \nJustice Inspector General's Office. We accommodated Senator Levin by \nhaving a representative from the FBI's General Counsel's office attend \nthe meeting. We also accommodated Senator Levin on the location of the \nmeeting, which was held\n\n[[Page S9713]]\n\nin his office and I was happy to meet there.\n  The interview with the FBI agent lasted approximately 1 hour, during \nwhich we had an extensive discussion about what the FBI agent knew \nabout interrogation techniques. The meeting barely, barely, barely \ntouched on Ms. Fisher. Nothing in the interview showed any misconduct \nor impropriety on the part of Ms. Fisher. Nothing contradicted her \ntestimony. She was barely involved.\n  Following that meeting, Senator Levin made a request to see two other \nindividuals who had no connection with Ms. Fisher and no connection \nwith her nomination.\n  I am glad we have come to this point. I have included extensive \ndocumentation in the record demonstrating the way the Department of \nJustice responded in honoring Senator Levin's requests. I have worked \nwith Senator Levin for 26 years. He is a very thorough and effective \nSenator. When he wanted to see this FBI agent, we worked it out so that \nhe saw the FBI agent.\n  I am glad the hold is off. I understand we are going to vote on Ms. \nFisher. I believe this comes under Shakespeare's edict: All's well that \nends well. And now we will go on to work on some other important \nmatters, such as trying to get habeas corpus in effect on the \nGuantanamo issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Pennsylvania \nfor his words.\n  After I tried for about a year to get the Attorney General to make \navailable an FBI agent so we could talk to him about a memo that he \nwrote naming Ms. Fisher, naming three other members of the Criminal \nDivision that she was the Deputy Director of, as being very aware of \nthe debate between the FBI and the Department of Defense over \ninterrogation practices at Guantanamo, I was unsuccessful for about a \nyear to simply get information.\n  Stonewalling has occurred in this case. The delay that has occurred \nin this case is directly attributable to the refusal of the Department \nof Justice to provide information to this Senator.\n  After that meeting--and I thank the good Senator from Pennsylvania \nfor arranging it; it wouldn't have happened without him--after that \nmeeting, something became clear which needed to be clarified. I sent a \nletter to the Department of Justice on that matter. It is a very \nimportant matter involving whether Mr. Nahmias, the counsel to the \nCriminal Division who was aware of the tactics which were being used at \nGuantanamo, was personally involved in knowing about this debate \nbetween the FBI--it did not like what it saw--which objected to the \ntactics being used and was very vehement about it and did not want his \nagents to participate in the interrogations and wrote e-mails to the \nDepartment of Justice saying: You cannot believe what is going on down \nhere. There was this vehement dispute between FBI and the Department of \nDefense on interrogation tactics. This is the background for what is in \nthe headlines today.\n\n  At the discussion which occurred in my office, which Senator Specter \naccurately described, the FBI agent indicated that Ms. Fisher's \nconnection related to one discussion he could remember about a specific \nevent, not abusive interrogation techniques but, rather, about whether \none of the detainees down there had been involved in September 11. That \nis what his recollection was. We accept that. We have no basis to not \naccept it.\n  However, something came out at that July meeting which is critically \nimportant. He said he had regular discussions on this subject about the \ndetainee treatment at Guantanamo with the counsel to the Criminal \nDivision, David Nahmias, and another Deputy Director, Bruce Swartz. We \nsimply wanted to find out from the two of them, particularly from Mr. \nNahmias since he served in the same department of the Justice \nDepartment with Alice Fisher, and the Deputy Director of that \ndepartment, whether he, David Nahmias, had shared the information that \nhe got from the FBI that wrote the e-mail, with the Deputy Director of \nthat department.\n  For reasons that I cannot fathom, the Justice Department is still \nstonewalling answering questions which are directly related to the \nnomination. That question is, Did Mr. Nahmias and Mr. Swartz share with \nthe Deputy Director of their own department, the Criminal Justice \nDepartment, what they had learned from this FBI agent about the raging \ndispute going on between the FBI and the Department of Defense over \nthese tactics?\n  We asked the Attorney General if we could talk with Mr. Nahmias. By \nthe way, this is the fourth request I had made to meet with Mr. \nNahmias. I started in May of 2005 because he was named, along with Ms. \nFisher, and Mr. Swartz as having been present at meetings during which \nthese tactics were discussed. So he was right in that e-mail. We asked \nfour times to see Mr. Nahmias. We have been rejected every time.\n  But now, in my office, we learned something else which is \nsignificant, which is relevant, which is going to go unanswered. It is \ngoing to go unanswered because the Department of Justice will not even \nanswer the questions which I want them to put to Mr. Nahmias.\n  What I finally have done out of exasperation was to write to the \nAttorney General saying: You obviously are not going to produce two \nrelevant people so I can ask them very basic information--did they \nshare the information they had about these abuses and these raging \ndebates between FBI and DOD. You are not going to allow me to ask those \ntwo people whether they shared that with the Deputy Director of their \ndepartment. You are simply not going to do it. Would you at least ask \nthe two of them questions in writing about whether they shared that \ninformation with Ms. Fisher?\n  The answer of the Department of Justice is silence--stone, cold, \nsilence--to my request.\n  That is where we are. I will be voting against this nomination \nbecause of the stonewalling by the Department of Justice of legitimate, \nreasonable requests for information which are still outstanding, \nrelative to Nahmias and to Swartz.\n  That is unacceptable. It puts us in a position of voting on nominees \nwithout relevant information which we should have. The delay--and I \nemphasize this--the delay in this matter is not mine. The delay is the \nrefusal of the Department of Justice to provide information, to provide \nwitnesses for a year and a half.\n  Without the help of my good friend from Pennsylvania, Senator \nSpecter, we never could have even received the information that we got \nfrom the FBI agent, and, as he knows, I am grateful to him for that. I \ncan now only hope that he will join in asking the Department of \nJustice--it can come after this nominee's vote--I would hope he would \nconsider joining the request of the Department of Justice that we have \nthis information for the record as being relevant to the matters we are \ndebating.\n  I close by saying I believe it is unacceptable, it is wrong for the \nDepartment of Justice to deny the Senate relevant information. We are \ngoing to end up voting now on this nomination of Ms. Fisher without it. \nIt should not be that way. I will express my opposition to the \nstonewalling tactics of the Department of Justice by voting no on this \nnomination, again, with my thanks to the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee for the help that he did provide in this matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, there are many things I can say in \nresponse to what the distinguished Senator from Michigan has said, but \nsilence is the preferable course.\n  Instead, I ask, as the representative of the majority leader, to set \nthe vote at 5:45 with the expectation there will be no other speakers. \nI ask unanimous consent we set the vote at 5:45.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I understand we have a thumbs up from the rear of the \nChamber. I have no objection.\n  Mr. SPECTER. People who run the Senate, staffers, have just consented \nto the request.\n  Mr. LEVIN. They didn't consent, but they indicated to me there was no \nobjection, to be technically correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I speak today on the nomination of Ms. \nAlice Fisher to be Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division \nat the\n\n[[Page S9714]]\n\nDepartment of Justice. Ms. Fisher, a native from Louisville, KY, is \nwithout question very well qualified to fill this position. As a fellow \nKentuckian, it is an honor to address her nomination today, and I give \nher my full support.\n  I firmly believe that Ms. Fisher possesses the qualifications needed \nfor this position. Her dedication and personal drive stand as an \nexample to us all.\n  Ms. Fisher has served as Assistant Attorney General for over a year \nnow. In this time she has coordinated with law enforcement agencies on \na variety of issues, including antiterrorism prosecutions, public \ncorruption cases, and child pornography cases.\n  Prior to this appointment, Ms. Fisher served within the Department of \nJustice managing both the Counterterrorism and Fraud Sections of the \nDepartment. In this time, she was responsible for coordinating the \nDepartment's national counterterrorism activities, including matters \nrelated to terrorist financing and the USA PATRIOT Act.\n  Throughout her tenure at the Department of Justice, Ms. Fisher has \nshown time and time again that she is a true leader and leads by \nexample. Many of her colleagues testified before Congress this past \nyear about her unwavering work habits and her true commitment to \njustice.\n  This is the type of leader that we need in our Government. I urge my \ncolleagues across the aisle who have held up her nomination in the past \nto not let partisan politics get in the way this time. We need to move \nforward with her nomination. Not only does she have a proven record, \nbut it was approved overwhelmingly by the Judiciary Committee, and now \nshe deserves a fair up-or-down vote on the Senate floor.\n  I am confident that when she receives this vote that she will be \nconfirmed, and I wish her continued success in her position.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I will yield back my time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield back my time, also. I am willing to do that as \nSenator Specter has yielded his back. What time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 13 minutes. The \nminority leader has 59 minutes. The majority leader has 27 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if the Senator from Pennsylvania would agree that \nwe can put in a quorum call and the time be deducted proportionally \nfrom all of the remaining speakers.\n  Mr. SPECTER. That is acceptable. Having set the vote at 5:45, we have \ngiven our colleagues ample notice. If somebody wants to speak in the \nnext 14 minutes, they certainly would be at liberty to do that. My \nhunch is that we will have a quorum call for 14 minutes. The important \nthing is that we have finished the discussion on a reasonably \nharmonious note.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we proceed to \nthe vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nnomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Alice S. Fisher, of Virginia, to be an \nAssistant Attorney General? On this question, the yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senator was necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Minnesota (Mr. Coleman).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Minnesota (Mr. \nColeman) would have voted ``yea.''\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Akaka), the \nSenator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), and the Senator from \nLouisiana (Ms. Landrieu) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kennedy) would vote ``nay.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss).

Mr. President, at the present time, the members of the \nArmed Services Committee of the Senate and the members of the Armed \nServices Committee of the House are in a conference. A great deal of \nconfidentiality is attached to that procedure. I do not in any way \nintend to violate that confidentiality.\n  But before the conference--and this is not a matter of \nconfidentiality--is a provision in the bill of the House of \nRepresentatives which is related to military chaplains. I will read \nfrom the House bill.\n\n       Each Chaplain shall have the prerogative to pray according \n     to the dictates of the Chaplain's own conscience, except as \n     must be limited by military necessity, with any such \n     limitation being imposed in the least restrictive manner \n     feasible.\n\n  That is the end of the proposed bill language. That is what I would \nlike to address at this time.\n  I first want to say that the Senate has no such provision, and \ntherefore we have to resolve the difference between the two bodies. The \nHouse of Representatives put this provision in during markup, which is \nthe time they go over their bill. Another amendment was offered in that \nmarkup and rejected. It is referred to as follows: ``Amendment to H.R. \n5122, offered by Mr. Israel,'' Member of Congress, and it provides in \nsection 590, which I just read, relating to military chaplains: at the \nend of the quoted matter inserted by each of the subsections (a), (b), \n(c), (d), and (e), insert the following: ``, except that chaplains \nshall demonstrate sensitivity, respect, and tolerance for all faiths \npresent on each occasion at which prayers are offered''.\n  I personally have not decided on what version I personally feel \nshould\n\n[[Page S9715]]\n\naddress this problem, so I remain of an open mind. But I remain very \nfirmly of a mind that in the brief time that we have had an opportunity \nto look at it and examine it here on the Senate side, the time is \ninadequate to address an issue which I regard as of enormous \nimportance. This is an issue that I would hope this Chamber would have \nthe opportunity to discuss, whether to put into law a provision as \nproposed by the House or a provision as proposed by Mr. Israel, a \nMember of Congress, which addresses the perspectives of this issue from \na different angle. This is just an example of the diversity of views on \nthis important issue.\n  Among the conferees--I cannot name names; I will not--there is a \nstrong division, those in favor of certain language other than what is \nin the House bill. Some conferees think that the provision by Mr. \nIsrael should be included. So there is at this time just an enormous \nuncertainty among the conferees.\n  The House book that contains what we call report language, which is a \nvery helpful instrument to try to explain the background of how \nprovisions come into our legislation, trying to explain what some of \nthe words mean, this book is silent. The only report language is a \nrecitation, exactly, of the proposed bill language. So there is no \nguidance that Congress is providing on this important phrase.\n  I hasten to point out that, as is the case in just about all matters \nthat we take up in the Armed Services Committee regarding the annual \nauthorization bill, the Secretary of Defense transmits to us opinions \nthat he has, on behalf of the Department, with regard to proposed \nlegislation. I now will have printed in the Record what is entitled:\n\n       The Department of Defense Appeal, FY 2007 Defense \n     Authorization Bill; Subject: Military Chaplains; Language/\n     Provision: House section 590 established chaplains at each of \n     the Military Services would have the prerogative to pray \n     according to the dictates of their own conscience, except as \n     must be limited by military necessity. The Senate included no \n     similar provision.\n\n  The Department of Defense position is they oppose this provision. \nThis reads as follows:\n\n       This provision could marginalize chaplains who, in \n     exercising their conscience, generate discomfort at mandatory \n     formations. Such erosion of unit cohesion is avoided by the \n     Military's present insistence on inclusive prayer at \n     interfaith gatherings--something the House legislation would \n     operate against.\n       The Department urges exclusion of this provision.\n\n  We have not decided as yet. But that is another dimension to the \ndiversity of thinking on this very important provision.\n  As all Members in this body fully appreciate and understand, when a \nmatter of this controversy comes along you are often singled out by a \nvariety of people who disagree. I have not taken a position, but \nnevertheless I am being besieged by telephone, by bloggers, by \neverything else--that I have taken this or that position. I will state \nmomentarily what I think should be done. But I am very proud of my \nbackground.\n  I was blessed with two magnificent parents. We were active in the \nEpiscopal Church, and I have remained active in that faith nearly all \nof my life, nearly 80 years now. My uncle was a rector of a very \nprominent parish here in Washington, DC, in the shadow of the \nWashington Cathedral where I was raised, not more than three blocks \nfrom his church, and I was a regular attendee of Sunday school through \nthat. I am just sorrowful that people attack me personally, as if I had \nno religious foundation. I have that foundation.\n  I have had the privilege to serve in uniform. Not a career--and I \nhave said it many times here on the floor of the Senate--of any great \nnote, a very modest career, but as a young, 17, 18-year-old in the last \nyear of World War II, just in the training command. We were trained to \nbe replacements to go overseas to the Pacific. The war ended. We were \nsent home.\n  But many a time in the course of that period in military service, the \nsecond chapter, this time as a United States Marine, a young officer \nserving in Korea, the First Marine Air Wing, at a time when, indeed, \ncertainly the infantry troops in the front lines, where I visited on \noccasion, were being subject to the most difficult combat under \nrigorous conditions in Korea, but I knelt and prayed many, many times \nwith my fellow soldiers--men and women, fellow marines, fellow sailors.\n  So I speak as one who has benefited through the years from the \nreligion that was instilled in me through my parents and the church of \nmy choice, and it has given me a great strength to face up to the \ntrials and tribulations that all of us experience in a lifetime.\n  I respect the chaplains. I went to chaplains on occasion, and I am \ngrateful for the counseling that they gave me. So I say, I look back \nwith a sense of humility on what the military has taught me. Many times \nhave I said I don't think I would ever have achieved the opportunity to \nbe a U.S. Senator had I not had the opportunity, the privilege of \nserving in uniform during the periods of two conflicts of our Nation \nand the learning that I received throughout the military. I have often \nsaid the military did more for me than I ever did for the military. But \nI just will stand my ground against anyone who wishes to challenge my \nreligion.\n  Now, in my 28th year in this magnificent Chamber, many is the time I \nstood here as our Senate opens and listened to either our chaplain or a \nvisiting clergy. Each of us have the privilege of inviting from our \nseveral States a visiting clergy to come and deliver a prayer. It is \npart of the life of the U.S. Senate. I know of no effort ever to try \nand censor or legislate the prayers given here in the Senate, either by \nour chaplain or by the many who come from all over America to give \ntheir prayers here. So I am not suggesting the military is like the \nSenate. But it is an example of the use of prayer.\n  The military is different. It is for that reason, that it is \ndifferent, that I think it is important that we proceed to resolve such \nproblems as may exist today in the military regarding how our chaplains \npray, that we resolve that only after the institutions of the Senate \nand the House of Representatives go through a careful and deliberative \nprocess, not just try in the heat of resolving a conference report, in \nbrief meetings here and there among just a very few--well, sometimes \nall the conferees, sometimes in small groups--trying to reconcile the \ndifferences between legislative provisions in the House bill and those \nin the Senate bill.\n  I would like to call our attention to the Constitution of the United \nStates. It says:\n\n       Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of \n     religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or \n     abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the \n     right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition \n     the government for a redress of grievances.\n\n  This is such a fundamental part of our democracy. It is a pillar of \nstrength in this Republic. But it is constantly reviewed by the courts \nagainst the different factual situations that come up.\n  I think the military deserves no less than to have the most careful \nand deliberative review of this suggested language rather than to put \nit into law at this time. My recommendation--I will cooperate with the \nconferees--is that I am not prepared to take any position on how this \nlanguage should be put into law or not put into law at this time. But I \ndo say that I will strongly recommend to the Committee on Armed \nServices that the seriousness of this issue literally demands that as \nsoon as the new Congress convenes in January, the committees of the \nArmed Services of the Senate and the House put on hearings at the \nearliest possibility. You could start with this language as recommended \nby the House of Representatives--the Senate has no language--to go \nthrough a process where people can come in.\n  For example, I asked each of the chiefs of the chaplains of the Army, \nNavy, and the Air Force to come in and speak to the conferees--there \nwere only four conferees there at that time--which they did. I attached \nthe utmost confidentiality as to what they said. But I was left with \nthe impression that now is not the time to try to quickly put this one \nsentence into law by virtue of incorporating it into the final draft of \nthe conference report. Those chaplains would be quite willing to come \nbefore the Congress in open session. Let the whole of the United States \nsee this debate unfold, as it should.\n  Prayer is very important to the men and women of the Armed Forces. I \nremember so well the old maxim, ``There\n\n[[Page S9716]]\n\nis no atheist in the foxholes of war.'' Military people, military \nfamilies are heavily dependent upon the comfort that is given by \nprayer--prayer alone or prayer with others.\n  I urge this Congress not to do at this time this one sentence. I will \nread it again. I have difficulty, as many times as I have read it, \nunderstanding exactly what it means.\n  It says: Each chaplain shall have the prerogative to pray according \nto the dictates of the chaplain's own conscience except as must be \nlimited by military necessity.\n  What is that? What is military necessity? We should define that very \ncarefully. I continue:\n\n       With any such limitation being imposed in the least \n     restrictive manner feasible.\n\n  That, to me, is a complicated sentence and a complicated message to \nput forth.\n  In conclusion, I will recommend to the conferees that at this time \nCongress not enact this bill language in the House, that we defer it to \na time when the entire Senate and the entire House in open before the \npublic invites in as many as we can possibly accommodate to give their \nviews on the institution of the chaplain in the Armed Forces of the \nUnited States, an institution that I have known since the closing days \nof World War II and have known for over a half century and have seen it \nfunction and have seen it work. Before we change those rules, I think \nwe owe no less to the men and women in the Armed Forces to have these \ndeliberative bodies of the House and Senate have their hearings, debate \nthe language, and then decide whether they wish or not to write \nlanguage that in many respects we were admonished by the Founding \nFathers to be careful, at least at the most under the First Amendment.\n  In addition, some of the concern--and I think it is a legitimate \nconcern--of those proposing this language emanates from actions taken \nby the Department of the Air Force, the Department of the Navy, and I \nbelieve--I have not seen it--the Department of the Army in issuing \ncertain guidance. The guidance was issued recently about this subject \nof prayer and other matters relating to the chaplain.\n  I will not go into it, but I will put in today's Record the documents \nthat were issued by several military departments. You can read it for \nyourselves.\n  I think that we should put in report language in our bill two things: \nFirst, that the Secretary of Defense will stay--that means hold in \nabeyance--enforcement of these newly promulgated regulations until such \ntime as the Congress has had an opportunity to hold its hearings, go \nthrough a deliberative process, and then decide whether it wishes to \nact by way of sending a conference report to the President for purposes \nof becoming the law of the land.\n  So it is twofold: let the system of the chaplain, which has been \noperating for my lifetime, half a century, serving the needs of the men \nand women of the Armed Forces, continue to do as they have done but \nstand down any regulations until studied by this coequal branch of the \nGovernment, which under the Constitution has a very special language \nprovision that says we have a responsibility to care for the needs in \ngeneral of the men and women of the Armed Forces. That is what the \nconference report does.\n  I am hopeful that the conferees will see the wisdom of this action, \nlet this bill go forward to the President's desk so it can become law, \nand it can care for the men and women of the Armed Forces.\n  That will be written in report language. It does not have the force \nof law. But I am basically assured by the Department of Defense that \nthey will comply; stay for the time being the most recent regulations, \nwhatever they wish to call them, that have been sent out to their \nrespective commands until Congress has had a reasonable time within \nwhich to decide whether they feel it is necessary to prepare for the \nPresident's signature a new law.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional materials \nregarding this subject be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         Department of the Navy\n\n\n                       SECNAV Instruction 1730.7C\n\n     d. Chaplains\n       (1) Chaplains are Qualified Religious Ministry \n     Professionals (RMPs) endorsed by a Department of Defense \n     (DOD)--listed Religious Organization (RO) and commissioned as \n     CHC officers.\n       (2) As a condition of appointment, every RMP must be \n     willing to function in a pluralistic environment in the \n     military, where diverse religious traditions exist side-by-\n     side with tolerance and respect. Every RMP must be willing to \n     support directly and indirectly the free exercise of religion \n     by all military members of the DON, their family members, and \n     other persons authorized to be served, in cooperation with \n     other chaplains and RMPs. Chaplains are trained to minister \n     within the specialized demands of the military environment \n     without compromising the tenets of their own religious \n     tradition.\n       (3) In providing religious ministry, chaplains shall strive \n     to avoid the establishment of religion to ensure that free \n     exercise rights are protected for all authorized personnel.\n       (4) Chaplains will provide ministry to those of their own \n     faith, facilitate ministry to those of other faiths, and care \n     for all service members, including those who claim no \n     religious faith. Chaplains shall respect the rights of others \n     to their own religious beliefs, including the right to hold \n     no beliefs.\n       (5) Chaplains advise commands in matters of morale, morals, \n     ethics, and spiritual well-being. They also serve as the \n     principal advisors to commanders for all issues regarding the \n     impact of religion on military operations.\n       (6) Chaplains are non-combatants. Chaplains are not \n     authorized to obtain weapons qualifications, warfare \n     qualifications, or bear arms; however, chaplains who attained \n     weapons or warfare qualifications during prior service as a \n     combatant are authorized to wear their awards and/or warfare \n     qualifications. Chaplains are eligible to qualify for and to \n     wear the insignia of qualification designations such as Fleet \n     Marine Force, Basic Parachutist, and Navy/Marine Parachutist.\n     6. Responsibilities of Commanders\n       a. Commanders shall provide a Command Religious Program \n     (CRP) in support of religious needs and preferences of the \n     members of their commands, eligible family members and other \n     authorized personnel. The CRP is supported with appropriated \n     funds at a level consistent with other personnel programs \n     within DON.\n       b. Chaplains will not be compelled to participate in \n     religious activities inconsistent with their beliefs.\n       c. Commanders retain the responsibility to provide guidance \n     for all command functions. In planning command functions, \n     commanders shall determine whether a religious element is \n     appropriate. In considering the appropriateness for including \n     a religious element, commanders, with appropriate advice from \n     a chaplain, should assess the setting and context of the \n     function; the diversity of faith that may be represented \n     among the participants; and whether the function is mandatory \n     for all hands. Other than Divine/Religious Services, \n     religious elements for a command function, absent \n     extraordinary circumstances, should be non-sectarian in \n     nature. Neither the participation of a chaplain, nor the \n     inclusion of a religious element, in and of themselves, \n     renders a command function a Divine Service or public \n     worship. Once a commander determines a religious element is \n     appropriate, the chaplain may choose to participate based on \n     his or her faith constraints. If the chaplain chooses not to \n     participate, he or she may do so with no adverse \n     consequences. Anyone accepting a commander's invitation to \n     provide religious elements at a command function is \n     accountable for following the commander's guidance.\n       d. Commanders shall, when in a combat area, only assign, \n     detail, or permit chaplains, as non-combatants under the \n     Geneva Convention, to perform such duties as are related to \n     religious ministry under Art. 1063 of reference (b).\n       e. Commanders shall not assign chaplains collateral duties \n     that violate the religious practices of the chaplain's \n     religious organization or that require services in a capacity \n     in which the chaplain may later be called upon to reveal \n     privileged or sensitive information.\n       f. Commanders shall not assign chaplains duties to act as \n     director, solicitor, or treasurer of funds, other than \n     administrator of a Religious Offering Fund; or serve on a \n     courtmartial; or stand watches other than that of duty \n     chaplain.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               U.S. Army\n\n     Army Chaplains & Military/Patriotic Ceremonial Prayer: How \n         does the Army Chief of Chaplains address chaplains and \n         Military/Patriotic Ceremonial Prayer?\n       AR 1651-1, Chaplain Activities in the United States Army, \n     has several pertinent statements. Paragraph. 1-4 a. reads, \n     ``In, striking a balance between the `establishment' and \n     `free exercise' clauses the Army chaplaincy, in providing \n     religious services and ministries to the command, is an \n     instrument of the U.S. Government to ensure that soldier's \n     religious `free exercise' rights are protected. At the same \n     time, chaplains are trained to avoid even the appearance of \n     any establishment of religion.'' Paragraph 4-4h. reads, \n     ``Military and patriotic ceremonies may require a chaplain to \n     provide an invocation, reading, prayer, or benediction. Such \n     occasions are not to be considered religious\n\n[[Page S9717]]\n\n     services. Chaplains will not be required to offer a prayer, \n     if doing so would be in variance with the tenets or practices \n     of their faith group.''\n       Chaplains provide prayer within worship services governed \n     by the tenets of their faith. Chaplains also provide prayer \n     in public ceremonies which are patriotic/military (sometimes \n     called secular). The former are completely voluntary; the \n     latter are often required functions at which all manner of \n     people are present. It is at these non-worship ceremonies \n     that the Chaplains must consider their obligations to assist \n     every Soldier to pray.\n       There is no Army regulatory guidance prohibiting an \n     individual from praying or directing an individual to pray in \n     any specific manner. AR 165-1 is intended to strike a balance \n     between a Chaplain's right to freely express his or her own \n     personal religious beliefs and the Chaplain's duty to ensure \n     that every Soldier is afforded his or her ``free exercise'' \n     rights under the Constitution.\n       Pluralism and religious accommodation are trained \n     throughout the Chaplain life cycle with the bulk of the \n     subject matter conveyed in the foundation courses at the \n     Chaplain Officer Basic Course. AR 165-1 is the reference for \n     this training.\n       The Army Chief of Chaplains sees no reason to provide \n     additional guidelines concerning Chaplains and public prayer \n     since AR 165-1 is sufficient.\n       The Army Chief of Chaplains will not dictate how an Army \n     Chaplain performs his or her prayer. Chaplains are trained \n     and expected to use good judgment when addressing pluralistic \n     audiences at public, non-worship ceremonies.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                             U.S. Air Force\n\n\nrevised interim guidelines concerning free exercise of religion in the \n                               air force\n\n       We are sworn to support and defend the Constitution of the \n     United States. In taking our oath we pledge our personal \n     commitment to the Constitution's protections for free \n     exercise of religion and its prohibition against government \n     establishment of religion.\n       We will remain officially neutral regarding religious \n     beliefs, neither officially endorsing nor disapproving any \n     faith belief or absence of belief. We will accommodate free \n     exercise of religion and other personal beliefs, as well as \n     freedom of expression, except as must be limited by \n     compelling military necessity (with such limitations being \n     imposed in the least restrictive manner feasible). Commanders \n     should ensure that requests for religious accommodation are \n     welcomed and dealt with as fairly and consistently as \n     practicable throughout their commands. They should be \n     approved unless approval would have a real, not hypothetical, \n     adverse impact on military readiness, unit cohesion, \n     standards, or discipline. Avoidance of schedule conflicts \n     between official activities and religious observances can \n     enhance unit effectiveness and demonstrate mutual respect.\n       Chaplain service programs are the responsibility of \n     commanders. Chaplains impartially advise commanders in regard \n     to free exercise of religion, and implement programs of \n     religious support and pastoral care to help commanders care \n     for all their people, including opportunities for free \n     exercise of individual beliefs. We will respect the rights of \n     chaplains to adhere to the tenets of their religious faiths \n     and they will not be required to participate in religious \n     activities, including public prayer, inconsistent with their \n     faiths.\n       Leaders at every level bear a special responsibility to \n     ensure their words and actions cannot reasonably be construed \n     to be officially endorsing nor disapproving any faith belief \n     or absence of belief. In official circumstances or when \n     superior/subordinate relationships are involved, superiors \n     need to be sensitive to the potential that personal \n     expressions may appear to be official, or have undue \n     influence on their subordinates. Subject to these \n     sensitivities, superiors enjoy the same free exercise rights \n     as all other airmen.\n       Voluntary participation in worship, prayer, study, and \n     discussion is integral to the free exercise of religion. \n     Nothing in this guidance should be understood to limit the \n     substance of voluntary discussions of religion, or the \n     exercise of free speech, where it is reasonably clear that \n     the discussions are personal, not official, and they can be \n     reasonably free of the potential for, or appearance of, \n     coercion.\n       Public prayer should not imply Government endorsement of \n     religion and should not usually be a part of routine official \n     business. Mutual respect and common sense should always be \n     applied, including consideration of unusual circumstances and \n     the needs of the command. Further, non-denominational, \n     inclusive prayer or a moment of silence may be appropriate \n     for military ceremonies or events of special importance when \n     its primary purpose is not the advancement of religious \n     beliefs. Military chaplains are trained in these matters.\n       General rules regarding use of Government computers apply \n     to personal religious matters as they do for other personal \n     matters. Chaplain programs will receive communications \n     support as would comparable staff activities.\n       These guidelines are consistent with the responsibility of \n     commanders to maintain good order and discipline, and are \n     consistent with the core values of the Air Force: integrity \n     first; service before self; and excellence in all we do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/19/senate-section/article/S9717-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9717]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On March 8, 2006, in Savannah, GA, David Bennett was attacked by five \nmen outside a local gay bar. According to police, Sidney Swift, one of \nthe alleged attackers, made several antigay remarks towards Bennett \nwhile in police custody.

Mr. President, in my 32 years as a U.S. Senator, I have \nmet many extraordinary people. They have included Presidents, Kings and \nNobel laureates, artists, soldiers, nurses, activists, and ordinary \nAmericans who are doing any number of wonderful, selfless, and \ncourageous things for their families, their communities, and their \ncountry. Some of these people chose careers in public service. Others \nwere leading normal, uneventful lives when they were unexpectedly \nconfronted with circumstances that caused them to become leaders. Many \nhave simply lived inconspicuous lives caring for others. And then there \nare those who have struggled to overcome unfair and seemingly \nimpossible hurdles and in doing so have shown a force of character and \nspirit that breaks barriers and inspires awe among everyone they meet.\n  Ben Chater, a Vermonter who interned in my office several years ago \nduring the summer after his sophomore year at the University of \nCalifornia at Berkeley, is in the latter category. Born with cerebral \npalsy, Ben has faced obstacles from birth that the rest of us could not \neven imagine, much less overcome. He has done so with amazing grace, \ncourage, and good humor, and his accomplishments are nothing short of \nawe inspiring. Ben's refusal to let his disability prevent him from \ntaking on practically any challenge has been an example for me and my \nwife Marcelle, for my staff, and for virtually everyone who has come \ninto contact with him.\n  I have little doubt that Ben will continue to set ambitious goals and \nin reaching them he will demonstrate even further the incredible \ncapacity of the human spirit to overcome adversity. He will also \ncontinue to erase the stereotypes and misconceptions about the \npotential of people with disabilities.\n  Ben was recently the subject of an article in the Vermont Sunday \nMagazine by Tom Slayton, who is also the editor of Vermont Life, and I \nask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record so others can be \ninspired by Ben's life and accomplishments.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        [From the Vermont Sunday Magazine, September 10, 2006].\n\n   ``In Awe of Ben''--Ben Chater, 23, with cerebral palsy, finishes \n              Berkeley, prepares for life's next challenge\n\n                            (By Tom Slayton)\n\n       This is the story of a fine mind living in a body that \n     won't cooperate.\n       Ben Chater, 23, of Montpelier has had cerebral palsy since \n     birth. Due to a difficult birth, Ben's brain was deprived of \n     oxygen for a few moments. As a result, he has a major \n     disability--he has limited control over movements of his \n     limbs, or the rest of his body.\n       He requires assistance with everyday living--getting \n     dressed in the morning, eating a meal, taking a shower. He \n     speaks with some difficulty and requires a motorized \n     wheelchair to get around.\n       However, Ben's mind is complete and undamaged. In fact, he \n     is extremely bright.\n\n[[Page S9718]]\n\n     He graduated this year, with honors, from the University of \n     California at Berkeley with degrees in English and \n     linguistics, the study of language--how it works, how sounds \n     combine to make meaning, how the language we use shapes our \n     thinking and our experience.\n       Linguistics is not for the faint of heart. Or mind. But Ben \n     is neither.\n       For his work in that field, Ben received the Departmental \n     Citation for Excellence in Linguistics, awarded by the \n     faculty of the department to an outstanding student. He was \n     the only student at Berkeley to receive that award this year.\n       Ben is not only an outstanding student; he is an \n     outstanding person.\n       After talking with him for even a few minutes, one forgets \n     the fact that he is in a powered chair and has some \n     difficulty forming words. What remains is the lasting \n     impression of an intelligent, positive, hopeful young man.\n       ``I'm frankly in awe of Ben,'' says his mother, Maude \n     Chater. ``There's a grace about him that I don't understand--\n     nor do I need to.''\n       Maude and her husband, Mike, have worked long and hard to \n     help Ben achieve an independent life. Perhaps the hardest \n     thing for them to do, in recent years, has been to stand back \n     and get out of Ben's way.\n       ``It's very hard for families to resist their protective \n     instincts,'' she notes quietly.\n       In addition to academic success that would be remarkable in \n     a person with normal abilities, Ben has served as an intern \n     in the office of U.S. Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, living in \n     Washington while working for the senator. And he recently \n     took--and aced--the LSAT exams--the qualifying exam for law \n     school.\n       However, all that success does not eliminate the fact that \n     he has difficulties the rest of us cannot imagine.\n       Recently, Ben went outside into the back yard to check on a \n     blueberry patch, alone, while family members were out and \n     about, as usual. He drove his motorized chair uphill \n     toward some trees--and got mired in a soft spot in the \n     yard.\n       Two hours later, when his mother arrived back home, she \n     found Ben, still mired, still in his chair, stuck in front of \n     one of the trees. When she went to assist him, Ben's only wry \n     comment was:\n       ``It's a nice tree . . . really!''\n       Early on--when Ben was a junior at Montpelier High School, \n     to be exact--his special qualities became apparent to all of \n     his classmates.\n       For Ben, as for most kids, it was a time of change, \n     uncertainty and social stress. Many of the young people he \n     had grown up with had begun to change their interests, and \n     old friends drifted away and new ones didn't appear to take \n     their places. More than most kids, Ben felt isolated.\n       Unlike most kids, though, he decided to do something about \n     it. He received permission from the school administration to \n     call a school-wide assembly, and at it he spoke to his fellow \n     students about what he saw and felt. He spoke about what it \n     was like to be Ben Chater, teenager, confused and lonely. ``I \n     felt I needed to do something,'' Ben says, remembering the \n     assembly.\n       What he discovered that day was that he was not alone. Many \n     of his classmates and other students approached him afterward \n     and said they felt exactly the same way--and they thanked him \n     for putting their feelings into words along with his own.\n       ``I don't know a single kid who loved every minute of high \n     school,'' he says.\n       With his parents' backing and encouragement, he has always \n     tried to join in the activities and share the interests of \n     his peers. If a school field trip involved climbing a \n     mountain, Ben's first thought was not: ``I can't go,'' but \n     ``How can I climb the mountain, too?''\n       (Answer: ``We need to get a really strong guy to carry me \n     up the mountain on his back.'' And that's the way it \n     happened.)\n       But college presented a whole new set of challenges.\n       How could Ben get by without the assistance of his parents? \n     (Answer: Hire and manage assistants. There are some Social \n     Security funds for just that purpose.)\n       How could he do the immense amount of work that college \n     typically demands? What about lengthy term papers, for \n     example?\n       (Answer: The world of electronic communication--computers, \n     e-mail, the Web, blogging and so on--has actually been very \n     helpful to Ben. True, his hands and fingers won't obey his \n     mental commands, but he makes expert use of a headset that \n     enables him to type by tapping with a pointer attached to \n     his head.\n       When ``translated'' into computer strokes and electronic \n     impulses, Ben's words and ideas can be communicated freely. \n     And the excellence of his ideas and scholarship stands out.)\n       How would Ben get to classes in a multi-story building, \n     meet with professors, register, even accomplish something as \n     basic as going to the bathroom in a standard multi-story \n     academic building? (Answer: Attend a university that prides \n     itself on integrating disabled students into all its classes \n     and activities.)\n       After considerable research and a couple of visits, Ben \n     decided to apply and was accepted at Berkeley, one of the \n     nation's most competitive universities.\n       ``Going to Berkeley expanded my horizons in just about \n     every way imaginable,'' he says of the school, which is \n     located across the bay from San Francisco.\n       As Ben explains the situation at Berkeley, he smiles and \n     mentions the school's diverse, multi-ethnic, multi-cultural \n     student body.\n       ``In most cities, `diversity,' means there are a lot of \n     different sections of town, each with its own different \n     ethnicity or whatever,'' he said. ``But in Berkeley, \n     everybody--all the different kinds of people--lives together. \n     . . . And that creates a kind of social comfort I had never \n     seen before.''\n       People in the Bay area--in California generally, according \n     to Ben--prefer to make life easy and non-confrontational. \n     They tend to be more accepting of different kinds of people \n     because there are a lot of different kinds of people living \n     close together. That means acceptance is the rule, not the \n     exception.\n       ``People with disabilities are just another element in that \n     kind of melting pot,'' Ben said. ``There are a lot of folks \n     in chairs out there--so it's easy to get around.''\n       And people with significant disabilities are more accepted, \n     more worked into the everyday mix of society, he noted.\n       That doesn't mean that bad things, never happen.\n       Ben tells the story of the time he went into San Francisco \n     to a concert. His plan was to meet friends in the city and go \n     to the Fillmore, one of the city's main event venues. Then \n     his friends would help him take the Bay Area Rapid Transit \n     train back across the Bay to his apartment.\n       But things began to go wrong as soon as he reached San \n     Francisco. He couldn't find his friends at all, and by the \n     time the concert got out, he realized that he had to return \n     home on his own.\n       Unfortunately, by the time he worked all that out, the BART \n     trains had stopped for the night, so Ben had to go home by \n     bus--a much longer and more circuitous route. He found his \n     way to the Trans-Bay Bus terminal, and got a bus part-way \n     home, to Oakland. It was late at night by then, and Ben had \n     to wait in downtown Oakland for a bus to Berkeley.\n       The bus finally arrived and Ben drove his motorized chair \n     onto the special lift that buses in the Bay area carry for \n     passengers with disabilities. At that moment, the lift broke \n     down.\n       And so at 3 a.m. Ben sat suspended over the street, waiting \n     for 45 minutes for a mechanic to come and repair the lift.\n       Eventually the mechanic fixed the lift, the bus rolled out \n     of the Oakland station, and Ben got home--as the sun was \n     rising at about 5 a.m. He passed out in his chair and was \n     later helped to bed by his roommate.\n       Such experiences have not cramped Ben's spirit. Now, with \n     his degree in linguistics, a high score on the LSATs, and \n     college behind him, he's taking a bit of a break, letting \n     things settle, thinking about his next move.\n       There is an employment possibility at Berkeley that he's \n     considering, but he's also visiting law schools--he and his \n     father, Mike Chater, checked out Yale last week; and Ben \n     would also like to visit Columbia and New York University. \n     Eventually, he plans to apply to several law schools, choose \n     one, and start next year. He's also thinking about traveling.\n       Like many young men and women his age, he also doesn't know \n     precisely what career he wants to follow.\n       ``The thought of being a lawyer . . . working in an office \n     for the rest of my life is not all that exciting,'' he said. \n     ``But going to law school gives you a lot of options--you can \n     do a lot of things with a law degree.''\n       His dad, Ben notes, has counseled him to keep as many \n     options open as he can.\n       Ben obviously has some things going for him. One is the \n     steady, strong support of his parents.\n       ``Our family was definitely oriented around Ben in his \n     early years,'' Maude Chater says, ``When he got into high \n     school, he directed us to back off a bit.''\n       Vacations and trips have occasionally been challenging. \n     ``We travel, but we don't travel light,'' Maude quips.\n       Independence has been Maude and Mike's goal for Ben since \n     his birth, and they realize that to foster independence in a \n     person you have to let them be independent.\n       But there are moments--especially when Ben wants to take a \n     significant step forward, like foreign travel or learning to \n     drive--that can cause the mental brakes to go on in a \n     parent's head. The difficulties Ben faces with daily living \n     are probably at least as stressful on his parents as on Ben \n     himself. But they have learned to stand back. They have \n     learned to learn.\n       And they are regularly amazed by their son's courage.\n       For his part, Ben doesn't waste any time at all on self-\n     pity. Not a moment.\n       ``I've never spent a lot of time thinking about what life \n     would be like if I weren't disabled,'' he said recently. ``I \n     believe that everyone's dealt a set of cards, and it doesn't \n     matter which cards you're dealt--it's how you play them.''\n       Interestingly, although he is well aware of the inequities \n     that people with disabilities face in society, he said \n     recently, ``There are a lot of things about our society that \n     aren't right, and that aren't fair.''\n       But he said he doesn't want to spend his life worrying \n     about that.\n       What he said he has learned, and is still learning, is that \n     the more comfortable people can be with themselves, the more \n     power they have over their lives--and by extension, the \n     conditions around them.\n       Ben doesn't think of himself as a teacher, but he is one. \n     Those who know him say he has taught them about the dignity \n     and deep value inherent in every person, no matter\n\n[[Page S9719]]\n\n     what their circumstances. At Berkeley, one of his nicknames \n     was ``The Rabbi,'' because of the wise counsel he would offer \n     his classmates, when asked.\n       He remains modest about his achievements, the long learning \n     process he has come through and the long road that remains \n     ahead. ``I'm definitely in the middle of a lengthy process of \n     figuring out which end is up,'' he said. ``It's a process \n     that everyone has to figure out for themselves.''\n       And what are his parents' hopes?\n       ``Our hope for Ben is that he is able to live \n     independently, support himself, and be happy,'' Maude says \n     ``. . . that he finds his place in the world.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/19/senate-section/article/S9719-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9719-S9720]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               DISASTER RECOVERY PERSONAL PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. VITER. Mr. President, as the Senate author of the Disaster \nRecovery Personal Protection Act of 2006 and a cosponsor of the \nDistrict of Columbia Personal Protection Act, I believe we must work to \nsupport the ability of law-abiding citizens to defend and protect \nthemselves and their families from criminal activity. It has been \nproven time and time again that prohibiting law-abiding citizens from \nowning a legal and constitutionally protected firearm does not reduce \ncrime but, as this article which I will ask to have printed in the \nRecord states, in fact, increases crime.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article published in the August 7 \nissue of Legal Times entitled ``The Laws That Misfire: Banning guns \ndoesn't work--in the District or anywhere else'' authored by Don B. \nKates be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From Legal Times, Aug. 7, 2006]\n\n                         The Laws That Misfire\n\n                           (By Don B. Kates)\n\n       The District of Columbia is now suffering from what its \n     police chief on July 11 called a ``crime emergency.''\n       In 1976 the District banned handguns and required that all \n     other guns be kept unloaded and disassembled, making them \n     unavailable for self-defense. The result is that for 30 \n     years, only lawbreakers have had guns readily available for \n     use in the District.\n       Is that effective policy? Is it a sensible way to respond \n     to a crime emergency? Those policy questions, in addition to \n     purely legal issues, arise in pending litigation that brings \n     a Second Amendment challenge against the District's gun bans.\n       I recently filed a Brandeis amicus brief supporting this \n     constitutional challenge. My co-counsel were 12 other law \n     professors, and the amici we represent include 16 American, \n     Australian, and Canadian social scientists and medical school \n     professors.\n       The case in question, Parker v. District of Columbia, is \n     currently before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. \n     Circuit, after an unfavorable ruling in the District Court. \n     The plaintiffs include a woman under a death threat for \n     reporting neighborhood drug-dealing to police and a gay man \n     who used his handgun to defend himself against a hate crime. \n     This brief was filed pro bono, and the amici are not being \n     paid.\n       What this amicus brief shows is significant, and the \n     information it contains may surprise some. For the truth \n     about gun bans is that they are policy failures even on their \n     own terms: More guns don't mean more death, and fewer guns \n     don't mean less death. Gun bans like the District's simply \n     don't work.\n\n\n                           BRITAIN'S FAILURE\n\n       Before the District adopted these policies in 1976, its \n     murder rate was declining. Shortly after the District adopted \n     the gun bans in an effort to reduce crime and violence, its \n     murder rate became the highest of any large American city. It \n     has remained the highest throughout the 30 years these \n     policies have been in force (excepting the few years when the \n     District ranked second or third).\n       To excuse this disastrous history, anti-gun advocates \n     assert that gun bans covering only a single city are \n     unenforceable.\n       True enough, but experience shows that gun bans covering an \n     entire nation are also unenforceable In the United Kingdom, \n     decades of severe gun control failed to stem steadily rising \n     violent crime. So in 1997 the United Kingdom banned and \n     confiscated all legally owned handguns. Yet by 2000 the \n     United Kingdom had the highest violent-crime rate in the \n     Western world--twice ours--and it still does today.\n       Gun bans are far from working even in a relatively small \n     island nation, the report of England's National Crime \n     Intelligence Service laments: Although ``Britain has some of \n     the strictest gun laws in the world [i]t appears that anyone \n     who wishes to obtain a firearm [illegally] will have little \n     difficulty in doing so.''\n       American anti-gun advocates used to cite the United \n     Kingdom, Canada, and Australia as nations where low violence \n     stemmed from severe gun restrictions. But in recent decades \n     those nations' violent-crime rates have skyrocketed, first \n     matching and now far surpassing ours.\n       In the 1990s those nations moved from severe controls to \n     outright bans and confiscation of half a million guns. Today, \n     Australia and Canada join the United Kingdom in having the \n     highest violent-crime rates in the Western world--more than \n     double ours.\n\n\n                              MURDER RATES\n\n       For decades anti-gun advocates claimed that America, with \n     the world's highest gun-ownership rate (true), had the \n     highest murder rate (false).\n       In fact, the recently revealed Russian murder rate for \n     the past 40 years has been consistently higher than the \n     American rate. The Russian murder rate in the 1990s and \n     2000s has been almost four times higher than the U.S. \n     rate. All this despite Russia's 70 years of banning \n     handguns and strictly controlling long guns--laws that it \n     enforced with police-state methods. Various European \n     nations, including Luxembourg, also ban handguns but have \n     much higher murder rates than the United States does.\n       Gun bans reflect a quasi-religious belief that more guns \n     (particularly handguns) mean more violence and death, and, \n     concomitantly, fewer guns mean fewer deaths.\n       This belief is quasi-religious because the believers cling \n     fanatically to it despite scores of studies around the world \n     finding no such correlation.\n       Consider the 2004 U.S. National Academy of Sciences \n     evaluation: Having reviewed 253 journal articles, 99 books, \n     43 government publications, and some empirical research of \n     its own, the academy could not identify any gun law that had \n     reduced violent crime, suicide, or gun accidents.\n       American statistics on both the numbers of guns and murder \n     rates are available from immediately after World War II to \n     the present. In 1946, with about 48 million guns in the \n     country, the U.S. murder rate was 6 per 100,000 people.\n       By 2000 the number of guns had increased fivefold (to more \n     than 260 million), but the murder rate was almost identical \n     (6.1). It remained there as of year-end 2004, despite the 12 \n     million guns added to the American gun stock since 2000.\n       In the 60 years since World War II, U.S. murder rates \n     dramatically increased and dramatically decreased--but not in \n     relation to gun ownership, which increased substantially \n     every year.\n       In the 1950s our murder rate held steady despite the \n     addition of roughly 2 million guns per year. In the mid-'60s \n     through the early '70s, the murder rate doubled, while 2.5 \n     million to 3 million guns were added annually. In the late \n     '70s, the murder rate held steady and then declined, even as \n     4 to 5 million more guns were added annually. Murder rates \n     skyrocketed with the introduction of crack in the late '80s, \n     but in the '90s they dramatically decreased, even as \n     Americans bought 50 million more guns.\n       In sum, between 1974 and 2003, the number of guns doubled, \n     but murder rates declined by one-third. So much for the \n     quasi-religious faith that more guns mean more murder.\n       Multinational studies also discredit that faith. An \n     American criminologist's comparison of homicide- and suicide-\n     mortality data with gun-ownership levels for 36 nations \n     (including the United States) for the period 1990-1955 showed \n     ``no significant (at the 5% level) association between gun \n     ownership and the total homicide rate.''\n       A somewhat later European study of data from 21 nations \n     found ``no significant correlations [of gun-ownership levels] \n     with total suicide or homicide rates.'' When you look at the \n     data, guns aren't increasing murders.\n\n\n                               who kills\n\n       The myth of more-guns-meaning-more-murder makes sense to \n     people who think most murders involve ordinary people killing \n     in moments of ungovernable rage because guns were available \n     to them.\n       But ordinary people do not commit most murders, or many \n     murders, or almost any murders. Almost all murderers are \n     extreme aberrants with life histories of violence, \n     psychopathology, substance abuse, and other crime.\n       Only about 15 percent of Americans have criminal records. \n     But homicide studies reveal nearly all murderers have adult \n     criminal records (often showing numerous arrests), have been \n     diagnosed as psychotic, or have had restraining orders issued \n     against them.\n       Obviously, such dangerous aberrants should not be allowed \n     any instrument more deadly than a toothpick. Unfortunately, \n     they disobey gun laws just as they disobey laws against \n     violence. But law-abiding adults do not murder, guns or no \n     guns, so there is little point is trying to disarm them.\n\n\n                         DEFENDING THE INNOCENT\n\n       Worse, banning guns to the general public is not just \n     useless but also counterproductive. Criminals prefer victims \n     who are weaker than they are. The unique virtue of firearms \n     is that they alone allow weaker people to resist predation by \n     stronger, more violent ones.\n       A recent criminological evaluation states: ``Reliable, \n     durable, and easy to operate, modern firearms are the most \n     effective means of self-defense ever devised. They require \n     minimal maintenance and, unlike knives and other weapons, do \n     not depend on an individual's physical strength for their \n     effectiveness. Only a gun can allow a 110 pound woman to \n     defend herself against a 200 pound man.''\n       Research has shown guns are six times more often used by \n     victims to repel criminals than by criminals committing \n     crimes.\n\n[[Page S9720]]\n\n       But Handgun Control Inc. tells victims not to resist rape \n     or robbery in any way: ``The best defense against injury is \n     to put up no defense--give them what they want or run.'' This \n     anti-gun position, too, is bereft of criminological support. \n     Twenty years of National Institute of Justice data show that \n     victims who resist with guns are less likely to be injured, \n     and much less likely to be raped or robbed, than victims who \n     submit. Indeed, in more than 80 percent of cases where a \n     victim pulls a gun, the criminal turns and flees whether he \n     has a gun or not.\n       When speaking at universities here and abroad, I am often \n     asked, ``Wouldn't it be a better world if there were no \n     guns?''\n       I am a criminologist, not a theologian. If you want a world \n     without guns and you think there is a God, pray for him to \n     abolish guns. Human laws cannot disarm lawbreakers, but only \n     the law-abiding.\n       Firearms are the only weaponry with which victims can \n     reliably resist aggressors. In their absence, the ruthless \n     and strong can oppress the weak.\n       Such oppression in the District is really the crime \n     emergency. And as the District responds, it should take an \n     unbiased look at the social-science data. It should rethink \n     its gun bans now under legal challenge. And after 30 years of \n     failed prohibition, it should now let its law-abiding \n     citizens arm themselves for their own protection.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/19/senate-section/article/S9720-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9720]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               BRIGADIER GENERAL ROBERT FRANCIS McDERMOTT\n\n Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nmoment to honor a dear friend and dedicated community leader who passed \naway on August 28, 2006. GEN Robert McDermott leaves behind a legacy of \ndistinguished service to his country and his community, and he will be \ndearly missed.\n  GEN Robert Francis McDermott was born on July 31, 1920, in Boston, \nMA, to Alphonsus and Anna McDermott. He graduated from the Boston Latin \nSchool in 1937 and continued his education at Norwich University. He \nreceived an appointment to the United States Military Academy in 1940 \nand was commissioned on January 19, 1943. In 1950, General McDermott \nearned an MBA degree from Harvard University.\n  On January 20, 1943, General McDermott married Alice Patricia \nMcDermott at Trinity Chapel at West Point. Their marriage would last 47 \nyears until Alice's death in 1990. Following their wedding, General \nMcDermott was assigned to the 474th Fighter Bomber Group as its deputy \ngroup operations officer and flew 61 combat missions in a P-38 during \nWorld War II in the European Theatre. After the war, he remained in \nEurope on General Eisenhower's staff and later served in the Pentagon.\n  After teaching economics at West Point for 4 years, General McDermott \nwas assigned to the newly established Air Force Academy as vice dean \nand professor of economics. In 1956, he was appointed Dean of Faculty, \nand in 1959, President Eisenhower appointed General McDermott the first \nPermanent Dean of Faculty and promoted him to brigadier general. At \nthat time, he was the youngest flag-rank officer in all of the armed \nservices. In recognition of General McDermott's contributions and \ninnovations at the Air Force Academy, the Air Force named the cadet \nlibrary for him and called him the ``Father of Modern Military \nEducation.'' He retired from the Air Force in 1968.\n  General McDermott joined USAA--United Services Automobile \nAssociation--as executive vice president, and became its president in \nJanuary 1969. Throughout his career, McDermott's philosophy was to \nnurture the employees and to promote their personal and professional \ngrowth treating them and USAA's customers by the Golden Rule. His \nefforts bore success. In 1993, USAA was ranked No. 1 in ``The 100 Best \nCompanies to Work for in America.'' General McDermott retired as \nchairman and CEO of USAA in 1993.\n  On August 6, 1994, General McDermott married Marion Slemon of \nColorado Springs. They enjoyed his retirement in San Antonio and \nColorado Springs, but General McDermott did not slow down. He was \nactive in the San Antonio community with business and charitable \norganizations, enjoyed traveling to visit family and friends, and \ncontinued playing golf and his trombone.\n  As a dedicated and enthusiastic advocate for San Antonio, General \nMcDermott worked tirelessly to advance economic development in the \narea. In 1974, he was elected chairman of the Greater San Antonio \nChamber of Commerce and promoted San Antonio as a center for domestic \nand international growth. He also founded the Economic Development \nFoundation and was a cofounder of United San Antonio. In the 1980s, \nGeneral McDermott focused on the development of biotechnology in San \nAntonio to provide the city with a viable economic sector for the 21st \ncentury. In 1984, he founded the Texas Research and Technology \nFoundation which began development of the Texas Research Park--TRP--the \ncore of biotechnology for San Antonio. In the early 1990s, General \nMcDermott also led a group of local investors to buy the San Antonio \nSpurs to assure it would stay in San Antonio. To coach the Spurs, he \nselected Air Force Academy graduate Gregg Popovich who led the team to \nwin three NBA championships.\n  For General McDermott's wide-ranging efforts on behalf of San \nAntonio, the city of San Antonio named a section of Interstate Highway \n10 West as the ``Robert F. McDermott Freeway.'' He also received \nrecognition for his business and educational activities, including an \nelementary school named for him, induction into the Texas Business Hall \nof Fame in 1987 and the American National Business Hall of Fame in \n1989; the recipient of the Distinguished Graduate Award from West Point \nin 1993; the recipient of Harvard Business School's Alumni Achievement \nAward in 1998; and most recently, the University of the Incarnate Word \nestablished the Robert F. McDermott Professorship in Organizational \nLeadership this year.\n  Today I honor the passing of a great family man, a terrific friend, \nand an outstanding community leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/19/senate-section/article/S9720-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9720-S9721]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NATIONAL MINE RESCUE COMPETITION\n\n Mr. ENZI.

The tragic loss of \nlife in these accidents served to reaffirm the commitment of all those \ninvolved in the industry to ensuring and improving the safety and \nwelfare of our Nation's miners.\n  Essential to that effort, and emblematic of our commitment, was the \npassage of the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response, MINER, Act \nof 2006. The MINER Act passed this body unanimously. It was then signed \ninto law by President Bush and implemented by the Mine Safety and \nHealth Administration, MSHA.\n  As the primary sponsor of the MINER Act, I am confident that this new \nlaw will improve the safety of our underground mines and reduce the \nlikelihood of similar tragic accidents in the future. In the careful \nand deliberate process of developing the MINER Act, the views of all \nstakeholders were solicited and carefully considered. Although in many \nareas there were differences of opinion, all those involved in the \nissue of mine safety were in agreement on the critical role played by \nmine rescue teams and universal in their praise of the dedicated \nindividuals who serve on them.\n  Rescue teams represent the very finest traditions of the mining \ncommunity. Composed of volunteers, highly trained and experienced, \nthese teams stand ready to come to the aid of their fellow miners in \nthe most critical and dangerous of situations. The MINER Act explicitly \nrecognizes the essential role of mine rescue teams and the importance \nof their training and support.\n  Part of the training and the tradition of mine rescue teams is their \nparticipation in competitions that pit the teams against each another. \nEach year MSHA holds a national mine rescue competition that draws \nteams from throughout the United States. This year, the metal, nonmetal \nmine competition was held in Reno, NV. I am particularly pleased to \nreport four teams from southwestern Wyoming placed in the top six spots \nin a field of 34 teams from across the Nation.\n  The FMC Corporation White Team, which was led by Leroy Hutchinson, \nwon the competition. The White Team\n\n[[Page S9721]]\n\nwas followed by the FMC Red Team, led by Bob Knot. OCI Chemical's Blue \nTeam, which was led by Gary Ruiz, placed fifth, and Solvay's Silver \nTeam, which was led by Shawn Marshall, placed sixth.\n  These teams represent the best of southwest Wyoming's soda ash \nindustry. The four companies that mine the mineral Trona in Wyoming \naccount for 90 percent of the U.S. production of soda ash. Soda ash is \na commodity required for the production of glass. It is also a very \nimportant export that accounts for $500 million of our balance of \ntrade.\n  I am very proud of this year's showing by our Wyoming soda ash \nindustry in this competition. It is important to remember that although \nthis is a competition, it is not a sport. The National Mine Safety \nRescue Contest and other mine safety rescue contests are training \nevents. They help prepare mine rescue teams so they are ready to act if \nthey are ever called to deal with a situation that we hope will never \noccur.\n  When accidents happen, miners count on volunteer mine rescue teams to \nsave them. Those mine rescue teams need to have the best resources \navailable to them and the training they will need to be prepared for \nanything that may happen as they take on that important job. Mine \nrescue competitions play an important role in that effort by providing \nmine rescue teams with the kind of experience they will need if they \nare to perform at the highest level of efficiency in the event there is \nan emergency. They offer a chance for teams to improve their \ncommunication skills, to consider previously unforeseen problems, and \nto get feedback on their performance from contest judges.\n  Although these teams compete against each other in mine rescue \ncontests, when a real world situation arises, they operate as one \ncohesive unit to affect a rescue. Each company can draw on the good \nwill and collective expertise of the mine rescue teams to help bring \nminers in danger to safety. In the spirit of brotherhood and \ncooperation, the teams know that if there is a mine emergency, they \nwill have the support they will need to bring the victims of the \naccident and their fellow rescue workers out of the mine and home to \ntheir families and loved ones.\n  In other words, while these companies compete in the marketplace and \nmine rescue teams compete in these contests, they will stand shoulder \nto shoulder should an accident occur at the mine.\n  I would like to include the names of each of the participants of our \nteams in southwest Wyoming who competed in the national mine rescue \ncompetition. Although I particularly want to congratulate the FMC White \nTeam, the FMC Red Team, OCI Chemical's Blue Team, and Solvay's Silver \nTeam, I congratulate and thank all those who participated. Your efforts \ncontinue to make a difference by making our mines a safer place for all \nour Nation's miners to work.\n  The information follows.\n\n       FMC White Team: Leroy Hutchinson (Captain) (Benchman), Tony \n     Herrera, Alan Jones (Gas), Robert Byers, Brad Roll, Bronson \n     Berg, Vern Plantenberg, Mike Padilla (Team Trainer).\n       FMC White First Aid: Robert Byers, Bronson Berg, Vern \n     Plantenberg.\n       FMC Red Team: Bob Knott (Captain), Mark Anderson, Rick \n     Owens (Gas), Robert Pope, Bill Madura, Daniel Hellickson, Rod \n     Knight (Benchman), Mike Padilla (Team Trainer), Dave \n     Hutchinson (Team Trainer), Rick Steenberg (Official in \n     Charge), Robert Pope, Mark Anderson, Bill Madura.\n       FMC Red First Aid: Robert Pope, Mark Anderson, Bill Madura.\n       General Chemical Blue: Jeff Downey (Captain), Doug Cox \n     (Gas), Steve McKeehan, Mickey Smith, Willie Cederburg, Stan \n     Owens, Terry Hansen, Leslie Wareham (Benchman), Keith Mullins \n     (Team Trainer), David Graham (Official in Charge), Mickey \n     Smith, Terry Hansen, Steve McKeehan.\n       General Chemical Blue First Aid: Mickey Smith, Terry \n     Hansen, Steve McKeehan.\n       General Chemical Black: Alan Brewer (Captain), Byron \n     Willingham, Lucas Coon (Gas), Curtiss Cooley, Jr., Steve \n     Roberts, Tommy Graham, Ken Ball, Charles Beard (Benchman), \n     John E.

Mr. President, today I acknowledge the Creative \nPlanters Garden Club of Louisiana. After the catastrophic destruction \nof Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, this organization has dedicated itself \nto rebuilding the horticulture in Louisiana, and I would like to take a \nfew moments to highlight their efforts.\n  Unfortunately, like many other citizens in south Louisiana, several \nmembers of this organization lost their homes to the hurricanes that \nravished our State in 2005. While many members of the Creative Planters \nGarden Club are rebuilding their livelihoods, they are also \nvolunteering their time to rebuild their State. Their priorities \ninclude replacing landscape projects devastated by Hurricanes Katrina \nand Rita and replanting the rose garden in New Orleans Botanical \nGardens in City Park. It is community involvement like this that \nenriches our State.\n  For more than 23 years the Creative Planters Garden Club has worked \nto enhance Louisiana communities by promoting civic stewardship and \nhorticulture education. They have worked in conjunction with many State \nand local government agencies to teach and encourage gardening to \nchildren.\n  I applaud the members of the Creative Planters Garden Club of \nLouisiana for their continued service to the citizens of their \ncommunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/19/senate-section/article/S9721-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9721-S9722]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REAR ADMIRAL MICHAEL K. LOOSE\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I \nrise today to recognize and honor Rear Admiral Michael K. Loose for his \nexceptional achievement as Commander, Naval Facilities Engineering \nCommand and Chief of Civil Engineers, from October 2003 to October \n2006.\n  As Commander, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, NAVFAC, Rear \nAdmiral Loose led 17,000 civilian and military employees, executing an \nannual workload of $10.6 billion supporting global contingency \nengineering operations, the Navy shore infrastructure, and systems \ncommand engineering and acquisition support. As the chief of civil \nengineers, he led Active and Reserve components of the Civil Engineer \nCorps community of over 2,000 officers and the enlisted Seabee \ncommunity of over 20,000 sailors that jointly serve as the Navy's \ncontingency and facilities engineering experts and comprise the Naval \nConstruction Force of 22 battalions, 4 regiments, and other supporting \nunits.\n  Upon assuming command of NAVFAC, Rear Admiral Loose quickly developed \nan overarching strategic plan that incorporated Department of Defense, \nSecretary of the Navy, and Chief of Naval Operations guiding \nprinciples. Building on this foundational document, and acutely focused \non the critical imperative to dramatically reduce costs to support Sea \nEnterprise fleet recapitalization, improve service to joint/fleet \noperational commands, and align and single-up accountability, Rear \nAdmiral Loose boldly conceptualized and implemented a dramatic \nrestructuring and transformation of all components of NAVFAC--the most \ncomprehensive and fundamental reorganization of the command since the \nNavy revamped the Bureau system more than three decades ago. As a \ndirect result of his initiative and vision,\n\n[[Page S9722]]\n\nover $600 million in savings were harvested and redirected to the fleet \nstarting in the Program Objective Memoranda for fiscal year 2006. \nOverall, Rear Admiral Loose increased production productivity by 13 \npercent while reducing the required workforce by 1,100 civilian \npositions. Key elements of the transformation that enabled these \nefficiencies included dramatically consolidating and fully aligning \nNAVFAC field commands with Navy regional commanders. This structural \nrealignment combined Navy public works centers focused on maintenance, \ntransportation, and utilities services with engineering field divisions \nfocused on planning, environmental, design, and construction services \nto establish a single, aligned, and vastly streamlined organization--a \nRegional Facilities Engineering Command. He also developed and executed \nstrategic partnership agreements with Commander, Navy Installations \nCommand and Headquarters, U.S. Marine Corps--Installations--and \nCommander, Naval Supply Systems Command, to enable lowest facility \nlife-cycle business analysis and management by leveraging the \ntransformed NAVFAC organization. With the establishment of the single, \naligned Facilities Engineering Command in each Navy region, Rear \nAdmiral Loose operationalized NAVFAC, creating a command culture of \naccountability, technical competency, and responsiveness to fleet \nmission demands and surge requirements.\n  Rear Admiral Loose also aggressively supported the newly established \nNaval Expeditionary Combat Command/Naval Expeditionary Combat \nEnterprise as Systems Command Commander and first chief operating \nofficer. He developed a $400 million program to replace overage and \nexpended equipment, weapons, personal protective gear, and materials \nsupporting the Naval Construction Force extended operations in support \nof Operations Noble Eagle, Iraqi Freedom, and Enduring Freedom. Rear \nAdmiral Loose guided the largest mobilization since Vietnam of Seabees \nand Civil Engineer Corps Officers, enabling outstanding mission support \nof Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom II.\n  Clearly, Rear Admiral Loose's comprehensive knowledge of the Navy, \nkeen judgment, and unwavering commitment to the sailor, the Navy \nfamily, and the fleet have made him an asset to the Navy. I am proud \nthat he is my fellow New Mexican and my fellow American, and I am \npleased to recognize and thank Rear Admiral Loose for his tenure as \nCommander, NAVFAC and Chief of Civil Engineers.\n  Today I honor Rear Admiral Loose for his service to our country, his \ninspirational moral courage, his exceptional strategic vision, and his \nrelentlessly bold leadership. He and his wife Carol have made many \nsacrifices during his career in the Navy, and I call upon my colleagues \nand join his family, friends, and associates to wish them ``fair winds \nand following seas'' as they embark on yet another great Navy adventure \nand continue their dedicated and outstanding service to this grateful \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/19/senate-section/article/S9722-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9722]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               HONORING SOUTH DAKOTA GAME, FISH AND PARKS\n\n Mr. THUNE.

A bill to direct the Joint Committee on the Library to \naccept the donation of a bust depicting Sojourner Truth and to display \nthe bust in a suitable location in the Capitol; to the Committee on \nRules and Administration.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President it gives me pride and pleasure to \nintroduce revised legislation that will enable the Joint Committee on \nthe Library to display a bust depicting Sojourner Truth in the Capitol \nBuilding.\n  I began this effort with legislation I introduced 2 years ago during \nthe 108th Congress. Because my colleagues in the other body and I were \nnot able to enact our bill that time, we return in the 109th Congress \nwith new legislation which would direct the Joint Committee on the \nLibrary to accept the donation of a bust depicting Sojourner Truth and \nto display the bust in a suitable location in the Capitol. I now lay \ndown this version of the bill that reflects bipartisan support among \nleaders who share the goal of honoring this important figure in our \nNation's and New York State's history.\n  Sojourner Truth was born into slavery in New York's Hudson Valley in \n1797, She moved to New York City after gaining her freedom in 1826 and \nby 1843 had changed her name to Sojourner Truth, traveling the country \npreaching for human rights. After attending the 1850 National Woman's \nRights Convention, Truth made women's suffrage a focal point of her \nspeeches, portraying women as powerful, independent figures. Her most \nfamous speech, ``Ain't I a Woman,'' given at the 1851 Women's Rights \nConvention in Akron, OH, has become a classic text on women's rights.\n  Because of her great, advocacy on behalf of women, despite all of the \nhardships she faced, Sojourner Truth deserves to be represented along \nwith the suffragists depicted in the United States Capitol Building. I \nask that the Senate come together and honor this visionary American for \nher service to our Nation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Alexander, and Mr. Frist):\n  S. 3911.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nextend the exceptions process with respect to caps on payments for \ntherapy services under the Medicare program; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I am pleased to introduce the Securing Effective and \nNecessary Individual Outpatient Rehabilitation Services Act, the \nSENIORS Act, to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries who rely on \nmedically necessary therapy services continue to have access to the \nservices they need. The bill would allow exceptions to therapy caps for \ncertain medically necessary services in 2007.\n  An exceptions process for Medicare patients who exceed the therapy \ncap was authorized in legislation last year. A Medicare patient may now \nobtain an exception if the service is deemed medically necessary and \nthen receive covered therapy services above the cap. The exceptions \nprocess expires at the end of this year, so Congress must extend it for \nthe 2007 calendar year.\n  I started the fight to eliminate the annual cap on outpatient \nrehabilitation services in its entirety when I was in the House of \nRepresentatives. I brought this fight to the Senate where I introduced \nlegislation to completely repeal the annual Medicare cap on \nrehabilitation therapy services. I recognize that a complete repeal is \nnot politically or financially viable at this time. However, an \nextension of the exceptions process should be possible.\n  Action is needed to address the therapy caps this year. This is not a \nRepublican issue or a Democrat issue. At its heart, this issue is a \npatient issue. Forty-four of my Senate colleagues have joined me in \nlegislation to repeal the therapy caps once and for all. In addition, \nalmost 260 of members of the United States House of Representatives and \nmore than 40 groups representing patients and providers support \nlegislation efforts to repeal the caps or extend the current exceptions \nprocess. And, in May of this year, 47 Senators signed a letter to \nSenate leadership urging an extension of the exceptions process \nauthorized in the Deficit Reduction Act beyond its current expiration \nof January 1, 2007.\n  Ensuring access to needed outpatient physical therapy, occupational \ntherapy and speech language pathology services for Medicare \nbeneficiaries in a fiscally responsible manner is essential. Denying \naccess by an arbitrary cap will only shift costs as patients will delay \nrehabilitation, seek more costly interventions, or be admitted \ninpatient settings.\n  As a member of th1e Senate Budget Committee, I realize the serious \nbudgetary constraints that are upon Congress. I also understand that we \nneed to prioritize spending. I believe that extension of the exceptions \nprocess beyond 2006 should be a priority. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues to ensure that senior citizens continue to have \naccess to high-quality rehabilitation services.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      BY Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 3913. A bill to amend title XXI of the Social Security Act to \neliminate funding shortfalls for the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram (SCHIP) for fiscal year 2007; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto protect the vital health insurance coverage that millions of our \nNation's children receive through the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram (CHIP). As I stand here today, at least 17 States face looming \nFederal funding shortfalls of as much as $900 million, the cost of \ncovering more than half a million children.\n  Mr. Dingell, the distinguished ranking member of the House Energy and \nCommerce Committee, and I have worked for several weeks to craft a bill \nthat reflects the intentions of this program when it was first created \nnearly ten years ago: to provide comprehensive health insurance \ncoverage for children. Additionally, this legislation addresses an \nongoing set of challenges associated with the program's block grant \nfinancing structure. I am pleased to report that Mr. Dingell and others \nwill be introducing companion legislation in the House of \nRepresentatives today.\n  We are introducing the Keep Children Covered Act now because it is \ncritically important that we consider and pass this legislation before \nwe adjourn this year. No one can dispute the success of the CHIP \nprogram in enrolling and providing coverage for more then 6 million \nchildren nationwide. In 2005, West Virginia provided coverage for more \nthen 38,000 children, and an expansion to reach additional children is \ncurrently underway. This is quite an accomplishment. But, the ongoing \nsuccess of this program depends on adequate Federal funding for all \nStates.\n  It is a sad truth that persistent barriers to health care coverage \nhave resulted in annual increases in the total number of uninsured \nAmericans. Today, 46 million Americans are uninsured for all or most of \nthe year. I am particularly troubled in that, in 2005, the number of \nuninsured children increased for the first time since the CHIP program \nwas implemented in 1998. The number of uninsured children now stands at \n8.3 million.\n  This is unacceptable. We have taken a significant step back in terms \nof covering children, and this will only get worse if the $900 million \nFederal funding shortfall is not immediately addressed. Children are \nthe least expensive group to insure, and our future depends on their \ngood health and well-being. There is clear evidence that children with \nconsistent access to health care services are more likely to become \nhealthy adults and successful members of our communities. Like West \nVirginia, a number of States have expressed their willingness to expand \nthe CHIP program, but we must hold up our end of the bargain and supply \nthem with the resources necessary to make these positive changes. It \nwould be irresponsible for us to allow additional children to go \nwithout this much needed access to care. It would also run counter to \nthe goals Congress set out when we created CHIP in 1997.\n  Preserving health care coverage for children is not an objective \nbeyond our reach. Although it represents only a temporary fix of the \nlarger funding issues facing CHIP, the bill I am introducing today will \nalleviate the fiscal year 2007 shortfalls and ensure that children \ncurrently enrolled in CHIP do not lose their coverage. I congratulate \nmy colleagues on the House side, Congressmen Deal and Norwood, who \nintroduced similar legislation at the end of last week. They understand \nthis is something we can come together on, pass, and enact into law \nbefore Congress recesses for the elections. It is my hope that Congress \nwill act on a bipartisan basis to more comprehensively address the \nlong-term financial challenges facing CHIP when the program is \nreauthorized next year.\n  In the meantime, I urge my colleagues to make children's health care \na priority during the limited time we have left this session. Working \nfamilies depend on this program in order to access the health care \nservices--like check-ups and prescriptions--that their children need. I \nhope we will not let them down. We should not.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of this bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3913\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 572\n\n       Whereas over 205,000,000 Americans use the Internet in the \n     United States, including over 84,000,000 home-users through \n     broadband connections, to communicate with family and \n     friends, manage their finances, pay their bills, improve \n     their education, shop at home, and read about current events;\n       Whereas the approximately 26,000,000 small businesses in \n     the United States, who represent 99.7 percent of all United \n     States employers and employ 50 percent of the private work \n     force, increasingly rely on the Internet to manage their \n     businesses, expand their customer reach, and enhance their \n     connection with their supply chain;\n       Whereas, according to the Department of Education, nearly \n     100 percent of public schools in the United States have \n     Internet access, with approximately 93 percent of \n     instructional classrooms connected to the Internet;\n       Whereas having access to the Internet in the classroom \n     enhances the education of our children by providing access to \n     educational online content and encouraging responsible self-\n     initiative to discover research resources;\n       Whereas, according to the Pew Institute, almost 9 in 10 \n     teenagers between the ages of 12 and 17, or 87 percent of all \n     youth (approximately 21,000,000 people) use the Internet, and \n     78 percent (or about 16,000,000 students) say they use the \n     Internet at school;\n       Whereas teen use of the Internet at school has grown 45 \n     percent since 2000, and educating children of all ages about \n     safe, secure, and ethical practices will not only protect \n     their computer systems, but will also protect the physical \n     safety of our children, and help them become good cyber \n     citizens;\n       Whereas the growth and popularity of social networking \n     websites have attracted millions of teenagers, providing them \n     with a range of valuable services;\n       Whereas teens should be taught how to avoid potential \n     threats like cyber bullies, online predators, and identity \n     thieves that they may encounter while using cyber services;\n       Whereas the critical infrastructure of our Nation relies on \n     the secure and reliable operation of information networks to \n     support our Nation's financial services, energy, \n     telecommunications, transportation, health care, and \n     emergency response systems;\n       Whereas cyber security is a critical part of the overall \n     homeland security of our Nation, in particular the control \n     systems that control and monitor our drinking water, dams, \n     and other water management systems, our electricity grids, \n     oil and gas supplies, and pipeline distribution networks, our \n     transportation systems, and other critical manufacturing \n     processes;\n       Whereas terrorists and others with malicious motives have \n     demonstrated an interest in utilizing cyber means to attack \n     our Nation;\n       Whereas the mission of the Department of Homeland Security \n     includes securing the homeland against cyber terrorism and \n     other attacks;\n       Whereas Internet users and our information infrastructure \n     face an increasing threat of malicious attacks through \n     viruses, worms, Trojans, and unwanted programs such as \n     spyware, adware, hacking tools, and password stealers, that \n     are frequent and fast in propagation, are costly to repair, \n     and disable entire computer systems;\n       Whereas, according to Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, since \n     February 2005, over 90,000,000 records containing personally-\n     identifiable information have been breached, and the overall \n     increase in serious data breaches in both the private and \n     public sectors are threatening the security and well-being of \n     the citizens of the United States;\n       Whereas consumers face significant financial and personal \n     privacy losses due to identity theft and fraud, as reported \n     in over 686,000 consumer complaints in 2005 received by the \n     Consumer Sentinel database operated by the Federal Trade \n     Commission;\n       Whereas Internet-related complaints in 2005 accounted for \n     46 percent of all reported fraud complaints received by the \n     Federal Trade Commission;\n       Whereas the total amount of monetary losses for such \n     Internet-related complaints exceeded $680,000,000, with a \n     median loss of $350 per complaint;\n       Whereas the youth of our Nation face increasing threats \n     online such as inappropriate content or child predators;\n       Whereas, according to the National Center For Missing and \n     Exploited Children, 34 percent of teens are exposed to \n     unwanted sexually explicit material on the Internet, and 1\n\n[[Page S9729]]\n\n     in 7 children report having been approached by an online \n     child predator;\n       Whereas national organizations, policymakers, government \n     agencies, private sector companies, nonprofit institutions, \n     schools, academic organizations, consumers, and the media \n     recognize the need to increase awareness of computer security \n     and enhance the level of computer and national security in \n     the United States;\n       Whereas the mission of National Cyber Security Alliance is \n     to increase awareness of cyber security practices and \n     technologies to home-users, students, teachers, and small \n     businesses through educational activities, online resources \n     and checklists, and public service announcements; and\n       Whereas the National Cyber Security Alliance has designated \n     October as National Cyber Security Awareness Month, which \n     will provide an opportunity to educate the people of the \n     United States about computer security: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Cyber \n     Security Awareness Month; and\n       (2) will work with Federal agencies, national \n     organizations, businesses, and educational institutions to \n     encourage the development and implementation of existing and \n     future computer security voluntary consensus standards, \n     practices, and technologies in order to enhance the state of \n     computer security in the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day":

SUPPORT THE SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION FROM \n                CONFLICT TO SUSTAINABLE PEACE IN UGANDA\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself and Brownback, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Martinez, \nMr. Coleman, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Biden \nand Mr. Kennedy) submitted for the following resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 573\n\n       Whereas, for nearly 2 decades, the Government of Uganda has \n     been engaged in a conflict with the Lord's Resistance Army \n     (referred to in this preamble as the ``LRA'') that has \n     resulted in--\n       (1) the deaths of approximately 200,000 individuals from \n     violence and disease; and\n       (2) the displacement of more than 1,600,000 individuals \n     from the northern and eastern regions of Uganda;\n       Whereas more than half of those internally-displaced \n     individuals are under the age of 15, and 95 percent of those \n     individuals live in absolute poverty in camps where they face \n     malnutrition, high rates of AIDS and malaria, and egregious \n     abuses of their human rights;\n       Whereas the LRA has used brutal tactics during that \n     conflict, including the abduction and abuse of more than \n     25,000 children who the organization forces to attack, rape, \n     and murder members of their families and communities on \n     behalf of the LRA;\n       Whereas continued instability and a lack of security in the \n     northern region of Uganda has severely hindered the delivery \n     of sufficient humanitarian assistance and services to \n     individuals who have been displaced or otherwise negatively \n     affected by that conflict;\n       Whereas spillover from the war in the northern region of \n     Uganda have had negative consequences in the neighboring \n     countries of Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo;\n       Whereas a successful transition to sustainable peace in the \n     northern region of Uganda and throughout the country will \n     depend in large part on a coordinated and comprehensive \n     effort by the Government of Uganda, regional partners, and \n     the international community to create new social, economic, \n     and political opportunities for the citizens of Uganda who \n     are affected by that conflict;\n       Whereas a sustainable political resolution to that conflict \n     must include a range of locally and nationally driven \n     reconciliation efforts that will require the endorsement and \n     involvement of all parties to the conflict, as well as \n     support from the international community;\n       Whereas the 2005 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, \n     published by the Department of State, relating to the \n     Government of Uganda indicated that the ``security forces \n     committed unlawful killings. . .and were responsible for \n     deaths as a result of torture'' along with other ``serious \n     problems'', including repression of political opposition, \n     official impunity, and violence against women and children;\n       Whereas, in the Northern Uganda Crisis Response Act (Public \n     Law 108-283; 118 Stat. 912), the Senate--\n       (1) declared its support for a peaceful resolution of the \n     conflict in the northern and eastern regions of Uganda; and\n       (2) called for the United States and the international \n     community to assist in rehabilitation, reconstruction, and \n     demobilization efforts; and\n\n       Whereas the cessation of hostilities agreement, that was \n     mediated by the Government of Southern Sudan and signed by \n     representatives of the Government of Uganda and the LRA on \n     August 20, 2006--\n       (1) required both parties to cease all hostile military and \n     media offensives; and\n       (2) asked the Sudanese People's Liberation Army to \n     facilitate the safe assembly of LRA fighters in designated \n     areas for the duration of the peace talks: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends the delegates from the Government of Uganda \n     and the Lord's Resistance Army for agreeing to a cessation of \n     hostilities for the first time in the 20 years of that \n     devastating conflict;\n       (2) recognizes the leadership role that the Government of \n     Southern Sudan played in mediating that cessation of \n     hostilities and establishing a framework within which a \n     lasting peace to that conflict could be achieved;\n       (3) emphasizes the importance of a complete implementation \n     of the cessation of hostilities agreement by all parties to \n     maintain progress towards a permanent resolution of that \n     conflict;\n       (4) expresses the support of the citizens of the United \n     States for the people of Uganda who have endured decades of \n     violence as a result of that conflict;\n       (5) entreats all parties to address issues of \n     accountability and impunity for war crimes and crimes against \n     humanity, and to support broader national reconciliation \n     efforts;\n       (6) strongly encourages the Government of Uganda to improve \n     the professionalism of Ugandan military personnel currently \n     stationed in the northern and eastern regions of Uganda, with \n     an emphasis on enhancing respect for human rights, \n     accountability for abuses, and effective protection of \n     civilians;\n       (7) urges the Government of Uganda to follow through and \n     augment its resettlement plan by--\n       (A) expanding social services;\n       (B) deploying professional civil servants; and\n       (C) developing the legal, political, and security \n     infrastructure--\n       (i) necessary to facilitate the freedom of movement of \n     civilians to their homes, land, and areas within and around \n     camps; and\n       (ii) essential to fulfill the needs of returnees and former \n     combatants; and\n       (8) calls on the United States Department of State and the \n     United States Agency for International Development, as well \n     as the international community--\n       (A) to provide adequate and coordinated humanitarian \n     assistance through nongovernmental organizations to the \n     individuals and areas most affected by that conflict;\n       (B) to, while providing humanitarian assistance, pay \n     particular attention to women and children who have been \n     victimized; and\n       (C) to provide--\n       (i) sufficient technical assistance for the demobilization \n     and reintegration of rebel combatants and abductees;\n       (ii) both financial and technical support for \n     reconciliation and reconstruction efforts; and\n       (iii) diplomatic and logistical support for the cessation \n     of hostilities agreement and subsequent progress towards a \n     sustainable peace in Uganda.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/19/senate-section/article/S9729-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9729-S9730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 574--RECOGNIZING THE NORTH CAROLINA FARM BUREAU \n  FEDERATION ON THE OCCASION OF ITS 70TH ANNIVERSARY AND SALUTING THE \n     OUTSTANDING SERVICE OF ITS MEMBERS AND STAFF ON BEHALF OF THE \n        AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY AND THE PEOPLE OF NORTH CAROLINA\n\n  Mr. BURR (for himself and Mrs. Dole) submitted for the following \nresolution;

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.

Res. 573\n\n       Whereas, for nearly 2 decades, the Government of Uganda has \n     been engaged in a conflict with the Lord's Resistance Army \n     (referred to in this preamble as the ``LRA'') that has \n     resulted in--\n       (1) the deaths of approximately 200,000 individuals from \n     violence and disease; and\n       (2) the displacement of more than 1,600,000 individuals \n     from the northern and eastern regions of Uganda;\n       Whereas more than half of those internally-displaced \n     individuals are under the age of 15, and 95 percent of those \n     individuals live in absolute poverty in camps where they face \n     malnutrition, high rates of AIDS and malaria, and egregious \n     abuses of their human rights;\n       Whereas the LRA has used brutal tactics during that \n     conflict, including the abduction and abuse of more than \n     25,000 children who the organization forces to attack, rape, \n     and murder members of their families and communities on \n     behalf of the LRA;\n       Whereas continued instability and a lack of security in the \n     northern region of Uganda has severely hindered the delivery \n     of sufficient humanitarian assistance and services to \n     individuals who have been displaced or otherwise negatively \n     affected by that conflict;\n       Whereas spillover from the war in the northern region of \n     Uganda have had negative consequences in the neighboring \n     countries of Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo;\n       Whereas a successful transition to sustainable peace in the \n     northern region of Uganda and throughout the country will \n     depend in large part on a coordinated and comprehensive \n     effort by the Government of Uganda, regional partners, and \n     the international community to create new social, economic, \n     and political opportunities for the citizens of Uganda who \n     are affected by that conflict;\n       Whereas a sustainable political resolution to that conflict \n     must include a range of locally and nationally driven \n     reconciliation efforts that will require the endorsement and \n     involvement of all parties to the conflict, as well as \n     support from the international community;\n       Whereas the 2005 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, \n     published by the Department of State, relating to the \n     Government of Uganda indicated that the ``security forces \n     committed unlawful killings. . .and were responsible for \n     deaths as a result of torture'' along with other ``serious \n     problems'', including repression of political opposition, \n     official impunity, and violence against women and children;\n       Whereas, in the Northern Uganda Crisis Response Act (Public \n     Law 108-283;
