Mr. President, in a few minutes, we will return to the \nDepartment of Defense appropriations bill. We have several votes on \namendments and the two managers were able to work out language on a \nnumber of other amendments that were agreed to by consent. I expect \nanother full day on the Defense bill, with votes on amendments, as \nnecessary. We will remain in session later into the evening to finish \nthe appropriations bill tonight. That is the goal. The two managers \nhave patiently waited for Senators to bring their amendments forward. I \nwould counsel them to bring the bill to a close if Senators are not \nprepared to come down and offer their amendments. Again, the managers \nare doing a superb job. We need to get Members to move ahead with their \namendments and make sure they are appropriately offered.\n  Last night I filed a cloture motion on the motion to proceed to the \nFamily Prosperity Act, which is the death tax, the minimum wage, and \nthe extenders package. That vote will occur tomorrow morning, unless we \ncan finish the Defense bill earlier and we can get an agreement to \nchange the timing of that cloture vote.\n  Therefore, I encourage Members to remain available for the next 24 to \n48 hours as we consider these two important measures, along with a very \nimportant pensions bill which we must act upon before we leave.\n  Let me turn to the Democratic leader briefly. Schedulingwise, we have \na busy day, a lot today and tomorrow. I have a couple of things I want \nto discuss, including commenting on the bill for tomorrow morning and \nalso trying to go to the child custody protection.\n  Anything else on the schedule to address?\n  Mr. REID. No.\n\n\n                  unanimous consent request--h.r. 748\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, let me go to the Child Custody Protection \nAct. This is a bill that earlier this week I asked unanimous consent to \ngo to conference on, a bill we passed last week with strong bipartisan \nsupport, 65 to 34. The assistant Democratic leader objected to this \nrequest on the grounds\n\n[[Page S8672]]\n\nthat he wanted assurance that language offered in an amendment by \nSenator Boxer would be retained. He was referring to the only amendment \nthat the Senate agreed to on that bill. This amendment clarifies that a \nfather who victimized his daughter by incest would not be able to \ntransport her across State lines for an abortion or to sue anyone who \ndid. This amendment offered by Senator Boxer and cosponsored by Senator \nFeinstein passed the Senate 98 to 0. I obviously voted for it. It \nimproved the bill. I fully support the amendment.\n  To accommodate the concern that was expressed, I pledged I will not \nsupport a conference report or any consideration of a conference report \nthat does not retain that Boxer-Ensign language we agreed to July 25. I \ntake the Democratic leader at his word and want to address his concern. \nThus, I make it clear I give my word that the language he wants will be \nincluded and his request will be met. I trust that by addressing his \nstated concern we will be able to move forward.\n  I now ask for unanimous consent the Senate immediately proceed to \nconsideration of H.R. 748, provided that all after the enacting clause \nbe stricken, and the text of S. 403 be inserted in lieu thereof, the \nbill then be read the third time and passed, the Senate insist on its \namendment, request a conference with the House, and the chair be \nauthorized to appoint conferees with the ratio of 3 to 2.\n\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, first of all, I voted for \nthis legislation. I support it. However, there are Senators on this \nside of the aisle who do not. Senator Boxer appreciates the assurance \nthat has been given to her through the public statement of the leader. \nShe has heard from others that does not bind what the House would do \nwith this piece of legislation.\n  That is one of the problems we have when you spend so much time on \nissues that are taking far too much time. We talked about the estate \ntax endlessly. There are ways, even though there are people on this \nside of the aisle who object to going to conference, that this matter \ncan be taken to conference. We pass bills all the time by sending a \nbill to the House and having them accept it. If that does not work, \nthere are procedural methods that can be taken.\n  The bill passed by 70 votes or even more, far more than enough to \novercome any procedural hurdles anyone could stand in the way of. Steps \njust have to be initiated.\n  As a result of that, on behalf of Senator Boxer and others, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I shortly will move to a statement on the \nFamily Prosperity Act, but both of my distinguished colleagues from \nNevada are here. If I could briefly yield to my distinguished \ncolleague, the sponsor of the bill we were just talking about.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, the Child Custody Protection Act is an \nimportant piece of legislation. During the debate, we heard from people \nfrom around the country that this is an important piece of legislation, \nand they want to see it move forward. We had heard the last couple of \nyears that neither side of the aisle would cooperate with the other \nside. During the child custody debate, we cooperated. There was an \nagreement between the leaders. We had a certain number of amendments. \nThe whole tenor of the debate, on a very emotional issue, was \ncooperative. Even though we disagreed on the issue, there was \ncooperation. I worked with Senator Boxer on the amendment. We had \nseveral amendments. We ended up getting it down to basically a Boxer-\nEnsign amendment that strongly improved the bill. I asked her if she \nwanted a voice vote on the bill. She said no, she wanted a recorded \nvote to make sure it stayed in conference. I told her, that is great, \nwe will have a recorded vote. Saying she wanted that recorded vote to \nstay in conference indicated to me that there would be cooperation to \ngo to conference. We had a recorded vote. It is an amendment I feel \nstrongly about and want to see it stay in the bill in conference.\n  To now block, via a parliamentary move, an important piece of \nlegislation simply because we are at the end of a session and the other \nside knows we do not have the time to go through all the procedural \nmaneuverings is outrageous, especially because this Senate operates \nwith some kind of collegiality. When you are cooperating, you should \ncooperate.\n  There were accusations made that we should not bring up this \nlegislation because we don't have the time and we should be talking \nabout more important issues. What the other side is doing, by some \nSenators blocking this, is saying you should spend more time on this \nissue. If they were truly genuine in what they were saying, that we \nshouldn't spend too much time on this issue, then let's go to it.\n  It is a simple unanimous consent agreement that doesn't take any more \nfloor time. It is boom, it is done, we are done with this bill, and we \ncan go to conference and work out the differences. We will strongly \nsupport the Senate side the way the bill came out of the Senate. There \nmay be some small changes we have to make in conference, but the bottom \nline is we should move forward with this legislation.\n  The instructions being put out by the other side are wrong. I hope \nthe American people can get involved and let their Senators know they \nare unhappy about it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, one final issue to address is with regard \nto tomorrow's vote on the Family Prosperity Act. Tomorrow, we will be \nvoting on whether to proceed to the consideration of the Family \nProsperity Act, which is the compromise--I emphasize compromise--\npermanent solution to the death tax; second, extending important tax \nprovisions such as college tuition deductions, research and \ndevelopment, sales tax deductibility; and, third, raising the minimum \nwage with a 40-percent increase.\n  This Senate will decide tomorrow morning whether these issues are \nsufficiently important to people across this country who are paying \nattention or whether they are not sufficiently important to bring to \nthe Senate. That is what this vote is all about.\n  A ``yes'' vote tomorrow morning to proceed to the bills tells the \nAmerican family that we are listening to you, that we are with you, \nthat we hear you, that we understand your daily challenges. A ``no'' \nvote to proceed to the bills tells the American family these issues are \nsimply not sufficiently important for the Senate to consider, a \npermanent solution to the death tax, extending those tax provisions, \nraising the minimum wage.\n  Friday's vote--tomorrow morning--is an important vote. I made it very \nclear that we will not split up the bills. I made it clear this is a \npackage and we will move to proceed to them as such. Each Senator will, \nof course, be accountable to their constituents over the recess for how \nthey vote, either with the American family or against the American \nfamily.\n  Earlier this week, one of my distinguished colleagues came to the \nSenate and quoted President Truman and his whistlestop campaign and the \n``do nothing Congress.'' Why? Because my colleague does not believe the \nissues addressed in this particular bill, the Family Prosperity Act, \nare matters of importance to the American people. Some do not believe \neliminating the death tax is important to the American people, some do \nnot believe extending tax relief is important to the American people, \nand some don't believe raising the minimum wage is important to the \nAmerican people.\n  Yet the majority of the American people believe each one of these \nissues is important and does deserve consideration. If you look at the \npermanent death tax, roughly 70 percent of Americans support repeal of \nthe death tax. This is not repeal. We brought that to the floor and we \ngot 55 votes, so we are moving in that direction, but that is not \nsufficient. So we have a compromise permanent solution. This is an \nissue that touches the lives and livelihoods of Americans from \nWashington, DC, to Washington State.\n  Back home in Tennessee, Ann Bennett's family has farmed the same \npiece of land in Kingsport for the past 70 years for one generation and \nthe other two generations make it a total of 130 years. Already, they \nhave paid over $100,000 in death taxes so her father could inherit the \nfarm from his father. When Ann's father passes on, Ann\n\n[[Page S8673]]\n\nand her sisters have to come up with $2 million just to hold on to that \nfamily farm.\n  At its core, the death tax is a cruel and unfair burden inflicted on \nAmerica's small businesses, on farmers, and on families during a time \nof grieving and pain. It punishes everyday Americans such as Ann \nBennett by forcing them to give up businesses that their loved ones \nworked their entire lives to build and to pass on.\n  Whether it is farming or ranching or construction, they are all \ncapital intensive, they are all labor intensive. But the cost of \npassing these enterprises on to future generations in one piece is \noften prohibitive.\n\n  Partly as a result of the death tax, about 90 percent of family \nbusinesses don't survive for a third generation.\n  Even those who manage to pass their family business on are adversely \naffected. Instead of spending money to innovate--to grow their \nbusinesses or to invest in new jobs that help our economy--they pay the \nFederal Government.\n  We have allowed time to address many pressing issues already this \nCongress. We have acted. We have done something.\n  And now it is time for us to do something about the death tax. It was \nimposed as a temporary measure during World War I. But since then it's \nmanaged to wedge its way tightly into our Tax Code.\n  Americans have waited long enough for Congress to take the death tax \nburden off their backs with a permanent solution. Today is our chance \nto act.\n  Similarly, for nearly 20 years Tennesseans waited for Congress to \nrestore State sales tax deductibility. It is one of the provisions in \nthe so-called ``tax extenders''.\n  From 1986 until 2004, hard working Tennesseans were placed at a \ndisadvantage--simply because Tennessee was one of seven States that \nchoose to raise revenue primarily through a sales tax instead of an \nincome tax.\n  Congress and President Bush acted in 2004 to restore the State sales \ntax deductibility--and to restore fairness to Federal tax policy.\n  But the provision expired last year--and more than 640,000 Tennessee \nfamilies will suffer if the tax relief isn't extended. That is \nunacceptable.\n  The State and local sales tax deduction is just 1 of more than 20 tax \npolicy extensions included in the Family Prosperity Act.\n  These extensions will keep taxes low, helping Americans find and keep \nwork. They help families tackle the increasing cost of living. And they \nstrengthen the economic security of hardworking Americans everywhere.\n  To me, that is important.\n  The final piece of the Family Prosperity Act increases the minimum \nwage. Specifically, it raises the minimum wage rate $2.10 over 36 \nmonths in three increments of 70 cents. That is a 40 percent increase \nin the minimum wage.\n  It includes a tip credit provision that protects employee wages at \ntheir current level. In the seven States where there is no tip credit, \nthis bill would allow the credit to apply only against future State \nincreases in the minimum wage.\n  It would not result in any workers' wages being lowered. Some have \nsaid otherwise, but that is simply not the case--and colleagues should \nnot be misled by opponents of this bill into believing something that \nis simply not true.\n  For young workers entering the job market for the first time--the \nminimum wage hike is welcome news. We're helping them meet the \nincreasing cost of day-to-day living.\n  As I said earlier this week, this--the Family Prosperity Act--is the \nlast chance--the last chance--the Senate will have during the 109th \nCongress to give these workers a boost.\n  There will always be new, emerging challenges to address here on the \nSenate floor. And it is our responsibility to address them--to deliver \neffective solutions in a timely manner.\n  But it is also our responsibility to address those challenges that \ncompound over time--the challenges and burdens that develop slowly and \naffect Americans with latent urgency.\n  The death tax is one of those issues. So are tax relief extenders and \nraising the minimum raise.\n  That is why we are taking up the death tax once again. That is why we \nare extending key tax relief provisions for other 2 years. And that is \nwhy we are raising the minimum wage.\n  We are not ``doing nothing.'' We are doing something--about issues \nthat concern hardworking Americans across the Nation.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I try to read the newspapers very well every \nday. I am one who reads the editorials. I read people such as E.J. \nDionne, who represents important, progressive writers. But I am a fan \nof Robert Novak. That may surprise someone, but I read Robert Novak's \ncolumn whenever it appears. It may also surprise people to know that I \nam a friend of Robert Novak. I don't agree with him much of the time, \nbut some of the time I do.\n  I want to start my presentation this morning following the suggestion \nmade by the majority leader. In papers today all over the country is \nthe column of Robert Novak. Among other things, he said--because of the \nlegislative proposals we have before us that the leader says is our \nlast chance--because of this ``Republicans cast doubt on what they \nreally believe.''\n  He goes on to say, among other things, that ``A lame-duck committee \nchairman''--we all know that is Chairman Thomas--``overpowering \nCongress connotes weak leadership in both the House and the Senate and \na President detached from legislative activity.''\n  I couldn't say it better myself. I give that to Bob Novak.\n  He goes on to say that Thomas, last week, combined them with the \nextenders bill--minimum wage and estate tax legislation.\n  He went on to say:\n\n       Arrogant, acerbic and authoritarian, the chairman was going \n     out with a bravura performance [refusing to walk across the \n     Capitol to meet with Senators].\n\n  He refused to come to the Dirksen building.\n  He said further:\n\n       Last week Senators cooled their heels for hours while \n     waiting for Thomas and other House Members to attend a \n     meeting.\n\n  And among other things, he said, ``But Grassley''--Chairman of the \nFinance Committee here in the Senate--``was undercut by Senate Majority \nLeader Bill Frist's support of the Thomas plan.''\n  As a young man I had my first trip to New York City. That is a long \nway from Searchlight. But I was there among the great big buildings. I \nwas fascinated by some people on the street. They had little containers \non a table there. They were asking people for a few cents to find out \nwhere the money was. I watched that. I watched people come up and give \nthem money. It was magic. It was a shell game. I had never seen one \nbefore. The guy in the shell game never lost. I don't know how he did \nit. He would move these things around right in front of us. And when \nyou picked it up, it wasn't there.\n  That is what we have going on here. This is a shell game with fancy \nnames such as ``Family Prosperity Act.'' Is that something similar to \nthe Clear Skies initiative that pollutes our skies? Is that something \nsimilar to Leave No Child Behind but leaves all of our children behind? \nIs that something similar to the budget deficit reduction plan which \nincreased the deficit?\n  This is a shell game. I am going to have a more complete statement \nbefore we vote on this.\n  I wish to make a couple of comments regarding my distinguished \ncolleague's assertion. He gives the name of somebody on a farm.\n  One of the sitting Senators from the State of California, with 35 \nmillion people--California feeds most of America and other parts of the \nworld. It is the agricultural capital of the world, the great Imperial \nValley and other places in California that produce wonderful fruits and \nvegetables.\n  The Farm Bureau, which supports passage of the repeal of the estate \ntax for reasons no one can understand because the California Senator \nasked the head of National Farm Bureau: During the past 10 years, give \nme the name of a farmer or farmers or ranchers who lost their farms as \na result of the estate tax. Zero, none. That is a myth.\n  I will bet every Democratic Senator thinks we should do something to \nchange the estate tax a little bit.\n  When I was in law school, the ceiling was $60,000. It is now $2.5 \nmillion--whatever it is, an escalating level, but it is a lot more than \nit was then.\n  I am terribly disappointed with the situation we have in the Senate \ntoday.\n\n[[Page S8674]]\n\nThis should have been the day we were doing our victory laps prior to \ngoing home for the August recess. We should have felt good. I felt \ngood. We were finally going to be able to do something about coastal \nerosion, to restore the coasts, especially around New Orleans. I have \nbeen worried about that. I was twice chairman of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee. We finally had an opportunity, and what do we \ndo? We should be leaving feeling good. We should feel good today about \nwhat Senators Baucus and Grassley did for us in taking care of the \npensions bill, which directly affects 45 million people and indirectly \naffects 145 million Americans. It was done. It was signed.\n  That is what Robert Novak is talking about. It was done--the pension \nbill was done. It had the extenders on it.\n\n  That is when Chairman Thomas, as indicated here, showed that he could \noutsmart the House leadership and the Senate leadership. And as \nindicated here, Grassley was undercut by Senate Majority Leader Bill \nFrist in supporting the Thomas plan.\n  It was all done. It would have taken an hour here. The extenders \nwould have been done, and the pension bill would have been completed. \nIt was done, agreed upon by the House and Senate conferees.\n  We should have been leaving today feeling so good about that. We \nshould be leaving today feeling good about having given the money to \nour beleaguered troops, which is so badly needed.\n  We learned this week that a month ago the President got a message \nfrom his generals that the war machine was worn out. They wanted $17 \nbillion--yesterday--to refurbish the fighting forces we have. Our \nvaliant soldiers are fighting, but they are doing it with equipment \nthat needs repair.\n  We learned a day later from the head of the National Guard that they \nare underfunded by $34 billion. The Nevada National Guard followed up \nby saying, as a number of our Guard around the country said--a lot of \nour equipment is still in Iraq.\n  We should have left feeling that we had completed work on the \nMilitary Construction bill and the Defense appropriations bill. But no; \nwe have been jammed into this situation that we have here today.\n  Of course, we should have felt good about these extenders that now we \nhave been threatened: We are not going to do them at all--which we know \nwe will do before we leave. We are going to do them.\n  This should not be called the ``trifecta'' bill--as it has been \nreferred to too often by my friends in the majority--but the \n``defecta'' bill.\n  The minimum wage issue is absolutely so hard to comprehend. We know--\nand Bob Novak talks about it--the Republicans hate the minimum wage. He \nis the mouth of the conservatives. He says Republicans hate the minimum \nwage. And they give us a bill so they can say ``minimum wage''--but it \nis a pay cut for people in seven States. Then it is spread out over 3 \nyears.\n  They couldn't bring themselves to do a pay increase right away.\n  The richest man in the world is named Warren Buffett. He has more \nmoney than all of the Saudi princes. He has $34 billion in the bank, \ncash money. He is opposed to repealing the estate tax.\n  Bill Gates of Microsoft--he and his father are opposed to repealing \nthe estate tax.\n  What I say about the ``defecta'' bill is let us vote on the motion to \nproceed right now--right now. Set it up and make it so each side will \nhave half an hour of debate on it. Let us vote on the motion to proceed \nright now. We don't need to wait until tomorrow morning. We are ready \nto do it right now, so that we can get to work on the Defense bill, so \nthat we can do the extenders; otherwise, we are just churning time.\n  Let us vote on it.\n  The Family Prosperity Act is for 8,100 in this country. It really is. \nThat is how many this applies to with repeal of the estate tax--8,100 \nof the richest of the rich.\n  It is time to put the charade to bed. We are ready to end this \ncircus. Let us have the cloture vote now so we can get on with the \nbusiness of the American people. The Senate has already spent far too \nmuch time on the No. 1 priority of the Republicans. The road to \n``legislative heaven'' of the Republicans is the estate tax repeal.\n  We have spent more time on this issue in this do-nothing Congress \nthan anything else--far more time than we have spent on our troops in \nIraq--on 8,100 families. Is this the legacy of the Republican majority, \nto spend all of our time on repealing the estate tax and threatening--\nthreatening--Democratic Senators, Republican Senators, and the American \npeople: Either do it with the ``defecta'' bill or we are not going to \ndo anything?\n  We need to vote.

Madam President, we have a long day ahead of us. I again \nwant to state that the Parliamentarian has submitted an opinion \nregarding the application of rule XVI to quite a few amendments. In \norder to not be discriminatory, it is my intention to raise rule XVI in \nany instance in which the Parliamentarian says it would apply, and I \nthink Senators ought to be on notice to that effect.\n  There is a whole series of amendments that are being presented today. \nI believe we will have a considerable number of votes today.\n  I wish to point out to the Senate that Senator Inouye and I have now \nreprogrammed over $4 billion from various projects and equipment \naccounts that we have already approved for the Department of Defense \nfor this fiscal year. Those requests were made to obtain more money to \ncover the costs of the military pay and allowances and the costs \nassociated with rotation of our military force in and out of Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  That means within the next few weeks there is going to be a shutdown \non many contracts throughout the United States. I say to the occupant \nof the chair, the distinguished Senator from the same State I \nrepresent, we had that happen at Fort Greely when the supplemental was \nnot approved in time, with considerable disruption to the working \npeople who were working on projects at Fort Greely. Some of them have \nbeen resumed, but the tempo that was in place could not be picked up \nbecause of the problem of financing the Department of Defense during \nthis period. So I want Members to be on notice that if this bill is not \ncompleted and signed by the President and delivered to the Secretary of \nDefense before September 30, there will be even more of these notices \nof delay, which lead to unemployment, lead to considerable increase in \ncosts.\n  There is no reason this bill should be delayed. This bill has to be \nsent to the President before the end of the fiscal year and timed, as a \nmatter of fact, so the Secretary of Defense has the authority to \nrelease the money immediately on the first of October.\n  I urge the Senate to consider the welfare of these men and women who \nrepresent us now in 120 countries throughout the world. We have men and \nwomen in uniform who depend upon this.\n  As delays occur--we know what has just happened to the Stryker \nBrigade from our State. They were ready to come back. Two days from the \ntime they were scheduled to come back, they were delayed. Their \npersonal equipment had been sent home. Their families had airline \ntickets to go meet their loved ones as they came into the depot. They \nplanned vacations and some time off with their families. Reservations \nwere made. The Department has said they are going to try to compensate \nthose people to the extent possible, but all of those are delays which \nwere caused by lack of funding.\n  Now, I think the Senate cannot be in the position of not passing this \nbill before we go home. If we do so, I can tell Members of the Senate, \nthey are going to get the kind of complaints Senator Murkowski and I \nhave gotten from the families of the Stryker Brigade. And they are \nlegitimate complaints. The problem is, there is nothing we can do about \nit.\n  I do think it is incumbent upon us to concentrate on this bill today. \nAnd again, I serve notice that rule XVI will be applied to any \namendment the Parliamentarian says violates that rule.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, is there an amendment pending at this \ntime?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Kennedy amendment is pending.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment \nbe set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4787\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 4787.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4787.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To limit the funds available to the Department of Defense for \n                   expenses relating to conferences)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. The aggregate amount available in this Act for \n     expenses of the Department of Defense relating to conferences \n     in fiscal year 2007, including expenses relating to \n     conference programs, staff, travel costs, and other \n     conference matters, may not exceed $70,000,000.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, this is a fairly straightforward \namendment. One of the things we do know is happening is that we are \nborrowing a lot of money every year from our kids and our grandkids. \nWhat we have done in my Subcommittee on Federal Financial Management is \nwe have noted that we spend, at minimum, a half a billion dollars a \nyear on conferences.\n  The Defense Department spends more on conferences than anybody. These \nconferences are sometimes very needed--which I will not object to--but \nalso many are not needed. One of the things I think we need to look at \nis, can we do it better? Can we become more efficient?\n  The chairman and ranking member on the Appropriations Defense \nSubcommittee, as well as Chairman Warner on the Defense authorization \ncommittee, understand the things we need to do to fund our military, \nsuch as the Senator just talked about: the timeliness of this bill. But \nthe fact is, the Pentagon, last year, spent $77 million on conferences.\n  Madam President, 36,000 military and civilian employees went to 6,600 \nconferences worldwide last year, at an average cost of $2,200 per \nperson. Of interest is that of those 6,600 conferences, 663 were held \nin Florida in the middle of the winter, 224 were held in Las Vegas, and \n98 in Hawaii. The cost of those conferences and the per cost of those \ntravels for individuals far exceeded the average. DOD spent more on \nconferences than the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Education, \nEnergy, Housing and Urban Development, Labor, Transportation, Treasury, \nand EPA combined.\n  The question is, Are there not some benefits? There are some benefits \nto some of these conferences. But half the conferences could have been \nconducted under what we call now digital video conferencing. So we have \nthe technology to save money. We are in a war. We are having trouble \nfunding the war. We are borrowing the money to fund that war from our \nkids. We are at $8.6 trillion debt. We have unending debts facing us in \nthe future, secondary to Medicare and Social Security. It is time we \nprioritize.\n  All this amendment does is it sets a ceiling for the Department of \nDefense. It does not tell them where they can go, who can go, or \nanything else. It just says they will not spend more than $70 million--\n$70 million. That still will be more than all those agencies combined. \nAnd all it takes is a little thoughtful planning to say: Maybe this is \none we should not go to. Maybe we should not be traveling to Florida in \nthe middle of the winter for a conference. Maybe we can do it on video \nconferencing.\n  The fact is, there are hard choices before us. Should we limit how \nmuch\n\n[[Page S8676]]\n\nmoney we spend on conferences? And can we use that money to take care \nof our troops, to upgrade a humvee, to pay for the things we are having \ntrouble paying for today?\n  I think this is a commonsense amendment. It was added to the HUD bill \nby this body. I plan on adding it to almost every appropriations bill \nthat comes through. It is something I think we ought to consider.\n  For example, for $159,000, we can up-armor an M1151. For $152,000, we \ncan up-armor an M1152. For $189,000, we can up-armor an M1152 \nambulance. There are a lot of things we can do if we limit the amount \nof money spent on travel and conferences in the Department of Defense.\n  So all this says is: Can't you do it better? Won't you do it better? \nWon't you use the technology that is available to us today? And won't \nyou put $70 million, this next year, into our troops instead of \nconferencing?\n  I have tried to work with the chairman on getting this accepted and \nheld in conference. I understand he cannot guarantee that. Therefore, I \nam going to be asking for a vote so that the Senate is on record that \nwe think we ought to be trimming some of the other expenses so we can \nput the money where our troops need it.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I wish to speak on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At this moment, there is not a sufficient \nsecond.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, the Senator's amendment is very \ndifficult to vote against, except that it applies to all members of the \nDepartment of Defense, civilian and military. About 1 percent of the \npeople in the Department of Defense, civilian and military, go to a \nconference each year. I personally know that when we travel abroad, we \nask for members of the Department of Defense from Germany and from \nItaly to come meet with us in France. We have conferences with them \nconcerning NATO. We did the same thing recently in terms of the Middle \nEast. We had people come from three different countries to meet with us \nwhen we were in Kuwait. That involved probably 14 people traveling in \neach instance to come see us. It is essential that we have conferences \nand not have to depend upon video conferences to deal with issues. That \napplies throughout the Department of Defense.\n  The Senator is correct. We offered to take it to conference, and in \nconference we might be able to find a reasonable figure that would be a \nlimitation. Seventy million is not a reasonable limitation. There is no \nreason for us to try to be unreasonable with the Department of Defense. \nWe are the last superpower in the world. People depend upon us, and we \ngo visit the places, 120 different countries, where we have military \npeople in uniform. It costs money. The cost of traveling is going up \nall the time.\n  I did offer to take the amendment to conference and try to work out \nwith the House a reasonable limitation. The Senator is unwilling do \nthat.\n  Therefore, I move to table the Senator's amendment and ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment may \nbe temporarily set aside so the Senator may offer another amendment. We \nare trying to determine the availability of membership to be present \nfor a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4784\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, in concurrence with the other amendment \nbeing set aside, I ask that amendment No. 4784 be considered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn], for himself and Mr. \n     Obama, proposes an amendment numbered 4784.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require the posting of certain reports of the Department \n    of Defense on the Internet website of the Department of Defense)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. (a) Posting of Certain Reports on Department of \n     Defense Internet Website.--Each report described in \n     subsection (b) shall be posted on the Internet website of the \n     Department of Defense for the public not later than 48 hours \n     after the submittal of such report to Congress.\n       (b) Covered Reports.--The reports described in this \n     subsection are the reports as follows:\n       (1) Each report required by a provision of this Act to be \n     submitted by the Department of Defense to the Committees on \n     Appropriations of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives.\n       (2) Any report required to be submitted by the Department \n     of Defense to Congress in support of the budget of the \n     President for fiscal year 2008 (as submitted to Congress \n     pursuant to section 1105 of title 31, United States Code) for \n     the Department of Defense, including any budget justification \n     documents in support of such budget for the Department of \n     Defense.\n       (c) Redaction of Certain Information.--In posting a report \n     on the Internet website of the Department under subsection \n     (a), the Secretary of Defense may redact any information \n     whose release to the public would, as determined by the \n     Secretary, compromise the national security of the United \n     States.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. This amendment is all about common sense, about saving \nmoney.\n  I do wish to make a couple of corrections with regard to the last \namendment. The expenses related to the military meeting with Members of \nCongress are not in the $79 million that was spent last year. It is not \nincluded in that figure. This is domestic conferencing. It doesn't have \nanything to do with international travel. The fact is, we have to do \nbetter when it comes to the things we can control in terms of variable \nexpenses.\n  In the Defense appropriations bill, 20 reports are required by the \nDefense Department. Many of those are needed. What this amendment does \nis require public disclosure of all reports delivered to the \nAppropriations Committee. I am willing to amend that to apply to the \nauthorization committee as well, if the chairman would so desire, \nincluding the justification of the presence of annual budget requests \nby the Department of Defense, unless those reports contain information \nthat would comprise national security. Anything that would comprise \nnational security is exempted from the amendment. But if they are \nreporting to the Appropriations Committee or the authorization \ncommittee, then they ought to be reporting to the American public. The \nAmerican public ought to see what those reports say, provided there is \nno risk to national security within them.\n  DOD provides the Appropriations Committee with annual justifications \nfor the administration's budget proposals, which OMB has agreed to put \nonline next year, with the same exception regarding the compromise of \nnational security. The reason this issue came up is that this year with \nthe President's budget request, only members of the Appropriations \nCommittee could see the justifications. Other Members of the Senate \ncould not see the justifications, the reasoning behind the requests. \nEven though we are going to be required to vote on them, we could never \nsee the President's reasoning for why he was asking for what he was \nasking for. So that is going to be changed at OMB next year. They have \ncommitted to do that. Those justifications will be made public.\n  But of the reports this committee is going to ask of the Congress, if \nthey don't compromise national security--Senator Obama and I are \noffering this amendment--they ought to be placed online. The Defense \nDepartment has the capability of doing that. The rest of America ought \nto see what the justifications are. Sunshine is the best thing we have \nto hold us accountable\n\n[[Page S8677]]\n\nto do what is in the best interest of our country. Not only should the \nAmerican public know it, the media should have availability to it so \nthat information can be spread.\n  Every Department annually provides budget justifications to the \nAppropriations Committee. That is not in question. The question is, Do \nthey provide justifications to the American public? That is the \nquestion. That is a question the American public is asking now.\n  We are going to spend, as Senator Gregg said yesterday, $553 billion \non defense this year, including the war, upgrading defense, and there \nis no question, as the chairman said, we are the lone superpower. There \nis great responsibility that comes with that. But in fact, as the \nSecretary of Defense said on September 10, 2001, every penny counts. It \nought to be tracked, checked, and open for scrutiny.\n  This amendment says that a communication to Congress, if in fact it \nputs no risk, no security-sensitive information out there, the American \npublic ought to see it. The only reason, a logical person could assume, \nother than a national security issue, that we would not want the \nAmerican public to see these reports is that we have something we don't \nwant them to know. I believe collectively the American public is as \nwise or wiser than the collection of their representatives in \nWashington. Their judgment is important in what we do and how we do it. \nIf we truly have a government of the people, by the people, and for the \npeople, then routine operations of the Government must no longer be \nconcealed or hidden from the people of this country. What this \namendment does is assure greater transparency and accountability of \ntaxpayer funds. It lets the American people know what we are doing, why \nwe are doing it, and how.\n  This amendment is endorsed by over 50 organizations. Here is what \nthey say:\n\n       As advocates from diverse political perspectives, both on \n     the far right and far left and in the middle, we concur that \n     government transparency is vital to the health of our \n     political system. Regardless of our views on the appropriate \n     role of the federal government, we believe government policy \n     must disclose its spending decisions and the rationale behind \n     them. Such disclosure will help encourage a more active, \n     engaged citizenry and a more effective and efficient \n     government.\n\n  American taxpayers should not be kept in the dark about any decision, \nunless it is for national security, and yet there are obstacles for \nthis information at every turn. It is important, with the revelations \nof what has happened in Defense contracting, that the American public \nhave their confidence reestablished that what we are doing is correct, \nright, and straightforward.\n\n  This is straightforward. We have from the committee the list of \nreports that are directed to be prepared: Reserve component budget \nstructure, legal assistance, personnel reductions, National Guard \nprocurement, alternative diesel fuel, MTF efficiency wedge, impact of \nnursing shortage on military health care delivery system, postdoctoral \neducation, alcoholism research, Commander's Emergency Response Program, \nto name a few. Where it does not compromise national security, the \nAmerican public ought to know it. This says that if they have it, the \nDepartment of Defense puts it on the Web site with the proviso that \nanything that is of national security be extracted or withheld. It is a \nreasonable amendment. It ought to be there. The Senate ought to vote on \nit to say that they want sunshine, that they want the American people \nto know what they are going to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, this amendment violates rule XVI in \nterms of the second portion of the amendment, part (b)(2), page 2. If \nit applied just to the reports delivered to the Appropriations \nCommittee, it would not, in my opinion. I have already said I am going \nto raise rule XVI on any amendment that is determined by the \nParliamentarian to apply to a particular amendment.\n  In regard to the basic concept, we have no problem with having all of \nthe items that are submitted to the Appropriations Committee put on the \nWeb. Almost all of them are anyway. But there are some reports that are \nsubmitted to Congress pursuant to section 1105, as I understand it, \nwhich are documents that go to other committees and are for other \npurposes. I don't know what their policies are with regard to \ndisclosure.\n  All of the items that come to us are on the Web, and we welcome them \nbeing on the Web. We don't have any problem with every report required \nby the provisions of this act, submitted pursuant to this act, or, as a \nmatter of fact, in terms of existing law, but I do think we should not \nhave a violation of rule XVI. Therefore, I ask the Senator if he is \nwilling to limit paragraph (2) to any report required by the Department \nof Defense to be submitted to the Appropriations Committee in support \nof the budget of the President which does not violate rule XVI? The \nSenator said that is what it is about, but it goes further. It applies \nto any report going to any committee or to the Congress itself with \nregard to this budget. There are other justifications submitted to \nother committees. What their policies are, I don't know.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, we spent some time last evening with the \nParliamentarian on it. We believe we have a defense of germaneness \nbased on what the content of the House bill is and that we would stand \nby the idea that this is already relating to and attached to \nrequirements from the House bill. We do not believe it violates rule \nXVI. I ask for a ruling from the chair.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I raise a point of order under rule XVI \nthat this amendment violates rule XVI. What is the ruling of the Chair?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are two issues raised here. One is \nwhether the amendment violates rule XVI and the other one is whether \nthere is an appropriate defense of germaneness. The answer to both \nquestions is in the affirmative.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I raise rule XVI. If the Senator wants to raise the \npoint of germaneness, he may do so.\n  Mr. COBURN. I raise the point of germaneness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is submitted to the Senate.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will ask that the vote be postponed until we agree on \na series of votes today.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on that question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote will be set.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I may \nspeak up to 7 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. What is the amount of time?\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Up to 7 minutes. I probably will not need that much \ntime.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator has the floor. I will not object now, but we \nare trying to get the votes put together so we can start at 11 o'clock \nfor the convenience of the Senate because committee meetings are going \nto take place. I will not object now. To any further interruption, I \nwill object.\n\n\n           Estate Tax and Extension of Tax Relief Act of 2006\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Madam President, I want to speak about unfounded \nconcerns raised about the minimum wage increase proposal of the Estate \nTax and Extension of Tax Relief Act of 2006.\n  I have long supported an increase in the minimum wage in order to \nhelp raise the living standards of America's hard-working families. I \nvoted for Senator Kennedy's amendment on a number of occasions. I voted \nfor a minimum wage increase with or without a tip credit. It has been 9 \nyears since we last increased the minimum wage. Many States--mine \nincluded--have raised their minimum wage higher than the Federal level.\n  The tax bill we will take up tomorrow increases the minimum wage. The \nbill would also provide for a tip credit in those States--again, like \nmy own--that don't currently allow for a tip credit. Again, I have \nsupported a minimum wage increase with and without a tip credit. We \nhave an opportunity to increase the minimum wage, and there is a tip \ncredit provision in there.\n  I find it regrettable that some of my Democratic colleagues are now \narguing that the tip credit provision would actually lead to a \nreduction in the minimum wage for those workers in nontip\n\n[[Page S8678]]\n\ncredit States. It is interesting that these colleagues of mine make \nthis argument at a time when we are close to providing an increase in \nthe minimum wage. Not once have these colleagues of mine made such \nclaims when the Senate considered this very same proposal on several \noccasions in the recent past.\n  Contrary to what some are saying, the fact is that the tip credit \nwould only apply to future increases in the minimum wage. I will repeat \nthat. The tip credit would only apply to future increases in the \nminimum wage--not to the current minimum wage.\n  The charge that the tip credit provision would result in the minimum \nwage for tipped workers going down is absolutely false.\n  If you read closely the proposal's language, it says a worker cannot \nbe paid less than ``the cash wage paid such employee which is required \nunder such law, ordinance, regulation, or order on the date of \nenactment. . . .'' That is how the bill reads.\n  It also appears that the critics of this provision have not taken \ninto consideration section 218 of the Fair Labor Standards Act, which \nprohibits employers from paying less than the current minimum wage.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nthe Assistant Secretary for Employment Standards, U.S. Department of \nLabor, Victoria Lipnic.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   August 2, 2006.\n     Hon. Bill Frist, M.D.,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Leader Frist: You have asked for the views of the \n     Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division (WHD) regarding \n     Section 402 of the Estate Tax and Extension of Tax Relief Act \n     of 2006 (the Act). If Section 402 of the Act (``Tipped Wage \n     Fairness'') were passed into law, WHD would read Section 402 \n     as protecting the current minimum wages of the tipped \n     employees in the seven states that now exclude a tipped \n     employee's tips from being considered as wages because to do \n     otherwise would be inconsistent with what we understand to be \n     the intent of Congress and the Fair Labor Standards Act, \n     which WHD enforces.\n       Nevertheless, we are aware that some have argued that \n     Section 402 is ambiguous. We would be pleased to work with \n     the Congress to clarify that the intent of Congress is to \n     protect the current minimum wages of tipped employees. Please \n     contact me if the Department can be of further assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Victoria A. Lipnic.\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. This letter says that absolutely the Fair Labor \nStandards Act prohibits employers from paying less than the current \nminimum wage. That is to be taken into consideration in terms of what \nthe Senate is doing with the minimum wage tip credit provision.\n  The letter from the Department of Labor is very clear. If my \ncolleagues have any question, this is now part of the Record; I have \nasked that it be printed in the Record. It lays it out very clearly.\n  Again, the letter states that if the tip credit becomes law, the \nLabor Department reads it ``as protecting the current minimum wages of \nthe tipped employees in the seven States that now exclude a tipped \nemployee's tips from being considered as wages because to do otherwise \nwould be inconsistent with what we understand to be the intent of \nCongress and the Fair Labor Standards Act.''\n  In my State, the minimum wage is $6.15. Our employee wages are not \ngoing to be decreased if this tip provision comes in. If there is an \nincrease above that, then of that amount of the increase, you could use \ntip credits to compensate for that, with no decrease in the minimum \nwage.\n  This is nothing more than an effort by my colleagues on the other \nside to steal defeat from the jaws of victory as we move to the \nopportunity to pass an increase in the Federal minimum wage. Let's not \nmiss that opportunity. Let's support this bill and get this done on \nFriday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, regarding amendment No. 4784, I ask \nunanimous consent that on page 2, section 2 be deleted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4784), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. (a) Posting of Certain Reports on Department of \n     Defense Internet Website.--Each report described in \n     subsection (b) shall be posted on the Internet website of the \n     Department of Defense for the public not later than 48 hours \n     after the submittal of such report to Congress.\n       (b) Covered Reports.--The reports described in this \n     subsection are the reports as follows:\n       (1) Each report required by a provision of this Act to be \n     submitted by the Department of Defense to the Committees on \n     Appropriations of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives.\n       (c) Redaction of Certain Information.--In posting a report \n     on the Internet website of the Department under subsection \n     (a), the Secretary of Defense may redact any information \n     whose release to the public would, as determined by the \n     Secretary, compromise the national security of the United \n     States.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to withdraw \nthe point of order under rule XVI and that the vote on the issue of \ngermaneness be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. It is my understanding that the Senator from Oklahoma \nwants a vote on that amendment. Is that correct?\n  Mr. COBURN. That's correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We are prepared to accept it, but if the Senator wishes \na vote, he is entitled to it.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, we expect the Senator from Oklahoma to \nraise two additional amendments. It is our hope that we can ask \nunanimous consent in a short time that a series of votes on the Coburn \namendments start around 11 o'clock.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4785\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside, and I call up amendment No. 4785.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4785.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To ensure the fiscal integrity of travel payments made by the \n                         Department of Defense)\n\n       On page 218, between lines 6 and 7, insert the following:\n       Sec. 8109. Not later than 90 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit \n     to the congressional defense committees and the Committee on \n     Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate and \n     the Committee on Government Reform of the House of \n     Representatives a report--\n       (1) describing risk assessments performed by the Department \n     of Defense on payments made by the Department for travel, as \n     required under section 2 of the Improper Payments Information \n     Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-300; 31 U.S.C. 3321 note);\n       (2) including an estimate, using statistically valid \n     methods, of improper payments for travel that have been \n     processed by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service \n     (DFAS); and\n       (3) including an explanation that the methods used to \n     perform risk assessments are statistically valid in \n     accordance with Office of Management and Budget Memorandum \n     30-13 issued pursuant to the Improper Payments Information \n     Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-300; 31 U.S.C. 3321 note).\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, this is a straightforward amendment. \nEverybody knows we are having problems in the Department of Defense in \nterms of management and accounting and control. There is a law called \nthe Improper Payments Act. Quite frankly, the law is not being followed \nby the Department of Defense.\n  This amendment is very narrow in its focus. What it does is directs \nthe DOD to improve the methodology for estimating improper payments \nrelated to travel and to provide risk assessments that determine \nwhether travel payments at DOD are at a significant risk of making \nimproper payments.\n\n[[Page S8679]]\n\n  We know of a minimum of $30 million in airline tickets that were not \nused, but we didn't get our money back for last year. We know of \nanother $30 million that was at least bought inappropriately, and this \nis done outside of the Defense Department, not within. The Defense \nDepartment is not assessing that. All this amendment does is say you \nought to figure out and look at what you are making improper payments \nfor.\n  What we do know, from our subcommittee hearings, is that there is in \nthe neighborhood of $20 billion to $30 billion of improper payments \nmade by the Defense Department every year on a $553 billion budget. \nThose problems cannot be solved overnight. We are working hard. As a \nmatter of fact, we are having a hearing today on the management \ntechniques and information systems that the DOD is using. They are \nstarting to make the corrections to be better stewards of our money.\n  This is a simple amendment that says they ought to follow the \nImproper Payments Act for this one segment, for the purpose of finding \nand eliminating payments that should not have been made, or were made \nfor incorrect amounts by the Defense Department. We have had three \nhearings in our subcommittee on improper payments. The minimum in this \nGovernment, including Medicare, Medicaid, and Defense, is around $100 \nbillion a year in wrong payments made by the Federal Government. There \nis over $30 billion in Medicaid and $36 billion in Medicare. This large \nquantity in the Defense Department--plus many of the other agencies--is \nnot even being reported or looked at. There is $1.6 billion in food \nstamps. I could go on and on.\n  The fact is, when we are running a deficit such as we are and we are \nborrowing the money from our grandkids, we ought to do every small \nthing we can to improve the stewardship of that money. The DOD is \nreporting improper payment information for only three programs--the \nmilitary retirement fund, military health benefits and, for the first \ntime this year, military pay.\n  There are significant other improper payments within the Pentagon. We \nknow it and we are going after it and we are going to try to solve it. \nThe Improper Payments Act doesn't exempt this agency from its \nrequirements. No agency is exempt. What it says is: Perform a risk \nassessment, develop a statistically valid assessment of improper \npayments, develop corrective action, and report the results. If you are \nnot doing any of that, you are not going to know what we are wasting, \nand you are not going to be able to develop a plan or figure out how to \ncorrect the problem.\n  So all this amendment does is take one small area of it and say do \nthe improper payments on it. It is one area where they can do it fairly \nsimply and they can accomplish it. It is asking them to do it. It \nrequires them to provide the congressional defense committees and the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee the risk assessments for fiscal year \n2005 that determine whether travel payments at DOD are at a significant \nrisk of making improper payments. We already know that because that is \nwhat the Defense Travel System debate is all about. It requires DOD to \nuse a statistically valid estimate for determining whether travel \npayments are at risk or making significant improper payments. Finally, \nit requires DOD to provide a justification for the methodology and \nmaking sure it is statistically valid and accurate, representing the \nfull universe of travel payments by DOD. This isn't a small amount of \nmoney. They spend a ton on travel, and they ought to spend it wisely. \nThey shouldn't waste a penny because anything we are wasting can't be \nused in a way to support our troops and do what we need to do.\n  We have cleared this with the Parliamentarian in terms of it being \ngermane, and we hope the Senate will concur with this amendment.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I think we should welcome the devotion \nof the Senator from Oklahoma to be concerned about the Improper \nPayments Act, and if the Senator's amendment applied to any payments \nmade pursuant to this act, I certainly would have no objection. We are \nprepared to accept it.\n  This covers a great deal more than that, though, those made under \nexisting law and those made to, as I understand it, in the areas of \nhomeland security and Government affairs. I wish the Senator would say \nthat this covers--to be clear under rule XVI--payments made out of any \nfunds provided by this act. If he did that, I am prepared to accept it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, let me describe the recent assessment by \nthe Department of Defense: For payments made within the Department of \nDefense for travel--for travel--as required under section 2 of the \nImproper Payments Information Act.\n  Mr. STEVENS. From the funds provided in this act? There are funds \nprovided in other acts. For instance, the funds provided to the Defense \nIntelligence Agency come from the funds that are provided through the \nNational Intelligence Director's Office, but they come to DIA. But we \nare very specific about it. If the payments are made pursuant to this \nact, we agree with it.\n  Mr. COBURN. That is what this says.\n  Mr. STEVENS. No, no, it does not. It says: All payments made by the \nDepartment----\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the chairman yield for a question?\n  Mr. STEVENS. It says performed by the Department on payments made for \ntravel.\n  Mr. COBURN. Would the chairman yield for a question?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  Mr. COBURN. Is there a reason, even if the money was spent from NSA \nor Defense Intelligence, that you wouldn't want an improper payments \nevaluation for that money?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I don't have any problems with this--this Senator \ndoesn't have any problem with complying with the Improper Payments \nInformation Act. I have to tell you, I am not informed about that act \nin detail, but I know there are payments made through DIA and through \nNSA and through other agencies and that if they remain, there would \nhave to be a disclaimer in here about classification and other things. \nBut if you just say it is from the Department under this act, I don't \nthink you have that problem. And this act is a 1-year bill, it is not--\nin truth, this should be applied to the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill, and then they could have a bill that would \nauthorize for more than 1 year. By definition, this bill is a 1-year \nbill.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, if the chairman would yield, I did apply \nthis to the Defense authorization bill and it is in conference--it is \ngoing to conference, and the chairman of that committee accepted it.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I can understand why he would. I don't understand why \nthe Senator wants it on this bill, too, because it has a problem on \nthis bill that it doesn't have on the authorization bill.\n  Mr. COBURN. I would be happy to add an amendment or a caveat that \nsays ``under this act.'' Would that satisfy the chairman?\n  Mr. STEVENS. If you do that, I would not raise a point of order under \nrule XVI.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4785, as Modified\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I submit an amendment to this amendment \nand ask for its immediate consideration. Do I have the right to ask to \nmodify the Senator's amendment in that regard?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It would take unanimous consent.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to modify the \nSenator's amendment with the amendment that is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4785), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 218, between lines 6 and 7, insert the following:\n       Sec. 8109. Not later than 90 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall, with \n     regard to payments made with Funds provided by this\n\n[[Page S8680]]\n\n     Act, submit to the congressional defense committees and the \n     Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of \n     the Senate and the Committee on Government Reform of the \n     House of Representatives a report--\n       (1) describing risk assessments performed by the Department \n     of Defense on payments made by the Department for travel, as \n     required under section 2 of the Improper Payments Information \n     Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-300; 31 U.S.C. 3321 note);\n       (2) including an estimate, using statistically valid \n     methods, of improper payments for travel that have been \n     processed by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service \n     (DFAS); and\n       (3) including an explanation that the methods used to \n     perform risk assessments are statistically valid in \n     accordance with Office of Management and Budget Memorandum \n     30-13 issued pursuant to the Improper Payments Information \n     Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-300; 31 U.S.C. 3321 note).\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Does the Senator wish to have a vote on this amendment?\n  Mr. COBURN. I do.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We are prepared to accept it. Does the Senator still \nwish a recorded vote?\n  Mr. COBURN. I do.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4848\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask that the pending amendment be set \naside, and I call up amendment No. 4848.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4848.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require notice to Congress and the public on earmarks of \n             funds available to the Department of Defense)\n\n       At the end of title VIII, add the following:\n       Sec. 8109. (a) Reports to Congress and Notice to Public on \n     Earmarks in Funds Available to the Department of Defense.--\n     The Secretary of Defense shall submit to Congress, and post \n     on the Internet website of the Department of Defense \n     available to the public, information as follows:\n       (1) A description of each earmark of funds made available \n     to the Department of Defense by this Act, including the \n     location (by city, State, country, and congressional district \n     if relevant) in which the earmarked funds are to be utilized, \n     the purpose of such earmark (if known), and the recipient of \n     such earmark.\n       (2) The total cost of administering each such earmark \n     including the amount of such earmark, staff time, \n     administrative expenses, and other costs.\n       (3) The total cost of administering all such earmarks.\n       (4) An assessment of the utility of each such earmark in \n     meeting the goals of the Department, set forth using a rating \n     system as follows:\n       (A) A for an earmark that directly advances the primary \n     goals of the Department or an agency, element, or component \n     of the Department.\n       (B) B for an earmark that advances many of the primary \n     goals of the Department or an agency, element, or component \n     of the Department.\n       (C) C for an earmark that may advance some of the primary \n     goals of the Department or an agency, element, or component \n     of the Department.\n       (D) D for an earmark that cannot be demonstrated as being \n     cost-effective in advancing the primary goals of the \n     Department or any agency, element, or component of the \n     Department.\n       (E) F for an earmark that distracts from or otherwise \n     impedes that capacity of the Department to meet the primary \n     goals of the Department.\n       (b) Earmark Defined.--In this section, the term ``earmark'' \n     means a provision of law, or a directive contained within a \n     joint explanatory statement or report accompanying a \n     conference report or bill (as applicable), that specifies the \n     identity of an entity, program, project, or service, \n     including a defense system, to receive assistance not \n     requested by the President and the amount of the assistance \n     to be so received.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, this is an amendment which we know is \nneeded. We have seen it through the conviction of a Member of Congress.\n  What this does is require an analysis of the total cost of earmarks \nand the effectiveness of each in meeting the goals of the Department of \nDefense. Earmarks are consuming a growing proportion of the Defense \nfunding. The number of earmarks in the appropriation laws has grown \nfrom 587 in the Department of Defense in 1994 to 2,847 in 2006. The \namount of money earmarked has increased over the same period from $4.2 \nbillion to $9.4 billion. The amount earmarked as a percentage of the \ntotal Defense budget has risen to 2.4 percent in 2006.\n  It is my belief that earmarks are siphoning away funds from other \nnational security priorities. Last year, the White House Office of \nManagement and Budget wrote to the House Appropriations Committee \nwarning that the hundreds of millions of dollars set aside for \ncongressional pork projects would be slashed from a Pentagon program \ndesigned to fill some military desk jobs with civilians and would \nthereby limit one of the Defense Department's most productive \ninitiatives for reducing the strain on our Armed Forces and free up \ncritically needed troops for the global war on terror. OMB's letter \nsaid the committee's additions to the Navy's shipbuilding program and \nbudget, and numerous other smaller funding increases, preempts the \nDepartment's ability to invest cost-effectively in 21st century \ncapabilities and that the administration is concerned that these \nreductions could damage the readiness of the U.S. forces and their \npreparedness.\n  Earmarks or projects directed by Members could be used to offset much \nof the cost of the emergency supplemental bills that have been used to \nfinance the various front lines in the war against terrorism. The \nemergency supplemental bill passed by Congress and signed by the \nPresident this last month provided $65.8 billion to support Operation \nIraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. The total amount spent on \nearmarks in Defense appropriations spent over the past 3 years was $27 \nbillion--about 47 percent of the amount needed to pay for the continued \nmilitary operations in these battlefronts in the war against terrorism. \nWhat we have done instead is relied on emergency spending, which is not \noffset; it is directly added to the debt of our kids, undermining their \nfuture standard of living.\n  All this amendment does is say: Let's do an analysis. Let's see if \nthe things that are being earmarked by individual Members of Congress \nactually support the defense of the country versus the defense of some \nspecial interest back home.\n  Interestingly, the chairman objected to Senator Durbin's amendment to \ndo brain trauma research at the University of Chicago, and rightly so. \nWe have had 1,700 brain-injured troops from traumatic brain injuries. \nThere is research going on across this country on traumatic brain \ninjury. The reason is that we have 1,700 a year from 4-wheelers and \nanother 1,700 from motorcycles. So the point is, do we put the money in \nour troops or do we put the money in investing in projects back home \nthat make us look good but aren't a priority with the troops?\n  Let's talk about this supplemental which we just passed this past \nyear: $80 billion. Ten million dollars went to expand wastewater \nfacilities in Pennsylvania. The University of Texas Southwestern \nMedical Center got $3 million; Dosoto County, MS, got $35 million; the \nFire Sciences Academy in Elk, NV, got $4 million.\n  We know the problems with earmarking in terms of the recent \ncongressional corruption and ethics probes. What this amendment does is \nadds transparency and accountability to the earmark process. If it is \ngood, then the Defense Department study will say: Yes, it is something \nwe should have done. If it will waste, then we will say: It is wasted. \nThe fact is we are loading to the tune of billions of dollars a year \nprojects Members of Congress want but the Defense Department doesn't \nwant that interfere with their mission rather than help their mission.\n  An analysis of the usefulness of each earmark in advancing the goals \nof the Department of Defense is the purpose of this amendment. This \nwill provide Members of Congress a more complete view of the cost-\neffectiveness of the earmarks and whether they continue to warrant \nadditional funding.\n  The annual earmark report will ensure that policymakers and the \npublic are fully aware of the impact of unnecessary earmarks on the \nbudget of the Department of Defense and siphon\n\n[[Page S8681]]\n\naway from military preparedness and our national defense. The grading \nsystem will likewise provide needed information to the appropriators \nabout projects that are inserted in the bills that have not had proper \noversight, debate, or discussion. This added transparency will ensure \nthat every Member of Congress can cast a truly informed vote and ensure \ngreater accountability for how Federal funds are allocated and spent.\n  This is at the heart of the confidence of the American people with \nCongress. Do we earmark something because it is the best thing for the \ncountry to do, is it the best long-term choice, or do we earmark \nsomething because it helps us individually?\n  I would say there isn't one State in this country that can be healthy \nif this country isn't healthy. There can't be one community that can \nend up healthy if the country isn't healthy economically. None of us \ncan be free unless we are all free. So the idea is not to eliminate \nearmarks; it is just saying after they have happened, then let's look \nat them and see if they really accomplished something worthwhile for \nthe defense of this country and should we have spent the money in doing \nthat.\n  There are multiple examples I can put into the Record, and I will \nsubmit to the Record with unanimous consent a list of the ongoing \nprobes that are there in terms of earmarks and the Defense Department. \nBut I think it is incumbent upon us to reestablish the confidence of \nthe American public that when we earmark, what we are doing is \naccurate, it is needed, and it is something that will, in fact, inure \nto the defense of this country and the defense of our children's \nfinancial health.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nimmediately proceed to a series of votes in relation to the following \namendments: Coburn amendment No. 4787 for conferences, Coburn amendment \nNo. 4784, as modified, for posting of reports, and Coburn amendment No. \n4785, as modified, for improper payments.\n  The Senator has a pending amendment. That would not be included. It \nis because of the timeframe associated with meetings that are scheduled \ntoday that the leadership has asked that we proceed to the votes on \nthese three amendments. I further ask that no amendments be in order to \nthe amendments prior to the votes and that all votes be limited to 10 \nminutes each and there be 2 minutes equally divided on the votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. All the votes have the yeas and nays, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The first vote is on the motion to table \namendment No. 4787. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, 2 minutes before each vote. Senator \nCoburn and I each have 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes equally divided.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this is a real straightforward amendment. \nThe Defense Department spends more on conferences than all the other \nprograms combined. It has grown significantly in the last 5 years. \nEvery dollar that is spent on a conference in Las Vegas, the Presiding \nOfficer's home, or in Hawaii or south Florida is a dollar that doesn't \ngo to our troops. We are not saying eliminate the needed conferences. \nWe are saying do some sacrifice when it comes to conferences so we have \nmoney to fund our troops appropriately. Be wise, use digital video \nconferencing where you can, and make some sacrifice within the ease of \ntravel and conference fun and fair for our troops.\n  It is $70 million a year. Less than 5 years ago it was $58 million. \nCan we not, can we not spend less on conferences, do it a different \nway, and still accomplish what we need for the troops?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The committee has already cut $85 million from travel \nfunds for the Department. This would say that for programs related to \nstaff and travel costs and conference programs or other conference \nmatters, the total amount available to the whole Department--over a \nmillion people in over 120 countries in the world--will be limited to \n$70 million. We are unable to run the Department at $70 million a year. \nSo I proposed and made a motion to table the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The \nyeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senator was necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Kentucky (Mr. Bunning).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. \nBunning) would have voted ``no.''\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Montana (Mr. Baucus), \nthe Senator from New York (Mrs. Clinton), and the Senator from \nConnecticut (Mr. Lieberman) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from New \nYork (Mrs. Clinton) would vote ``nay.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 36, nays 60, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 223 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--36\n\n     Akaka\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bond\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Dayton\n     Dole\n     Durbin\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Kennedy\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Roberts\n     Sarbanes\n     Shelby\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Vitter\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--60\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bayh\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brownback\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Conrad\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Harkin\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johnson\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     McCain\n     Menendez\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Santorum\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Voinovich\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--4\n\n     Baucus\n     Bunning\n     Clinton\n     Lieberman\n\n  The motion was rejected.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4787) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, there are two more amendments. These are \n10-minute votes, at the request of the leadership. I hope we can keep \nto that time. We are ready to take all three amendments to conference.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4787\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Coburn amendment No. 4787 is the next \namendment. There is 2 minutes equally divided.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, all this amendment says is that with the \nexception of anything related to national security, whatever they \nreport ought to be made available to the American public. It is real \nsimple. They have the Web site capability. If they report it, and it \ndoesn't have anything to do with national security in terms of \nprotecting our security, they ought to report it to the rest of the \nMembers of Congress as well as to the rest of the American public.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we are ready to take the amendment to \nconference on a voice vote. Is the Senator willing to accept a voice \nvote?\n\n[[Page S8682]]\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I will accept a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4787) was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4785, as modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes of debate equally divided \non Coburn amendment No. 4785, as modified.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, again, if the Senator will yield, we are \nwilling to take this amendment to conference and accept it on a voice \nvote. Is the Senator willing to accept a voice vote?\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, the only problem with that is I think the \nSenate ought to have a rollcall vote on whether improper payments which \nhave been made by the Department of Defense ought to be held in \nconference. I would like to have a recorded vote to empower the \nchairman of the committee to hold this in conference.\n  All this says is, let's look at improper payments of the Department \nof Defense. They make more improper payments than anywhere in the \nGovernment. They only look at three areas out of all the areas. The law \nsays they should report improper payments. That is all I am asking for. \nLet's make them report the improper payments under the Improper \nPayments Act of 2002 which says they should.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Improper Payments Act is not within \nthe jurisdiction of our committee. We agreed that it should be \nreported. I believe the committee of jurisdiction ought to have \nhearings to determine whether there is improper compliance. We are \npleased to accept it. If a rollcall vote is required, let us go ahead.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Montana (Mr. Baucus) and \nthe Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Lieberman) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I rise to discuss my absence today during \nrollcall vote No. 224. The vote was in reference to Senate amendment \nNo. 4785, offered by my colleague, Senator Coburn. Senator Coburn's \namendment, which sought to ensure fiscal integrity of travel payments \nmade by the Department of Defense, passed the Senate by a vote of 96 to \n0.\n  During the vote, I was serving as chairman of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, chairing a very important hearing on Iraq, \nAfghanistan, and the global war on terrorism. Witnesses at the hearing \nincluded Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld; Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, General Peter Pace; and General John Abizaid, \nCommander, United States Central Command. My vote would not have \naffected the outcome of this amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n          Amendments Nos. 4755, 4808, 4847, and 4828, en bloc\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have a managers' package: amendment 4755, for Senator \nSantorum, regarding maritime inspection; amendment 4808, for Senator \nBill Nelson, regarding UAV virtual training; amendment 4847, for \nSenator Reed of Rhode Island, regarding recoil mitigation; amendment \n4828, for Senator Chambliss, regarding linguists.\n  I send this package to the desk. I ask unanimous consent it be \nconsidered en bloc, agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments were agreed to, as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 4755\n\n   (Purpose: To make available from Research, Development, Test and \n Evaluation, Navy, up to $2,500,000 for Navy research and development \n activities on the Wireless Maritime Inspection System as part of the \n                Smartship Wireless Project of the Navy)\n\n       At the end of title VIII, add the following:\n       Sec. 8109. Of the amount appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by title IV under the heading ``Research, \n     Development, Test and Evaluation, Navy'', up to $2,500,000 \n     may be available for the Wireless Maritime Inspection System \n     as part of the Smartship Wireless Project of the Navy.\n\n\n                          amendement no. 4808\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n       Sec.   .

We are continuing to work on the agreements. I hope \nMembers come forward to help work them out. We still have the \nopportunity to finish this bill before we leave this week. There are \nsome 34 amendments still pending we are working on. I do believe a lot \nof them can be worked out, as these last four were.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4827\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Senator Bond and I have amendment No. 4827. \nI ask consent the pending amendment be set aside and it be in order to \ncall up that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I will be brief on amendment No. 4827. This is an \namendment that the distinguished senior Senator from Missouri and I \nfiled yesterday. It guarantees that $2.4 billion of the $13 billion \nincluded in the managers' package on Tuesday for the Army and Marine \nCorps be allocated for National Guard equipment. It does not add any \nmoney. It ensures that the promises that have already been made to the \nGuard about funding will be fulfilled and, also, of course, make sure \nwe have a much needed infusion of equipment to the National Guard.\n  It follows an amendment that Senator Bond and I introduced last \nSeptember to the Fiscal Year 2006 Defense\n\n[[Page S8683]]\n\nAppropriations, in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. We \nrealized, with the significant shortfalls in equipment available to the \nGuard at home for use in such natural disasters or other domestic \nemergencies, if, God forbid, we had another such tragedy, the Guard \nwould not have had enough trucks, tractors, and communication gear \nacross the country to adequately respond.\n  The problem then--and still is--that much of their equipment has been \nleft in Iraq, where the National Guard has been indispensable.\n  Since the start of the war in Iraq, Guard units have deployed with \ntheir gear and then, after a year, they have left this gear for use by \nother units arriving in Iraq. Worse still, the National Guard has \nconsistently been underfunded, leaving it with well less than the \nrequired equipment stocks.\n  These low levels of equipment threaten the Guard's ability to carry \nout the two critical prongs of its dual mission.\n  Two days ago, the top National Guard LTG Steven Blum, reported that \nmore than two-thirds of the Army National Guard's 34 brigades are not \ncombat ready, due largely to vast equipment shortfalls.\n  Almost a year after Katrina, the Department of Defense leadership--\nwhich is ultimately responsible for monitoring the Guard's \ncapabilities--has yet to recognize this clear problem, let alone to \ndevelop a real funding plan to deal with the problem.\n  The $900 million included in last year's, Defense appropriations bill \nwas only the beginning of addressing this major problem with \nshortfalls--a problem that General Blum himself estimates to total \nnearly $21 billion.\n  Congress has no choice but to act. That is why this amendment takes \nanother step toward addressing the Guard's response capabilities at \nhome. It adds $2.4 billion on top of the funding in the regular bill \nand bridge supplemental for the Guard to procure equipment--for items \nas diverse as remanufactured tanks, radios, medium-sized trucks, and \ncommand-and-control systems.\n  I would like to commend Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye, who were \nable to identify almost $340 million in National Guard and Reserve \nequipment in the committee markup of the baseline Defense bill. That \nnumber shows the enormous support that exists within the Defense \nSubcommittee, especially when the Senate Defense allocation was $9 \nbillion below that set in the House of Representatives.\n  On behalf of our Guard units, our Guard members, and of all Americans \nwho so acutely rely on their steadfast readiness and service, I urge my \ncolleagues to vote now for a much-needed, higher level for the Guard.\n  This problem is so pressing and so severe that we cannot afford to \nlose momentum.\n  I just mention again, 2 days ago the top National Guard General, LTG \nSteven Blum, reported that more than two-thirds of the Army National \nGuard's 34 brigades are not combat ready.\n  We really have no choice but to act. This will not even begin to \nhandle the problems, but it will be a good start.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add, after Senator Bond's \nname and my name, Senator Menendez of New Jersey and Senators Lincoln, \nDodd, Landrieu, Lautenberg, Dorgan, Mikulski, Harkin, Rockefeller, \nBaucus, and Jeffords as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished chairman of \nthe National Guard Caucus, who has labored indefatigably in this area, \ncalling on his experience not only as a U.S. Senator but especially his \nexperience when he was Governor and commander in chief of the Guard in \nhis own State.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and fellow chairman of \nthe National Guard caucus for his kind words. As most people in this \nbody know, we have had wonderful, bipartisan cooperation supporting the \ngreat work of the Guard.\n  As the Senator from Vermont was kind enough to note, I did have the \nexperience of being commander in chief of our National Guard in \nMissouri for 8 years. And I have since followed very closely what they \nhave done.\n  Our National Guard, as I think everybody knows, has provided about 40 \npercent of the boots on the ground in Iraq and in the conflict against \nIslamofascism. They went into that battle, being called up for their \nnational security service, short of equipment. They are short of \nequipment because, as the Senator from Vermont and I have explained \ntime after time after time, the Pentagon, when it is faced with a \nshortfall of equipment or resources, tends to take care of the active \nforces first.\n  No one who knows my personal situation would think I am not \nsympathetic to the needs of the active forces. I very much want to see \nthem get the support they need. I understand what is going on in the \nPentagon. But the National Guard has fallen so far behind in its \nequipment accounts because of the pressure of the need to restock and \nreset other branches of Government.\n  When we found that a significant sum of money would be available for \nproviding equipment that is vitally needed for our National Guard, for \nour entire military, it was extremely important that we carve out a \nsmall amount, which is covered by this amendment, that would go \ndirectly to the Guard.\n  Now, we have been told this could have been accepted if we said the \nmoney ``may'' go to the National Guard. That is precisely the problem: \nthat money could have gone to the National Guard under any \ncircumstances. But, in fact, it is not going to the National Guard. \nWhen there are competing needs in the active military, they get first \ncall.\n  Let me be clear: The National Guard is being fully active, not only \nin the work they are doing overseas but in their homeland defense \nactivities.\n  Now, when you take a look at the national service mission, when they \ngo abroad, as has been pointed out on the floor, and they take \nequipment with them, they leave it there because it does not make sense \nto transport equipment back from the fighting frontlines when they have \ncarried it over there. So, as a result, that equipment is left there. \nWhen the Guard units come home, they have lost even more equipment. \nThat means they are falling far, far behind in their needed equipment \ncoverage.\n  Now, at the same time, when they went over they left the homeland \ndefense or the natural disaster equipment at a far, far insufficient \nrate. Most Guard units are about one-third equipped. In other words, if \nthey have nine units, only three of them are fully equipped.\n  I pointed out on the floor last year, after Hurricane Katrina, we \nwere very proud that one of our National Guard engineering battalions \nwas called to Louisiana. And they did a magnificent job. As a matter of \nfact, they did such a magnificent job that the adjutant general of \nLouisiana and the Governor of Louisiana sought another of the three \nengineering battalions from Missouri to come down. The bad news was \nthat one out of the three battalions that we had took the only \nequipment we had. We did not have equipment for a second battalion that \ncould have been very, very well used by our Guard in assisting the \nrecovery mission in Louisiana or Mississippi or Texas or other areas.\n  That is why it is so important to make sure we are fully equipped.\n  More than 200,000 Guard troops have left their homes, their jobs, and \ntheir families to participate in the war on terror in Afghanistan and \nIraq and other missions since 9/11. The National Guard has provided as \nmuch as half of the combat force and 40 percent of the total force in \nIraq. They are performing their duties with honor and valor, often at \ngreat cost to their families and their own lives.\n  The Guard also helps local responders deal with overwhelming natural \ndisasters here at home such as hurricanes, tornados, and floods.\n  The modified amendment will provide an additional $2.4 billion for \nNational Guard and Army Reserve needs on top of the funds already \nprovided in the bill under title III and title IX.\n  Lieutenant General Blum in a recent interview had this to say about \nNational Guard readiness:\n\n       I am further behind or in an even more dire situation than \n     the active Army, but we both have the same symptoms, I just \n     have a higher fever.\n\n\n[[Page S8684]]\n\n\n  It has been widely reported that the current funding shortfall for \nNational Guard needs is approximately $23,000,000,000.\n  About a third of this amount is required to replace equipment \nconsumed by the wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, and peacekeeping \nassignments. The remainder is money that is needed to close the gap \nfrom years of intentional underfunding according to Lieutenant General \nBlum, the Chief of the National Guard Bureau who also has been quoted \nas saying:\n\n       I am not talking about the icing on the cake. That's the \n     cake.\n\n  It has been reported that more than two-thirds of the Army National \nGuard's 34 brigades are not combat-ready due largely to vast equipment \nshortfalls.\n  The Army National Guard currently has only 34 percent of its required \nequipment. It was recently even worse than that. The percentage \nactually dropped for a time to as low as 26 percent as large numbers of \nunits demobilized and the Guard realized the full impact of equipment \ndestroyed, damaged or required to remain behind in theater.\n  Since that new low, there has been some recovery so that, at present, \nthe percent of required equipment actually onhand is 34 percent. That \nis nowhere near enough.\n  My colleagues will recall that Senator Leahy and I provided over $900 \nmillion in last year's Defense appropriations bill for the shortages in \nequipment. Had we not acted then, the state of National Guard equipment \nmight be even worse.\n  Currently there are 27,000 Guard forces deployed overseas and another \n29,000 Guard forces either coming back from overseas or preparing to go \noverseas. Additionally there are 6,000 Guard troops deployed along the \nNation's borders. Do the math and you will find that there are 62,000 \nGuard forces mobilized.\n  The National Guard Bureau reports that 16 percent of its force is \nmobilized in support of the global war on terror and 84 percent of the \nforce is actively involved in force planning or preparing and training \nto deploy overseas or along the border.\n  Time and time again the National Guard has been a tremendous value \nfor the capabilities it provides our Nation, providing 40 percent of \nthe total force for around 7 to 8 of the budget.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that our National Guard force must also \nremain cognizant of its homeland defense and security role. Our Nation \nwas reminded last year during the response to Hurricane Katrina of the \nGuard's other paramount mission.\n  The National Guard's contributions to Hurricane Katrina were stellar. \nThe magnitude, quality, and timeliness of the Guard's response remains \none of the less publicized successes of the Katrina disaster. The \nGuard's successful response was attributable to the fact that the Guard \nis best organized and trained to initiate and coordinate a civil \nresponse of the scale of Katrina.\n  This morning I was advised that it might be necessary to come to the \nfloor to defend this amendment. As I noted, it came as a surprise that \nit might be necessary, but now that I am here I am eager to defend it. \nSenator Leahy and I are not alone. I have a letter from the Enlisted \nAssociation of the National Guard of the United States addressed to the \nbill managers which states in part:\n\n       The $2.44 billion will not solve the equipment shortages in \n     the Guard. It will not instantly restore Guard equipment \n     readiness to top levels. It will, however, allow the Guard to \n     focus its restorative efforts on those who are preparing for \n     mobilization, and it will help to restore readiness for our \n     homeland defense posture.\n\n  Our amendment provides a prudent allocation of dollars to the proven \nand effective forces of the National Guard and Army Reserve.\n  Through it we ensure that the Guard and Reserve's military readiness \nand homeland security resources remain at minimally acceptable levels. \nThe funds we are providing in this measure are absolutely necessary to \nthe health of the force. This is why I urge my colleagues to send a \nstrong message to the citizen-soldiers and Airmen of the National Guard \nand Army Reserve by voting overwhelmingly in favor of this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I will turn it over to my colleague, but I believe it \nis necessary for us formally to call up amendment No. 4827.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senator is absolutely right. The \nSenator from Missouri is right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond], for himself and Mr. \n     Leahy, Mr. Menendez, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Dodd, Ms. Landrieu, \n     Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Dorgan, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Harkin, Mr. \n     Rockefeller, Mr. Baucus, and Mr. Jeffords, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4827.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To clarify the availability of funds for the National Guard \n               for National Guard and Reserve equipment)\n\n       At the end of title IX, add the following:\n       Sec. 9012. Of the amount appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by this Act by reason of the adoption of Senate \n     Amendment 4751 (referred to as the ``Stevens amendment''), \n     $2,440,000,000 is available for the National Guard for \n     National Guard and Reserve equipment. Such amount is in \n     addition to any other amounts available in this title, or \n     under title III under the heading ``Other Procurement, \n     Army'', for National Guard and Reserve equipment.\n\n                    Amendment No. 4827, as modified\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe modified to include ``and the Army Reserve.'' We have been asked to \nexpand this so that the $2,440,000,000 is available for the National \nGuard and the Army Reserve, for National Guard and Reserve equipment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as I previously stated, LTG Blum, the head \nof the National Guard, said in a recent interview about National Guard \nreadiness:\n\n       I am further behind or in an even more dire situation than \n     the active Army, but we both have the same symptoms, I just \n     have a higher fever.\n\n  And while this $2.4 billion will be a significant step forward, the \nGuard's best estimate for the shortfall is approximately $23 billion--a \nthird of it to replace equipment consumed by the wars in Afghanistan, \nIraq, and peacekeeping assignments. The remainder is money that is \nneeded to close the gap from years of underfunding by the Pentagon. \nAgain, LTG Blum, chief of the National Guard Bureau, has said:\n\n       I am not talking about the icing on the cake. That's the \n     cake.\n\n  And they have been cut very badly.\n  I have already mentioned that the Army National Guard has only 34 \npercent of its required equipment. At one time it dropped as low as 26 \npercent. And with some 27,000 Guard forces deployed overseas, and \nanother 29,000 either coming back or preparing to go, there is a \ntremendous need for that equipment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we \ntemporarily set aside the Leahy-Bond amendment for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on an amendment I \nhave filed regarding the Air Force's KC-135 Tanker Replacement Program.\n  Like my colleagues in the Senate, one of my top priorities is to keep \nour Nation safe. I am working to ensure that our servicemembers have \nthe best equipment possible.\n  Our Air Force has a fleet of aging refueling tankers that are \ncurrently experiencing problems. I simply do not believe we can wait 35 \nyears to replace them.\n  While I understand the fiscal constraints the Defense Subcommittee \nwas under, I believe that the KC-X, the airframe that will replace our \nnearly 40-year-old fleet of KC-135 tankers, is vital to our national \nsecurity and to the success of our servicemembers fighting abroad.\n  This acquisition effort is likely one of the most important ones we \nwill execute for many years to come. Whether the objective is to \nrespond to military aggression or to provide humanitarian relief, the \ncombination of distance and time can pose a significant challenge. When \nwe need to respond quickly and in force, tankers allow us to project \nglobally.\n  With our current military commitments abroad, our national security \nhas become dependent upon the tanker force. It is the way we deter, \ndeploy, and fight. We cannot achieve our decisive range capabilities \nwithout the air refuelers.\n  The Air Force's current schedule is to award a contract for the new \nKC-X aircraft in 2007. However, that award could be indefinitely \npostponed if funding is not restored in the 2007 Defense appropriations \nbill.\n  While I have filed an amendment, I do not plan to call it up because, \nas a member of the Appropriations Defense Subcommittee, I understand \nthe problem between the authorizers and the appropriators who may be \nreceiving different information regarding the necessity for funding in \nfiscal year 2007. I have a letter from the Air Force Deputy for Budget, \ndated August 2, 2006, stating that the Air Force needs a minimum of $70 \nmillion in research and development, test and evaluation funds for the \nyear 2007, in addition to the funds remaining in the tanker transfer \nfund. I ask unanimous consent it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  Department of the Air Force,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 2, 2006.\n     Hon. Richard Shelby,\n     Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Shelby: On behalf of the Secretary of the Air \n     Force, thank you for your inquiry on the Air Force's tanker \n     replacement program (KC-X). The KC-X budget request for RDT \n     in fiscal year 2007 was $203.9M. However, the submitted \n     budget did not account for the full extent of the program \n     pause, which started in September 2005 to allow for \n     additional analysis and review. In April 2006, the SECAF took \n     the program off pause and traditional program activities \n     resumed.\n\n[[Page S8686]]\n\n       To properly re-phase the program to account for the delay, \n     with contract award scheduled for August 2007, the Air Force \n     needs a minimum of $70M in RDT funds for fiscal year 2007. \n     This is in addition to the funds remaining in the Tanker \n     Transfer fund. These funds are needed to allow the program \n     office to obligate commercial long lead items for four test \n     aircraft and engines, as well as mitigate the risk associated \n     with the competition, since there is a wide variance between \n     the levels of effort required and the cost of potential \n     airframes among the various competitors.\n       To answer your specific funding questions, we provide the \n     following table:\n\n                                              [Dollars in millions]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                               Proposed for\n                                        RDT funding          Issued         reprogramming        Remaining\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTanker Transfer Fund................               $100              $10.2  .................              $89.8\nFY06................................               97.9               19.7               78.2                  0\nFY07................................              203.9                  0                  0                  0\n                                     ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Total.............................              401.8               29.9               78.2               89.8\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n* Requested in FY07PB, subject to enactment.\n\n       We agree that recapitalizing our aging tanker fleet is \n     vital to our national security and appreciate your support in \n     moving this program forward.\n           Sincerely,\n                                         Patricia J. Zarodkiewicz,\n                                                Deputy for Budget.\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. I also want to make certain that both the Armed Services \nCommittee and the Defense Subcommittee on Appropriations are receiving \nidentical funding information from the Air Force. To that end, I am \ncommitted to working with my colleagues to ensure that we are all \nreceiving the same information and have the same understanding of the \nneeds of the program to move forward at this time.\n  The Tanker Replacement Program is vital to ensuring that our Armed \nForces have the most reliable and effective equipment in the world. In \na year when the Senate's Defense appropriations bill has been cut $9 \nbillion, I appreciate the difficult funding choices that must be made. \nAs a member of the committee, we have to make those choices. However, \nas our military aircraft become fewer in number and have to serve \nlonger than those they replace, we cannot afford to take a misstep at \nthe outset of this acquisition program. We must adequately fund the \nTanker Replacement Program to ensure our servicemembers have the \nnecessary equipment to successfully defend our Nation.\n  I appreciate Chairman Stevens' continuing assistance with this \nprogram, as well as Senator McCain's longstanding interest, and look \nforward to working with both of them in the coming months to ensure \nthat we can move forward and replace our aging tanker fleet. A lot of \nthose planes are over 40 years old.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to associate myself with the \nconcerns expressed by Senator Shelby regarding the cuts contained in \nthis bill to the tanker replacement program.\n  The tanker fleet is one of our military's key competitive advantages. \nIt gives our Nation the ability to project power to any point on the \nglobe like no other country can. In an age where our military must be \nable to react rapidly to events, our airmen and soldiers cannot reach \nall corners of the world without being refueled by tankers.\n  At a time when we are spending billions of dollars on new, short-\nrange fighter aircraft, it would be foolish to not ensure that those \naircraft could get adequate supplies of tanker gas to do their jobs.\n  The current tanker fleet is old, with most aircraft dating back to \nthe mid-1960s. The fleet is now aging even more rapidly because \nincreasingly frequent deployments--mainly in support of operations in \nIraq and Afghanistan--have put significant wear and tear on their \nairframes. As magnificently as they have performed, these work horses \nof our military are coming close to the end of their service life and \ncannot safely fly forever.\n  It is imperative that we move now to ensure that we can acquire \nsufficient numbers of new tankers before these old airframes have to be \nretired. Reliable sources have informed me that without a minimum of \n$70 million in fiscal year 2007 funding, the Air Force's effort to \nacquire the next generation of tankers will likely face significant \ndelays.\n  I believe it is very important that the conference committee provide \nsufficient funding for next generation tankers to ensure that the \nprogram can proceed on schedule.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to enter into a colloquy with the \ndistinguished chairman of the appropriations subcommittee, the manager \nof the bill.\n  Senator Stevens and I have discussed a particular rescission included \nin the Defense appropriations bill on a classified matter. It is my \nunderstanding--and I ask the Senator--that it is his intention to \nreceive additional information from the Director of National \nIntelligence and other appropriate intelligence community officials on \nthis program. I believe it is imperative that the committee have this \ninformation as soon as possible so that the conferees can appropriately \nconsider the matter. Could the Senator confirm that this is his \nintention?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have conferred with our cochairman, \nSenator Inouye. This is our intention. We do appreciate the Senator's \ndesire to work cooperatively on this issue, and we intend to follow \nthrough and see to it we get the information he seeks and have further \ndialog on it when we do.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and Senator Inouye for \ntheir leadership on this bill. This information will be of great \ninterest to them. I appreciate their careful consideration of it. We \nlook forward to having these discussions and hearings.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Conference Report on Pensions\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are in the final moments of working \nthrough a rather important amendment. I thought I would use a few of \nthose moments, until the floor manager returns, to address an issue \nthat we are going to be dealing with within the next 2 days. I am not \nsure how much time we will have. That is the conference report on \npensions which I urge the Senate to accept.\n  I want to quickly review exactly what our pension conference came \nback with. It requires the companies to fund pension promises, help \nworkers save through automatic enrollment, making the Saver's Credit \npermanent. This automatic enrollment will ensure that workers will be \nenrolled in 401(k)s. And this legislation ensures they will be able to \nget good advice. The advice will be objective.\n  The Saver's Credit is going to be made permanent. That is probably \nthe most that can be done for low-income individuals. The bill helps \nprotect our airline workers' pensions. It give workers timely and \naccurate information on pension plan finances. It protects workers and \nbusinesses in multi-employer pensions. It protects older workers' early \nretirement benefits from erosion. That is important. It gives workers \naccess to unbiased investment advice. It adopts post-Enron worker \npension protections. It penalizes corporate\n\n[[Page S8687]]\n\nexecutives who line their pockets when workers' pensions suffer. It \nprovides greater retirement security for widows and former spouses.\n  Pensions are important because when we look at retirement security, \nit is a three-legged stool. We have Social Security, the bedrock of \nretirement; private pensions, and then private savings. Private savings \nare at an all-time low. We will, obviously, maintain the integrity of \nSocial Security, but the other aspect is private pensions. Only 50 \npercent of workers today have pension coverage at work, and only 21 \npercent have a defined benefit plan.\n  Pensions are enormously important. We have had approximately $8 \nbillion in pension savings that have been lost in the last 5 years. So \nif we did not take these steps, the prospects in terms of workers' \npensions would have been very threatening.\n  We will make this recommendation at an appropriate time, when the \nleaders are here. The chairman of our conference is our friend and \ncolleague, Senator Enzi, who has done an extraordinary job during the \ncourse of the whole pension conference. As always, he is a man of good \njudgment and patience. The conference lasted longer than any of us \nbelieved was necessary. Nonetheless, we have a product that we are \nprepared to defend.\n  We had great unanimity in the Senate when we passed the earlier bill \n97 to 2. Even those two individuals expressed reservations, and we were \nable to address their primary concerns.\n  This is not the legislation that I think Senator Enzi or I would have \ndrafted, quite frankly. But it is a solid recommendation. It will make \nan important difference to millions of workers, particularly those in \nthe multi-employer plans and also single-employer plans. It will make \nan incredibly important difference to some of the airlines. Quite \nfrankly, I was disappointed that we didn't treat American and \nContinental Airlines more fairly in the final recommendations. Without \nmoving ahead at this time on the pension legislation, we have the \nprospects of one of the major airlines dropping their pension program, \nwith more than 150,000 workers losing their pensions.\n  So this is going to be enormously important. We are not going to \nspend a great deal of time on this, as we are dealing with Defense \nappropriations, which is incredibly important; and we are going to be \ndealing with the estate tax proposal, which has been set by the \nmajority leader. But we will, in the next 2 days, deal with this \nlegislation.\n  It is extremely important. If there are Members who want additional \ninformation, I am sure Senator Enzi and I will be more than willing to \nprovide it.\n  Americans who have worked hard and played by the rules for a lifetime \ndeserve a secure retirement. They deserve to be able to enjoy their \ngolden years, to spend time with their families and to rest after a \nlifetime of hard work. We need to be sure that they have the income \nthey need to meet their costs for gasoline, prescription drugs, and \nother needs of daily living.\n  But what they see each day is corporations such as Enron that \ncallously disregard their workers retirement needs. They see airlines \nthat are going bankrupt, leaving their workers with a fraction of the \npensions they thought they had earned. They see other companies facing \neconomic hardship that reward their executives while cutting the \npensions of their workers.\n  The Pension Protection Act, which we are considering this week, will \nhelp over 100 million Americans. This legislation makes sweeping \nchanges to strengthen guaranteed pensions and to increase workers' \nability to build a secure retirement.\n  This legislation is the result of years of work on these complex \nissues by both the House and the Senate. Last year, we worked closely \non the HELP Committee with our chairman, Senator Enzi, and subcommittee \nchair, Senator DeWine, and its ranking member, Senator Mikulski, to \ndevelop a bipartisan way to deal with these issues, and we worked \nclosely as well with Chairman Grassley and Senator Baucus of the \nFinance Committee. Last fall, the Senate approved our comprehensive \nlegislation by a vote of 97 to 2.\n  For months, the conference committee has struggled to reach agreement \nwith the House, and last month we were finally able to reach a \ncompromise on the key pension elements of the bill, which are reflected \nin the measures we are considering today.\n  Before I turn to the merits of the Pension Protection Act, I must say \nthat while I support this legislation and the compromise it represents, \nI cannot support the process used in this conference, particularly the \nsystematic exclusion of Democrats from the negotiations. Republicans \nallowed only two of the 11 Democratic conferees to participate in the \ntalks, denying the American people the views and contributions that \nthese able legislators could bring to the table. The American people \nelect us to serve them, and refusing to allow elected officials to do \ntheir job is a fundamental attack on our democratic system of \ngovernment.\n  As we all know, millions of Americans are increasingly concerned \nabout their retirement security, and it is long past time for Congress \nto act. Many workers cannot save enough toward retirement. The personal \nsavings rate has now fallen below zero because wages are stagnant, but \ncosts are soaring for basic necessities such as gas, housing, health \ncare and education.\n  Social Security is under attack, and private pensions are in trouble \ntoo. In the past 5 years, over 700 pension plans have failed, with \nworkers losing approximately $8 billion in pensions they had worked so \nhard to earn.\n  Many workers today rely solely on their 401(k) accounts as their \npensions. But these accounts don't offer real retirement security. Many \nof those workers do not have any money in their 401(k)s.\n  Those who do are not saving enough. Half of workers close to \nretirement have less than $61,000 in their accounts. And those who rely \non these accounts face the constant risk that their investments will \nperform poorly.\n  This is why this legislation is needed. Companies need to keep their \npension promises to workers. Workers deserve to know the true financial \nstate of the health of their pensions. And companies need to offer \nbenefits that give more workers the ability to earn a secure \nretirement.\n  A core problem that we have tackled in this bill is the need to \nstrengthen the defined benefit pension system, which today provides \nsecure pensions for nearly 45 million workers and retirees. These \npensions grant a known monthly retirement benefit for life, and are \ninsured by the Federal Government.\n  Workers rely on these plans for a secure retirement. They have earned \ntheir pensions over a lifetime of hard work, foregoing raises and other \nbenefits to keep them. But as many workers at Bethlehem Steel and \nUnited Airlines suddenly discovered, their companies stopped \ncontributing money to these pensions, and the employees paid the price \nwhen the pensions collapsed. This includes workers like James Roberts, \nof Harrisburg, PA, worked for 33 years in a steel plant. When Roberts' \npension had to be bailed out by pension guaranty agency at the Federal \nDepartment of Labor, his pension was cut by one-third, to only $14,916 \na year. Our headlines have been full of stories like these in recent \nyears.\n  The legislation solves this serious problem by requiring companies to \nput more funds into their pensions and to do so in a fair and \npredictable way.\n  It also recognizes the power of public disclosure and the urgent need \nfor more effective oversight of pension plans. Under current law, \nworkers receive little financial information about their pensions, and \nwhat they do receive is often years out of date. They have earned these \npensions, and they deserve to know whether the funds are there to pay \nthem.\n  The Pension Protection Act ensures that workers and retirees receive \nup-to-date information each year about the status of their pensions. By \nopening up the books of pension funds, they will be able to monitor the \ntrue health of their retirement.\n  The bill also provides incentives to keep pensions financially \nhealthy by tying executive compensation to pension health. Executives \nshould not be able to feather their own retirement nests, while workers \nlose their nest eggs. The bill penalizes executives who put company \nfunds into their own retirement trusts, when the pensions of rank and \nfile workers are underfunded.\n  We also need to recognize the growing role of defined contribution \npension\n\n[[Page S8688]]\n\nplans in our retirement system. Over 40 percent of workers participate \nin such plans today, and for many of them it is their only pension \nplan.\n  Our legislation encourages them to save more under these plans by \nautomatically enrolling them in these pensions and automatically \nincreasing the amount they can save. Automatic enrollment can \ndrastically increase the number of workers who start saving for \nretirement--it would immediately help up to 5.9 million American \nworkers whose companies already offer pensions but they are not \nparticipating.\n  Workers in the lowest income brackets benefit the most. One study \nprojects that automatic enrollment could more than double the percent \nof lower income workers who are building a retirement when their \nemployer offers a pension from only 42 percent to over 90 percent.\n  The Saver's Credit provides critical incentives to help hard-working \nAmericans contribute to their retirement plans and helps over 5 million \nworkers each year. This legislation makes that credit permanent and \nindexes it so this incentive will continue to be meaningful for workers \ninto the future.\n  Also, as employees assume greater responsibility for pension \ninvestment choices, they need the best information possible about their \nchoices. The Pension Protection Act encourages companies to provide \nnonbiased investment advice to their employees so they can maximize \ntheir retirement savings.\n  Our bill also helps to improve the portability of pension savings. By \nmaking it easier for workers to move retirement savings from one type \nof pension to another when they change jobs, we encourage workers to \nkeep these savings for retirement instead of spending them.\n  In addition, the bill addresses the needs of nearly 10 million \nworkers and retirees who receive pensions through multiemployer plans. \nThese are the workers who clean our office buildings and hotel rooms, \nsell us our groceries, build our homes and schools and highways, and \ndeliver goods across the country. Many of them are in industries where \nthey move from job to job and would not be able to earn any pension at \nall without a multiemployer plan, since their employers, particularly \nsmall businesses, could not afford to offer a pension on their own.\n  The majority of these pensions are in strong financial shape. But the \nrecent economic downturn and the weak stock market have put some of \nthem in financial difficulties similar to those facing single-employer \npensions. We owe it to these employees to protect their pensions now, \ninstead of acting only when they are about to fail.\n  Under this legislation, employers and employees must work together \nand agree on a plan to restore these pensions to financial health. \nEmployers would be protected from unforeseen payment increases and new \nexcise taxes, which could cost many workers their jobs.\n  The bill also addresses the special needs of workers who help to keep \nAmerica safe. We improve retirement security for public safety workers \nby expanding options to pay for retiree health care and long-term care. \nWe also allow reserve and national guard members to draw on their \nretirement savings without penalty when called to active duty, and we \ngive them an opportunity to replace these savings when they return to \ncivilian life.\n  The pension crisis in the airline industry also deserves our \nimmediate attention. Our airlines have faced unprecedented challenges \nsince 9/11. Natural disasters have reduced travel. The industry is \nsuffering from record-high fuel prices. These costs are driving \ncompanies into bankruptcy, putting the retirement of hundreds of \nthousands of workers and retirees at risk.\n  Workers at United Airlines and U.S. Airways saw their pensions \nslashed when their companies filed for bankruptcy and then turned over \ntheir pension plans to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. We \nneed to help hundreds of thousands of other workers avoid the same \nfate.\n  The bill provides a way for these airlines to keep their pensions, by \noffering companies a specialized payment program and a transition \nperiod to adjust to the new rules. Hardworking people like Sean \nReardon, a mechanic with Delta Airlines in Boston, deserve to keep \ntheir pensions, as do thousands of other workers in Massachusetts.\n  Our legislation also addresses new types of pensions, like ``hybrid'' \npensions, which play a growing role in our retirement system. These \npensions provide a guaranteed pension, and the benefits are attractive \nto younger workers and to others, such as parents caring for children, \nwho move in and out of the workforce.\n  Older workers, however, can lose out when their companies switch to \nthese plans because they lose a large portion of the benefits they were \npromised. Some companies have been taking advantage of the conversion \nprocess to eliminate early retirement benefits that workers have \nalready earned.\n  This legislation gives companies clear guidance about the future \nlegal status of these plans, but allows workers who have been harmed in \nthe past to continue to pursue their rights. And it contains clear \nprotections against such ``wearaway'' or erosion of older workers' \nbenefits. The bill also makes these pensions more portable, so that \nthey better serve a mobile workforce.\n  As we learned from the Enron, WorldCom and other corporate scandals, \nemployees forced to invest in company stock are at huge risk. Despite \nall the publicity, many workers continue to overinvest in company \nstock, jeopardizing their retirement security because their job and \ntheir retirement depend on the fate of their company.\n  The bill protects them by preventing employers from overloading \n401(k) plans with company stock. It also warns employees when they \nplace too much of their retirement funds in one investment.\n  The legislation also includes important provisions from the Women's \nPension Protection Act that Senator Snowe and I introduced. Retirement \nsecurity is essential for all Americans, but we often fail to meet the \nneeds of women on this basic issue. Women live longer than men, but \nthey continue to earn far less in wages over their lifetimes. They are \nalso much less likely to earn a pension. These differences translate \ninto seriously inadequate retirement income for vast numbers of women.\n  According to the most recent data, only 22 percent of women age 65 \nand over are receiving private pension income, and for those who do, \nhalf of them are receiving less than $4,500 a year compared to $9,600 \nfor men. Minority women are in even more desperate straits--only 21 \npercent of African-American women and 9 percent of Hispanic women \nreceive a pension. These disparities are a major reason why nearly one \nin five elderly single women lives in poverty.\n  Our legislation gives them greater retirement security. Widows will \nreceive more generous survivor benefits and divorced women will have \ngreater ability to receive a share of their former husband's pension \nafter a divorce. These are long overdue improvements in the private \npension system, so that retirement savings programs will be more \nresponsive to the realities of women's lives and careers.\n  Employees and their families rightly expect Congress to protect their \nhard-earned pensions. This legislation is a major start toward meeting \nthis basic challenge in our 21st century society. I urge my colleagues \nto support the Pension Protection Act.\n  I suggest absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I rise for a moment to address the \nsituation with regard to the pension protection bill. I want to follow \nup on the remarks by the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy. I \nthank Senator Kennedy for his hard work as the ranking member of the \nHELP Committee. I thank Mike Enzi, the chairman, and I appreciate the \npatience of Chuck Grassley and his effort in the Finance Committee.\n  The Senator's recitation of the long and arduous conference committee \nwas absolutely on track. We are within hours of getting a bill to the \nfloor that will protect the pensions of thousands of Americans today \nand, in the future, make our pension laws 21st century laws in a 21st \ncentury economy.\n\n[[Page S8689]]\n\n  Failure to agree to the bill before we leave will mean disastrous \nconsequences. Airlines in America have needed some special protection \nfor some time in order to do what they want to do, which is honor the \npensions of their employees. It is to the great credit of Delta and \nNorthwest Airlines that both companies want to exit bankruptcy and \nensure the pension benefits of their employees. This is not only noble, \nbut it is very important. In my State, 91,000 people's pensions and \ntheir futures are determined and dependent upon the Senate acting.\n  Beyond the airline situation, the pension laws of the country have \nneeded to be modernized for some time. We all know the trouble Social \nSecurity has had. It has been the same trouble with defined pension \nbenefits. People live longer and there are less workers, and less \nworkers do more work and contribute less to the system. It is important \nto the companies to be able to amortize their liability over a period \nof time that is sustainable. It is important that the interest rate \nassumptions made are realistic, and that we adopt the principle that \npeople do in their own savings, and that is dollar cost averaging--\ncontinuing to put money into whether the market is up or down. It \nshould be the same in terms of protecting pension plans by ensuring \nthat contributions are consistent and meaningful and, in fact, doable.\n  I have had tremendous help over the past 18 months from many people. \nI want to particularly thank Mike Quiello, Ed Egee, and Glee Smith on \nmy staff for countless hundreds of hours in working toward the \nresolution that will soon come to this floor.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with us in adopting and ratifying, \nwithout amendment, the pension protection bill that will be before us. \nIt will be meaningful for many retirees today. It will be more \nmeaningful for every retiree in the future. I end by thanking Chairman \nGrassley and Chairman Enzi for their tireless work, and ranking members \nKennedy and Baucus for their cooperation, and the staffs who put in so \nmuch time to make this bill a reality for millions of Americans.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the pending amendment is the amendment I \noffered; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Bond amendment is the pending amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The regular order is the underlying Kennedy amendment; \nis that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4802, as Modified\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I send a modification of the amendment to \nthe desk and ask that the underlying amendment be modified as \ndesignated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment will be so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 4802), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 150, line 24, insert before the period the \n     following: ``: Provided, That the Director of National \n     Intelligence shall, utilizing amounts appropriated by this \n     heading, perpare as soon as practicable but not later than 90 \n     days after the date of enactment of this Act, a new National \n     Intelligence Estimate on prospects for security and stability \n     in Iraq, which shall address such matters as the Director of \n     National Intelligence considers appropriate, including (1) an \n     assessment of whether Iraq is succeeding in creating a stable \n     and effective unity government, and the likelihood that \n     government will address the concerns of the Sunni community, \n     (2) the prospects for Iraq's ethnic, religious and tribal \n     divisions, (3) the prospects for controlling severe sectarian \n     violence that could lead to civil war, (4) an assessment \n     whether Iraq is succeeding in standing up effective security \n     forces, including an assessment of (A) the extent to which \n     militias are providing security in Iraq and (B) the extent to \n     which the Government of Iraq has developed and implemented a \n     credible plan to disarm and demobilize and reintegrate \n     militias into government security forces and is working to \n     obtain a political commitment from political parties to bar \n     militias, and (5) the prospects for economic reconstruction \n     and the impact that will have on security and stability. \n     Provided further, That the Director of National Intelligence \n     shall submit to Congress the National Intelligence Estimate \n     prepared under the preceding proviso and this document shall \n     be submitted in classified form, except that, consistent with \n     the protection of intelligence sources and methods, an \n     unclassified summary of key judgments of the National \n     Intelligence Estimate should be submitted: Provided further, \n     That is the Director of National Intelligence is unable to \n     submit the National Intelligence Estimate by the date \n     specified in the preceding proviso, the Director shall submit \n     to Congress, not later than that date, a report setting forth \n     the reasons for being unable to do so and the date on which \n     such National Intelligence Estimate will be provided''.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, just to take a moment of the Senate's \ntime, first, I am very grateful to the floor managers, Senator Stevens \nand Senator Inouye, and particularly Senator Roberts for the \nopportunity to work with him on a matter which I think is of underlying \nimportance.\n  We have worked out language which would require an updated national \nintelligence estimate on Iraq. The last one that was prepared was 2 \nyears ago. The assessment would address whether Iraq is succeeding in \ncreating a stable and unity government, and whether it will address the \nSunnis' concerns, the prospect for Iraq's ethnic, religious, and tribal \ndivisions reconciliation, the progress for controlling severe sectarian \nviolence that could lead to civil war, whether Iraq has a credible plan \nto disarm and demobilize and reintegrate the militias, and whether the \nGovernment is working to obtain a political commitment from the \npolitical parties to ban militias.\n  For the sake of our men and women in Iraq and for the sake of our \nNation, we need this kind of assessment from the intelligence community \nso we can adjust our policy.\n  John Adams, the great leader from Massachusetts, said: Facts are \nstubborn things. We should have an update on the facts as our \nintelligence agencies see them and have them available to the \ndecisionmakers and to the administration.\n  I very much appreciate the cooperation of Senator Roberts and others \nin working out language which I think carries through the purpose of \nthe initial amendment and I think will be enormously valuable and \nhelpful to us in charting the course for our Nation in the future.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this amendment has been modified after \nconsultation with the distinguished chairman of the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee. I believe it has the support of the Senator from Hawaii.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, as I indicated, we have discussed this \namendment with the Senator from Kansas, the chairman of the Senate \nIntelligence Committee. We had a little bit of trouble reading the \nwriting on the modified amendment. I believe we have that agreed to \nnow.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to make a few observations with \nregard to the Kennedy amendment to require a new national intelligence \nestimate on the situation in Iraq. I very much appreciate the efforts \nof Senator Roberts and Senator Stevens to work with Senator Kennedy to \nimprove his original amendment, and I think the language that we have \nagreed to is a big improvement over the original proposal.\n  I do want to share with my colleagues, however, a concern I have \nabout what we are asking for here. As everyone in this Chamber knows, \nwe have had a big debate over the last few years about whether the \nintelligence on Iraq was ``politicized'' as we approached the decision \nwhether to authorize the use of force against Saddam Hussein in 2003. A \nlarge part of that debate has turned on whether the National \nIntelligence Estimate that was submitted to Congress by the \nintelligence community on October 1, 2002, was balanced and complete.\n  It is important to recall that the October 1, 2002, National \nIntelligence Estimate was demanded by Members of Congress in September \nof 2002. The\n\n[[Page S8690]]\n\nrecord demonstrates that the Director of Central Intelligence asked for \nmore time to complete the estimate, and the Members of Congress who \nwanted to see that estimate said no. Certainly the pressure from \nCongress to produce that document very quickly contributed to whatever \nproblems have subsequently been identified in that estimate.\n  A lesson that can be drawn from this experience is that it is not \njust executive branch officials who are in a position to politicize or \ndegrade the quality of intelligence. Members of Congress can do so as \nwell if they are sloppy in the way they press for information, ask \nbiased questions, or don't allow enough time for the intelligence \nprofessionals to do their work carefully.\n  In light of this experience, I would hope that if the Kennedy \namendment is enacted into law, the Director of National Intelligence \nwill not feel pressured to reach some of the judgments that some \nsupporters of the amendment clearly want him to reach. Instead, our \nintelligence professionals should take their time, work hard, and \narticulate conclusions that represent their best judgment about the \nsituation in Iraq. There simply is too much at stake to permit the work \nof our intelligence professionals to be politicized at this late date.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending. Is there further \ndebate?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask for adoption of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If not, without objection, the amendment is \nagreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4802), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator from Iowa wishes to be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                    Estate Tax and the Minimum Wage\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman. I did not want to \ninterrupt any amendments. I just thought as long as there was time when \nno one was offering amendments, I would take the opportunity to speak \nbriefly about the issue that will be confronting us today and tomorrow \noutside the action on the Defense appropriations bill, and that is the \nso-called deal the House of Representatives sent over to us regarding \nestate taxes and the minimum wage.\n  For 9 long years, the majority party here has blocked any increase in \nthe minimum wage. During that time, the real value of the minimum wage \nhas declined by 21 percent. The minimum wage now is a poverty wage. One \ncan work for a minimum wage, but one is still in poverty. A breadwinner \nworking full time for minimum wage earns $6,000 less than the Federal \npoverty level for a family of three. Yet the Republicans again and \nagain have adamantly refused to allow an increase.\n  Just think what it would feel like to anyone here if our salaries we \nmake as Senators and Congressmen had decreased in value by 21 percent \nover the last 9 years. Think how that would feel to you and your \nfamilies. How about people at the bottom of the economic ladder? That \nis exactly what has happened to them.\n  However, now 3 months before the election, I think the majority party \nis looking at the polls. A Pew poll this week showed that 83 percent of \nthe American people favor increasing the minimum wage. My friends on \nthe other side of the aisle don't want to appear coldhearted and \ncallous, so they have offered us a deal, and what a deal it is. They \nhave crafted a perverse minimum wage bill that actually cuts wages for \nnearly a million workers, then increases the minimum wage for others \nover 3 years, and then they say: We will give you this only if you \nagree to another giant tax break for some of the wealthiest people in \nAmerica.\n  Let me be specific. What my friends on the other side of the aisle \nare saying is that the lowest income working Americans do not deserve \non average a $1,200-a-year increase in the minimum wage; they don't \ndeserve it. But the estates of billionaires should get a tax break \nworth tens of millions--in some cases billions--of dollars.\n  Let me repeat that. People at the lowest end of the spectrum don't \ndeserve a $1,200-a-year increase. They will only get it, you see, if we \ntie it to another huge tax giveaway for the richest Americans.\n  This so-called deal we have been given takes cynicism to a new level. \nIt takes greed to a new level. And by draining the Treasury of more \nthan three-quarters of a trillion dollars over 10 years to give another \nhuge tax break to the wealthy, it takes fiscal recklessness to a new \nlevel. Let's be clear. This is a deal the Senate should reject. It is \nshameful that the majority party would attempt to hold the minimum wage \nhostage to yet another tax bonanza for the wealthy--I might add, the \nsixth in 6 years--the sixth tax break for the wealthiest in 6 years. \nThe Walton family alone--we all know the Walton family; not the ones on \nTV, the ones that started the Wal-Mart stores--the Walton family alone \nstands to get a tax break worth billions, upwards of $16 billion over \nthe coming generation if we pass this estate tax near-repeal.\n\n  So the near repeal of the estate tax is a tax cut we can't afford, \nfor people who don't need it, paid for by the children and \ngrandchildren of the working middle class in America. And the huge loss \nof revenue, creating even more massive deficits in the coming decade, \nwill force deep cuts in health care, education, veterans' benefits, \nagriculture, and other programs on which working Americans depend.\n  But the cynicism doesn't stop there. Republicans have taken the \nDemocrats' minimum wage bill and they have twisted it in ways that will \nactually result in a pay cut--a pay cut--for nearly 1 in 6 Americans \nearning the minimum wage. Because of the delayed, 3-year phase-in, the \nbill would benefit nearly 2 million fewer workers. And here is the \nkicker: The bill before us will nullify laws in seven States that \nprovide minimum wage protections for workers who earn tips. Those \nworkers in those seven States actually, under this bill, will receive a \npay cut of up to $5.50 an hour in seven States. I find it interesting \nthat my friends on the other side who have always championed the causes \nof States rights and that the Federal Government should not be taking \npower away from the States, with this bill they are telling seven \nStates: We don't care what you want to do, we are telling you we know \nbetter. We are going to take away your right to give your working \npeople who earn tips a better deal. We are going to take that away.\n  So much for States rights.\n  This is not a deal; it is a deception. It does a grave injustice to \nthe 6.6 million Americans earning the minimum wage, hard-working people \non the margins of our economy desperate for an increase. With this \nbill, my friends on the Republican side are saying to them: You are \nhostages. You get nothing. You get nothing unless 3 out of every 1,000 \nof the wealthiest estates in America get an average tax break of $1.4 \nmillion. That is right. This estate tax bill helps only 3 out of every \n1,000 estates in America--3 out of 1,000 of the richest estates in \nAmerica. So that is their deal: You are hostages. You don't get a thing \nunless we help these 3 out of 1,000 of the richest. This violates our \nmost basic sense of decency, fairness, and justice. And, just as \nimportantly, the near repeal of the estate tax would pile another \nmassive load of debt onto our children and grandchildren. It will be \ntoxic for our Nation's economy.\n  We will hear our colleagues on the other side tell us it is mostly \nteenagers, summertime workers, part-time workers flipping burgers \nworking for the minimum wage. Facts are nagging things because facts \nnag at myths, and this is one of the myths we hear all the time. What \nare the facts? Thirty-five percent of those earning the minimum wage \nare their family's sole breadwinners. Sixty-one percent of the people \nearning the minimum wage in America today are women. You want a women's \nissue? This is a women's issue. Sixty-one percent earning the minimum \nwage are women. As I said, 35 percent are the sole breadwinners of the \nfamily. Seventy-six percent of the women who would directly benefit \nfrom an increase are over the age of 20. So it is not just teenage \nwomen. In my State of Iowa, if the minimum wage were raised to $7.25 an \nhour, which is what we have been proposing, some 257,000 Iowans--that \nis, 18 percent of all of the\n\n[[Page S8691]]\n\nworkers in my home State--would receive an hourly wage increase \naveraging 60 cents. Now, again, of those workers in my State, 75 \npercent are over the age of 20, 58 percent are female, 42 percent work \nfull time, and 20 percent are parents.\n  Well, 3 months before the election, we are proposed this deal. It is \na devil's deal. My friends on the other side say: We will grudgingly \ngive poor working Americans an increase, but first you have to agree to \na near repeal of the estate tax for the richest of Americans, despite \nthe fact that we are facing a deficit this year of about $300 billion, \ndespite the fact that they have run up more than $2 trillion in new \ndebt since President Bush took office, despite the fact that they have \nincreased spending by 25 percent in just 5 years' time, despite the \nfact that we are spending almost $10 billion a month on seemingly \nendless wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The level of irresponsibility \nhere is just breathtaking.\n  As I said, this is a tax break we cannot afford, benefiting people \nwho don't need it, and it is going to be paid for by the children and \ngrandchildren of hard-working, middle-class Americans. Slashing the \nestate tax would not create a single new job. It will not increase \nproductivity or competitiveness. It will do nothing to build one \nnew school or to improve the education of our children. To the \ncontrary, by driving up the deficits and the debt, it will create more \npressure to cut already underfunded efforts to support education, \nhealth care, veterans, and other domestic priorities.\n\n  This Senate went on record this spring in the budget to add $7 \nbillion to the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human \nServices, and Education. It went on record with an overwhelming vote--\n73 to 26--to put in $7 billion--to increase it? No. Just to get us to \nthe level we were 2 years ago in 2005--just to get us to the level we \nwere in 2005. Well, through the committees and the conferences, we got \nthat bill down to $5 billion. So we have a $5 billion increase. So we \ncan't even get back to the level we were in health care, medical \nresearch at NIH, education, all of the programs that help kids, Title \nI, Individuals With Disabilities Education Act--none of those will be \nable to get back to the 2005 level.\n  I am told the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education \nappropriations bill again is being held hostage, that we won't bring it \nup until after the elections. We won't bring it up until after the \nelections. Why? Because we will probably vote on putting that $2 \nbillion in there, and it will win--it will win--it will win. I don't \nthink my friends on the other side want to go into the election having \nsuffered that kind of defeat here on the Senate floor.\n  So I take this time, since no one else was offering amendments, to \ntalk about this so-called deal which is being called a trifecta, for \nsome reason or another, to just say we have to reject this devil's \ndeal, as I called it, this deception. What we need to do is to say no \nto the House of Representatives and what they have tried to do to us, \ndefeat that, take the tax extenders on which we all agreed--on which \nboth sides agreed--put it on the pension bill, and send it back to the \nHouse, and then we will address the issue of the minimum wage and \nperhaps estate taxes sometime later.\n  We should reject this perverse deal being offered. I reject giving \naway another three-quarters of $1 trillion in tax breaks for the \nwealthiest of Americans. If we are going to pass new tax breaks, let's \nfocus on working Americans who need them for increased college tuition, \nincreased gasoline prices, increased heating bills, and increased \nhealth care premiums. Those are the people who need the tax breaks, not \nthe 3 out of 1,000 who have the biggest estates in America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment \nNo. 4827 in its modified form--I believe it has been modified----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS be placed before the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is pending.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask for a vote on this amendment. Are \nthe yeas and nays ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have been ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask that that order be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4827), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Coburn amendment No. 4848.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I ask unanimous consent to address the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Obstruction\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, we are at a time of year when Congressmen \nand Senators leave Washington to spend the month of August back in \ntheir States and districts. As I travel around the State of South \nCarolina, I know that my constituents will want to know what we have \ndone in Congress to secure our homeland, to lower their cost of living, \nparticularly gas prices, and to protect the values that have made us \nstrong and unique as a nation. In short, the people of South Carolina, \nlike the people all across America, will want to know what we have done \nto secure their future and to give them hope that their children and \ngrandchildren will live safe and prosperous lives.\n  The Democrat leader recently charged this has been a ``do nothing \nCongress'' and suggested it is time to go to work on the pressing \nproblems facing our Nation. Maybe he should have extended that same \nadmonition to his Democrat colleagues who have tried to block just \nabout everything that would make our country safer, more prosperous and \nprotect the values that make America great.\n  It has been said that everyone is entitled to their own opinion but \nnot their own facts. And the fact is, thanks to Republican perseverance \nand leadership, this Congress has been one of the most productive \nCongresses I have been privileged to be a part of. I am looking forward \nto giving the people of South Carolina my report.\n  Let's talk about securing our homeland. I am proud that, thanks to \nthe leadership from President Bush and the Republican Congress, we have \nremained steadfast and forceful in the war against radical Islamic \nterrorists all around the world and that there have been no further \nattacks on United States soil since September 11.\n  Republicans understand the war on Islamic Fascism has many fronts: \nAfghanistan, Iraq, and we see it now in Israel's struggle against \nHezbollah. There will be many new fronts. If we do not defeat radical \nIslamic terrorists in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Lebanon, we will never \ndefeat them anywhere.\n  Unfortunately, many of my Democrat colleagues, with the help of their \nmisguided allies and media outlets such as the New York Times, have \nsignaled to the terrorists that America is tired, discouraged, and \nready to quit. This has encouraged the terrorists to expand their \nattacks in many parts of the world.\n  Not content just to heckle from the sidelines, many Democrats have \nfought to block the tools needed to defend freedom abroad and to defend \nour Nation at home. Democrats have blocked reauthorization of the \nPATRIOT Act while their leader boasted ``we killed the PATRIOT Act.'' \nThey blocked nominees to critical national security positions, \nincluding U.N. Ambassador John Bolton and the Department of Defense and \nintelligence officials. They have blocked expediting our national\n\n[[Page S8692]]\n\nmissile defense system, attempting to cut funding by $50 billion this \nyear, just as the threats from Iran and North Korea increase. They have \nopposed the terrorist surveillance programs that are critical \nto stopping future attacks, leading to an attempted partisan censure \nmotion against our President. They blocked measures that would require \nbackground checks on workers with access to sensitive sites such as our \nports, while wringing their hands over port security. They blocked \nefforts to secure our border by ending the failed practice of catch-\nand-release of illegal immigrants. And they have advocated a variety of \ncut-and-run strategies, showing a complete lack of resolve and a basic \nmisunderstanding about the nature of the global war against radical \nIslamic terrorists.\n\n  Zell Miller, a Democrat, recently visited South Carolina. He compared \nthe terrorists to a nest of copperheads under his porch. He said: These \nsnakes threaten the well-being of my family. I didn't call my neighbors \nfor help or convene a committee to discuss possible courses of action. \nI took what you might call unilateral action and cut off their heads.\n  Zell Miller is one of the few Democrats who gets it. Terrorists have \nproved they are determined to harm us, and they have attacked in \nMadrid, London, and a number of other places across the world, with \nrecent arrests in Canada and Miami. They have shown they are \neverywhere. We need to continue our resolve.\n  There is no in-between choice when it comes to Iraq. Either we run \nand allow Iraq to become a safe haven for terrorists and a staging \nground for future attacks or we stay until Iraq is a stable partner in \ndemocracy.\n  Recently, I met a wounded soldier at Walter Reed Hospital. He had \nsevere head injuries. He had difficulty remembering some things. His \nonly request to me was, Don't leave until we win; make sure our \nsacrifices were not in vain. He could remember that.\n  The Republican-led Congress has not forgotten. We have secured \nAmerica's homeland by funding critical ongoing needs of our troops, by \nincreasing funds for border security, bioterror and pandemic \npreparedness, by renewing the PATRIOT Act despite Democrat obstruction, \nand we have defended the use of military intelligence and law \nenforcement resources that have led to the capture of many of al-\nQaida's top leaders and substantially degraded the capability of the \nworld-wide terrorist network.\n  Republicans will continue to secure America's homeland. We will \nstrengthen border security with additional border agents. We will \nenforce immigration laws with worker verification. We will secure our \nports with worker background checks. We will modernize the national \nemergency alert system to better respond to natural disasters and \nterrorist attacks, and we will support surveillance to find and stop \nterrorists before they strike, regardless of what the New York Times \nsays.\n  I am proud to tell South Carolinians that Republicans are doing what \nit takes to secure our homeland from all enemies, and we are committed \nto complete our current mission in Iraq and Afghanistan with victory \nand honor. We are committed to create a new generation of freedom and \nsecurity, of peace and prosperity for America and the world.\n  Let's talk about our prosperity in America today. I am anxious to \ntell the people of South Carolina what we are doing to help them make \nends meet. Republican tax cuts continue to bring strong economic \ngrowth. We have created over 5.4 million new jobs.\n  As the economy grows and wages rise, family checkbooks still feel the \npressure. If you get a $25-a-week raise but you have to spend $50 a \nweek more than you did before for gas, food, or medical care, you are \nstill $25 worse off than you were when you started. Optimism about the \neconomy is fading as concerns over the cost of living have increased. \nThere is no quick fix to this dilemma, but Republicans have a plan to \nsecure America's economic prosperity.\n  Unfortunately, Democrats have raised the cost of living by blocking \ncommonsense health care, energy, and education solutions while \npromising to raise taxes.\n  Let's talk about health care. It is one of our largest and most \nrapidly growing economic sectors, nearly 20 percent, by most estimates. \nWe still have access to the best health care in the world, but the \nsupport system that makes all of this possible is on the verge of \ncollapse--costly premiums, leaving millions uninsured, sky-high \nhospital and prescription drug costs, overwhelming amounts of confusing \npaperwork, outrageous cost of medical malpractice insurance which \ndrives doctors out of business and discourages our best and brightest \nstudents from even considering the profession.\n  In this era of fierce global competition, our overcomplicated and \ninefficient third-party payer health insurance system is bankrupting \nour companies and raising the cost of living for millions of hard-\nworking Americans.\n  Democrats have raised the cost of living for Americans by blocking \ncommonsense health care solutions for small businesses and families and \nopposing prescription drug coverage for seniors.\n  Republicans have a goal that every American will have a health plan \nthat they can own, afford, and keep. Our plan is to move toward what \nsome call ``consumer-directed health care''--or patient-directed health \ncare--which will unleash the power of free market competition in the \nhealth care industry. It will allow health care to function like the \nrest of our growing economy. It will return control to patients and \ngive them choices so they can shop for the best values. It will \nstrengthen doctor-patient relationships, improve quality, and reduce \nprices. It will allow us to keep our promises to seniors and give them \nbetter choices in the future.\n  We want to pass small business health plans. We have tried once this \nyear. The Democrats have blocked it. We hope to bring it back before \nthe end of the year. We want to expand health savings accounts, which \nare a new way to provide tax-free funds for people to shop for health \ncare without a third-party telling them what is covered. We want to \ntalk about allowing people in one State to buy health insurance from \nany other State in the country. We call it the Choice Act, and it is \nsomething this Senate should look at.\n  We are at a crossroads in health care. We can continue down the same \npath we are on now, where Washington bureaucrats are making many of the \nhealth care decisions, and we can allow the Democrats to continue to \nobstruct real change or we can put patients and caregivers in charge \nand lower everyone's cost of living.\n  Let me talk about energy. It is such an important part of the cost of \nliving and our prosperity. Our Democratic colleagues have a long \nhistory of increasing energy prices for American families. They have \ncontinually called for higher and higher taxes on gasoline, \nsuccessfully adding a 4.3-cent tax on every gallon of gas back in 1993.\n  They blocked a comprehensive national energy policy for 4 years. We \nfinally succeeded in overcoming that obstruction. They blocked \nincreasing American oil supplies by opening some Alaskan reserves. They \nvoted against it eight times over 15 years while gas prices steadily \nclimbed. They have blocked the expansion of American refining capacity \nand streamlining American boutique fuel bureaucracy that needlessly \ndrives up costs.\n  This week, over half of the Democrats in the Senate voted against \nenvironmentally friendly American deep sea energy exploration that will \nlower the price at the pump and lower the cost of home heating and \ncooling. Fortunately, again, we overcame their obstruction and passed \nthe bill.\n  Republicans have practical solutions on the table, such as deep sea \ndevelopment, that will increase America's natural gas and oil supplies, \nreduce the cost of gas, and reduce our dependence on foreign oil.\n  We have a plan to invest in alternative energy to diversify our \nenergy infrastructure and encourage conservation. We can supply \naffordable, abundant, and environmentally friendly energy. Most \nimportantly, we can reduce the cost of living for American families.\n  Democrats can follow their leadership's tired, partisan strategy of \nblocking real solutions and then trying to blame Republicans when the \nenergy crisis does not get solved or we can work together and secure \nour prosperity and bring down the cost of living for Americans. The \nchoice is theirs.\n\n[[Page S8693]]\n\n  Education is a big part of America's prosperity. We are in a global \neconomy, and we must invest in flexibility and choices for students and \nparents. We need to train the best workforce in the world to attract \nthe best jobs in the world right here at home. We can never guarantee \nour students a lifetime of employment, but we can invest in innovative \nideas that will ensure them a lifetime of employability. Only then will \nsuccess in school actually equate to success in life.\n  Democrats have blocked education reform for years that will improve \nour children's future. They blocked school choice. They blocked the \nexpanding of charter schools. They blocked the Workforce Investment Act \nand the Higher Education Reauthorization Act.\n  Democrats would rather cater to liberal teacher associations rather \nthan allow schools to specialize to meet the needs of each child.\n  Republicans believe we must empower students and parents with more \nflexibility in how they use education dollars. We need to allow schools \nthat are succeeding to continue to do what is working instead of \nforcing them to conform to an outdated governmental model.\n  We need to explore fresh ideas, such as strong professional \napplication and skills development programs within our educational \nsystem, and more opportunity scholarships and Pell grants for high \nschool students. These ideas and others can help reinvigorate a \nstagnant educational system that is being insulated from reality by the \nwell-intentioned but misguided policies of the past.\n  If America is to be prosperous, we need to talk about our tax system \nand our budget system. Tax-and-spend Democrats are fierce defenders of \nour Tax Code. It is the most complicated Tax Code in the world. It is \namong the highest as far as the tax rate. It kills our competitiveness. \nIt hurts American workers by killing American jobs.\n  Tax-and-spend Democrats block extending tax relief for American \nfamilies. They block the permanent repeal of the death tax that \ndestroys about 100,000 jobs each year and punishes family farmers and \nsmall businesses. They voted this year en bloc to raid the Social \nSecurity trust fund to pay for wasteful spending. They would not agree \nto set aside the Social Security money in a reserve fund.\n  Republicans believe meaningful Tax Code reform is our only option. At \na minimum, we must extend tax cuts that were passed in 2001 and 2003 \nthat return money to hard-working families and will help continue the \neconomic growth that is coming from investment around the country.\n  Republicans believe American businesses should be able to devote the \nbulk of their time and resources to doing business, not complying with \nthe Tax Code.\n  Republicans believe we should trim Government waste and that we can \nand will balance our budget within 5 years. We believe we should pass \nthe line-item veto to help cut wasteful spending in Washington.\n\n  We welcome the Democrats to join us to secure our prosperity and make \nAmerica the best place in the world to create jobs and do business. \nHopefully, they will join us to support the Family Prosperity Act that \nwe will be voting on either today or tomorrow.\n  This is one of the most important bills of the year, and I have been \ndisappointed to hear all the misinformation about the bill on the floor \nof the Senate. This bill raises the minimum wage; it will not decrease \nthe minimum wage anywhere in this country. That is a fact. The other \ninformation is, frankly, not true. The Family Prosperity Act will raise \nthe standard of living for Americans and cut the cost of death.\n  We need to talk about our values if we are going to secure our \nfuture.\n  I am also proud to report to my constituents that Republicans are \nworking to secure our shared values, the values that have defined the \nAmerican character, protected our families, and shaped our society for \nover 200 years.\n  I was interested to hear the Democratic leader criticize Republicans \nfor focusing on value issues, such as protecting marriage and \nprohibiting flag desecration, by claiming--in his words--that we have \n``divided our country and distracted this Body from more pressing \nconcerns.''\n  Over the years, the idea of values has come to be negatively \nconstrued by those who would define freedom as the ability to do \nwhatever they want and to have no one tell them it is wrong. I am here \nto say today that this distorted idea of freedom without values is \nactually the greatest form of tyranny.\n  Unfortunately, I am afraid the Democratic leader and others in his \nparty have bought stock in a philosophy that is completely bankrupt. \nThe society that refuses to say that some things are wrong, or give \nvalue to things that are right, condemns its people to live under the \ndespotism of fear--for the safety of their lives, their families, and \ntheir possessions--and robs them of hope for a better future.\n  As we fight to secure our homeland, we are opposed by radical Islamic \nterrorists who hate us for our shared values. These are the same \nterrorists who devalue their own women and use them, and even children, \nas shields behind which they carry out their cowardly work. They kill \ninnocent bystanders to prove a political point. They despise our values \nand will stop at nothing to destroy them and destroy us.\n  As we fight to secure our economic prosperity, we are reminded of \nvalues--the entrepreneurial American spirit and the premium placed on \nhard work--that have driven an amazing age of innovation and improved \nthe quality of our lives for millions here and all around the world.\n  The fact is, our shared values--things such as respect for life and \nthe rule of law--are the very basis of our prosperity and security, and \nwe forget that lesson at our peril.\n  So I am afraid it is a bit shortsighted of the Democratic leader and \nothers in his caucus when they dismiss securing our shared values as \nunimportant. And, unfortunately, like the other areas I have already \ndiscussed, they do not simply dismiss, they actively obstruct.\n  I am proud to tell my constituents that Republicans have taken \nseveral important steps to secure our values this year.\n  The Child Custody Protection Act was one. Parental notification is \nrequired for nearly all medical procedures. School nurses typically \nwill not even give an aspirin to a teenager without a signed parental \npermission slip. An overwhelming majority of Americans believe that \ntaking a minor across State lines to obtain an abortion without her \nparents' knowledge is not consistent with our shared values. This \nimportant legislation protects the rights of parents to care for their \ndaughters' health.\n  Democrats have caved to the pressure of their ``abortion at any \ncost'' industry donors by blocking the commonsense bill from becoming \nlaw with procedural delays. They are hoping that the American people \nwill either not notice or forget their obstruction. The cost is the \nemotional and physical health and well-being of teenage girls and the \nrights of parents who most want to protect them.\n  Let's talk about the marriage amendment. The Federal Government has \ndiminished marriage through misguided social programs and court \nrulings, and the Federal Government is the only one that can fix the \nproblem it has created.\n  Marriage is America's most important institution. It must be \ncherished and protected. We cannot allow activist judges to force their \npersonal views on American families that overwhelmingly support \ntraditional marriage.\n  Democrats have blocked the Republican-led efforts to secure our \nvalues by defining marriage as a union between one man and one woman.\n  Judges are also important to upholding our values. As I travel in \nSouth Carolina, time and time again, South Carolinians have asked me to \nfight for judges who will place the rule of law above their personal \nopinions. Democrats have consistently blocked and even tarred and \nfeathered well qualified men and women. Republicans have continued to \nfight, with some success--to mention Chief Justice Roberts and Justice \nAlito on the Supreme Court, and we have confirmed 14 circuit judges and \n34 district judges, overcoming much Democratic obstruction.\n  I would like to talk about the National Sex Offender Registry as part \nof our values agenda as well.\n  Parents deserve to know when a sex offender moves into their \nneighborhood so they can ensure their child's safety.\n\n[[Page S8694]]\n\n  The Republican-led Congress has created a National Sex Offender \nRegistry to protect our families against criminals and their heinous \nacts. A public database has been created by this bill that will help \nlaw enforcement and families track convicted sex predators as they \nenter communities. It has been called the toughest piece of child \nprotection legislation in 25 years, and I am proud that Republicans \ntook the lead on this.\n  We also need to talk about stem cell research. Our commitment to \nscientific yet ethical research is another shared value that has \ndefined America for years. I was proud to join President Bush and our \nRepublican majority to support additional funding for cutting-edge \nresearch with nonembryonic stem cells and to ban ``fetal farming,'' \nwhich allows human embryos to be created so they can be destroyed for \nresearch purposes.\n  Nonembryonic stem cell research has already been used in over 60 \nsuccessful human therapies to date. It holds unlimited promise for \ncures for millions who suffer from debilitating diseases. It proves \nthat we don't have to choose between science and ethics. We can achieve \nboth.\n  For all these reasons and more, I am proud to be part of a Republican \nmajority committed to securing our shared values.\n  I think we may be on the 12th or 13th version of the Democratic \nagenda. I have lost track; there have been so many. But while Democrats \npromise to travel the country staging press events during August, \nRepublicans are promising, for the rest of this year and as long as we \ncontrol the Congress, to continue to work for real, tangible \nlegislative solutions to the problems Americans face. Democrats may \nclaim to be the party of compassion, but compassionate rhetoric without \na plan for action is nothing more than an empty promise.\n  I look forward to telling my constituents that Republicans are \ncommitted to securing our homeland, our prosperity, and our values. I \ninvite my Democratic colleagues to join us to provide hope and security \nfor all Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from Massachusetts \nis recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Iraq and the Middle East\n\n  Mr. KERRY. I came to the floor to speak about the Middle East and \nIraq, and I intend to do so. But obviously, having sat here for the \nlast almost half hour listening to how the Senator from South Carolina \nis going to go back to South Carolina and report, I couldn't help but \nlisten to him say that he is going to be proud to tell South \nCarolinians that he and the Republicans have been doing what it takes \nto make America more secure. You can tell them that. But it doesn't \nmean it is true.\n  The fact is, the American people understand, I think pretty well, \nwhat is going on. Because life for the average American is getting \ntougher and tougher, they don't think Washington is doing very much for \nthem at all.\n  Health savings accounts work just fine for people who can save money. \nAsk how many Americans are saving money. If you can't save money and \nyou don't have the benefit of the tax deduction, then the health \nsavings accounts don't do anything. That is why there are now 46 \nmillion Americans without health care. It has gone up 6 million people \nunder this President.\n  Eleven million children have no health care at all in the United \nStates of America--none, no health care. We are the only industrial \nNation in the world that treats our kids like that. I hope he reports \nto the people of South Carolina, where there are a lot of kids who \ndon't have health care, why there hasn't been a vote on the Senate \nfloor to give children health care.\n  When it comes to making America more secure, I hope he tells them \nthat North Korea has four times the nuclear weapons capability that it \nhad 4 years ago. Are we more secure?\n  The fact is, for 3 years this administration didn't even engage with \nthe British, the Germans, and the French in their efforts to try to \nreduce the potential that Iran would nuclearize. Three years standing \non the sidelines, and now Iran is playing out its deadly game with \nSyria and Lebanon.\n  I think by any measure--and this is not what I came to the floor to \ntalk about--the case is powerful that America is in fact less secure. \nNothing underscores that more than when the Senator from South Carolina \nstands there and says how important it is to separate who is willing to \nfight terrorists, and we are fighting terrorists, he said, in Iraq.\n  Iraq is not a war of terrorists today. Iraq is a war principally that \nis civil. It is Iraqi killing Iraqi. The fact is, Iraq was never the \ncentral front in the war on terror, which was always in Afghanistan, \nalways with respect to Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida. It is al-Qaida \ntoday that is in fact stronger around the world, with 60 to 80 \ncountries in which it now has cells that it didn't have at the time of \nSeptember 11, 2001.\n  I hope we will have this debate. Believe me, we will have this debate \nover the next months about whether we are more secure and about how you \nactually stand up for the security of the United States. One of the \nways you stand up for the security of the United States is to have a \nsensible policy with respect to Iraq.\n  Yesterday I was at Arlington National Cemetery for the funeral of \nLance Corporal Geoffrey Cayer, a 20-year-old from Massachusetts. Apart \nfrom the obvious heart-wrenching sadness of that moment, I was struck, \nas I walked up to the graveside, by the number of new headstones, all \nof which read Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom.\n  One of those now among the fallen is Phillip Baucus, the nephew of \nour friend and colleague Senator Max Baucus. Phillip was a proud and \nbrave Marine Corps corporal who gave his life serving this country last \nSaturday in Anbar Province in Iraq. He was an extraordinary young man \nfrom all I have read and from what Max told me personally. I know \nfrom Max what he meant to his family and what a totally devastating \nblow this is to all of them. We offer our prayers for Phillip and for \nevery family that has endured this kind of monumental loss. Phillip and \nGeoffrey Cayer and all those who have given their lives are a very \ntough reminder to all of us of the incredible sacrifices that America's \nchildren are making every single day.\n\n  With the violence in Iraq growing worse by the day, it was stunning \nto hear Secretary Rumsfeld come before the Armed Services Committee \nthis morning with a laundry list of excuses and denials about what is \nhappening there and its consequences for the region. General Abizaid \ncandidly acknowledged that ``the sectarian violence is as bad as I have \nseen it,'' that he has rarely seen the situation ``so unsettled and so \nvolatile.'' He warned of coming civil war and that ``failure to apply \ncoordinated regional and international pressure . . . will further \nextremism'' and could lead to a widening and more perilous conflict.\n  But this morning Secretary Rumsfeld didn't call for that kind of \ndiplomacy, didn't talk about that kind of diplomacy, didn't lay out a \nplan that the administration has for that kind of leadership and \ndiplomacy, nor has President Bush reached out to undertake the kind of \ncrisis diplomacy needed in Iraq or to leverage the regional pressure to \nstop Iraq from descending into irretrievable chaos.\n  We ought to try to strip away the labels for a minute, take away \nDemocrat and Republican, take away the partisanship of this city, just \nmeasure this against history. How many times have any of us as United \nStates Senators, or even previous to our being here, seen the concerted \neffort statesmen on an international level convening efforts in order \nto diffuse crises or to make peace where there was war or to try to \nstop war where there was conflict?\n  Instead today Secretary Rumsfeld announced ``there are a number of \ngood things happening . . . amidst all of this difficulty, the currency \nis fairly stable, the schools are open, the hospitals are open, the \npeople are functioning.'' Secretary Rumsfeld waxed optimistic about an \nIraq where you ``see people out in the fields doing things and people \ndriving their cars and lining up for gasoline and going about their \nbusiness.''\n  He went to say that ``despite all of the difficulties, there are also \nsome\n\n[[Page S8695]]\n\ngood trend lines that are occurring, and I think the period ahead is an \nimportant period.''\n  I respectfully think it is a lot more than important. This may well \nbe the moment that decides the security and the framework for the \nsecurity of the Middle East itself. It certainly could be that kind of \nmoment with the proper vision and the proper statesmanship. It is time \nthat the administration was candid about the situation and worked on \nrescuing what is salvageable in Iraq. The reason that candor is \nimportant, it is the only way to get other countries engaged and \ninvolved.\n  With now at least 2,578 Americans killed, over 19,000 wounded, and no \nend in sight, you can't just offer the ``same old, same old'' as more \nkids die for a policy that isn't working. Go to the hospitals, meet the \nkids, talk to them. Sure they want us to win. We all want to win. But \nask them what is wounding them, what is killing them by and large. The \nvast majority of those killed and wounded are killed and wounded by \nIEDs, the new term of a new war, improvised explosive device.\n  What are our soldiers supposed to do about an improvised explosive \ndevice except go out and find them. And how do they find them? Usually \nwhen they explode, unless they are lucky enough to come across them \nsome other way. Americans are right to wonder why, \n3/\\1/2\\ years into this effort, it is Americans who have to go out and \ndo that rather than Iraqis. After all, Iraq was able to fight a 10-year \nwar with Iran, lost a million people, fought to a stalemate, during \nwhich time, I might add, we were providing a lot of the weapons to \nthem.\n  I don't think we should be silent. I don't think we have the right to \nbe. I can't be while this administration continues to deny reality and \nrepeat the same mistakes and pursue the ``same old, same old'' policy \nday after day which puts more and more lives at risk, more and more \nlives on the line, without pursuing a policy that provides the least \nrisk to our troops and greatest opportunity for success.\n  I have said it before and I believe it deeply, we in Congress have a \nspecial constitutional responsibility and a moral obligation to hold \nthe executive branch accountable for making the right choices for our \ntroops and our country. Frankly, that begins by demanding honesty when \nit comes to the war in Iraq.\n  The bottom line is--and here again the administration has not been \nhonest--this administration is now sending more U.S. troops into the \ncrossfire of an escalating civil war in Iraq. They still refuse to come \nclean with the American people about it.\n  I don't think we should endure more half measures, and staged, phoney \ndebates. It is time for us all to confront and deal with the truth \nabout the consequences of today's failed policy in Iraq.\n  No matter what the administration tells us, there is a civil war \nraging in Iraq. The President's policy of standing down U.S. troops as \nIraqis stand up, which has been the mantra of the last 2 years or more, \nhas now been exposed as a misleading myth. In fact, we are actually \nincreasing the overall troop presence, even as they tell us that more \nIraqi soldiers have been trained, and we have reportedly all but \nabandoned the hope of withdrawing significant numbers of troops this \nyear, even as the Iraqi President tells us that Iraqis can take over \nthe security responsibility throughout their country by the end of this \nyear. That is what the Iraqis are telling us, even as U.S. forces are \nincreasing\n  Yesterday, we learned more about our dangerously overstretched \nmilitary when the top National Guard general warned that more than two-\nthirds of the Army National Guard's brigades are not combat ready. Can \nyou please tell me how the Secretary of Defense can come up to the U.S. \nCongress and explain to us how two-thirds of the National Guard's \ncombat brigades are not ready? And their equipment--large percentages \nof it--is in Iraq and it will not come back to the United States. That \nis going to cost billions of dollars for the United States, billions of \ndollars to replace the equipment and the wear and tear, billions which, \nI might add, is not in the budget today. Worst of all, there is no end \nin sight and no realistic plan to turn the tide.\n  Mr. President, if you are going to change course or set the right \ncourse, you have to do it based on the realities. I believe that starts \nby acknowledging the reality of the civil war that is going on right \nnow. The administration denies it because it doesn't fit their \nrhetoric, but by objective standards, that is what is happening.\n  In the first 6 months of this year, 14,338 Iraqi civilians were \nkilled--civilians--mostly in sectarian violence. They were not killed \nby al-Qaida. They were not killed by Islamic terrorists from another \ncountry. They were killed by Shia on Sunni and Sunni on Shia. That is \nsectarian violence.\n  Prime Minister al-Maliki acknowledged last week that an average of \n100 Iraqi civilians are being killed every day--civilians. And the \nviolence has only been getting worse. Mr. President, 2,669 civilians \nwere killed in May; 3,129 civilians were killed in June. That is nearly \n6,000 Iraqi civilians killed in 2 months alone. Since the February 22 \nbombing of the Shia mosque in Samara, the Government reports that \n30,359 families--about 182,000 people--have fled their homes due to \nsectarian violence and intimidation. They are refugees, which is part \nof the definition of a civil war.\n  This is not just a civil war; by historical standards, it is a \nrelatively large-scale one. A recent academic analysis published in the \nNew York Times showed that the median number of casualties in civil \nwars since 1945 is 18,000. Estimates of total casualties in Iraq vary, \nbut the number is almost certainly above twice that many.\n  Larry Diamond, whom many Senators know and have talked to, is an \nexpert. He was over there with Paul Bremer in the Coalition Provisional \nAuthority. Here is what he said:\n\n       In academic terms, this is a civil war, and it is not even \n     a small one.\n\n  The Iraqis from all sides understand what is going on in their \ncountry. They are not afraid to speak the truth.\n  Haidar al-Lbadi is a prominent Shiite legislator. This is one of the \npeople we are working with in the democracy that we have offered and \nthat they have fought for and voted for. He said:\n\n       Certainly, what is happening is the start of a civil war.\n\n  Saleh al-Mutlaq, a Sunni legislator--so you have Shia and Sunni--also \ndescribed the recent violence as:\n\n       The start of a civil war.\n\n  Another leading Sunni, Adnan al-Dulaimi, said recently:\n\n       It is nothing less than an undeclared civil war.\n\n  The Iraqis are ready to tell you it is a civil war. Still, the \nadministration continues to deny the facts about that. If you don't \nacknowledge the facts, it is difficult to put together a plan to be \nable to adequately deal with them.\n  This is the same administration, incidentally, that everyone, I hope, \nremembers downplayed the insurgency. Do you remember that? Do you \nremember when it was first clear that chaos was giving way to a \ndetermined insurgency? What did the administration do month after \nmonth? Secretary Rumsfeld told us they are ``just a bunch of dead \nenders.'' At one point, he even suggested that Baghdad was safer than \nWashington, DC. Vice President Cheney told us the insurgency was ``in \nits last throes.''\n  Just look at the results. Since then, the number of Iraqi insurgents \nhas increased by 20 percent, and the insurgency is more than six times \nstronger now than in May 2003. Once again, it is our troops who pay the \nmost significant price. In fact, the number of IED attacks on U.S. \ntroops has nearly doubled since January.\n  Now, in the face of all of the evidence to the contrary, the \nadministration continues to deny that there is a civil war. The only \nones, it appears to me, they are fooling are themselves. This appears \nto be one more inconvenient truth they prefer not to deal with. In \nfact, Secretary Rumsfeld said just a few months ago that if civil war \ndid break out, Iraqi forces, not U.S. troops, would be the ones dealing \nwith it.\n  I hope everybody hears that. Secretary Rumsfeld, in another one of \nhis misjudgments, or misstatements, said a few months ago that if civil \nwar breaks out, Iraqi forces, not U.S. troops, will be the ones to deal \nwith it. So why are U.S. troops being augmented in their number? Why \ndid it take sending more troops to the city of Baghdad? One more \nmisjudgment and misleading statement. So we are sending more troops \ninto the crossfire. The\n\n[[Page S8696]]\n\nadministration doesn't want to say that, but that is what is happening.\n  When the President announced his plan last week to increase the U.S. \ntroop presence in Baghdad, he said that the troops would come from \nother areas of Iraq. He didn't mention that additional troops had been \nsent into Iraq from Kuwait and that current deployments were being \nextended as new troops arrive. The net bottom line of that policy, \nwhich he didn't mention but the Washington Post and the New York times \ndid report, is that the total numbe of U.S. troops in Iraq is going to \nincrease by several thousand. He didn't mention that the recently \nannounced deployment schedule could bring the number of U.S. troops in \nIraq even higher in the coming years.\n\n  Finally--and this is the most important thing of all--he did not \nexplain why this strategy, which hasn't been working for these past \nseveral years, is suddenly going to work, and the fact that a few \nmonths ago U.S. and coalition troops in Baghdad increased from 40,000 \nto 55,000. Guess what happened? The violence got worse. Now the \nPresident says we are going to send a few more thousand.\n  The question is, Why is this going to be any different? I remember \nthis psychology very well. Back in 1964 and 1965 when Lyndon Johnson \nresponded to the so-called attack of the Gulf of Tonkin and we upped \nour troop level by 5,000 troops in Vietnam, I responded to that call \nand found what we all now know was a matter of history--very different \nfrom what we are being told by our own administration.\n  One thing is clear to me under this administration's approach: It is \nhighly unlikely that we are going to be drawing down significant \nnumbers of U.S. troops from Iraq this year. That is despite the fact \nthat Secretary Rumsfeld said on Wednesday that there are some 275,000 \ntrained Iraqi security forces, with 325,000 expected to be trained by \nthe end of the year. General Martin Dempsey, the American general in \ncharge of training Iraqi forces, said in June that the new Iraqi Army \nwould be formed and at full strength by the end of this calendar year. \nIraqi President Talabani declared just yesterday that Iraqis could take \nover security in the entire country by the end of the year.\n  If the Iraqis are standing up, as the administration tells us, why \naren't U.S. troops standing down, as they told us they would? I think \nthe rhetoric of ``as they stand up, we will stand down'' is as hollow \nand misleading as the rhetoric that ``we will be greeted as \nliberators'' or ``mission accomplished'' or, frankly, ``stay the \ncourse,'' which means more of the same and is not an adequate response \nto the needs of dealing with the civil war.\n  The bottom line is this: The approach hasn't worked because the \nunderlying assumption that more troops are the solution to the problem \nis fundamentally flawed. I will say that again. You can put in a lot \nmore troops, but our own military leaders have told us there is no \nmilitary solution. So why are you putting in more troops? Our own \ngenerals, the Iraqi leaders, and even the Secretary of State herself, \nhave told us that there is no military solution to the insurgency. And \njust today, Secretary Rumsfeld acknowledged there is no military \nsolution to the sectarian violence. So in fact, all of us can agree \nthat the only hope for salvaging a measure of lasting success in Iraq, \nwhich I emphasize is what we all want--the difference is not what we \nwant, the difference is in how you get it. The evidence is mounting \nmonth by month that the course this administration is on is not the \nmost effective, least risk, most efficient way to get it.\n  The only way to resolve this insurgency is a political solution that \nall of the Iraqis can buy into. So the question then looms large: Why \nisn't that happening? If Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and if our \nown generals and if the Iraqis themselves say there is no military \nsolution, why are we adding more troops? Why are the Iraqi troops not \nable to deal with the situation? The answer is simple: because until \nyou resolve the fundamental differences that bring Sunni to kill Shia \nand Shia to kill Sunni, you are not going to stop this process.\n  I believe there is only one way to resolve that, and that is to \nengage in the kind of intensive diplomacy that has been so inexplicably \nlacking from this administration in its approach to Iraq. I know what \nsome of the wise guys say in Washington and what some of the pundits \nsay and what the conventional wisdom is. People love to dismiss \ndiplomacy these days. It is the easiest thing in the world. Why talk to \nthem? We have to go out and be tough and so on.\n  There was a time not so long ago in this country, practiced by \nRepublican Presidents, such as Ronald Reagan, Richard Nixon, and Gerald \nFord, as well as Democrats, where diplomacy was exhausted before the \nUnited States resorted to military means. We used to understand that \ndiplomacy was the primary means of advancing America's national \nsecurity interests. We used to remember that war is the ultimate \nfailure of diplomacy--and the best way to end it.\n  Unfortunately, our current diplomacy has been almost absent--an \nambassador left to his own devices on the grounds, an occasional fly-in \nvisit from the Secretary of State or the President, but no ongoing \ntalks or shuttle diplomacy. In fact, so much of what we used to take \nfor granted in national security policy has now been called into \nquestion.\n  We used to know that, despite our differences and political \nphilosophies in the Senate--and I remember watching the Senate in those \ndays as a young kid and a student of government--the two great parties \nof this country were able to cooperate to craft international policies \nin our national interest. We used to understand that the unique and \nhistoric role of the United States in world affairs required a \nfarsighted and multifaceted approach to protecting our people and our \ninterests. We used to value as a national treasure the international \nalliances and institutions that enhanced our strength, amplified our \nvoice, and reflected our traditions and ideals in maintaining a free \nand secure world. You can look at the history of the Cold War and what \nWoodrow Wilson tried to do, as well as Franklin Roosevelt, Harry \nTruman, and Dwight Eisenhower, with the Marshall Plan and other efforts \nto bring countries together and to try to honor the effort through \nstatesmanship, to be able to forge viable alliances and peace.\n  We used to say that politics stopped at the water's edge. We used to \ncall on our people to share in the sacrifices demanded by freedom. Our \nleaders used to raise hopes and inspire trust, not raise fears and \ndemand blind faith\n  We used to measure America's strength and security by our moral \nauthority, our economic leadership, and our diplomatic skills all \ntogether, as well as by the power of our military.\n  I want people to stop and think about how much things have changed. \nLast week, one of the most noted, honored columnists in America, New \nYork Times' Tom Friedman, wrote the following. He had just come back \nfrom the Middle East. He wrote his previous book ``From Beirut to \nJerusalem,'' which won a Pulitzer prize:\n\n       Our President and Secretary of State, although they speak \n     with great moral clarity, have no moral authority. That's \n     been shattered by their performance in Iraq.\n\n  That moral authority is something that Presidents struggle to hold \nonto, to nurture and create, through Republican and Democratic \nadministrations alike.\n  I believe the key to any hope of stabilizing Iraq is changing course \nand engaging in sustained diplomacy from the highest levels of \nAmerica's leadership that matches the effort of our soldiers on the \nground.\n  History tells us the results of that kind of effort. In 1995, most \nrecently, there was a brutal civil war in Bosnia involving Serbs, \nCroats, and Muslims. Faced with a seemingly intractable stalemate in \nthe face of horrific ethnic cleansing, the Clinton administration took \naction--I might add, they took action that was opposed by a lot of \npeople on a partisan basis--and led by Richard Holbrooke they brought \nleaders in the Bosnian parties together in Dayton, OH. I know at the \ntime Mr. Yeltsin didn't even want to appear, didn't want to be part of \nit. But it took persuasion and leverage that ultimately helped to bring \nRussia, then the Soviet Union, to the table. They brought leaders of \nthe Bosnian parties together in Dayton, OH, and representatives from \nthe European Union, Russia, and Britain to hammer out a peace agreement \nthat brought relative stability to the region. That is the kind of \neffort we have to engage in if we are\n\n[[Page S8697]]\n\ngoing to secure Iraq and extricate ourselves ultimately.\n  While an international process has begun to bring reconstruction and \neconomic aid to Iraq, a real national compact forged with the support \nof countries in the region, is needed to bring about a political \nsolution to the insurgency and end the cycle of Shia-Sunni violence.\n  This strategy can work. It is the only strategy that ultimately will \nwork. No matter what happens ultimately, the hope of bringing American \ntroops home from Iraq is going to depend on the quality of the \nnegotiating process which leverages a new security arrangement for the \nregion. That is the bottom line. We are not going to be able to leave \nwithout it, and Americans ultimately are going to want to leave.\n  A Dayton-like summit that includes the leaders of the Iraqi \nGovernment, the countries bordering Iraq, the Arab League, NATO, and I \nknow from talking with members--recently I was in Brussels talking with \nmembers of NATO, I talked with people at the United Nations, I talked \nwith people with respect to the Arab League--they are all waiting. They \nare ready to try to do this, but it takes leadership to pull those \nparties together.\n  The fact is, we can enable the Iraqis to engage in the intensive \ndiplomacy to forge a comprehensive political agreement that addresses \nsecurity guarantees, oil revenues, federalism, and disbanding of the \nmilitias, and all the parties would agree on a process for securing \nIraq's borders.\n  These are the key elements of a political agreement necessary to \ndecrease the violence, and they are not the tasks for which U.S. troops \ncan or should be responsible. They are the responsibility of civilian \npersonnel, particularly the Iraqis.\n  Success is going to require the collective effort that engages \nmembers of the international community who share our interest in a \nstable Iraq. To enlist their support, we have to address their concerns \nabout a security arrangement in the region after we have withdrawn from \nIraq. That is why the summit should lay the groundwork for creating a \nnew regional security structure that strengthens countries in the \nregions and the wider community of nations.\n  That, incidentally, is what we should have been doing all of last \nyear under resolution 1559 of the United Nations, when we should have \nbeen dealing with the issue of the disarmament of Hezbollah.\n  I believe--and I think others share this belief--that the only way to \nultimately be successful in Iraq is to lay down a strategy that \nextricates the United States because even our generals have said our \nlarge force presence is a magnet for the terrorists and adds to the \nproblem of the insurgency. So part of the solution is to reduce that \nAmerican presence. I believe if we were to redeploy those forces after \nwe set some responsible timeframes, that is the most effective way to \nproceed.\n  Let me say one or two words in closing. I keep hearing colleagues say \neverybody loves the politics of this, but a lot of young people's lives \nare on the line. They may want to play to the politics of cut and run \nversus stay the course, but that is not what this is about.\n  If you were to adopt a policy that sets some timeframes and \ndeadlines, you still leave the President the discretion to be able to \nkeep certain forces there to complete the training; you leave the \nPresident the discretion to keep forces there to fight al-Qaida; you \nleave the President the discretion to use forces to protect American \nfacilities; and you maintain over-the-horizon ability to protect \nAmerican interests in the region.\n  I think we need to get away from this simplistic sloganeering and get \ninto a real discussion about how one makes Iraq a success and our \npolicy in the region a success. We know that Prime Minister Maliki \nunderstands this, which is why he has talked openl about a timeframe \nfor the reduction of U.S. forces.\n\n  We know that Ambassador Khalilzad and General Casey are discussing \nwith the Iraqi Government the formation of a joint commission to \noutline the terms and conditions of the withdrawal of troops from Iraq. \nWe know Mr. Rubaie has already said there is an ``unofficial `road map' \nto troop reductions that will eventually lead to a total withdrawal of \nU.S. troops.'' And we know that General Casey has drafted a plan for \nsignificantly reducing U.S. troop levels by the end of 2007. And we \nknow that the polls of Iraqis have shown that 87 percent of Iraqis, \nincluding 94 percent Sunnis and 90 percent Shia, support their \nGovernment endorsing a timeline for the withdrawal of U.S. forces.\n  So it seems to me that if the Iraqi Government and the Iraqi people, \nthe Ambassador, the top military commander, and a majority of Americans \ncan see that the time has come for an adequate timeframe to get Iraqis \nto fight for democracy for themselves as much as we have done it for \nthem, why can't the Bush administration?\n  Even as we consider the way forward in Iraq, we obviously can't lose \nsight of what is happening in a war raging on the other side of the \nMiddle East. Watching the news from the Middle East these days is an \nexercise in continual heartbreak as Israel continues military \noperations to defend itself against Hezbollah in Lebanon, and the \nmissiles still rain down on northern Israel.\n  Our hearts go out to people suffering all across the Middle East. We \nall want peace. The death of every child--Lebanese in Qana or Israeli \nin Haifa--is an unspeakable tragedy. But we know from the hard lessons \nof the past that lasting peace is not going to come easily, and it will \nnot come without the kind of sustained involvement at the highest \nlevels of the U.S. Government that, again, as in Iraq, we have not seen \nfrom this administration.\n  In fact, the violence we are seeing now is in part the bitter fruit \nof a number of years of U.S. neglect in the region, neglect which I saw \npersonally when I visited with President Abbas on the West Bank right \nafter he was elected. It is another disastrous byproduct of being \ndistracted and bogged down in Iraq.\n  Our inattention to diplomacy and the failure to disarm Hezbollah and \nstop the flow of weapons from Iran and Syria, as required by U.N. \nresolution 1559, left Israel to respond to this terrorist \norganization's provocations with a bloody war that threatens to spread \ninto a larger conflict.\n  In fact, just a few hours ago, General Abizaid testified that if 1559 \nhad been fully implemented, we wouldn't be in this situation today.\n  It is clear that our compromised position in Iraq, combined with our \ndiplomatic isolation in the region, has reduced our leverage and \nundermined our ability to bring about the lasting resolution that is so \ndesperately needed.\n  Obviously, the people of Israel can count on the stalwart support of \nthe United States during these difficult times. At the same time, the \nLebanese people must know that Americans also care deeply about \nprotecting innocent civilians and preserving their fragile democracy. \nThat is why we have to work urgently to achieve a viable and \nsustainable peace agreement that includes an international force \ncapable of ensuring Israel's security and Lebanon's complete \nterritorial sovereignty, the return of the kidnapped Israeli soldiers, \nand the permanent removal of the threat caused and posed by Hezbollah.\n  Given these dire circumstances, it is imperative that we do \neverything in our power to accomplish this as soon as possible and, Mr. \nPresident, we should not be afraid of talking to any country that will \nhelp us advance this objective, and that includes Syria and Iran. But \nthat cannot be the end of our involvement. In fact, it has to be the \nbeginning of a new--entirely new--more significant, greater Middle East \ninitiative that we undertake in order to create the kind of sustained \ndiplomatic engagement in the region that is the only way to resolve \nthese crises.\n  The unmistakable lesson is that we need more than crisis diplomacy; \nwe need preventive diplomacy--a preventive diplomacy in the best \ntraditions of our country that addresses the underlying problems before \nthey explode. That means putting an end, once and for all, to state \nsponsorship of terrorism. And that requires a renewed commitment to \nwork ceaselessly to achieve a lasting peace in the Middle East.\n  I yield the floor, and I thank my colleagues for their graciousness. \nI suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S8698]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4853\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, there is a lot of news south of \nFlorida, 90 miles from Key West. We don't know the condition of Fidel \nCastro. Clearly, there is obviously a major medical problem and, for \ndays now, Raoul Castro, his brother, has been invisible. Even though \nthe Cuban Government released information which said President Castro \nhad ended up going in for intestinal surgery, basically, we just don't \nknow. But what we do know is he is 79, going on 80, and we do know that \nnone of us are immortal and, therefore, what we know is that there are \na limited number of days of this totalitarian regime, and then there is \ngoing to be a transition to something else.\n  Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4853.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendment? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Nelson] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4853.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 4853\n\n(Purpose: To appropriate funds for a Cuba Fund for a Democratic Future \n               to promote democratic transition in Cuba)\n\n       On page 238, after line 24, insert the following:\n     That the following sums are appropriated, out of any money in \n     the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 2007, for functions administered by the \n     Secretary of State and for other purposes, namely:\n\n                                TITLE X\n\n                   CUBA FUND FOR A DEMOCRATIC FUTURE\n\n       Sec. 10001.(a) To promote a transition to a democratic form \n     of government in Cuba, $40,000,000.\n       (b) The amount provided under this heading is designated as \n     an emergency requirement pursuant to section 402 of S. Con. \n     Res. 83 (109th Congress), the concurrent resolution on the \n     budget for fiscal year 2007, as made applicable in the Senate \n     by section 7035 of Public Law 109-234.\n       (c) The amounts provided under this heading shall be \n     deposited into a fund to be known as the Cuba Fund for a \n     Democratic Future which is hereby established in the Treasury \n     of the United States.\n       (d) The amounts provided under this heading shall be \n     available to the Secretary of State, in consultation with the \n     United States Cuba Transition Coordinator, to carry out \n     activities to empower the people of Cuba and the democratic \n     opposition in Cuba to take advantage of opportunities to \n     promote a transition to a democratic form of government in \n     Cuba, including activities--\n       (1) to support an independent civil society in Cuba;\n       (2) to expand international awareness of Cuba's democratic \n     aspirations;\n       (3) to break the information blockade put in place by the \n     regime of Fidel Castro in Cuba, including activities to \n     promote access to independent information through the \n     Internet and other sources;\n       (4) to provide for education and exchanges for the people \n     of Cuba, including university training from third countries \n     and scholarships for economically disadvantaged students from \n     Cuba identified by independent nongovernmental entities and \n     civic organizations in United States and third country \n     universities (including historically-black and faith-based \n     institutions); and\n       (5) to support international efforts to strengthen civil \n     society and in transition planning in Cuba.\n       (e) If the President determines that there exists either a \n     transition government in Cuba or a democratically elected \n     government in Cuba, as those terms are defined in section 4 \n     of the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity (LIBERTAD) Act \n     of 1996 (22 U.S.C. 6023) and submits that determination to \n     Congress in accordance with section 203(c) of that Act (22 \n     U.S.C. 6063), then the funds made available for the Cuba Fund \n     for a Democratic Future may be used, at the discretion of the \n     Secretary of State in accordance with the guidelines set out, \n     respectively, in subsection (b)(2)(A) or (b)(2)(B) of section \n     202 of that Act (22 U.S.C. 6062).\n       (f) The Secretary of State shall ensure that none of the \n     funds made available in this section or any assistance \n     carried out with such funds are provided to the Government of \n     Cuba.\n       (g) Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment \n     of this Act, and every 180 days thereafter until all amounts \n     made available to the Cuba Fund for a Democratic Future are \n     expended, the Secretary of State shall submit to the \n     Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the \n     Committee on International Relations of the House of \n     Representatives a report describing the Secretary's progress \n     in obligating and expending such funds and that such reports \n     may be submitted in a classified form and the Secretary of \n     State shall publish any unclassified portions of each such \n     report.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, now is the time that if the \nUnited States were to supply some direct financial assistance to \ndissidents, it could start to have a salutary and immediate effect on \nwhat is happening on the island. Clearly there is going to be a \ntransition; we just don't know when that transition is going to come. \nWhat we hope is it is going to be a transition ultimately to a \ndemocratic government.\n  The news this week marks an opportunity that we have been \nanticipating for decades. We can only hope that it is a real \nopportunity for the Cuban people to move forward, leaving behind a \ndictatorship and the repression they have\n\n[[Page S8699]]\n\nexperienced for a half century. But we must remind ourselves that the \ntrue celebration is going to come on the day that the Cuban people have \na democratically elected government of their own choosing.\n  While it seems that we are one step closer toward our shared goal, we \nshould remind ourselves of the need to continue our support for the \ntrue Cuban heroes: the brave dissidents who struggle every day to \ndemand and to plead for the very basic human rights, including the \nability to read what they want to read, to say what they want to say, \nto live where they want to live, and to study what they want to study--\nthings that we take for granted in this country, but where, only 90 \nmiles from Key West, people do not have those freedoms.\n  These heroes in Cuba don't win medals. They are not honored in \nceremonies. Instead, Castro throws them in jail for decades after show \ntrials in kangaroo courts. Their families are harassed, denied \nemployment and other basic necessities. Those who are not thrown in \nprison are greeted regularly by mobs of government thugs who threaten \nand embarrass them in front of their neighbors. As recently as a few \nmonths ago, one of those mobs attacked and beat Marta Beatriz Roque, a \nprominent dissident who advocates for democracy on the island.\n  These are the people who every day choose to fight for democracy \nthrough simple acts of defiance. They risk their limited freedom by \ncontinuing to mobilize and speak out for the basic rights that every \nhuman being deserves. They run independent libraries. They \nclandestinely write stories for illegal independent press. They pass \nalong information to their neighbors or they very bravely sign \npetitions calling for democracy.\n  You will recall a few years back, even under the Cuban constitution, \nthat 10,000 people signed a petition, petitioning for the basic right \nof going in front of the Congress to fight for basic freedoms and \neconomic freedom. Mr. President, 11,000 very brave souls signed that \npetition, and many of them have been harassed.\n  Now, we here in the United States continue to support the brave \nCubans who struggle every day to fight for democracy and basic human \nrights. Despite the regime's attempt to silence them, the work of these \nbrave dissidents becomes even more important as the opportunity to \nfoster a real transition in Cuba gets closer and closer, and those \nbrave Cubans, those dissidents, will be the catalyst that pushes any \npost-Fidel government toward democracy.\n  Let me say that again. Those brave dissidents will be the catalyst \nthat pushes any government after Fidel toward democracy. Therefore, it \nis more important now than ever that we support the dissidents and the \nactivists in Cuba through direct financial support.\n  Senator Ensign, who is in the Chair, Senator Martinez, all of us have \nintroduced the Cuban Transition Act of 2006, and that includes the \nSenate majority leader as one of the cosponsors. This legislation will \nauthorize such funds to directly support dissidents in Cuba. Now, that \nhas been filed. We are trying to get it hotlined. There are some \nSenators I understand on both sides of the aisle who have objected to \nbringing it up, so what we will do is continue to work with them over \nAugust to see if we can get agreement.\n  Mr. President, amendment No. 4853 which I have just offered \nappropriates $40 million in emergency money to support the efforts of \ndissidents in Cuba. It is important that at this time we send a clear \nmessage of support and commitment to the Cuban people as they continue \ntheir struggle. We will continue this support to the people of Cuba \nuntil the day they have a free democratic government that respects \nhuman rights.\n  The overall bill that we filed which we are going to have to work on \nover August would authorize, over 2 years, $40 million. We already send \nstuff--goods. However, under current law, we do not send money to the \ndissidents to encourage them. So using the Defense appropriations bill \nas a vehicle is very timely. It is to promote in transition a \ndemocratic form of government in Cuba, and the appropriation would be \n$40 million.\n  Now, you wonder under this amendment: What would be some of the \nactivities that would be supported? For example, to support an \nindependent civil society in Cuba, to expand international awareness of \nCuba's democratic aspirations, to break the information blockade put in \nplace by the regime of Fidel, including activities to promote access to \nindependent information through the Internet and other sources; to \nprovide for education and exchanges for the people of Cuba, including \nuniversity training from third countries and scholarships for \neconomically disadvantaged students from Cuba that are identified by \nindependent, nongovernmental entities and civic organizations in the \nUnited States and third-country universities. Another activity would be \nto support international efforts to strengthen civil society in the \ntransition planning in Cuba.\n  If the President of the United States determines that there exists \neither a transitional government in Cuba or a democratically elected \ngovernment in Cuba, as those terms are already defined in the statutes, \nand he submits that determination to Congress, then the funds made \navailable may be used at the discretion of the Secretary in accordance \nwith set guidelines. The Secretary of State shall ensure that none of \nthe funds made available in this section are provided to the Government \nof Cuba.\n  So the intent of this legislation, while the island of Cuba is front \nand center in the eyes of the world, is for the United States to take a \nstrong stand and start providing some assistance so that those brave \npeople--the dissidents in Cuba--can look forward to the day of a \ndemocratically elected government. I and my colleagues all look forward \nto that day.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I certainly understand the position of \nthe Senator from Florida. Reluctantly, I raise a point of order that \nthis is legislation on the appropriations bill, and so it is in \nviolation of rule XVI. There is also a budget point of order, but I \nbelieve that is sufficient.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is sustained, and the \namendment falls.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4858\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4858, and I ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendment? Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4858.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds by the United States Government \n   to enter into an agreement with the Government of Iraq that would \n    subject members of the Armed Forces to the jurisdiction of Iraq \n             criminal courts or punishment under Iraq law)\n\n       At the end of title VIII, add the following:\n       Sec. 8109. No funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by this Act may be used by the Government of the \n     United States to enter into an agreement with the Government \n     of Iraq that would subject members of the Armed Forces of the \n     United States to the jurisdiction of Iraq criminal courts or \n     punishment under Iraq law.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nLindsey Graham be added as the principal cosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am very pleased with that. I am very pleased he is \nhere. I am also very pleased there appears to be good support for this \namendment. We are going to have a record vote because we both believe \nit is very important to send a loud and clear message about the subject \nof this amendment.\n  This amendment ensures that no funds in this bill will be used to \nenter into an agreement with the Government of Iraq that would subject \nU.S.\n\n[[Page S8700]]\n\nmilitary forces in any way to the jurisdiction of Iraqi criminal courts \nor punishment under Iraqi law.\n  I think it is very important that we all understand that U.S. \nmilitary forces are governed by law. They must comply with the Uniform \nCode of Military Justice, and they must comply with the Geneva \nConventions. But, currently, U.S. military forces are immune from \nIraq's legal system, and Senator Graham and I want to make sure that \nthis will continue to be the case.\n  This policy was set by the Coalition Provisional Authority, Order No. \n17, and it is supported by U.N. Security Council Resolution 1546. But \nhere is the reason we think it is important for us to speak out, \nhopefully, with a uniform voice today. Last month, Prime Minister Nuri \nal-Maliki said this policy should change. He is the Prime Minister of \nIraq. He said:\n\n       We believe that the immunity given to international forces \n     is what emboldens them to commit such crimes in cold blood. \n     This requires that such immunity should be reconsidered.\n\n  So the Prime Minister said that this immunity from his laws ought to \nbe reconsidered. It seems, in a difficult time in Iraq--and Lord knows \nwe won't get into all of it--where there is disagreement among the \nfactions there, everyone seems to agree that, in fact, changing this \npolicy to ensure that American troops are under the Iraqi court's \njurisdiction is a good idea. They think it is a good idea. We do not, \nand we want to make sure it does not happen.\n  Prime Minister Maliki also suggested that the Iraqi Parliament review \nthe policy of immunity for American troops. Let's look at what the \nIraqi Parliament is saying about U.S. troops.\n  I want to make sure we understand. It is not every member of the \nParliament but some members of the Iraqi Parliament. And let's keep in \nmind we have lost in excess of 2,500 troops there. They are gone, never \nto come home again. Every day, sadly--it feels like every day--I have \nto write a condolence letter to someone who lost a son or daughter. We \nnow have in excess of 19,000 wounded. We know that we have a third of \nour soldiers coming back in the first year seeking mental health help. \nWe know we have a lot of our soldiers experiencing post-traumatic \nstress. We have given, and taxpayers are still giving--it is the gift \nthat keeps on giving--money, billions of dollars, and the lives of our \nsoldiers, and wounded soldiers--all the rest.\n  So when we hear the Speaker of the Iraqi Parliament Mahmoud al-\nMashhadani say, ``The U.S. occupation is butcher's work under the \nslogan of democracy, human rights and justice''--and this is someone \nwho was part of the government, was part of the package when they put \ntogether that government--when we hear those words, we not only take \ntremendous offense at those words, we not only get sick about those \nwords, whether we supported this war or voted against it, we want to \nmake sure that not one of our soldiers comes under the jurisdiction of \nan Iraqi court with political statements behind it like that.\n  Let me tell you what else the Speaker of the Iraqi Parliament said. \nHe called for statues to be built for those who kill American soldiers, \nsaying:\n\n       I personally think whoever kills an American soldier in \n     defense of his country should have a statue built for him in \n     that country.\n\n  This makes me sick, to think that we are still there, year after year \nafter year. Now, in my opinion--and I certainly do not speak for \nsomeone else when I say this--in this increasingly hostile situation, \none that a British leader said was essentially a civil war, imagine us \nturning over our soldiers to the Iraqi courts when the Speaker of the \nParliament, who was part of the Government of Iraq, says:\n\n       Whoever kills an American soldier in defense of his country \n     should have a statue built for him in that country.\n\n  Then you have Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, the leader of the dominant Shiite \nblock in Parliament, who called for granting an amnesty for insurgents \nwho had fought against Americans in Iraq--in other words, an amnesty \nfor those who hurt our soldiers--but we should allow our solders, who \nare fighting for their freedom, to go before an Iraqi court? No way. No \nway. That is why this amendment is so important today, and I am so \npleased that Senator Graham and I have agreed on this.\n  I voted not to go to war. I am working as hard as I can to start \nbringing our troops home. Senator Graham has different views on this \nwhich he will express. But on the issue of our troops being tried in an \nIraqi court system, we are in full agreement.\n  This amendment is necessary because on July 6, the Washington Post \nreported:\n\n       An Iraqi government official, who spoke on the condition \n     that he not be named, said Mr. Maliki hoped to revise Order \n     No. 17 when the United Nations resolution authorizing the \n     presence of American forces in Iraq is up for renewal at the \n     end of the year.\n\n  Of course, that order is the order I referred to at the beginning of \nmy comments which protects our troops from being tried in an Iraqi \ncourt.\n  It is critical that Congress be heard on this issue. I am very \nhopeful that we will be heard loud and clear, and I am expecting that \nwe will.\n  Senator Graham and I also agree that those who commit crimes have to \nbe held accountable for their crimes. Of course we do. But as I said \nbefore, there is the Uniform Code of Military Justice and there are the \nGeneva Conventions. Our people must be held accountable for their \nactions, but we cannot subject our men and women in uniform to an Iraqi \njudicial system that is in chaos and, frankly, an Iraqi country that is \nin chaos.\n  Iraq's own Deputy Justice Minister has admitted that Iraqi prisons \nare overrun with Shiite Muslim militiamen who have freed fellow members \nconvicted of major crimes and have executed Sunni Arab inmates. In \nBasra, it was reported that militia members took 12 foreign-born \nprisoners from their cells and shot them in the head. One Iraqi \nparliamentarian has said he saw as many as 120 detainees packed into a \n35-by-20-foot cell, many who claimed they had been raped and their \nfamilies tortured. We are not going to have Americans in any way get \nclose to that situation over there.\n  U.S. personnel must not be subjected to the Iraqi legal system, \nespecially when you consider that under Iraq's constitution, experts in \nIslamic jurisprudence can sit on the supreme court even if they have no \ntraining in civil law or other relevant subjects. The U.S. Commission \non International Religious Freedom reports that ``such limited training \nplaces Iraq's supreme court requirements alongside those of \nAfghanistan, Saudi Arabia, and Iran.'' We are not going to let our \nsoldiers get close to that.\n  Everyone on both sides--all of us, whether we are for this war or \nagainst this war--voted yes. We all pray and hope that some day in Iraq \nthere will be a governing body that will bring order, that will bring \ndemocracy, that will be respected, and we all hope things don't go in a \nbad direction. But I tell you today that my view is it is very tough \nover there. I just told you about some of the things that are happening \nin their criminal justice system. We can't allow U.S. military \npersonnel to be subjected to Iraq's legal system.\n  Just this morning, GEN John Abizaid told the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee that ``sectarian violence is probably as bad as I have seen \nit.'' He said that today in the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  It was reported today that the outgoing British Ambassador to Iraq \nwrote a confidential memo to Prime Minister Tony Blair saying that \n``the prospect of a low intensity civil war and a de facto division of \nIraq is probably more likely at this stage than a successful and \nsubstantial transition to a stable democracy.'' That is a very \ndisheartening thing for the American people to hear.\n  Things are very tough--as tough as they have ever been in Iraq. This \nis certainly not the time to leave any impression out there whatsoever \nthat this is the time we could say that our soldiers would be somehow \ntrapped inside the Iraqi legal system.\n  The Boxer-Graham amendment makes common sense. U.S. military \npersonnel must be held accountable for their actions, but not by the \nIraqi Government, by the U.S. Code of Military Justice, by the Geneva \nConventions.\n  I am very proud to be working with my friend on this issue. I yield \nthe floor and hope that at this time, he would be recognized to make \nhis comments as to why we have come together on this important \namendment\n\n[[Page S8701]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California, Mrs. \nBoxer, for bringing this amendment to the floor at a very important \ntime in our relationship with Iraq.\n  In relation to Iraq and as to what people in Iraq in political office \nhave said, you can't judge everyone in the country by the statement of \none political leader, but the fact that a political leader said the \nthings that Senator Boxer has just described is unnerving.\n  I would like the Iraqi people to know that when it comes to \ndisciplining American service men and women serving overseas, we are a \nnation committed to following the rule of law and that we have status \nof forces agreements with Germany, Japan, and other countries where our \ntroops have been stationed for decades. Under those status of forces \nagreements, we have an agreement with a host country that if a military \nman or woman commits a crime, the United States will retain \njurisdiction to prosecute that person who is a military member under \nthe Uniform Code of Military Justice.\n  I served in Germany for 4\\1/2\\ years and prosecuted many cases where \nAmerican service men and women committed crimes against German \nnationals and civilians in general, and I can assure you that the \nAmerican military takes very seriously misconduct by its own.\n  This idea that Prime Minister Maliki suggests that immunity has been \ngiven to international forces is, quite frankly, wrong. There is no \nimmunity for an American service man or woman from prosecution for \ncrimes committed in Iraq. But we have an understanding and an agreement \nat this point in time that when the prosecutions are had, we will do \nthem. We will be the ones responsible for disciplining our troops, just \nas we do in almost every other country throughout the world. The idea \nthat the U.S. military will retain jurisdiction over crimes committed \nby service men and women in foreign lands is nothing new. It is the \nnormal course of business.\n  Given some of the rhetoric coming out of Iraq, it is very important \nthat we need to reaffirm that we will be there to help the Iraqi people \nachieve democracy, if that is what they want, and to gain their \nfreedom. We have lost 2,500 lives and have been spent $400 billion. So \nAmerica is very serious about helping the Iraqi people. But we need to \nbe serious--the Senate, the House, and the administration--we need to \nunderstand that as part of our commitment to the Iraqi people, there is \nno need or requirement for us to turn over jurisdiction regarding our \nsoldiers' conduct to the legal system in Iraq. That would be a mistake. \nWe don't do it in any other place, nor should we do it in Iraq.\n  I can assure you that when people have engaged in misconduct in Iraq \nand we have found out about it, the soldier, airman, sailor, marine, or \nwhoever is involved is given a trial under the Uniform Code of Military \nJustice, they are provided a vigorous defense, and the trial is \nsomething I think we should be proud of in terms of the legal \nprocedures in the military. But when found guilty, they are severely \npunished. There are a lot of high-profile cases now, alleging murder \nand rape, against U.S. service men and women, and they will be \nprosecuted to the fullest extent of the law because we as a nation \nbelieve very deeply in the rule of law.\n  Those who serve in the military believe very much in duty, honor, and \ncountry. When a service member commits a crime while wearing the \nuniform, it is a stain on all those who wear the uniform. That is why \nthe military comes down so hard on misconduct by our own, because you \ncannot win a war without good order and discipline.\n  I can assure the Iraqi people and every other nation where we have \ntroops stationed that when our troops misbehave and commit crimes, \nwhich happens in any society, we take the obligation to punish those \npeople seriously, and at the same time making sure they have a full and \nfair trial.\n  I join the Senator from California. I urge every Member of this body \nto get on record now before these treaties have to be renegotiated and \nget ahead of this rhetoric to let everyone know that we are going to be \nin Iraq trying to help the cause of freedom, but we are not going to \nturn our soldiers and military personnel over to a legal system that \nis, quite frankly, not very mature yet. We have never done it in any \nother country. There is no need do it.\n  We can with a great deal of assurance tell the Iraqi people--\npoliticians included--that we have a great track record of having \npeople stationed all over the world for decades and that track record \nis that when our people engage in misconduct found to have been proven \nin a court law, they are severely punished. I can assure every Iraqi \ncitizen that if something goes wrong on our watch by our military, we \nwill handle it. We have a great track record of handling it. But under \nno circumstances, in my opinion, should we ever go down the road of \nchanging the rules that now exist. It would be unwise for this Nation \nto abandon what has worked for over 50 years; that is, retaining \njurisdiction over misconduct by military members serving abroad. We \nhave a system that works and, quite frankly, I do not want to change \nthat because the men and women in Iraq have enough to worry about. They \ndo not need to be worried about some court in some province that is not \nreally well constituted coming after one of them.\n  I yield the floor and urge an absolute 100-to-0 vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, in behalf of the managers of the bill, we \nhave no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote \noccur at 4 o'clock.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I hope you \ncould modify the request--that no second-degree amendments be \npermitted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request, as amended?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, in the meantime, I suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I will speak to the Defense appropriations \nbill which is before the Senate and discuss the war in Iraq in the \ncontext of this bill.\n  This bill includes $50 billion for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nEarlier this week, we added another $13.1 billion for emergency funding \nfor the Army and Marine Corps to repair and replace badly needed \nequipment. I supported these additional funds and I support this bill.\n  I have this vision in my mind of our soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan \ndriving down those dusty roads wondering if a bomb is going to explode, \nand I think about us in the safety of this Senate Chamber here at home. \nI think to myself, if it were my son or daughter in uniform serving our \ncountry, risking their lives, would I want them to have everything \npossible to come home safely? The answer is very obvious.\n  Although I had great misgivings about the decision which led us into \nthis war in Iraq. I was one of 23 Senators from both sides of the aisle \nwho voted against the authorization of force that initiated this war. \nMy belief at the time as a Member of the Senate Intelligence Committee \nwas that the American people were not being given the full story, they \nwere not being given the facts.\n  We were told that Iraq was a great threat to the United States with \nweapons of mass destruction and nuclear weapons. We were told that \nthere was some connection between September 11 and al-Qaida terrorism \nand Saddam Hussein and Iraq. It turned out that none of those things \nwere true. It was also very obvious from the outset, as we initiated \nthis war in Iraq and invaded this country, we did it with the valued \nassistance of the United Kingdom and many other countries, but the \nburden fell on American soldiers, marines, airmen, and sailors more \nthan\n\n[[Page S8702]]\n\nany others, and the burden fell on American taxpayers and American \nfamilies more than any others.\n  So now we are in the fifth year of this war. We have been briefed \nfrom time to time about the progress we are making, and there are \npositive things which we should not overlook. Saddam Hussein is gone. \nHe was rooted out of a hole in the ground. He is being held for trial. \nThat is certainly a positive thing in the history of this world. We \nalso know that the Iraqi people have been given an opportunity which no \none might have dreamed of a few years ago, to have free elections and \nto elect their own government. That is a very positive thing. Of \ncourse, the courage of individual Iraqi citizens as well as the courage \nof our soldiers is an inspiration to all of us as we consider this \nsituation.\n  But we have to say, if we are honest and objective, that the \nsituation in Iraq is far from peaceful, it is far from stable. Mr. \nPresident, 2,585 American soldiers have given their lives in this \nbattle, over 100 of them from my home State of Illinois. Almost 20,000 \nof these soldiers have returned home seriously injured, many of them \namputees, 2,000 of them with serious head injuries. Their lives will be \nquite different because of their service to our country and because of \ntheir experience in this war.\n  We have spent some $320 billion on this war. We are spending at the \nrate of $3 billion a week on the war in Iraq. We are cutting back on \nspending in our own home budget for things as varied as aid to \neducation, money for our schools, cutting back at the National \nInstitutes of Health for medical research, cutting back in so many \nareas because war takes money away from a country that might spend it \nat home. That is the reality of what we face.\n  We know the funds in this bill will not carry our military through \nthe year 2007. The President and Secretary of Defense continue to send \nus so-called emergency bills which are supposed to be reserved for \nunanticipated surprise expenses. That is how we funded the war in Iraq, \nwhich is now going into its fifth year. These are certainly not \nunanticipated expenses. We know a war costs, and it costs greatly.\n  There are the short-term costs of war, the $320 billion price tag, \nbut there are other costs that will be with us for a long time. A \nPulitzer Prize-winning economist has estimated that the cost of medical \ntreatment for veterans with brain injuries from the Iraqi war will be \nat least $14 billion over the next 20 years. To date, 1,700 of these \nsoldiers have returned with serious traumatic brain injury. In a recent \ncalculation of 115 soldiers who were exposed to blast injuries, such as \nIEDs, 62 of the 115 had some form of a traumatic brain injury.\n  It means, of course, in the most serious cases, extensive surgery and \nrehabilitation in an effort to get back to a normal life. It means in \nsome other cases that they will lapse into epileptic seizures that will \nneed to be carefully watched and treated for many years to come. This \nnumber, $14 billion for the next 20 years for brain injurie alone \nassociated with the war in Iraq, tells us that we will pay, as these \nsoldiers and their families will pay, for a long time to come.\n\n  The numbers I have given do not include the billions of dollars which \nwe will need to repair and replace equipment for the Active-Duty units \nand the National Guard and Reserve. LTG Steven Blum of the National \nGuard bureau said:\n\n       Today, here at home, I have less than 34 percent of the \n     equipment I'm supposed to have.\n\n  In my hometown of Springfield, IL, I visited the National Guard at \nthe Camp Lincoln facility. I looked at their empty parking lot: 85 \npercent of our Guard units in Illinois have been over at least once. \nThey have run this equipment into the ground, and they have left a lot \nof it behind; it was just worn out. In a war, equipment is burned up at \nfour or five times the normal rate. I can understand that. They are \nracing to make sure they are safe, and it takes its a toll on vehicles \nand equipment.\n  They come home now to find empty parking lots and empty equipment \nlockers. Our National Guard units do not have the equipment they need \nto train to be ready if called up again. They do not have the equipment \nthey need to respond to homegrown emergencies, whether it is a flood or \na situation they need to be there for. Many of them have to beg, \nborrow, and scratch to find what they need.\n  According to Army officials, two-thirds of the Army's active brigades \nare not ready for war. There is substantial criticism of previous \nPresidents that we had a hollowed-out Army, an Army in name only, that \nwouldn't be there if we needed it. Now the Army is being very \nforthright and saying, yes, we have paid a heavy toll, not just in \nlives--and that is the most important thing--but in training and \nreadiness and basic equipment.\n  The Army currently estimates that it needs $17 billion to address \nthese readiness needs. The Marine Corps needs between $12 and $15 \nbillion. General Blum reports the National Guard is ``even further \nbehind and even a more dire situation than the active Army. . . .We \nboth have the same symptoms but [the Guard] has a higher fever.''\n  The National Guard's budget problems will only grow worse if the \nadministration's plans are followed. The Army National Guard currently \nhas 340,000 members, and it is working to recruit up to 350,000. There \nwas a time in the Persian Gulf war when National Guard units and \nReserve units were almost shunned. The regular Army said: Leave them at \nhome. We will take a few of them, but we will do the job. We will tell \nyou if we need you. It did not take long in Iraq and Afghanistan for \nour regular Army to understand they needed the National Guard and \nReserve and needed it desperately. The Department of Defense budget \nonly plans to fund 324,000 guardsmen over the next 5 years when we know \nwe will need 350,000. That is something we should face more \nrealistically.\n  The men and women in our military and their families give everything \nwe could possibly ask of them. I cannot tell you how many times I have \nbeen to sendoffs and welcome homes in Illinois for Guard and Reserve \nunits. I cannot tell you what it is like unless you have been there to \nstand there with mom and dad in tears watching their soldier, whom they \nlove so much and respect so much, off to war. It is a story that has \nbeen repeated many times in the history of our Nation, but it never \ngets easy for that family sending off someone they dearly love.\n  In my home State of Illinois, 85 percent of our Guard units have been \nmobilized in the last 3 years and many have gone more than once. Of the \n34 percent of the Illinois Guard equipment that has not been deployed, \n10 percent has been deemed unacceptable due to age and lack of parts \nand inadequate armor protection. These dire equipment shortages \nundercut the Guard unit's ability to train and be prepared.\n  Our guardsmen, God bless them, will find a way to serve. They will \nmake do. They will scratch it together and they will answer the call. \nThey always do. But we know what has happened. We have had soldiers \nstand up and say publicly: We have been digging through landfills to \nfind armor to try to protect ourselves. Things are getting better. \nThere are improvements. The humvees which we are now sending are \narmored up, at least to the latest threat that we face, even though the \nthreat seems to change and grow by the day.\n  Our soldiers deserve the best. They deserve planning and decision \nmaking at the highest levels of Government that respects their \nsacrifice and provides the resources they need to fulfill their \nmissions. We underestimated the cost of this war, it is clear. We \noverestimated the danger of Iraq to the United States. That is clear. \nWe underestimated the insurgency which now threatens our troops. We \nunderestimated the civil war which now appears to be breaking out. Six \nthousand civilians have died in the last 2 months in Iraq. We are \nperilously close to a civil war situation. And our soldiers, our \nAmerican soldiers, are caught in the middle of this deadly crossfire in \nIraq.\n  I am afraid that this civil war is underway, and I am afraid it is \nnot ours to win. This is a war that the Government and people of Iraq \nmust deal with. They have to find a way to end the sectarian violence, \nto reign in the murderous militias. Baghdad, when I visited a year and \na half ago, was the central point for American protection and security. \nWe were hurried from the airport by convoy, first by helicopter\n\n[[Page S8703]]\n\nand then by convoy, into the so-called green zone, an old palace of \nSaddam Hussein's which is guarded in three our four different \nperimeters to make sure it was safe--and still it was not. There we \nhave not only our personnel from the embassy and important decision \nmakers at the highest level of the military but a lot of soldiers, a \nlot of marines, and a lot of sailors. Baghdad, that was the central \nplace, the central point of our effort for security in Iraq.\n  Now, unfortunately, the security in that city has deteriorated \ndramatically, deteriorated to the point where we need thousands more \nAmerican soldiers, not to mention Iraqi soldiers, to move in and make \nit safe.\n  At some point in this terrible situation, there will be a tipping \npoint when the forces of chaos and hatred will gain the upper hand in \nIraq. I hope it hasn't been reached yet. I am afraid if we don't change \ncourse and the Iraqi Government doesn't change course, we will.\n  I understand we have a vote scheduled for 4 o'clock, so I conclude by \nsaying I will support this bill. Although I question the policy that \nbrought us to this point, although I question this administration's \nplan to bring an end to this war in Iraq, my questions cannot be at the \nexpense of shortchanging our troops. We must have the courage and \nvision to chart the right course so that the Iraqis stand up and defend \ntheir own country and that American soldiers start to come home with \ntheir mission truly accomplished.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who seeks time?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this is a simple amendment. This is \ntransparency. This is about adding an amendment to this bill that says \nthe earmarks we put in, we know where they go. They are transparent. We \nknow who did them, and we know who gets the money. It allows the \nDefense Department to look at them in comparison to what the overall \nmission of the Defense Department is. It talks about the cost of \nadministering the earmarks, assessment of the utility of the earmarks, \nand it is something the American people ought to see. We know some \nearmarks are great for the Department of Defense, but we also know some \nare terrible. We ought to be evaluating the pertinency and the value of \nthose earmarks, and we ought to know whether they are valuable at a \ntime when we are having trouble funding the war.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, for the information of Senators, after \nthe vote on this amendment, Senator Sessions will offer his amendment \nwhich deals with the conventional Trident modification, a very serious \namendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the vote on this amendment be limited to \n10 minutes. I say to the Senate this amendment is on the Defense \nauthorization bill. I urged the Senator to accept a voice vote, but the \nSenator requested a vote. So I request a vote now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS.

The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, since I have been a U.S. Senator, I have \nbeen an advocate of what is known as the tip credit. I have always \nurged for the tip credit to be included in increases in the minimum \nwage. In no way have I done this to try to lower someone's wage, but to \ntry to help employers and restaurants to keep their doors open and \nincrease job growth.\n  We are debating, among other things, the minimum wage-death tax \ncompromise. It has come to my attention\n\n[[Page S8705]]\n\nthat some of our friends in the Chamber are trying to construe the tip \ncredit in a way that I believe is very tortured and, frankly, very \nwrong. So I have come to the Chamber today to try to explain and \nalleviate anybody's fears as to what the effect of this law is to be.\n  Let me make clear what the language of the bill is. It says:\n\n       A worker cannot be paid less than the cash wage paid such \n     employee which is required under such law, ordinance, \n     regulation, or order on the date of enactment.\n\n  So what employees are receiving under their State laws is what they \nwill continue to receive. As a minimum wage increase goes into effect, \nthe current wage level will be the floor. If a State, such as my State \nof Oregon, currently has a minimum wage of $7.50 an hour, this amount \nwill be the wage the employee receives. No one's wage will go decrease. \nYet, some are suggesting that if a State does act, or if a court \nmisunderstands the statute, then tipped employees' wages will be \nlowered. That is not the intent of this tip credit provision.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider the tip credit for the employee for \nwhom we are raising this minimum and for their employer, who is simply \ntrying to comply with this law.\n  In my experience, when the executive agrees to the content of a law, \nthe legislature drafts it, and the affected stakeholders agree with it, \nthen that is what becomes law. At this time, some continue to want to \nmisrepresent what the tip credit is. For that reason, I would like to \ninclude two letters with my statement. The first letter is by the U.S. \nDepartment of Labor and the second letter is from the National \nRestaurant Association. We are all saying the same thing, \nnotwithstanding the efforts of others to try to defeat this compromise \nbill by distorting what the tip credit means.\n  The U.S. Department of Labor's Director of Wage and Hour Division has \nwritten to the majority leader stating the following:\n\n       The Wage and Hour Division would read Section 402 as \n     protecting the current minimum wages of the tipped employees \n     in the seven States that now exclude a tipped employee's tips \n     from being considered as wages because to do otherwise would \n     be inconsistent with what we understand to be the intent of \n     Congress and the Fair Labor Standards Act, which the Wage and \n     Hour Division enforces.\n\n  If a Republican administration is saying we will not reduce anyone's \nwages, I don't believe a Democratic administration would. A Republican \nHouse of Representatives has applied the same interpretation to the tip \ncredit provision, and I believe a vast majority of the Senate would \nagree with the House's interpretation.\n  But what about those affected by the tip provision, the ones who pay \nthe wages? This is a statement from John Gay, the senior vice president \nfor government affairs and public policy, of the National Restaurant \nAssociation. He writes:\n\n       The tip credit provision in the minimum wage bill protects \n     employee wages at their current level. No provision results \n     in the lowering of wages for any worker. The purpose of the \n     provision is to allow employers with tipped employees to \n     count their employees' tips as wages for purposes of meeting \n     their minimum wage obligation. There are 43 States that allow \n     this practice now. The tip credit provision in the minimum \n     wage bill allows the other seven--\n\n  We are talking about seven States, Oregon being one of them--\n\n     allows the other seven States to do so. In those seven \n     States, employers would only be permitted a tip credit once \n     their State minimum wage is raised in the future. For \n     example, the minimum wage is currently $7.50 per hour in \n     Oregon. If the current Federal minimum wage bill passed and \n     was signed into law, the State wage would remain at $7.50--\n\n  It wouldn't drop to $7.10, it would remain at $7.50--\n\n     until the State legislature or inflation increases the \n     State's minimum wage in the future. If the State minimum wage \n     was increased $1, to $8.50, only then would the employers be \n     permitted a tip credit of the amount of the minimum wage \n     increase.\n\n  I have never understood the belief of some that you can love \nemployees and hate employers, but that seems to be what is driving this \nattempt to misrepresent the tip credit. We are trying to be fair to \nemployees. We are trying to help employers to continue to retain and \ncompensate their employees.\n  I will simply conclude by saying again that when all parties--the \nones who write the law, the ones who enforce the law, and the ones who \nlive under the law--agree with the content of the law, then that is the \nlaw. And under this proposal, no employee's minimum wage will be \nreduced. Anyone saying anything to the contrary is shooting from the \npeanut gallery. These people are not part of the group--the writers of \nthe law, the enforcers of the law, and those who live under the law.\n  I urge its passage. If we are going to raise the minimum wage--and I \nsupport doing so--I think in fairness to the employers, we ought also \nto include the tip credit. This is a good compromise. There is so much \nimportant in this bill that is essential for the health of our economy \nand for the settling of some important issue, including planning \npeople's estates, supporting airline pensions, and helping those at the \nlowest rung of the income scale receive a raise. I am support all of \nthis. And I believe this provision only helps--it does not hurt--those \non the minimum wage because it enables more people to have jobs\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The Senator from Alabama is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to express my appreciation to the \nSenator from Oregon for his thoughtful and careful analysis of the tip \ncredit issue. I have heard a lot of things said about it recently, and \na lot of them are quite off base, and it is good that we hear the \nmatter carefully discussed and explained.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4844\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4844.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a second? \nWould the Senator agree to a time limit so that we would vote at 6:15 \non the amendment?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That would be fine.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on \nthis amendment take place at 6:15, with no second-degree amendments \nbeing allowed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n  The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Sessions] proposes an amendment \nnumbered 4844.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 4844\n\n   (Purpose: To make available from Research, Development, Test, and \n   Evaluation, Navy, up to $77,000,000 for the Conventional Trident \n                         Modification Program)\n\n       At the end of title VIII, add the following:\n       Sec. 8109. Of the amount appropriated by title IV under the \n     heading ``Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation, \n     Navy'', up to $77,000,000 may be available for Advanced \n     Conventional Strike Capability (PE #64327N) for the \n     Conventional Trident Modification Program.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I offer this amendment to restore the \nmilitary funding request of $77 million under research and development \nfor the Conventional Trident Modification Program. The Quadrennial \nDefense Review--that is, the 4-year review of the military's world \nstrategic plan--made this finding:\n\n       We need to make greater progress in fielding prompt, \n     accurate, nonnuclear global strike capabilities, and that we \n     also make further modest reductions in a strategic nuclear \n     force.\n\n  So they have looked at that nuclear posture review and as a result \nhave concluded, as General Cartwright and Admiral Giambastiani, as vice \nchairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in a letter to Senator Inouye, \nthat these capabilities as requested in this request for the \nConventional Trident Modification fulfill the military's need for a \nprompt strike weapon. So this is what they requested. The Conventional \nTrident Modification Program is designed\n\n[[Page S8706]]\n\nto demonstrate the feasibility of using existing Trident super \nsubmarine-launched ballistic missiles with nonnuclear warheads to \nprovide the President an important strategic capability for countering \nserious threats to the United States and to do so in time-urgent \nsituations. It will use an inert warhead--someone said it could even be \nconcrete--and a warhead traveling at the speed that this missile \ntravels would have sufficient impact with an inert warhead of \nnonexplosive capability to meet the needs of the military.\n  So while the Senate-passed National Defense Authorization Act for \nfiscal year 2007 fully funds this effort, the Senate Defense \nappropriation bill that is now before us would eliminate all funding \nfor this critical program. According to the report accompanying the \nappropriations bill, the Defense Committee:\n\n       Believes that fundamental issues about the use of this \n     weapon must be addressed prior to investing in this effort.\n\n  The committee also believes that other potentially less provocative \nalternatives have yet to be considered, it says.\n  I will try to address specifically these two concerns, but first \nallow me to remind my colleagues that this issue was thoroughly \nconsidered and debated by the Armed Services Committee prior to and \nduring its markup of the Defense authorization bill. The Strategic \nForces Subcommittee, of which I am the chairman, held a hearing on this \nspecific issue--the global strike capabilities--during which we \ndiscussed it in depth. During our markup, moreover, the Armed Services \nCommittee adopted an amendment proposed by the Democratic members of \nthe committee that would limit spending on the CTM beyond $32 million \nof research and development pending the submission by the Defense \nDepartment of a report by the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of \nState addressing the military, political, and international issues \nassociated with the conventional Trident missile modification.\n  But I would argue that this capability is just too important for our \nNation to allow another year to slip by without proceeding at least \nwith research and development. To accommodate the concerns of some of \nmy colleagues, the amendment before you would restore only the research \nand development funds associated with the CTM Program. Not included is \nthe $50 million requested by the Department of Defense for acquisition \nactivities related to the CTM Program. I believe this was a reasonable \ncompromise, an effort to gain broad support for this new system. I \nbelieve further that to provide R funds to demonstrate the concept, \nwhile withholding procurement funding until Congress has an opportunity \nto review the required report, meets and goes beyond, really, the needs \nand concerns that our colleagues have raised.\n  To speak directly to the matter, why do we need a submarine-launched \nballistic missile that can strike virtually anywhere on the face of the \nglobe with precision, with a conventional warhead, within 30 minutes or \nless? Former Secretaries of Defense Harold Brown, under a Democratic \nadministration, and James Schlesinger, under a Republican \nadministration, said it well in a recent op-ed article they wrote \ntogether, the two of them--Secretaries of Defense, men of wisdom and \nexperience. They said:\n\n       In a world in which terrorist groups may have access to \n     nuclear weapons it is imperative to give future U.S. \n     Presidents more options to prevent nuclear attack.\n\n  I think that says it all. Indeed, it is likely that by the time this \nsystem is ready to be fielded, President Bush will not be here to \nutilize it, but his actions, and our actions as a Congress today, can \nprovide future Presidents with these needed options. To be sure, we are \nnot dealing with an academic debate. It was reported in a 9/11 \nCommission report that on August 11, 1998, a cruise missile attack \nagainst bin Laden, who was then hiding in Afghanistan, missed its \nintended target ``by a few hours.'' How might the course of history \nhave been altered that day if the President had at his disposal a \nprompt global strike capability?\n  In another example, it was reported by the press that the initial \nattack against Saddam Hussein, at the outset of Operation Iraqi \nFreedom, took some 4 hours to reach the target using Stealth fighters \nand sea-launched cruise missiles--ample time for the enemy to escape.\n  In addition to targets in the war against terrorism, one can imagine \nother important uses for a conventional weapon that can strike targets \nacross the globe in minutes, for example, destroying a ballistic \nmissile armed with weapons of mass destruction as it is being prepared \nto be launched against the United States; intercepting a weapon of mass \ndestruction which is being loaded into a container ship heading for a \nU.S. port; or disrupting key enemy command-and-control facilities so \nthat they cannot execute an attack plan; thwarting enemy moves to seize \nstrategic advantage at the outset of some crisis.\n  It is true that some of these targets could be attacked using \nexisting strike forces such as cruise missiles, bombers and precision-\nguided weapons, fighter aircraft launching from carriers or perhaps \nspecial operations forces. But each of these alternative strike \nplatforms carries risks to U.S. personnel, require complex planning and \nsupport infrastructure, and cannot reach their target in minutes. It is \nhours.\n  CTM is indeed a niche capability. But the regrets of not having this \noption are just too high to contemplate, given today's security \nenvironment. Wouldn't we want any President to have this capability?\n  I believe all can agree on the strategic value of the conventional \nTrident program. Let me address what I understand to be the principle \nconcerns of some of its critics, which are that the launch of a \nconventional Trident missile might be mistaken for a launch of a \nnuclear-armed missile and prompt a catastrophic nuclear response from \nsome third-party nation that believes it is under attack.\n  The Defense Department has taken seriously this concern. As a matter \nof fact, the first thing they have done, and decided to do from the \nbeginning, is to be absolutely open to the world about the capability \nthey have in these missiles and their plans to convert a nuclear \nmissile to a conventional missile; but they have, in addition, put in \nplace a comprehensive approach for mitigating this risk.\n  But before examining these specific steps, I ask my colleagues to \nlook more carefully at the fundamental underlying concern. Would a \nnuclear power with ballistic missiles, such as China or Russia, \nperceive the launch of one or even two ballistic missiles, as an attack \nagainst its territory, starting a nuclear war? I think not. Even during \nthe darkest days of the Cold War such an attack by a single missile was \nconsidered implausible. People always talked openly, among the defense \nforces of all these nations, about the situation in which a single \nmissile might be launched by mistake. It is well known if people are \ngoing to kick off a nuclear war and have a number of missiles, they \nwould launch their entire fleet, hundreds of missiles at a time, trying \nto catch the Nation's adversary unaware and perhaps destroy their \nretaliatory capability on the ground. All that was the strategy \ninvolved in Mutual Assured Destruction--a thing, basically, of the \npast, frankly, and thankfully it appears to be so. But we have to be \nconcerned and cannot forget the lessons of that period.\n\n  But let's take this further. Very few States can currently detect a \nlaunch of a missile and track the trajectory of its warhead. Very few \nnations have the capability of detecting our launch. The country that \nhas the most capability in this regard would be Russia, but we are told \nby Defense officials that once the Russians detect a launch, their \nsystem capability is such they will know it is not aimed at them. They \nwill know where it will land, and they will know it poses no threat. \nThey are not going to kick off a war over this.\n  Assuming the above context is not enough to assuage our concerns, the \nDepartment of Defense has in place a comprehensive strategy to mitigate \nrisks posed by the misperception or ambiguity problems. One of the \nmeasures that they plan is advanced notification to leaders of select \nStates. For example, the United States maintains a robust set of \ncommunication links between U.S. leaders and their Russian counterparts \nand military counterparts all over the world. We have that capability \nand, in fact, communicate on a\n\n[[Page S8707]]\n\nfairly frequent basis, and additional communication links with senior \nRussian officials are planned, such as the Joint Data Exchange Center \nfor shared early warning. In this case, Russian and U.S. officials \nwould sit side by side in a jointly staffed early warning center. Isn't \nthat a good step forward?\n  What do we have as a strategy for the United States today? We are \nreducing significantly the number of our nuclear warheads, and we are \ncreating a center for early warning, where our military people sit down \nside by side to further eliminate any possibility of a mistake. There \nare political exchanges and military-to-military talks with Russians \nand other nations to inform them of our plans for the CTM. These \nefforts are already underway. We are right upfront with the military \nleaders around the world about what we are developing and why we are \ndoing it.\n  Operational measures, such as distinctive command and control \nprocedures for the conventional Trident missile, would differ from \nprocedures for nuclear-armed Tridents, and potential visits and \ninspections to build confidence through transparency are planned. Our \nDefense Department talked openly with other defense departments. We \nwill take every effort to make sure there is no risk from this.\n  In summary, the risk of a country misinterpreting the launch of a \nconventionally armed Trident missile as a nuclear attack are low to \nnonexistent. The Department of Defense risk mitigation strategy will \nfurther eliminate that risk--indeed, eliminate it totally. In this \npost-September 11 world, we need strategic capabilities to promptly \nthwart dangerous threats to the United States, where time is of the \nessence and the regret of not acting is too high to imagine. The \nconventional Trident option provides our leaders the capability to go \nafter high-value targets where access may be difficult or where other \nU.S. forces are not present. It is a capability that will be reserved \nfor extreme national emergencies. It is a capability we need today. It \nis an option any President can have if we move forward and should have.\n  I close by asking my colleagues to think carefully about this \namendment. It is a very important issue. I can understand that people \nmight have raised concerns. But what I want to say to my colleagues is \nwe had a hearing on this. We had General Cartwright and others testify. \nGeneral Cartwright is the Commander of the Strategic Command. This is \nunder his direction. He is a very impressive general. We asked him \ntough questions about all these issues, and he was quite forthcoming \nand open about it. He answered every single one of them.\n  Our Armed Services Committee has voted this out in a compromise \nfashion to guarantee even further study before the system goes to full \ndevelopment. But we do not need to waste another year. We do not need \nto go another year without the future President of the United States \nhaving the capability that we have the power to give him, to launch a \nnonnuclear strike anywhere in the world and hit a target within 30 \nminutes. It is the right thing to do. It is very important for our \nDefense Department. They strongly support it as part of their 4-year \nQuadrennial Defense Review. We have letters from General Cartwright, \nVice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and others supporting this \nmatter, and the Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld. Indeed, \nSecretary Rumsfeld said in his letter, just a few days ago:\n\n       The Department [of Defense] strongly supports this \n     amendment. Failure to fund this program would delay a \n     capability we need now to respond promptly and precisely to \n     time-sensitive, high-value targets anywhere in the world.\n\n  This capability is within our grasp. It will work. It is simply a \nmatter of developing the warhead and doing training with it. But the \ncapability we have is such that these missiles can hit the most precise \ntargets within 30 minutes anywhere on the globe.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I join my colleague from \nAlabama to offer this amendment that will provide funding to enable a \nnew and indeed needed capability known as Prompt Global Strike. In \nMarch of this year, prior to an Armed Services subcommittee hearing, I \nmet with General James Cartwright, of the U.S. Strategic Command, to \ndiscuss this capability. He explained to me that the need for it was \nurgent and why. It is designed for situations where the time to act is \nshort and access may be denied or difficult, U.S. forces are not \npresent, and the regret of not acting is high.\n  For instance, we could be in a situation that required a quick strike \non a mobile ballistic missile launcher or WMD transshipment point or \nhigh-value terrorist target or an enemy command center. In order to hit \nthese targets in a time-critical manner, General Cartwright has asked \nfor authorization for some Trident missiles to be modified for \nconventional use.\n  Trident missiles have longer ranges than Tomahawk cruise missiles, \nand in situations where airspace is restricted, are safer to employ \nthan long-range bombers. Now the need is obvious. The attacks on \nSeptember 11, the war on terrorism, and the spread of weapons of mass \ndestruction demand prompt global strikes.\n  I would argue that in the wake of North Korea's missile tests that \nhaving this capability becomes even more necessary as an option.\n  One of the main arguments against CTM is that other countries could \nmistake a conventional missile launch for a nuclear missile attack.\n  Even though I am told that is a very low likelihood, to ensure that \nother countries don't mistake a conventional missile for a nuclear \nmissile, the Department of Defense is developing assurance measures \nsuch as: Advance notification; Shared early warning; Inspections and \ntransparency.\n  And General Cartwright said to me that ``the lines of communication \nare more open than ever between the United States and Russia and \nChina.''\n  Additionally, the Department has studied alternatives. Conventional \nTrident Modification--CTM--is the only concept available within the \nnext 2 to 3 years. Other options may be available by the middle of the \nnext decade and are being pursued.\n  The Armed Services Committee, on which I serve, considered this issue \nand included language on CTM in the Defense Authorization bill. The \nStrategic Forces Subcommittee held a hearing and briefings; there was \nfull committee discussion during markup and a compromise was reached to \nfully fund the CTM request, but limit spending beyond $32,000,000 of \nR funds pending submission of a joint DoD/State Dept report \naddressing virtually all concerns and alternatives.\n  Unfortunately, the Defense Appropriations Committee did not fund the \nprogram, and required a National Academy of Science study of the \nunderlying mission requirement and options.\n  General Cartwright and the Vice-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, Admiral Giambastiani, believe these questions have already been \nanswered by the JASONs, the Defense Policy Board, the STRATCOM \nStrategic Advisory Group, and the STRATCOM staff.\n  In a joint letter from Admiral Giambastiani and General Cartwright \nthey state:\n\n       We are aware . . . of a range of issues associated with the \n     use of conventionally-modified Trident missiles, and \n     understand that Congress may desire assurances that these \n     issues be resolved prior to deployment of such a capability. \n     We are confident that the DoD, with the Department of State, \n     can satisfactorily allay these concerns in parallel with \n     continued research and development. This capability is too \n     important to the nation to delay.\n\n  Senator Sessions and I also have a letter from Secretary Rumsfeld \nindicating his very strong support for funding of the Conventional \nTrident Modification program. He said, ``Failure to fund this program \nwould delay a capability we need now to respond promptly and precisely \nto time-sensitive, high value targets anywhere in the world.''\n  The House Armed Services Committee and the House Defense \nAppropriations Committee had similar concerns, but they have provided \nR funding--$30,000,000--while awaiting response to their questions.\n  The benefit of our amendment, and this compromise approach, is that \nthe program will move forward with research and development funding--\nnot procurement funding--while DoD addresses the concerns of CTM \ncritics.\n  It's a good, bipartisan compromise amendment and I hope our colleages \nin the Senate will support it.\n\n[[Page S8708]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \nproposed by the Senator from Alabama. The premise advanced by the \nSenator from Alabama is that we have such a robust relationship with \nother nuclear powers, such as Russia, that it would be easy to \ncoordinate this; there would be no mistaking a launch of a conventional \nmissile from a Trident submarine. But I think that is contradicted by \nwhat the Russians themselves say.\n  General Cartright went out and met his counterpart, General \nBaluyevsky, the chief of the Russian general staff, and tried to talk \nto him about these threats of terrorists needing to strike at long \ndistance. And General Baluyevsky said this could be a costly move which \nnot only won't guarantee his destruction--referring to Bin Laden--but \ncould provide an irreversible response from a nuclear-armed state which \ncan't determine what warhead is fitted on the missile.\n  That is the strong support, constant communication with Russia that \nwe have today, which could easily discern and disseminate information \nabout a potential launch of a conventional weapon from a Trident \nplatform.\n  The Trident submarine contains missiles which are all armed with \nnuclear weapons. They are part of our strategic triad--probably the \nmost secure part of our triad. And the practical problem for anyone in \nthe world is to determine, if we shoot one of these missiles at them, \nis it a conventional warhead or is it a nuclear warhead?\n  If anyone believes they have nuclear weapons and are being attacked \nby a nuclear device, I think there is a strong fear, on my part at \nleast, that they would retaliate before they could ever verify what was \ngoing on.\n  Another aspect of this whole proposal is that it is premised on the \nfact that we would only have minutes or so to strike a target. But I \nthink you have to ask yourself, reasonably and realistically, if that \nis the case, how do we know the target is so dangerous? I presume, in \nterms of developing our intelligence sources, we first have a \nsuspicion, then we have information, we go out and verify it, and in \nthat process I would assume and would hope that our national security \nofficials would begin to move assets into the area which could conduct \na strike with precision weapons.\n  Again, I think the record of the intelligence community, frankly, in \nterms of determining targets is one that is spotty at best. That is \nbecause of the difficulty of doing this type of intelligence work.\n  Recall now the first blow in the Iraq war was a precision strike to \ndecapitate their leadership by killing, essentially, Saddam Hussein. It \nturned out he wasn't there.\n  Think about if that type of intelligence prompted the firing of a \nTrident missile, and a nuclear power was unsure that it was not a \nnuclear weapon or a conventional weapon and retaliate. I think we are \ngoing down a very dangerous path.\n  Let me also suggest something else, which is inherent in the argument \nof Senator Sessions. I guess the question would be, would we wait, if \nit is so dangerous and so insistent to act so quickly, would we wait to \nensure that the other parties understood--the other parties being \nRussia or China--that this was a nonnuclear launch? How much time would \nthat take? How could we be sure that we have effectively communicated \nit? None of this has been investigated.\n  The comments by the Russian chief of general staff suggests that. So \nI think we have an obligation to look carefully at this issue before we \ngo down this path.\n  That is essentially what was agreed to in the Defense authorization \nbill. The Defense authorization bill says no funds can be expended for \nR until 30 days after a report, which is specified in the committee \nlegislation, is given to the relevant committees in the Senate and the \nHouse. If they have all these answers right now, and they are \ncompelling and persuasive, I presume it could be delivered within a few \ndays, starting the 30-day period to be told or to expire. I think this \nis a prudent thing to do. To go ahead and avoid this report not only \ncontradicts the sentiment on the authorizing committee, but also I \nthink it disregards the difficult questions that have to be asked.\n  Where is this instantaneous assured notification to others that this \nis a conventional weapon and not a nuclear weapon? I think that \nquestion alone requires an evaluation.\n  I hope in the disposition of this amendment we would let this report \nrequirement stand, would let the committee do what they have \nessentially done--roughly the same thing--allowing R funding to go \nforward pending reports of one kind or another. That is the prudent and \nappropriate thing to do. I hope we would do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition.\n  I have spent many hours in discussions on this program with \nsupporters of this program. I have listened to their arguments. And, \nbelieve me, I have put in much thought about this matter.\n  I have concluded that this is not the time to begin development of a \nconventional Trident missile. Instead, the chairman and I agree--and \nthe Appropriations Committee concurred--that before proceeding to \ndevelop this or any alternative program, the Congress needs to have a \ntruly independent study.\n  As such, the bill includes $5 million for the National Academy of \nSciences to conduct a study to examine the conventional Trident and \nother alternatives.\n  I think most Americans are not aware of what we are speaking of when \nwe say a Trident submarine or Trident missile. A Trident submarine is a \nnuclear-powered submarine that carries 24 tubes. Each tube can have a \nnuclear-tipped missile, an intercontinental ballistic missile. All of \nthe military is well aware of this. The Russians know about this. The \nNorth Koreans know about this. The Koreans, the Japanese, the Chinese--\nit is no secret to them. And the proposal is to have four of these \nmissiles conventional, not nuclear.\n  That sounds reasonable. The argument is that the Russians know that \nif we fire one, it is not intended to be an attack because if we were \nto attack a nation, we would have hundreds flying.\n  But let's turn this around a bit. What if one of those Russian \nmissiles--and they have nuclear-powered submarines that can shoot out \nfrom their tubes intercontinental ballistic missiles--let's say they \nfired one toward Canada, and because of the curvature of the Earth, it \nhas to fly over Washington, DC, or New York City, and the Russians told \nus: No; we are not firing at you. We are firing at Canada. What do you \nthink our reaction would be? Would we say, go right ahead? The least we \nwill do is put our country on full alert. What is full alert? It is the \nfinger is right over the button, and sometimes a mistake can be made \nand sometimes the finger gets a bit too heavy.\n  No. 1, we don't need the conventional warhead.\n  No. 2, the risk is too great.\n  How would the North Koreans take it if they saw a missile flying in \ntheir direction? How would the Chinese take it? There is no \ntransparency. Today, yes, we can call up on all the nations and say we \nare going to test a Trident missile, and it is going to fly out of here \nand it is going to land there, and they can all watch and monitor. But \nif we were out to demolish something, the question is, Will we notify \nthe world? The answer is obvious. If you want a surprise to get Osama \nbin Laden, are we going to tell the whole world, ``Yes, we are going to \nfire into that mountain because we want to get Osama bin Laden''? Guess \nhow long he will stick around.\n\n  The committee did the right thing by setting aside $5 million for an \nindependent agency to make the study, not some agency connected to the \nDepartment of Defense. I hope my colleagues will vote against this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I appreciate my colleague so much. I express my \nappreciation to Senator Nelson of Nebraska for being a cosponsor and \nfor his work on the Committee on Armed Services. I failed to mention \nthat Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska is also a cosponsor of this \namendment.\n  We have so many ideas about how to defend America that we should not \ndisrespect others who may disagree every now and then on how something \nshould\n\n[[Page S8709]]\n\nbe done. I respect Senator Inouye. He is a patriot and an expert on \ndefense. I have seen his leadership on national missile defense, which \nis seen today as a very wise investment. If a single missile moved \ntoward the United States for the first time in history, we now have \nsome capability to knock that down. In fact, in a few years, we will \nhave a powerful capability to knock that down, but we have some \ncapability right now. I believe we could successfully knock down one of \nthose missiles.\n  I will share a few thoughts. My colleague, Senator Reed, talked about \nthe Russians, who had a meeting with our people. The Russians said they \nmight not like it if we launched a missile like this. If we had this \ncapability, they might not like it.\n  It is interesting that we are openly talking with them about the \ncapability, and letting them know what our plans are. The experts tell \nus they could tell, shortly after a launch, whether or not a missile \nwas aimed at them. Certainly we are not going to launch World War III, \nno nation would, if a single missile was aimed toward them. We need to \nthink this through.\n  With regard to the review and the studies, my colleague, Senator \nReed, on the Committee on Armed Services, and I serve together. He may \nhave misunderstood what this amendment would do. The authorization bill \nwe passed that authorized spending on this missile system required a \nstudy. It said that study must be completed and no more than $32 \nmillion could be spent until it was completed. It would require not \nonly the Defense Department to participate but the State Department to \nparticipate. That was to allay the concerns being raised.\n  That language is not undermined by this amendment. This amendment \ndoes not refer to it. It would be absolutely mandated by the language \nin the Defense authorization bill. We certainly want that report. There \nis no attempt, I say to my colleagues, to undermine that requirement. \nThat requirement remains in place.\n  The effect of failing to fund this program, a program that was based \nupon a need identified by the formal 4-year Quadrennial Defense Review \nof the Department of Defense, a study was made to identify how best to \nmeet that need. This conventional Trident was decided to be the best \nway to have that need met in short order. That is why the Defense \nDepartment has asked for it. They have never been secretive about it. \nThey have been absolutely open about it. They have made sure they have \ngone the extra mile to carry out a series of steps that would make us \nnot mislead any country. It is the right thing to do.\n  Our submarines carry 24 nuclear missiles today that can hit a target \naround the world within 30 minutes. I have a son-in-law in Hawaii who \nis an officer on a nuclear submarine. I am very proud of him. My \ndaughter is in Hawaii today. I know a little bit about those \nsubmarines. They carry nuclear weapons.\n  We don't want the President of the United States to have a real \nserious threat to America existing for a short period of time, and the \nonly response he or she may have is a nuclear weapon. We want them to \nhave extra options, an option to use a non-nuclear weapon.\n  There was some suggestion by Senator Reed, almost like he is afraid \nfor us to have this capability. We have the capability now to launch \ncruise missiles on shorter range targets where there is more time. We \ndon't go willy-nilly launching cruise missiles. This is a non-nuclear \nweapon. It would do no more damage than a cruise missile would, maybe \nless if it is not an explosive warhead. I don't see the danger.\n  I know the concern. We have had a hearing on it. We have talked about \nit. The Defense Department, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nand General Cartwright, Strategic Commander, one of the most able \nofficers in the military, one of the most respected, say we need this. \nThey have asked us and written us to do it this year. It is affordable. \nIt will use existing missiles. It will be a missile that now has the \ncapability to launch and is designed to carry nuclear weapons. We are \ngoing to ``non-nuclear'' it and make it a conventional weapon. It is \nvery much needed.\n  A former Secretary of Defense, Harold Brown, under Jimmy Carter, and \nformer Secretary of Defense, James Schlesinger, under President Reagan, \nhave both asked for this to be done. They said, in an op-ed they \nvoluntarily published, we need this capability.\n  I urge my colleagues to think this through. If we authorize it, \nadditional studies will be required. My colleagues, please know when \nyou vote on this you are not building and deploying the system but \nsimply doing the research and development. We will have another step in \nbetween with the full extra study we have asked by the Defense \nDepartment before we make a final decision to go forward.\n  That is where we are. It is a reasonable approach, an approach that \nhas listened to the concerns of some of our colleagues and tried to \nrespond to those in a way that keeps this on track. We don't want to \nend up 2, 3, 4 years from now not having done this, leaving the \nPresident of the United States in the future without the capability, \nwithout an option to protect the people of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I don't recall a time I have had a \ndispute with Senator Sessions on defense policy but I do on this issue. \nIn the first place, the Committee on Armed Services provided an \nauthorization for the money but told us it cannot be spent until there \nis a study. I don't support this amendment because I do not agree with \nthe urgency to commit to this solution and commit funds for it when we \nlack a full understanding of the requirement and a thorough review of \nthe alternatives.\n  What we needed and what the Defense appropriations bill before us now \nprovides is a comprehensive analysis. This follows the path of the \nCommittee on Armed Services, a review that considers the military \nfactors as well as the political and international factors of what is \nneeded--not money upfront. Our Defense appropriations bill contains \nlanguage for such a review and report. The Senate Committee on Armed \nServices was concerned about this capability. They included the \nextensive report language, as well. Our Appropriations Subcommittee has \ngone one step further, and we have withheld funds for the fiscal year \n2007.\n  Given the concerns raised by some Senators, our committee does not \nagree we must fund this initiative now. Funding for defense is very \ntight, as the Senate knows. Given the serious concerns about prompt \nglobal strike and the limited fund for defense this year, the Committee \non Appropriations--in particular, our subcommittee--has carefully \ndecided to fund only those programs that have been fully explained and \njustified.\n  There are three principal reasons why I am concerned about pursuing \nthe conventional Trident missile, or CTM, solution. I have reservations \nabout the international political opinion and the potential for \nmisinterpretation of our actions. A country that picks up or identifies \na CTM launch might legitimately worry whether the weapon carries a \nnuclear or conventional payload. This could be a provocative action, if \ntaken. This issue is larger than the Defense Department. There are \nserious international implications that the State Department should be \nmore involved before we go forward with CTM capability.\n  Second, the demand for a prompt strike capability is not well \nsupported by the timeliness of our intelligence or its decision-making \nprocesses. It takes time to validate intelligence information, and the \ndecision to strike takes time. It should be carefully analyzed before \nmaking that decision. This capability would offer the opportunity for \nrisky, even reckless strikes, rather than deliberate, clearly thought-\nout action. Congress needs to thoroughly understand the implications \nand uses of the concept of prompt global strike.\n  My third concern with CTM is my preference to do more with our \nforward-deployed conventional strike assets which may be called back \nand under positive control under the combatant commanders until final \ncommitment. Our committee recommended the Defense Department look again \nat how and where our conventional strike forces should be deployed to \ndevelop a more responsive means to meet the need for a faster strike \ncapability.\n  The facts are that Congress does not have sufficient information to \nmake a\n\n[[Page S8710]]\n\ndecision on a conventional Trident missile today. This missile is not \nsomething that is needed in the near term. Therefore, I recommend the \nSenate not approve this amendment and support our Defense \nappropriations bill which calls for further study.\n  Is there a time set for the vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is set for 6:15.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I have such respect for Senator Inouye \nand Senator Stevens, but I do want to mention a couple of things that \nare important for my colleagues. This is a high priority for our \nmilitary leaders. They believe it is critical to have this capability.\n  As former Secretary of Defense Harold Brown said, along with James \nSchlesinger:\n\n       The detonation of a nuclear weapon in the United States by \n     a terrorist group would be an unprecedented disaster. It is \n     essential [essential] that Congress approve the funds for \n     this program. Moreover, a small reprogramming action in \n     the current fiscal year could accelerate the missiles' \n     initial deployments. In a world in which terrorist groups \n     may have access to nuclear weapons, it is imperative to \n     give future U.S. presidents more options to prevent \n     nuclear attacks.\n\n  They go on in quite a long article and deal with this.\n  My colleague, in talking about this, mentioned that: Well, this could \nbe recklessly used. But any weapon we have could be recklessly used. \nSome have said President Clinton was not wise when he launched a cruise \nmissile into the Sudan. I defended it when he did it. But he made that \ndecision. He made that decision. That is a conventional weapon.\n  The only difference, really, colleagues, in a conventional Trident \nlaunch and a cruise missile launch is it is quicker. We talked about \nthere are multiple hours many times, they are not as fast, they have to \nbe launched often from an aircraft or from ships that are not readily \navailable, they are not readily available to be launched. So we are \ntalking about delays.\n  This would allow us the capability of launching a nonnuclear weapon, \nmuch like our cruise missiles and Tomahawk missiles, to hit a precise \ntarget that could represent a deadly threat to the people of the United \nStates of America.\n  It is unbelievable, really, that we have this capability. Right now \nthe President can do it, but the only missiles he has that he could \nlaunch that could hit a target within 30 minutes are nuclear missiles. \nIt would be unlikely we would ever launch one nuclear weapon like that \nthat I can imagine. It could happen, I guess, but it certainly would be \ncause for the greatest anguish and concern, and it would be unlikely to \never be done.\n  So I am just saying this is the plan that our experts, who are \nworking on strategic issues in the Department of Defense, believe gives \nthe President a capability and gives the Defense Department, our \nmilitary, a capability that can help protect America with a \nconventional weapon. Maybe it will be an inert warhead, inert substance \nin what would be the warhead, that it is not even an explosive. And it \ncould strike a target around the world that could save thousands and \nthousands of lives, tip the balance of some sort of military conflict.\n  So that is where we have reached some disagreement. I am very \nrespectful of the chairman and ranking member of this Appropriations \nCommittee. They have defended America personally, putting their lives \non the line for our country. They have, for many years, preserved, \nprotected, and defended this country through very able Defense budgets. \nMany times it was not so popular. But they have been there, and they \nhave fought for them. And we now have the finest military the world has \never known. I salute them for it. We just have a disagreement on this \nsingle matter. I think it is important or I would not raise it.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the senior \nSenator from Delaware, Mr. Biden, be added as a cosponsor to amendment \nNo. 4827 to the fiscal year 2007 Defense appropriations bill that is \nalready adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, there are 2 or 3 minutes before the \nvote, and I will take a brief minute to summarize this matter.\n  The Secretary of Defense personally has written us and asked that we \nallow the Department to go forward with this conventional Trident \nmissile capability saying:\n\n       Failure to fund this program would delay a capability we \n     need now to respond promptly and precisely to time-sensitive, \n     high-value targets anywhere in the world.\n\n  This has also been the subject of an op-ed by former Secretary of \nDefense Harold Brown, who served under Jimmy Carter, and former \nSecretary of Defense James Schlesinger, who served under Presidents \nNixon and Ford and served in President Carter's Cabinet also. They say \nwe need this now.\n  It would not deploy this system but would allow research and \ndevelopment, and requires, before any more than $30 million is spent--\nbefore any more than $30 million is spent--that the Defense Department \nand the State Department must complete a study and present that to \nCongress before we go forward.\n  We do not need to delay. If we wait another year or 2, we will allow \nanother year or 2 or 3 or 4 to go by without the President having the \ncapability within 30 minutes to hit any target on the globe with a \nnonnuclear weapon.\n  The concern over misinterpretation of the missile launch intent has \nbeen dealt with openly and directly by the military. They have talked \nwith foreign nations about it. We will make every effort to ensure that \ndoes not happen. And it, indeed, as I have explained earlier, should \nnot be a problem, as these former Secretaries of Defense stated.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \nagreeing to the Sessions amendment.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Montana (Mr. Baucus) and \nthe Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Lieberman) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, if we can get order, I can inform the \nSenators of what I know of the schedule. The Senator from Arizona, Mr. \nKyl, has an amendment he wishes to discuss. It has been cleared on both \nsides. I understand he will take about 20 minutes. We have another \nmanagers' package, and I will continue to work on packages.\n  After Senator Kyl has his amendment adopted by a voice vote, we will \nturn to the amendment to be offered by Senator Stabenow, which I \nunderstand will take some time. I tell the Senate, after those two, I \nknow of no other Senator who has asked to call up an amendment.\n  If there is no amendment to be offered and debated, I will move for \nthird reading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, everyone should know that we have cooperated \non this bill every step of the way. There was no reason to do a motion \nto proceed to this. We allowed this to take place in spite of the fact \nthat there were many other things going on taking the attention of the \nSenators.\n  We have been very cooperative in offering amendments. This is a bill \nthat is very important to the country. I think they should allow us a \nlittle bit of time to determine what is in the bill and what should be \nin the bill.\n  There are people who have amendments to offer, and for my friend, the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Alaska, to come here and threaten us \nthat he is going to try to stop debate on this bill is not in keeping \nwith the decorum of the Senate.\n  We have amendments to offer. I have offered, starting this morning, \nthat we come up with a list of finite amendments and finish this bill \nin a reasonable amount of time when we get back. We are not going to be \nable to finish this bill now. We have the so-called trifecta, we have \nthe pensions program we have to deal with that affects 45 million \npeople directly, 145 million people indirectly.\n  In addition to that, we have these tax extenders.\n  We, the Democrats, didn't put us in this procedural quagmire. Had it \nnot been for the distinguished Congressman from Tennessee, who said: We \noutfoxed the Democrats--no Democrat was outfoxed. The American people \nhaven't been outfoxed. We didn't put anyone in this position. We are \nhere because of what the majority decided to do.\n  Don't give us the hustle on the Defense bill. We have been ready to \nmove to this Defense bill for a long time. But we can't do it because \nwe are stuck on the road to legislative heaven the Republicans have, \nwhich is the estate tax repeal. So don't come here like I was born \nyesterday and tell me what you are going to do because I wasn't born \nyesterday.\n  We are ready to cooperate, and we have been, but don't threaten my \nSenators that they are not going to be able to offer amendments.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, do I have the floor? I thought I had the \nfloor.\n  I am pleased to hear the distinguished minority leader mention this \nfact. Let's be sure: Senator Inouye and I have managed this bill now, \none or the other of us, since 1981. We have never been on this floor \nlonger than 3 days for the Defense bill. All I said was I am going to \nmove to third reading if no one is here to offer an amendment. I didn't \nblock anybody's amendment. All it takes, if I do move to third reading, \nall it takes is someone to ask for the floor or offer an amendment.\n  Let me tell the Senate this, though: We know what is happening. When \nwe get back, we will have other business that will come ahead of this \nbill. We have to get this bill passed and to the President before the \nend of this fiscal year. When the House comes back, we can't get to \nconference if we don't finish it tonight or tomorrow until about the \nthird week of September, and it takes time to confer on a bill such as \nthis. It takes a lot of time, staff time. It is an enormous bill now \nbecause we have added considerable moneys to it that the House hasn't \neven considered.\n  When we come back, this bill has to be to the President before \nSeptember 20. What the Senator is suggesting, as I understand it, is \nthat we will take a couple days after we finish whatever is carried \nover from this session, if cloture is voted tomorrow, and this bill \ngoes back on the calendar; do you know that? It would take unanimous \nconsent to call it back up.\n  All I am saying is we manage this bill with the idea o protecting \nthese people in uniform. Anyone can raise an amendment. I am prepared \nto stay all night tonight, all day tomorrow, all the next night. If you \nwant to debate, debate. That is what we used to do in this society is \nbe a debate society. It is not society.\n\n  I take umbrage with the fact that the good Senator said I threatened \nhim. I didn't threaten anybody. I said I was going to offer a motion or \nmake a request to go to third reading if no one has an amendment to \ndebate. I say that again. It is not a threat; it is a promise, Mr. \nPresident.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to get along with everybody. I really \nhave tried. I came here this morning at 9:30, and I said: We are ready \nto vote on the big bill that cloture was filed on last night. I am \nready to do that. We were ready to do that this morning. I want to \nfinish the pensions bill. I want to do something on the extenders. That \nis where I hoped we would have been--to have completed all this.\n  No one has to worry about moving this when we get back. We want this \nbill to be completed. We want it to be done right. No one questions the \ncapability of Senator Inouye and Senator Stevens on the Defense \nappropriations bill. But we can see the light at the end of the tunnel.\n  Hey, listen, some of my Senators are leaving. They don't need to be \nhere to vote on cloture. Some of them would like to be here to vote on \ncloture. What I suggest is we have a program to complete the work \naround here.\n  People have come to me--Democrats and Republicans--asking: What do \nyou propose? I propose we vote on the so-called trifecta--I have \nanother name for it--and do the pensions bill and try to get the \nextenders done. That is not easy lifting. That is a big project for us. \nAnd the Defense bill, I am sorry it was brought up when it was and it \nwasn't done sooner.\n  As I said, we have cooperated with this body. We intend to continue \nto do that. And if the distinguished Senator wants to stay here all \nnight, then fine, that is fine, we will have a cloture vote in the \nmorning. As everybody knows, after the cloture vote, there aren't going \nto be a lot of people around here.\n  I have agreed not for endless amendments--we want to finish this \nbill--but that we have a list of finite amendments. These two good \nmanagers--I know when we get to these amendments, some of them will not \nbe able to be taken, so to speak, and will be headed to the dark hole \nof the conference. Some amendments will have to have votes, but not \nmany.\n  I said to the majority leader personally, and I say here: We will \nfinish this bill and take no more than 2 days when we get back. I am \nnot going to agree on a time for final passage, but I told the \ndistinguished majority leader that. We are not trying to do anything \nother than to just move along.\n  There have been a few times--not often--I probably raised my voice a \nlittle more than I should have. If I offended anyone, I am sorry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, while we are all on the Senate floor, \neveryone knows the business we have before us before we begin our \nrecess, and part, I think, of what we see rise here is we have a lot to \ndo in a short period of time. All the business is very important. \nIndeed, people have been very cooperative. We were allowed to go to the \nDepartment of Defense appropriations bill by unanimous consent on \nWednesday night or Tuesday--was it Tuesday night? We all agreed to go \nto the bill. We have had a good debate and a fair number of amendments.\n  Now it is almost 7 o'clock and the business we need to do is the \nDepartment of Defense appropriations. We do\n\n[[Page S8712]]\n\nhave the trifecta bill which, as everybody knows, by normal procedure \nwill be tomorrow morning--we will agree upon a time, an hour after we \ncome in, but we can agree to do that at 9:30. It is normal procedure. \nThen we do have to deal with pensions. We know how important it is to \nget that done before we leave.\n  The Democratic leader mentioned trying to do something with \nextenders. I think we made good progress. We have some pending \namendments. I wouldn't put it out of the realm--but I would like to \nhear the Democratic leader's response--if we worked hard for the next \n4, 5 hours and really plowed through the amendments, that we could even \nfinish the appropriations bill and tonight go to the trifecta bill, \ndispose of that--however the votes fall--and we all know that will be \nvery close. Then immediately deal with the pensions bill tonight. Then \nwe would have everything done.\n  I know probably the response will be that there is no way to finish \nthe Department of Defense appropriations bill, given the long list of \nthe amendments we referred to, although if we did stay here and spend 5 \nhours, 6, 7 hours or 3 hours, 4 hours and just plowed through the \namendments and addressed them, finish that--this has to be done by \nunanimous consent--go to the trifecta bill, go t pensions, and then go \nhome.\n\n  I would be interested in the Democratic leader's response.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have worked with my caucus and I have \nother Senators working with each Senator. We have done a number of \nhotlines to find out amendments that are pending. We have a number of \namendments that are pending. People feel very strongly about that. We \nare not going to finish the bill tonight. I guess if we worked all \nnight, if that would be the choice, it would be by attrition. I think \nit is just a strange way to do business.\n  I know people want to get the work done, but we have been willing to \ndo this bill for a long time. I have been on the floor and talked about \nit: Why don't we move to the Defense appropriations bill?\n  We have spent all week on things, but it seems to me we should have \nbeen doing things other than estate tax repeal, which we have dealt \nwith so many times. I have already given my speech on that. People know \nhow I feel about that issue.\n  I think we are being totally reasonable. I am not telling the leader \nhe has to file cloture on this bill. I am saying there are a lot of \namendments. We have about 50 amendments on our side. We know that as \ntime goes on they will be whittled down. These managers will accept \nsome. The Republicans have amendments.\n  I say with all due respect to my friend, the distinguished majority \nleader--and I know his job is a lot harder than mine; I know that--we \ncan't finish the Defense bill tonight, as much as he wants to, and as \nmuch as the two distinguished managers want to. We just can't do it. It \njust won't happen.\n  As I said, no one has to file cloture. I have told you--I say it here \nin front of all my colleagues--we will finish the bill in 2 days when \nwe get back. I don't think with all the turmoil going on around the \nworld today involving our fighting men and women--I think it might not \nbe a bad idea to have the break to find out where we need to go when we \nget back because things are moving very rapidly all over the world.\n  Anyway, I don't think we can do it, I say to the leader. I think we \nwould be much better off finishing this bill in a couple days when we \nget back, and I think we will be more in tune to do it. We will finish \nit as is scheduled, as I indicated to all my Senators here.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, while we are talking about it, we will be \nout for, I guess, 4 weeks and then Labor Day, and we will come back \nthat Tuesday. Again, I haven't talked with the chairman or ranking \nmember, but does that mean we can finish it late Wednesday night; spend \nthat Tuesday and Wednesday on it?\n  Mr. REID. We come in Tuesday, work on the bill Tuesday, finish it \nWednesday. It may be a late night, but we will finish. I told you 2 \ndays, and all my Senators are here, and we will finish it in 2 days.\n  Mr. FRIST. That just helps clarify so we know what we are working \nwith. I know the chairman wants to make a comment. Right now the way \nthings exist, because I filed cloture last night, we should say right \nnow we will be voting at 9:30 tomorrow morning on trifecta. We still--\nand I don't want to close that down--have the option, the opportunity \nof maybe doing it tonight. We can go back in the cloakroom and talk \nabout what the schedule will be.\n  I will turn to the chairman. I know he wants to make a comment, but \nlet's not close finishing tonight. It would have to be under a very \ntight agreement of how we complete this Department of Defense bill. \nThis is an absolutely critical bill for this country.\n  I have heard very clearly--and the Democratic leader and I have been \ntalking about it--if we had to put it off and if we can finish it late \nthat Wednesday night is something we can consider. The chairman and \nranking member need to think about that. It means we need to continue \nto work tonight before we do the trifecta.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I don't want to be disrespectful to \nanybody, and I consider every person--at least I consider every person \non this floor my friend. I am old enough to know that I have outlived \nmost of my enemies.\n  As a practical matter--I don't want to get a little maudlin about \nthis, but these men and women overseas, they are not taking August off. \nThey are not in a rush to get on an airplane. We could finish this \nbill.\n  My notice of going to go to third reading if there were no amendments \nis normal. Filibusters started around this Senate when people didn't \nwant to go to third reading so they offered amendment after amendment \nafter amendment so the leader could not take us to third reading.\n  We developed a procedure, a family thing here now, that now we do it \nlike Marcus of Queensbury rules. I remember being on this floor \novernight for two and three nights in a row, and so does my friend from \nHawaii. I don't disagree with this procedure--it is a more humane \nprocedure--but I do think we have a job to do, and the No. 1 job to do \nis to get this Defense bill to the President before the fiscal year \nstarts.\n  Now, I understand we can get a commitment that we will finish by \nWednesday night. Wednesday night means we can't get the papers to the \nHouse until Thursday or Friday, and it will be the next week before we \nconfer, and then we will confer at least a week with the House, and \nthat would be reasonable because both the House and Senate have other \nthings to do than just confer with each other. We are going to get back \nhere with this bill sometime around I would say the 21st, and then \nguess what. Then we would probably go home--it is just before the \nelection--and we probably wouldn't get around to this bill because \nfirst we have to wait for the House to get it to us, as a matter of \nfact, because it is an appropriations bill. So we are looking at \ngetting this bill back sometime around the 26th or the 27th, if \neverything goes right--if everything goes right.\n  I would prefer to have a time agreement for Wednesday night and that \nwe would vote at a time certain, but I will take our friend's point of \nview and say: OK, we will commit as Senators that we will finish this \nvote on Wednesday night. I wish we could do a lot better. I think we \nare going to be criticized, every one of us, for deciding to go home \nrather than finish this bill.\n  Now, I have heard a lot of rhetoric from the other side during this \nyear. You have not had that kind of rhetoric from me so far this year, \nbut if people want to keep it going, we can debate whether we should \nget this thing done and if we can get it done. I can guarantee you the \nSenator from Hawaii and I could finish this bill tonight if we had \ncooperation. There is not one amendment I know of that will take all \nnight--nothing in this bill requires something that would take all \nnight.\n  So again, I am not the leader. You two are leaders. You make up your \nminds. But I am going to be super critical of this Senate if this bill \ndoesn't go to the President in time to have this bill become law by the \nend of the fiscal year.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, let me just say, if the chairman and the \nranking member believe this bill can be finished tonight, even if it \ntakes all night, we ought to finish it tonight. There is\n\n[[Page S8713]]\n\nno question in terms of the importance of this bill. If it looks as if \nthat is impossible, which we have heard, then we should entertain the \nproposal put forth by the Democratic leader of finishing Wednesday \nnight. But if there is any way we can finish, I think we should finish \ntonight. I think everybody would be willing to stay, as it is that \nimportant to this country.\n  Again, I just heard the chairman saying we could finish it tonight. \nIt is going to be hard, but if we stay here and literally stay on the \nfloor and march through the amendments with the appropriate debate, \nthen that is what we should do. I don't think we need to make a \ndecision right this second because we can make it among ourselves when \nwe are not before the American people. But if we can finish it, we \nshould finish it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. We all know the talent of the senior Senator from Alaska, a \nwonderful man, and it is good that he hasn't been upset with us \nrecently. But where was my friend when we were spending all the time on \ngay marriage and other such things when we should have been working on \nthis?\n  We don't run this place; the majority runs the Senate. We do our best \nto represent our constituents. But we don't need to be told it is our \nfault the Defense appropriations bill is not going forward. We have \nbeen willing to work on the Defense appropriations bill, and I say as \nsomeone who has managed a lot of bills here on the floor, if we were \nattempting to stall, there are a lot of other ways of doing that.\n  We had very short debates on these amendments. Any one of these \namendments, I say to the leader, could have taken all day, but we set \nreasonable times for our amendments and we voted on them. I think the \nrecord is very clear that we have tried to cooperate.\n  However, there is too much to do, and I think it is asking too much, \nespecially when we look down the road. I talked to one of my friends on \nthe other side of the aisle. If we don't do this pensions bill, we have \ntwo airline companies that are going to dump their pensions. Everyone \nknows it is Delta and Northwest Airlines. They are in bankruptcy. They \nare going to dump those pensions, affecting tens of thousands of people \nworking for those two airlines.\n  So no matter how strongly the Senator from Alaska feels about moving \nhis bill forward, we have a lot of other things to do that are \nextremely important also. We understand the importance of the fighting \nmen and women in this country, and we have been stalwarts in working \nwith the majority in taking care of the Defense authorization bill, \nwhich moved quite quickly, considering all of the other things we had \nto do at the time\n  So I say that we will continue plowing through these amendments, but \nwe won't finish them, no matter if we stay here all night.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I believe the various proposals are on the \ntable in terms of how we might spend the next 24 hours. I will talk to \nthe Democratic leader and we can talk to our colleagues. What I would \nsuggest is that we turn the podium and the floor back over to the \nmanagers and we proceed with the amendments. I think we have a couple \nof amendments that are ready to go, and then we will have more to say \nabout the schedule.\n  As it exists right now, unless there is some other agreement, we will \nbe voting on the Family Prosperity Act at around 9:30 in the morning, \nbut we may come to some other agreement in our conversations, and we \nwill continue to vote and keep plowing ahead on this particular bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4842\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask for the regular order, and I call up \namendment No. 4842, and I ask unanimous consent that Senator Ensign be \nadded as a cosponsor and indicate that I am ready to vote, and I do not \ncall for a rollcall vote or the yeas and nays at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona will suspend until we can hear from the \nSenator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, from what I understand, if the Senator \nwould defer for a moment, we are checking one item pertaining to that \namendment.\n  I have another managers' package, Mr. President. I will present it \nlater. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President. I am not sure what the status is \nnow. Is the regular order to take the vote on amendment No. 4842?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That amendment is pending.\n  Mr. KYL. As I said, Mr. President, I am prepared to vote and will not \ncall for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I think someone should explain the amendment.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am happy to explain this amendment.\n  This amendment deals with royalty relief and requires that the \nSecretary of the Interior put a price threshold on any royalty relief \nin the future and confirms his authority to have done so in the past.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am told it has been cleared by \nleadership on both sides, and under the circumstances I would ask for a \nvoice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4842) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider that action.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n    Amendments Nos. 4767, 4867, as Modified, 4757, and 4868, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, if the Senator from Michigan would allow \nme to, I will present a managers' package including amendment No. 4767, \nfor Senator Sessions, regarding body armor; amendment No. 4867, as \nmodified, for Senator Byrd, regarding Camp Perry; amendment No. 4757, \nfor Senator Santorum, regarding electromagnetic guns; and amendment No. \n4868, for Senator Clinton, regarding families of the Guard and Reserve.\n  I send these amendments to the desk, having been cleared on both \nsides, and I ask unanimous consent that these amendments be considered \nen bloc, agreed to en bloc, and that the motions to reconsider be laid \nupon the table en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

(a) The amount appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by this title is hereby increased by $200,000,000.\n       (b) Of the amount appropriated or otherwise made available \n     by this title, as increased by subsection (a), $200,000,000 \n     may be made available for humanitarian assistance, including \n     food, water, cooking fuel, shelter, medicine, and other \n     assistance, for the innocent Lebanese and Israeli civilians \n     who have been affected by the hostilities between Hezbollah \n     and the Government of Israel.\n       (c) The amount made available under subsection (a) is \n     designated as an emergency requirement pursuant to section \n     402 of S. Con. Res. 83 (109th Congress), the concurrent \n     resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2007, as made \n     applicable in the Senate by section 7035 of Public Law 109-\n     234.\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to \nprovide $200 million for humanitarian assistance to the innocent \nLebanese and Israeli citizens who have been caught in the hostilities \nbetween Hezbollah and Israel. The last 3 weeks have brought horrific \nbloodshed on both sides of the Israeli and Lebanese border. The \nSecretary of State has pledged $30 million in humanitarian aid. That is \na good first step, but considering the extent of the humanitarian \nsuffering in both Lebanon and Israel, it certainly is not enough.\n  On July 25, the U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon, Jeffrey Feltman, declared \na humanitarian emergency in Lebanon, and since that time the situation \nfor innocent people has worsened. The violence affects mothers and \nfathers and sisters and brothers and children and whole communities on \nboth sides who need our assistance. Many innocent Americans from both \nsides of the Israeli-Lebanon border have fled back to Michigan and to \nother places in the country to escape the violence.\n  Thousands of people from Michigan, including buses of schoolchildren \nwho went to Israel for a trip and thousands of people who went to \nLebanon for summer vacation, for weddings, for funerals, for the \nability to visit grandpa and grandma to have them see the new \ngrandchildren, and family members who are sharing with each other \nduring the summer, as we all do, found themselves caught in a situation \nthat was certainly unexpected when Hezbollah attacked Israel. Many \ncitizens have been able to escape the violence, but unfortunately some \nhave been too poor to relocate or frankly don't want to leave their \nhomes. Too many innocent people, families with elderly relatives, small \nchildren, have had a horrific front row seat to this conflict.\n  The Lebanese Government estimates there are 841 dead as of today, \n3,243 injured, and over 700,000 Lebanese civilians--one-quarter of the \npopulation of the country--have been displaced internally or to other \ncountries. The stories of innocent citizens have weighed heavily on me, \nand I believe we must do something to help them. I know my colleagues \nfeel that way as well.\n  In Israel, it is the same. There are 51 dead, and more than 300 \ncivilians have been wounded by rocket attacks. More than 500,000 \nIsraeli citizens are spending a significant amount of time in bomb \nshelters, their children terrified, with families trying to console \neach other in constant fear, terrorized by Hezbollah rockets.\n  I believe, and I hope my colleagues will agree, that the U.S. \nGovernment must assert its leadership at this critical point in time. \nIt must assert its leadership to stop the violence as soon as possible. \nWe must also make it clear that we will step forward as a country to \nprovide humanitarian aid at this critical time. So many people from \nthese two countries have friends and relatives here in America who are \ndesperately concerned about what is happening, who are asking us in \nAmerica to step up and to help.\n  Time is really of the essence. This is a critical time to both send \nthe dollars and send a message that we in America, with big hearts, are \nwilling to reach out and make a difference in terms of humanitarian aid \nthat is needed at this critical time. I hope my colleagues will join \nwith me in supporting this amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator from Michigan yield for a question?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I say through the Chair, I commend the \nSenator from Michigan. I know she has a substantial Lebanese population \nin her State. We have a substantial Lebanese population as well. They \nare fine people, good people, who have made a success here in America, \nproud of their heritage in Lebanon. They are following every day, every \nminute the news that is coming back that reminds us of the suffering \nthat is taking place both in Israel and in Lebanon.\n  I am glad the Senator from Michigan has addressed this issue. I would \nlike to ask the Senator this. I have prepared a bill, with Senator \nSununu and Senator Feingold as cosponsors, which addresses another \naspect of this issue. There are many Lebanese who are currently \nvisiting in the United States or studying in the United States here \nlegally on visas, whose visas may expire at any time--tomorrow or in \nthe next week or month. Many of them are concerned about being forced \nto return to a war zone, being asked to return to a place that may be \ndangerous.\n  We know we evacuated American citizens out of Lebanon for fear for \ntheir own safety and warned the others not to stay. We know many other \ncountries did the same.\n  I ask the Senator from Michigan, in addition to her excellent \namendment relative to humanitarian assistance for those both in Lebanon \nand Israel, does she feel this temporary protected status which we \nwould offer on a temporary basis should be expedited as well so these \nvisitors will have a chance, if they want, to stay in the United States \nin a safe place until the hostilities have ended?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank my friend and our leader from Illinois, and I \ncommend him for this legislation. In fact, I am proud to lend my name \nto the legislation. I hope we move urgently to let people know that \nthey will not be required to go home to a place where we have been \nevacuating thousands and thousands of people, sending ships in to \nevacuate Americans.\n  I must say, we have had over 25,000 people from Michigan alone. We \nhave seen over 13,000 come back. Those who are still there are \ndesperately concerned about their family members, not being able to \nhear from them. Often there is no phone, no computer. So the idea of \nsending people here back into that violence makes absolutely no sense.\n  I commend the Senator. I hope part of what we would do before we \nleave is to make it clear that we would not ask those innocent people \nto return to a war zone.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will further yield for a question through \nthe Chair, I am sure the Senator is aware that we have done this \nbefore. When people are visiting in the United States and hostilities \nbreak out in their homeland, we have offered them a chance to stay here \non a temporary basis.\n  I might add, there are safeguards built into this process. If there \nis anyone about whom we have a question as to whether or not they are \nsafe to remain in the United States, they will not receive this \ntemporary status.\n\n[[Page S8715]]\n\nThat goes without saying. We want to make certain that the people who \nremain here are truly those innocent travelers--students, members of \nfamilies--who are concerned about whether returning home could endanger \nthem or people who are here.\n  I ask the Senator from Michigan, if we are in a predicament where a \nfamily is here visiting their relatives in Chicago or Detroit and they \nhave small children and they are from one of the parts of southern \nLebanon that has been under fire, does it not stand to reason that we \nas a compassionate people would say to them: You can wait. Stay with \nyour family. We are not going to force you to leave. We have done this \nin the past, and I hope the Senator from Michigan believes, as I do, \nthat it is reasonable to do it under these circumstances.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I say to my friend from Illinois, I could not agree \nmore. When you talk about people who come to visit, I think about the \ngroup of families and children I met with on Saturday who actually came \nhome from Lebanon--escaped, essentially--but were talking about their \nfamily members who are here. Bint Jbeil--that is the town in southern \nLebanon where they identified a Hezbollah stronghold--is also a place \nthat 15,000 people in Michigan call their hometown. People have come to \nvisit in the summer, to do the things that we all do: to go to the \nfamily wedding, to visit grandpa and grandma; as older citizens, coming \nto visit the grandchildren. There are all kinds of families who come \nback and forth all the time. That we would have people that are here be \nforced to go back to a war zone is really unthinkable.\n\n  I commend again our distinguished Senator from Illinois for his \nleadership, focusing on this issue which is so critical. I hope we \nwould in fact bring that bill before the Senate for a vote or seek \nunanimous consent before we leave. It is absolutely critical.\n  I hope, again, we are going to make it clear that for those, whether \nthey are in Lebanon or Israel, who have found themselves without any \nprior warning to be in a situation where they are innocently caught in \nthe violence that has occurred, we, as Americans, need to do what we \nknow how to do, which is to reach out and to help and be a part of a \nworldwide humanitarian effort. We need to address those issues--whether \nit is food, clothing, shelter, crucial issues to so many people, tens \nof thousands of people, probably hundreds of thousands, who find \nthemselves in a situation where they are looking around for someone to \nhelp them.\n  America needs to be an important leader in lending our support. I am \nhopeful this amendment of $200 million will be included as an emergency \nspending category in this legislation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be added as a \ncosponsor to the pending amendment by the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to finish the comments I made about this \ntemporary protected status so the record is clear for colleagues who \nare following this important debate--and particularly our Lebanese-\nAmerican friends who are watching this, I am sure, with great interest, \nbecause of the efforts of the Senator from Michigan--I would like to \nput in the Record at this point that in 1990, Congress enacted the \nTemporary Protected Status Statute. It grants that for 1 year nationals \nfrom El Salvador who were residing in the United States the right to \nstay. That was done of course because of hostilities.\n  After that, the Attorney General, administratively, in consultation \nwith the State Department, granted this as well to residents from the \nfollowing countries: Kuwait, Rwanda, Lebanon--this was during the \nperiod from 1991 to March of 1993--Kosovo, the provinces of Serbia, \nBosnia, and Herzegovina, and Angola and Sierra Leon.\n  I might also say to the Senator from Michigan, what we are hoping to \nadd, as a separate bill that might pass independently or be part of \nthis bill, is consistent with what we are currently doing. We have \noffered this temporary relief from deportation or temporary protected \nstatus to those who are from the countries of Burundi, El Salvador, \nHonduras, Liberia, Nicaragua, Somalia, and Sudan.\n  The reason I raise these issues is I want all my colleagues to know \nwhat we are suggesting is entirely consistent with the values of \nprevious administrations of both political parties. It is an act of \ncompassion and humanitarianism which I think reflects well on the \nUnited States, as does the amendment by the Senator from Michigan.\n  This may not be in the form of a question--it might not qualify for \n``Jeopardy''--but I say to her: I commend her for her humanitarian \nassistance, and I hope she will join us in helping to pass the other \namendment as a separate issue.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I want to join, as the ranking member of the Immigration \nand Refugee Committee, in support of what the Senator from Illinois has \nstated. The idea of temporary status has been longstanding. We have \nextended it in circumstances which do not even compare to the \nconditions that we have seen now in Lebanon. So I have joined being a \ncosponsor of that amendment.\n  It can be done administratively, as the Senator from Illinois and \nothers have pointed out. We certainly welcome that. If you look back in \nthe history of that, you will find that legislation in a number of \ninstances was introduced and then the administration moved, and moved \nrapidly, when it was brought to their attention. That certainly ought \nto be done now in the most expeditious way.\n  Second, I welcome the opportunity to join the Senator on the \nhumanitarian aid and assistance. We had an opportunity to talk to the \nrepresentatives of the NGOs on several different occasions over the \nperiod of these past days, as well as with the representatives of the \nIsraeli Government. There is a process now to try to extend \nhumanitarian aid and assistance--both from the point of view of the \nIsraeli Government but also in support of U.N. agencies and \nnongovernmental agencies.\n  There are supplies that are in the area that need to get through. I \nthink that needs focus and attention and support by all of the \ninterested parties. But what we are basically talking about with the \nDefense appropriations is hopefully there will be a meaningful cease-\nfire that will take place. What the Senator from Michigan is talking \nabout now is to reflect the concern for Lebanon and what has happened \nto that country, reflecting the fact that we here ought to extend \nhumanitarian aid and assistance.\n  I commend her. I think this makes a great deal of sense. I hope the \namendment will be accepted.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Reclaiming my time, Mr. President, and I thank my \ncolleague from Massachusetts very much, let me also just say when it \ncomes to the temporary protected status, the legislation the Senator \nfrom Illinois has spoken about, I would add one more occasion recently \nin which we moved in this direction.\n  On another piece of legislation, Senator Levin and I offered an \namendment that was accepted by this Senate to address the concerns of \nthose from Iraq who are in the Chaldean community, who are Christians \nin Iraq, who are truly the true minority religious community in Iraq, \nand concerns that those who are here, who are Chaldeans, do not have to \nbe returned now that Saddam Hussein is no longer in power because they \nin fact continue to find themselves in a situation of religious \npersecution.\n  So we have passed that in another bill, supported by colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle, which continues the whole premise of making \nsure that while those who are here on a temporary legal status would \nnot be required to return if, in fact, their lives are in jeopardy; if \nwe are putting them back into a danger zone.\n  I wholeheartedly agree and appreciate what the Senator from Illinois \nhas done.\n  I once again ask colleagues--I see my friend from New Hampshire on \nthe floor so I will bring this to a close. I am hopeful that we will \ncome together and that we could unanimously move\n\n[[Page S8716]]\n\nforward in this effort to provide humanitarian assistance to those in \nLebanon and in Israel who are innocent citizens, caught in the middle \nof the violence that has occurred.\n  Many, many people have suffered. I hope we will send a strong message \nthat we will stand with those who are working very hard to bring \nhumanitarian assistance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nLandrieu of Louisiana be added as a cosponsor of amendment No. 2724.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I very much appreciate what the Senator \nfrom Michigan is trying to do with the amendment. We have seen vivid \nimages on television that depict the impact and destruction of the \ninfrastructure--bridges, powerplants, the airport in Beirut, and, of \ncourse, the huge civilian toll that has been taken in Lebanon.\n  We all understand there is going to be a real need, and an immediate \nneed, for humanitarian assistance. The State Department has taken steps \nto provide resources and assistance both in funding and material in the \npipeline. But there is no question that additional funding is going to \nbe needed in order to help the Government of Lebanon and the people of \nLebanon rebuild and establish normalcy once again, in addition to all \nthe assistance and work that will be done to ensure not just a strong \ngovernment but compliance with U.N. resolutions, the demilitarization \nof Hezbollah, which is going to be so important to that country.\n  The Senator from Michigan, the Senator from Illinois, and others have \nalso worked with the State Department to ensure that there are \nhumanitarian corridors available to get assistance to those towns and \nvillages in southern Lebanon that have been most heavily hit in terms \nof civilian casualties.\n  We need resources and funding. We need material, but we also need \nthose humanitarian corridors.\n  I want to specifically speak a little bit about the protective status \nlegislation that I cosponsored with Senator Durbin and others. This is \nessential to send the right message to the Lebanese people and to the \nworld that we are not going to send immigrants back into a war zone \nsimply because their immigration status has changed. This is a \ntemporary measure but an absolutely crucial one. It is the right thing \nto do while the fighting in southern Lebanon rages on.\n  We have funding needs, we have needs for humanitarian corridors, we \nhave needs for protective status. All of these are essential if we are \ngoing to put Lebanon on the path to a peaceful resolution to their \nsituation.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the bilateral assistance account has $4 \nbillion in it. The Economic Support Fund has $12 billion in it. I am \ntalking about in the fiscal year we are in right now. There is no shown \nneed for additional moneys to assist the State Department. The State \nDepartment has an enormous amount of funds set aside for such cases. It \nhas an international disaster and famine assistance account, the \nemergency refugees and migration assistance account. We have no reports \nat all that the administration and all of the people involved in all of \nthese activities have run out of money. Even if they did, if they are \nclose to that, the foreign assistance bill will be before us in \nSeptember that deals with these various sums.\n  The Stabenow amendment causes the bill to violate its 302(b) \nallocation by providing $200 million, if the emergency designation is \nnot removed.\n  This is a rule XVI problem. This is not authorized. There are \nspecific accounts already authorized, as I have said. There is existing \nfor this fiscal year alone $6 billion involved in the area which could \nprovide assistance.\n  I raise a point of order that this violates rule XVI.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is sustained, and the \namendment falls\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Alaska if he \nwould join us in working through those accounts to make sure that the \ndollars are, in fact, available. We understand that an amount has been \nidentified of possibly $300 million needed, at least by the State \nDepartment. It is my understanding about $100 million has been pledged \nby other countries, leaving a $200 million gap.\n  I ask the chairman if he would work with myself and others who care \ndeeply about this to identify specific funds to be able to go toward \nthis desperately needed humanitarian effort.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I would be happy to author along with the Senator a \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution that the administration should proceed \nas rapidly as possible to use the funds which are in existence now and, \nif they are not sufficient, to submit a request for those funds.\n  I am not against the funds, but I believe that bill is coming along. \nThe Appropriations Committee is coming along. It has a substantial \namount of money in it this year. I don't see the need to add it to this \nbill.\n  If this amendment were agreed to, it would mean that we would have to \nconfer with even another committee when we get back in September in \norder to satisfy the necessity to get a conference report to the \nPresident in time.\n  I reluctantly raised this point of order.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Michigan to provide $200 million in \nemergency humanitarian and reconstruction aid to Lebanese and Israeli \ncivilians affected by the conflict between Hezbollah and Israel.\n  I commend Senator Stabenow for this amendment. If this conflict and \nthe terrible loss of innocent lives and destruction of civilian \ninfrastructure in Lebanon and Israel had occurred three months ago when \nwe were debating the fiscal year 2006 emergency supplemental, there \nwould have been no question that we would have included this aid.\n  To date, the U.S. Government has pledged $30 million in humanitarian \naid to Lebanon. While welcome, this is only a tiny fraction of what is \nneeded.\n  Over 900,000 Lebanese citizens--one in five--have fled their homes \nand are either displaced in Lebanon, living in schools and public \nbuildings, or are refugees in Syria. Estimates are that 200,000 people \nare in immediate need of humanitarian aid including food, water, fuel, \nshelter and medical care.\n  Basic goods are in short supply and hospitals in the south of Lebanon \nare facing electricity and water shortages. Just getting access to \npeople who are in the greatest need has been a difficult challenge for \nrelief organizations.\n  The United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross \nhave been doing their best to evacuate people and deliver medical \nsupplies, shelter materials, and food to affected people in southern \nLebanon.\n  Current estimates are that at least $300 million will be needed in \nthe next 3 months to meet their basic needs.\n  The international community has pledged assistance, but if past \npractice is any indicator, pledges often do not turn into actual \ncontributions.\n  This additional $200 million in humanitarian and reconstruction aid \nwould demonstrate the commitment of the United States to help the \ninnocent victims on both sides of this conflict.\n  The funds should be used by USAID's Office of Foreign Disaster \nAssistance and the State Department's Bureau of Population, Refugees \nand Migration, which have already depleted much of their available \nfunds and without this amendment will be forced to rob funds that are \nneeded to respond to other humanitarian disasters--in Darfur, the Horn \nof Africa, and elsewhere.\n  I thank the Senator from Michigan for offering this amendment and \nurge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4863\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I call up my amendment, which is at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. The assistant \nlegislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Menendez] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4863.\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S8717]]\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To make available from Operation and Maintenance, Navy, up to \n an additional $3,000,000 to fund improvements to physical security at \n         Navy recruiting stations and to improve data security)\n\n       At the end of title VIII, add the following:\n       Sec. 8109. Of the amount appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by title II under the heading ``Operation and \n     Maintenance, Navy'', up to $3,000,000 may be available to the \n     Navy to fund improvements to physical security at Navy \n     recruiting stations and to improve data security.\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, this amendment is in response to some \nbreaches in our security as they relate to critical information about \nrecruits that we are seeking in the Armed Services of the United \nStates.\n  In May of this year, we learned about the security breach at the \nVeterans' Administration that jeopardized the personnel records of 26.5 \nmillion of our Nation's veterans. Fortunately, the stolen laptop that \ncontained this information was recovered, but we know this is not an \nisolated incident.\n  In June of this year, nearly 28,000 Navy sailors and their family \nmembers had their information compromised when it was posted on a Web \nsite. Information, including their names, Social Security numbers, and \nbirth dates was on line for anyone to see and use for any nefarious \npurpose. Millions of people had access to the most sensitive personal \ninformation, and the long-term damage that it may have caused cannot be \nmeasured.\n  But the security failures don't end there. Just last week, we learned \nthat in my home State of New Jersey, two laptop computers were stolen \nfrom Navy officers. These computers contained the personal information \nof some 31,000 Navy recruiters and applicants. The theft jeopardized \npotentially the security of thousands of New Jerseyans, including high \nschool students who were actively being recruited.\n  Our country has some very strict laws to protect minors, but all of \nthese efforts are meaningless if criminals can easily get their hands \non the names and personal information of our young people by simply \nsnatching a laptop.\n  Senator Lautenberg and I wrote a letter to the Secretary of the Navy \nrequesting a full accounting on how the theft occurred and the action \nthe Navy has taken in response. The Navy came to my office and briefed \nus about where they are in this process. They are having a full \ninvestigation. But during the course of that discussion, it became \nrather clear to me that, in fact, they need assistance in trying to \nimprove the physical security at these Navy recruiting stations, and \nalso to improve data security.\n  In view of what we learned during the course of these discussions, we \ncome to the Senate floor because we believe that this is something that \nis incredibly important. If you are going to recruit people from our \ncommunities and say come join the Armed Services of the United States, \nin this case the Navy, and we ask for critical information from them as \nthey make a decision to join, or to be considered and to be further \nrecruited, we want people to have confidence that the critical \ninformation they give about themselves--Social Security number, birth \ndate, and other critical information--is ultimately secure, that they \ncan feel secure that the information will be secure.\n  It is very important when we see these breaches that have taken place \nto, in fact, move forward in a way that helps us give people a sense of \nsatisfaction that when they go to a recruiting entity, regardless of \nwhich branch of the service it is, that, in fact, the information they \ngive will be secure.\n  We know identity theft jeopardizes one's financial future, personal \nsafety, and constitutional right to privacy, and allowing it to happen \nto men and women who seek to serve in our military is absolutely \nunacceptable\n  We believe our amendment, which basically makes available from the \noperation and maintenance of the Navy, up to an additional $3 million \nto fund improvements to physical security at Navy recruiting stations \nand to improve data security is, in fact, critically important. We \nspecifically note the Navy because it was in June and July of this year \nthat we have seen two breaches of security.\n  I think it is important to ensure that at a time in which we are \nalready pretty dramatically stretched in terms of the Armed Forces of \nthe United States, and we are asking Americans to consider joining the \nservices, we are going to provide them a guarantee that their personal \ninformation, critical personal information, does not become public \ninformation, information that can ultimately dramatically affect them.\n  This amendment basically would move in the direction of trying to \nensure that these Navy recruiting sites where this information is often \nkept--because it is the first source of where the recruiting goes on \nbetween, in this case, the Navy and those in the communities in which \nthe stations find themselves--can be secure so that we do not \nexperience what we experienced in New Jersey last week.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we are prepared to accept the amendment. \nIf the Senator wants the yeas and nays, he is entitled to them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator withdraw the request?\n  Mr. REID. No.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is now a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I think we have to have some time to \nnotify people when the vote is going to take place. I ask the \ncloakrooms to tell us what time to have this amendment voted on.\n  There have been 114 amendments filed on this bill so far. We have \ntaken care of five of them in the managers' packages and several of \nthem in the form of colloquies that have satisfied the issue raised by \nthe amendments. Seven have been voted on or have been withdrawn because \nof a point of order under rule XVI.\n  I believe we have about 20 active amendments still pending before us.\n  I still say it is possible that we could finish tonight, if we wanted \nto. It is a leadership decision. I am not the leader. If the leaders \nmake the decision that we will not finish tonight, that is fine for me. \nBut for now, we are prepared to accept this amendment. I have no debate \nagainst it.\n  I ask that the rollcall commence at any time the leader says it \nshould be. I would say we ought to have at least 10 minutes of debate \nbefore we vote on it. I know some people are having dinner and will \nhave to come back.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the vote commence at 8 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the only thing I ask is that the \ndistinguished manager of the bill amend his consent to indicate there \nwill be no second-degree amendments in order prior to the vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I agree to that, and I make that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Any other pending amendments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The only amendment pending is 4863, the \nMenendez amendment, which is, under the previous order, to be voted on \nat 8 o'clock.\n  The hour of 8 p.m. having arrived, under the previous order, the \nquestion is on agreeing to the Menendez amendment. The yeas and nays \nhave been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senators were necessarily absent: the \nSenator from New Mexico (Mr. Domenici) and the Senator from Mississippi \n(Mr. Lott).\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Montana (Mr. Baucus) and \nthe Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Lieberman) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to reconsider the vote and to lay that motion on \nthe table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                   Waste Management on Military Bases\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I request to engage Senator Alexander in a \ncolloquy about the costs and methods of managing waste on military \nbases. I ask my friend if he shares my conclusion that it would be \nprudent for the Department of Defense to consider a variety of options \nwhen dealing with municipal solid waste on military bases. Waste \nremoval currently consumes significant sums of defense spending, and \nsignificant cost savings from improved waste management could be \napplied to critical defense needs. Military bases on islands, where \nwaste is usually removed by barge, suffer acute cost and space \nchallenges.\n  New technologies are giving the Department of Defense better waste \nmanagement options on military bases and creating new choices to re-use \nand recycle waste. Currently there is a development project under \nconsideration at Fort Campbell that uses a continuous flow process that \nrecycles 90 percent of municipal solid waste (MSW) without any \nseparation prior to processing. In fact, testing at Fort Campbell in \n2001 and Fort Benning 2002 demonstrated the feasibility of the \ntechnology and that the process and products made from the derivative \nfrom this waste processing technique were safe and highly effective as \na soil application at DoD test and training ranges. It is my hope that \nthe Department of Defense will consider this process of managing \nmunicipal solid waste as it looks to streamline its operational costs. \nDoes my friend from Tennessee agree with this assessment that the \nDepartment of Defense should consider this as an option for waste \nmanagement?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank my friend from Tennessee and agree that the \nDepartment of Defense should consider all options when managing \nmunicipal waste on military bases and facilities. The waste management \ntesting that my colleague from Tennessee references suggests that waste \nmanagement costs for military bases can be reduced over the long term \nand that landfill space needs can be greatly reduced. The technology in \nquestion addresses two major needs faced by our military bases.\n  First, all bases produce large amounts of municipal solid waste, \nwhich is sent to a declining number of landfills. Executive Order 13101 \ndirects the Department of Defense to develop targets for landfill \ndiversion and directs the Department of Defense, along with other \nFederal agencies, to take the lead in pollution prevention efforts.\n  The second need is military test and training ranges, which are often \nseverely depleted of vegetation. The resulting soil erosion and \nincrease of dust in the air impairs our ability to rapidly train \nmilitary forces at these facilities, and the application of sterilized, \nprocessed waste to vegetation depleted training grounds can reduce \nerosion and airborne dust. This technology could solve both problems, \nand I agree with my friend from Tennessee that this process should be \nconsidered by the Department of Defense when examining base waste \nmanagement and overall facilities operations.\n\n\n        northern california institute for research and education\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, Senator Feinstein and I would like to \nthank the Senator from Alaska and the Senator from Hawaii for their \noutstanding leadership on this bill and especially for their dedication \nto ensuring that our Nation's combat-wounded service members receive \nthe best possible services and care.\n  I would like to ask both Senators to work with us during conference \nnegotiations in support of funding for the Northern California \nInstitute of Research and Education, NCIRE.\n  This funding will support the work of the Neuroscience Center of \nExcellence at the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center--a \nstate-of-the-art facility dedicated to the diagnosis, prevention, and \nmanagement of neurodegenerative diseases, brain and spinal cord \ninjuries, and neuropsychiatric disorders such as post-traumatic stress \ndisorder, PTSD, that occur in U.S. warfighters.\n  I had the privilege of recently visiting NCIRE. Let me tell you, the \nwork they are doing is cutting-edge and absolutely vital to our \nNation's warfighters and veterans. They are developing new ways to \ndiagnose and treat PTSD in an effort to ensure that our more recent \nveterans do not share the same fate as so many of those from earlier \nconflicts, including Vietnam. I had the honor of meeting a Vietnam \nveteran during my visit to NCIRE who told me that he just got his life \nback because of NCIRE's work. This is a man who served his country and \ncame back to spend much of his time jobless, homeless, and without \nhope. NCIRE is working to make sure that our Iraq and Afghanistan \nveterans do not share the same fate.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I share my home State colleague's support for the \ngreat work the Northern California Institute for Research and Education \nis doing on behalf of our veterans. NCIRE was founded in 1988 to \nadminister research at the San Francisco VA Medical Center. It is the \nlargest of over 90 nonprofit research institutes associated with the \nVA. It is also designated as a Department of Defense Center of \nExcellence in Neuroscience and Neuroimaging for its work benefiting our \nmore recent veterans, including gulf war illness, post-traumatic stress \ndisorder, neurotrauma and closed-head injury resulting from combat.\n  The Neuroscience Center of Excellence is the VA's premier research \ninstrument for neurodegenerative diseases and brings together VA and \nDefense resources to conduct medical research in the areas most \nimportant for our active military and veterans. Research in \nneuroimaging, neuropsychiatry and basic neuroscience is targeted at \ndiagnosis, prevention and management of neurodegenerative diseases, \nbrain and spinal cord injuries, and neuropsychiatric disorders such as \npost-traumatic stress disorder.\n  In the near future, NCIRE will be working to enhance high-resolution \nimaging strategies to predict and prevent combat-related damage to the \nbrain and the nervous system, expand neuropsychiatric studies into \nPTSD, and understanding of vulnerabilities to PTSD and its effect on \ncombat performance.\n  I would note that the House version of this bill provides $4 million \nfor the Neuroscience Center of Excellence's research in neuroimaging \nand neuropsychiatric trauma in U.S. warfighters. I understand the \nchairman's concern about the growth of health research spending in this \nbill, but would point out that this facility is designated as a DoD \nCenter of Excellence.\n  I look forward to working with Chairman Stevens and Senator Inouye as \nwe go to conference. It is my hope that we can work together to support \nthis important funding provided in the House version of this bill.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I share my colleagues' interest in ensuring that our \nactive military and veterans receive the best health care possible. I \nam hapy to work with them as we move this legislation through \nconference.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I concur with the chairman. The Senators have my \ncommitment that I will work with them on\n\n[[Page S8719]]\n\nthis important funding during conference negotiations.\n\n\n                   KC-135 Tanker Replacement Program\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the subject of \nthe Air Force's KC-135 Tanker Replacement Program. Like my colleagues, \none of my top priorities is to keep our Nation safe, and I am working \nto ensure that our servicemembers have the best equipment possible. Our \nAir Force has a fleet of aging refueling tankers that are currently \nexperiencing problems. I simply do not believe we can wait 35 years to \nreplace them.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I agree with the senior Senator from \nAlabama. Our warfighters need air refueling tankers to ensure that the \nUnited States can keep both our military and humanitarian commitments \nabroad. It is critical that our armed forces have the equipment to \nrespond quickly and in force. However, the Defense Subcommittee's \nallocation was $9 billion less than the President's budget. Tough \nchoices had to be made. The Tanker Replacement Program was deemed to \nhave sufficient funds from previous years, given the schedule delays \nthat will impact fiscal year 2007.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, as we move towards conference on the \nfiscal year 2007 Defense appropriations and authorization bills, it has \ncome to my attention that the authorizers and appropriators may be \nreceiving differing information regarding the necessity for funding in \nfiscal year 2007. I have a letter from the Air Force's Deputy for \nBudget dated August 2, 2006, stating that the Air Force needs a minimum \nof $70 million in research, development, test & evaluation funds for \nfiscal year 2007 in addition to the funds remaining in the tanker \ntransfer fund. I want to make certain that both the Armed Services \nCommittee and Defense Subcommittee on Appropriations are receiving \nidentical funding information from the Air Force. To that end, I am \ncommitted to working with my colleagues to ensure that we are all \nreceiving the same information and have the same understanding of the \nneeds for this program to move forward.\n  Further, Mr. President, while I understand that the subcommittee's \nrecommendation to reduce funding was based upon their belief that there \nare sufficient funds remaining in fiscal year 2005 and 2006 to support \nsystems development and demonstration, the Air Force has stated that \nthey would need at least $70 million in fiscal year 2007 to move \nforward and award a contract in 2007. I greatly appreciate Chairman \nStevens' assistance with this program and look forward to continuing to \nwork with him to replace our aging tanker fleet.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I whole-heartedly agree with my colleague \nfrom Alabama that it is essential that we all have the same \nunderstanding of the requirements for this program. In March 2006, the \nAir Force indicated that, among other things, tanker replacement monies \nin fiscal year 2007 would be ``early to need.'' Thus, by the Air \nForce's own estimate, there is no need for additional funds for fiscal \nyear 2007. I do support the Department of Defense's interest in \nrecapitalizing its fleet of aging tankers. However, we need to ensure \nthat the Air Force is committed to full and open competition on the \nprogram. To protect taxpayers' interests and national security, the Air \nForce must exercise a competition that is straightforward and \ntraditional. In particular, the Air Force should rigorously follow an \nacquisition process based on established legal and regulatory \nguidelines, specifically setting aside any factors from its procurement \nevaluation that may improperly eliminate competition before bids are \nactually submitted. Our Armed Forces need the best tanker solution \npossible, and that means that any source with a reliable, high quality \nproduct that can provide aerial refueling services in a timely and \ncost-effective fashion, should be considered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleagues from \nAlaska and Arizona.\n\n\n                      vaccine health care centers\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and ranking member for \ntaking the time to discuss an issue that is very important to me and to \nthe well-being of our military personnel.\n  As both of you well know, the military today relies on vaccines as an \nelement of force protection. In order to keep our military healthy and \nto protect against biological threats, we require personnel to be \nvaccinated. These vaccines are generally considered to be ``safe'', but \nthey are still drugs that are put into the body. As such, there are \nalways a small number of personnel that have adverse reactions.\n  These personnel are our responsibility. While serving their Nation, \nthey are required to take these vaccinations. If they are made ill by \nthat requirement, we must give them the best possible care, just as we \ndo for those who lose a limb serving the Nation.\n  In 2001, Congress recognized that we needed to develop specific \nexpertise for treating these rare and complicated cases and created the \nvaccine health care centers. Last year, the vaccine health care centers \ntreated 708 personnel. That is a caseload increase of 83 percent since \nthey began operations in 2001.\n  Today, the centers are unique in the Nation for their expertise in \nadult vaccinations and adverse reactions to them. They are a critical \ncomponent of force protection, assuring our military personnel that if \nthey become ill from a mandatory vaccination, they will get adequate \ncare.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I want to thank my colleague for again raising this \nimportant issue. He has been a consistent advocate of our need to care \nfor those injured by mandatory vaccines. The vaccine health care \ncenters are a vital component in regular force protection. The centers \nhelp military medical providers administer vaccines in the most \neffective and safe manner and they provide expert care for that small \nnumber of personnel who have complicated adverse reactions.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I want to also thank my colleague for including $2 million \nspecifically for the vaccine health care centers in the fiscal year \n2007 Defense appropriations bill. I believe it was the committee's \nintent, in a difficult budget year, to show their support for keeping \nthe centers intact pending the GAO report expected in mid-fiscal year \n2007. Is that correct?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes. In the past, the centers have been funded with \nsupplemental funds. Last year we provided a portion of the funding in \nthe regular budget and sought to show our support again this year. We \nunderstand that in the past, the Army has used supplemental funds to \nhelp cover the annual operating costs of all the centers, which is \napproximately $6 million. This year, we sought to provide some \nassistance by designating a portion of the regular budget in fiscal \nyear 2007, $2 million, for the vaccine health care centers. It is not \nmeant to be a cap on what can and should be spent.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank my colleague. It was also my understanding, based \non discussions during consideration of the last supplemental in the \nspring, that the military was fully committed to retaining the complete \ncapabilities of the vaccine health care centers in their current form \npending the completion of the GAO report.\n  As my friend knows, Congress would also like to see a plan from the \nDepartment of Defense for meeting this need. On this year's Defense \nauthorization bill, the Senate agreed unanimous to my amendment \nprohibiting the restructuring or downsizing of the current vaccine \nhealth care centers until the Department provides Congress with a \nreport outlining their plans to meet the needs of our military \npersonnel for pre- and post-vaccination care over the next decade.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Again, I agree with my colleague. I understand the \nDepartment of the Army has covered the costs of operating all these \ncenters, even though some are located on Air Force and Navy \ninstallations. It is my hope that the Assistant Secretary for Health \nAffairs for the Office of the Secretary of Defense can provide that \nplan and look at how to support and maintain the vaccine health care \ncenters in a joint setting. It was the committee's understanding that \nthese centers would be fully funded and kept intact pending the report \nfrom GAO.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I would ask both of my friends if they are committed to \nensuring that happens?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Yes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank my colleagues for their assistance. I hope that \nnext year we will have a comprehensive and\n\n[[Page S8720]]\n\nuseful GAO report and a DOD report that will help us ensure that we are \nmeeting the unique force protection needs created by mandatory \nvaccinations in the best possible way. Until then, I greatly appreciate \ntheir commitment to ensuring that we do not lose the capabilities that \nhave been established to date and are regularly utilized by our \nmilitary personnel.\n\n\n                     funds for improving polygraphs\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I engage my colleague the distinguished \nchairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee in a short colloquy \nto clarify the intended use of funds provided in the fiscal year 2007 \nDepartment of Defense appropriations bills.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I would be glad to engage in a colloquy with my friend \nthe distinguished senior Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the current standard in polygraph use is \nwoefully inadequate. Last year's Defense appropriations bill included \nfunding for a project that would improve the use of polygraphs within \nthe Department of Defense. The project will ultimately benefit all \ninstitutions that use polygraphs to assure security. The project \nresearch will lead to the polygraph becoming a fully standardized, \nmachine administered, scientifically based test, thus getting rid of \nthe flaws that are inherent in the current use of polygraphs. Boise \nState University in my home State of Idaho is well qualified to do this \nresearch and develop the standardized technology. It is my hope that \nthe funds that were appropriated in fiscal year 2006 will be made \navailable soon and that the funds in the fiscal year 2007 Senate \ndefense appropriations bill will be available to continue the work that \nwill begin with last year's appropriation. Is it the expectation of the \ndistinguished Chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee that \nthe Department of Defense make last year's funds available as soon as \npossible to assure that this important research goes forward and that \nfiscal year 2007 funds be used to continue this important work?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator raises a valid concern. It is this \nchairman's expectation that the funds provided by our subcommittee in \nlast year's bill be made available quickly by the Department of Defense \nand that this important research be conducted in an expedient manner.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank my colleague from Alaska for clarifying this point \nand for his interest in this issue.\n\n\n                                 LUPUS\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I wish to speak about lupus, a chronic \nand devastating autoimmune disease which affects a growing number of \nmilitary personnel, their family members, and veterans. I would like to \nhave this disease included in the Department of Defense Peer Reviewed \nMedical Research Program. I am glad to see my friend Chairman Stevens \nis on the floor to discuss this issue with me.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am happy to discuss this program with the Senator from \nNew York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. For the past 2 years, Congress has included lupus as one \nof the diseases eligible for research funding through this highly \nregarded DOD program. This program has proven effective in filling \nessential gaps in research efforts funded by private industry and other \npublic sources.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator from New York is correct. This disease has \nbeen listed in the program by the Congress for priority consideration.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. This disease predominantly affects women and African \nAmericans, which are a growing demographic in today's military. This \ndebilitating disease damages vital organs and can cause disability or \neven death. Despite its prevalence and seriousness, lupus is \nnotoriously difficult to diagnose, and no new treatments have been \ndeveloped in more than 25 years.\n  Chairman Stevens, because of the expert research that is conducted in \nthis area through the Peer Reviewed Medical Research Program, I hope \nyou agree, and support adding lupus to the list of diseases eligible \nfor funding under the DOD Peer Reviewed Medical Research Program.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I assure the Senator from New York I will do everything \nI can in conference to add this disease to the peer reviewed medical \nresearch list for consideration by the Department of Defense.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the chairman for his commitment.\n\n\n                      TISSUE ENGINEERING RESEARCH\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I wish to engage in a brief colloquy \nwith the distinguished chairman of the Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee regarding innovative research being used to treat our \nsoldiers.\n  Tissue engineers in the U.S. are applying principles of biology and \nengineering to grow human replacement tissue for virtually every part \nof the human body--tissues that will replace those damaged by disease \nor injury. Recently, enormous national attention was focused on the \ncreation of fully functioning tissue-engineered bladders--bladders \ngrown in the laboratory and implanted in children with spina bifida. \nOne day, tissue engineering may eliminate the need for organ \ntransplantation. In the near term, this exciting field of biomedicine \nhas developed several products for immediate use, some of which have \nimportant implications for wounded military personnel.\n  Novel biological scaffolds for wound treatment are being developed to \neliminate the need for skin grafts. The work is based upon extensive \npreliminary research that shows biologic scaffolds from extracellular \nmatrix--a component of virtually every tissue--can promote tissue \ngrowth that very closely resembles tissue regeneration. The scaffolds, \ncalled urinary bladder matrix, or UMB, have two ``layers'': a membrane \nsurface upon which skin cells may grow and differentiate quite readily \nand a lower surface that may integrate well into the underlying wound \nbed. This UBM scaffold represents new hope for soldiers who have a need \nfor skin grafts.\n  A significant amount of this work is being done at the Pittsburgh \nTissue Engineering Initiative's Soldier Treatment and Regeneration \nConsortium, STRaC. The potential benefits of this research are \nboundless, and I am proud to have consistently supported STRaC and its \nmission. I thank the distinguished Chairman for his past support of \nthis research.\n  As part of this initiative, scientists are working to develop a \ntissue-engineered ear utilizing a patient's own cells to grow a \nreplacement ear for one severely damaged in combat in Iraq. In the \nfirst phase of this 12-month project a small biopsy of healthy tissue \nwill be taken and, using known techniques, scientists will isolate \ncells and from them millions of additional cells will be grown in the \nlab. A specially modified scaffold prepared from an FDA-approved \nimplant will be ``seeded'' with these cells. After biocompatibility and \nlong-term durability of this implant are established in an animal \nmodel, a biopsy will be taken from a soldier currently awaiting \ntreatment at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio. Cartilage and \nskin cells will be used to create a patient-specific ear replacement. \nThese techniques are expected to be useful in replacement therapies for \nnumerous other body parts for our soldiers returning from Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  Mr. President, I will ask unanimous consent that a letter be printed \nin the Record from COL John Holcomb, Commander of the U.S. Army \nInstitute of Surgical Research at Fort Sam Houston, TX, that expresses \nhis views on this line of research. Colonel Holcomb's facility is the \nprimary receiving site for all significantly burned casualties from the \nwar in Iraq. He stipulates that integrating the opportunities currently \nunderway in regenerative medicine are important for both short- and \nlong-term advances for military medical research and clinical care.\n  Mr. President, I ask the distinguished chairman of the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee to comment on the research that I have \ndescribed and which the Army has been using to the benefit of our men \nand women returning from Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the research the Senator from \nPennsylvania is describing is exactly the reason that the committee \nprovided $45 million for the Peer Reviewed Medical Research Program. We \nneed to get innovative treatments to our men and women in uniform as \nquickly as possible. I urge the Department to give the tissue \nengineering research proposal described by the Senator from \nPennsylvania full and fair consideration.\n\n[[Page S8721]]\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask unanimous consent that the letter to which I \nreferred be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Department of the Army, U.S. Army Institute of Surgical \n           Research,\n                              Fort Sam Houston, TX, July 24, 2006.\n     Dr. Alan Russell,\n     Director, Institute for Regenerative Medicine, University of \n         Pittsburgh School of Medicine Pittsburgh, PA.\n       Dear Dr. Russell: I am writing to share with you our \n     continuing interests in your work on Regenerative Medicine. I \n     am the Commander of the US Army Institute of Surgical \n     Research at Fort Sam Houston, Texas and the Army Surgeons \n     General Trauma Consultant. I have been in Iraq 8 times since \n     the war started and my facility is the primary receiving site \n     for all significantly burned casualties from the war. Our \n     experiences have convinced us that partnering with your \n     world-class research programs and integrating the \n     opportunities currently underway in regenerative medicine are \n     important for both short and long term advances for military \n     medical research and clinical care.\n       Areas of particular interest for us continue to be \n     hemostasis, resuscitation, bone tissue injury) soft tissue \n     injury, trauma informatics and clinical trauma research. \n     These six areas all focus on saving soldiers' lives and \n     returning them back to duty as soon as possible. \n     Collaboration with you continues to help us in our medical \n     mission to serve these soldiers.\n       I sincerely look forward to our continuing this important \n     partnership and using the technologies available today and in \n     the future so we can meet these increasingly complex \n     challenges to better serve our warfighters.\n           Sincerely,\n     John B. Holcomb,\n       Colonel, U.S. Army, Chief, Trauma Division, Trauma \n     Consultant for the Surgeon General Commanding.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I have an amendment that calls for a \nPentagon report on several aspects of the assistance we provide to the \nwidows and children of our fallen soldiers. In his second inaugural \naddress, President Lincoln said, ``let us strive on to finish the work \nwe are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him who shall \nhave borne the battle and for his widow, and his orphan.'' That simple, \neloquent phrase has become the motto of the Department of Veterans \nAffairs, but it certainly applies to programs run by the Department of \nDefense as well. Today we are considering the bill that funds the \nDepartment of Defense, including the offices that provide benefits to \nthe survivors of our servicemen and servicewomen killed in Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  I have recently seen and heard about enough instances of wives who \nare having problems getting the survivor benefits they should be \ngetting, of delays in implementing a new health care benefit for the \nchildren of servicemembers who died on active duty, and similar \nproblems that I think the Congress should hear from the Pentagon about \nthem. In 18 months the regulations for this new health care program are \nnot finished. That is costing a widow money or it is keeping her \nchildren from the health care they need. Or both. I would like to hear \nfrom the Pentagon what is taking so long.\n  A number of problems and delays I have heard or read of in the \nvarious benefit programs may be attributable to a simple lack of enough \npersonnel to process forms, take calls, and get payments out. I want to \nhear from the Pentagon if there are enough people on board to get this \nimportant job done so that the families of our fallen soldiers do not \nsuffer any more hardship than they already must.\n  I do commend the Defense Department for setting up a new call center \nthat is designed to help survivors navigate the process through which \nthey sign up for and receive these various benefits. I also want to \nknow how that's working. For these reasons I am introducing an \namendment that asks the Secretary of Defense to report back to Congress \non these questions. It is fine for us to establish benefit programs but \njust as important to keep an eye on them and make sure they work, and \nwithout delays. I hope this amendment will be adopted, and I ask my \ncolleagues for their support.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would like to discuss the Kennedy \namendment, which passed the Senate earlier today by unanimous consent. \nThis amendment would require that the Director of National Intelligence \nsubmit to Congress a new National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq's \nsecurity situation. At the outset, I would note that Senators Roberts \nand Stevens should both be applauded for their efforts to improve the \noriginal Kennedy amendment.\n  That said, I would like to make clear my understanding of the Kennedy \namendment, as modified. I believe that the Kennedy amendment, if \nenacted, should be interpreted to mean that the intelligence community \nshould undertake an objective analysis of the situation in Iraq. The \noriginal Kennedy amendment included questions that appeared to drive \ntoward predetermined answers, thus potentially distorting the \nintelligence value of the report. I believe the administration should \ntake notice of the changes that were made to the original Kennedy \namendment language and recognize that these changes, which moved the \namendment toward requesting information in a more objective manner, \nwere the reason the amendment was able to pass by unanimous consent.\n  I share the majority leader's concern that those in the intelligence \ncommunity should take the time they need to conduct a dispassionate \nanalysis of the Iraq situation and not be swayed by the political \ncontext within which this amendment was initially offered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is \nconsidering the Defense Department appropriations bill. As many of my \ncolleagues have noted, this bill provides essential funding for the men \nand women in uniform who are serving bravely around the world. It \nprovides a well-deserved 2.2 percent across-the-board pay raise for our \nmilitary personnel, along with funding money to help equip and resupply \nour military, which has been strained to the breaking point by the war \nin Iraq.\n  Before I discuss what I believe are the broader implications of this \nbill, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the men and women \nin uniform and their families, who are bearing the heaviest burden of \nour Nation's military operations around the world. The brave men and \nwomen who make up our military are serving in desolate, harsh, and too \noften deadly conditions throughout the world, and their \nprofessionalism, dedication, and honor are appreciated by all of us in \nthis body.\n  I specifically commend the men and women of Wisconsin who are \ncurrently serving, or have served, in the military. Wisconsin has lost \n58 of its sons and daughters in Iraq, and 4 in Afghanistan. I am proud \nof the service and accomplishments of the citizens of my State and am \ngrateful for their contributions to our country.\n  The greatest tribute we could pay to the men and women of the Armed \nForces, however, would be to create a national security policy that \naddresses the most serious threats to our country, and that makes all \nof us more secure. Unfortunately, the administration has failed to \nprovide such a policy--in fact, its Iraq policy has actually undermined \nour national security--and this appropriations bill fails to put things \nright. While this bill provides necessary and valuable support for our \nmilitary and their families, this bill does not address the fundamental \nfact that members of the military are being asked to put their lives on \nthe line in Iraq for a policy that has not succeeded, has very little \nchance of succeeding, and does not appear to have any end in sight. And \nlet's not forget that the American taxpayer is footing the enormous and \ngrowing bill for this unsuccessful policy.\n  Much of the funding in the bill is associated with the fallout of \nthis administration's failed policy in Iraq, and with a military that \nhas been strained by the current pace of operations in Iraq, to the \npoint where it has a diminished readiness level to respond to other \ncrises. And we have no shortage of other potential crises these days.\n  For anyone following developments in Iraq, it is abundantly clear \nthat this administration is pursuing a flawed and damaging strategy \nthere. It is clear that the presence of 130,000 U.S. military personnel \nin Iraq is not contributing to political stability in Iraq or quelling \nsectarian violence; that the administration has failed to articulate a \npolicy or strategy for establishing long-term stability in Iraq; and \nthat\n\n[[Page S8722]]\n\nthe administration failed to take into account what an unending and \ndevastating commitment in Iraq could do to our military capability and \nto our national security.\n  Sectarian violence is on the rise. Security is not getting better in \nIraq. The United Nations has reported that an average of 100 civilians \nwere killed per day in June. The U.N. just released a report suggesting \nthat over 6,000 civilians have died over the past 2 months. And the \nadministration seems unable to settle on an appropriate strategy to \naddress these worsening conditions. Just 2 months ago General Casey \ncame to Washington to discuss the significant drawdown of U.S. troops \nfrom Iraq. Now, just a few weeks later, troop deployments are being \nextended beyond a year, and we are no closer to helping Iraqis \nestablish stability in their country than we were over a year ago.\n  It is clear that our current approach in Iraq is not going to \nestablish stability in Iraq. We need a new strategy--a political and \neconomic strategy--that will help establish long-term stability in \nIraq. Perpetuating the massive presence of U.S. forces in Iraq is not \nthe answer. We need a new strategy in Iraq so that we can repair our \nmilitary and strengthen our national security. Anything short of a \nchange in course will ensure more of the same.\n  It is also clear that the war in Iraq is having a negative--and \ndramatic--effect on our military's capability and readiness levels. \nBecause of the heavy usage of military equipment in Iraq, the Army \nNational Guard's 34 brigades are not combat-ready, and it will be no \neasy task getting our physical capacity back up to full strength.\n  While I applaud the efforts of Senators Dodd and Reed of Rhode Island \nto include in this bill sufficient ``reset'' funds for the U.S. Army \nand Marine Corps, I think it is imperative to remember that this is a \nwar of choice. This is a war that this administration designed and \npressed on the American people as ``urgent.'' This is a war that was \nbased on false pretenses, launched with poor planning, and implemented \nwithout any concept whatsoever of how significant the drain on our \nnational resources would be. This is a war that the administration \nchose the ``time and place'' for but that now cannot seem to end. And \nnow, after years, it is apparent that stability cannot be won \nmilitarily. The costs we are incurring in Iraq are devastating, they \nare endless, and they are not advancing our national interests--\nparticularly when our military is losing its capacity to respond to \nfuture threats globally and to defend our country from the terrorist \nnetworks that attacked us on 9/11.\n\n  I would like to quote the Army Chief of Staff, General Peter \nSchoomaker, who testified in front of the House in June. He painted a \ndire picture of our military's equipment in Iraq:\n\n       This sustained strategic demand has placed a tremendous \n     strain on the Army's people and equipment which have been \n     employed in the harsh operating environments of Iraq and \n     Afghanistan. In Operation Iraqi Freedom, for example, crews \n     are driving tanks in excess of 4,000 miles a year--five times \n     more than the programmed annual usage rate of 800 miles. Army \n     helicopters are experiencing usage rates roughly two to three \n     times programmed rates. Our truck fleet is experiencing some \n     of the most pronounced problems of excessive wear, operating \n     at five to six times programmed rates.\n\n  This testimony highlights not only the physical strain that military \noperations in Iraq are having on our military capability but also the \nstrain on our readiness to deal with the serious threats to our \nnational security around the world. We were ill prepared for our \noperations in Iraq, and now Iraq is making us ill prepared to respond \nto other crises.\n  Lieutenant General Blum, head of the National Guard, also painted a \ndire picture yesterday when he noted that three-quarters of the \nNational Guard are not ready for combat. A significant portion of our \nSpecial Forces personnel are deployed to Iraq, and there is no doubt \nabout the draining effect that operations in Iraq are having on the \nrest of our government.\n  This is a major concern. While this bill includes some important \nfunds to help restore readiness levels, we are not addressing the root \ncauses of what is placing such a strain and limitation on our military.\n  With that said, I would like to shift to the very work--\nreconstruction--that was originally designed to help develop a sound \npolitical and economic infrastructure in Iraq and, as the \nadministration has consistently repeated, help set the ``conditions for \nsuccess.'' Unfortunately, there isn't much to report.\n  Reconstruction efforts in Iraq are troubled. The SIGIR released a new \nquarterly report this week on U.S. reconstruction efforts in Iraq, and \nit is clear that, after billions of taxpayer dollars have been spent, \nmajor obstacles remain. SIGIR has concluded that large unforeseen \nsecurity costs, massive corruption within the Iraqi Government, \nadministrative overhead, and waste have crippled original \nreconstruction strategies and have prevented the completion of up to \nhalf of the work originally called for in critical sectors such as \nwater, power, and electricity.\n  It is also troubling that the recent SIGIR report suggests that there \nstill is no strategy for transitioning the responsibility for \nreconstruction efforts in Iraq from the United States to the Iraqi \nGovernment. Reconstruction efforts in Iraq have been dominated for more \nthan 3 years by U.S. funding and companies, and now as it comes time to \ntransfer the responsibility and management of reconstruction efforts to \nthe Iraqis, it has become clear that Iraqis don't have the capacity to \ncomplete the many projects left unfinished.\n  Most troubling, in my mind, is the fact that the GAO has recently \nreported that there does not currently exist a strategy that links \nreconstruction efforts to broader political and strategic goals in \nIraq. I am not sure how we will achieve any goals in Iraq if we don't \nhave a sense of how reconstruction efforts, political efforts, and \nsecurity efforts fit together. Given that stability in Iraq will only \ncome through political and economic progress, it is troubling to know \nthat no strategy exists to link any of this together.\n  While this bill doesn't address reconstruction funding, it is clear \nthat unless there is a comprehensive strategy to bring these efforts \ntogether, security conditions in Iraq won't get better. This has a \ndirect impact on the troops currently in Iraq, which in turn has a \ndirect impact on our national security.\n  Mr. President, our ongoing military presence in Iraq is hurting our \nnational security. It is putting a tremendous strain on our military \nitself and it is limiting our capacity to deal with other crises around \nthe world, including Lebanon, Iran, North Korea, Somalia, and \nAfghanistan.\n  We need a drastic change of course in Iraq. We need to redeploy our \ntroops so that we can focus on these very real threats to our national \nsecurity, and on al-Qaida and its allies. We need a strong military, \nand we also need a strong national security strategy that honors the \nmen and women in uniform who serve our country selflessly around the \nworld.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. President. I rise to speak about \namendment No. 4783 which has been filed and accepted into this bill.\n  I would like to thank my colleagues, Chairman Stevens and Ranking \nMember Inouye, for agreeing to accept this amendment and for their \nmanagement of this bill which is so critical to funding the needs of \nthose who serve our country.\n  When our service men and women, fighting so bravely in the face of \nsuch grave danger, go into battle, they should have all the resources \nand technology they need to not only get the job done but come home \nhealthy and safely to their families.\n  This is why I was dismayed to learn that our troops in Iraq and \nAfghanistan are not equipped with the medical bandages they need to \nstop heavy bleeding from potentially fatal wounds. These hemostatic \nagents--which are small enough to be easily carried by all soldiers--\ncan literally save lives.\n  Unfortunately, those supplies are being stockpiled in medical units \nand soldiers are writing home to their friends and families to say that \nthey need these bandages on the front lines.\n  Take a moment to think about that. Imagine a mother or father, \nsitting in their living room, scared stiff every day that they might \nnot see their son or daughter alive again, reading a letter begging \nthem to send bandages so their son or daughter can take care of \nthemselves if they are hurt.\n\n[[Page S8723]]\n\n  We need to do better because sending these men and women into harm's \nway without the medical equipment they need is simply unacceptable.\n  Hemostatic agents are chemical compounds that have been tested and \nproven to help save soldiers' lives by forming powerful clots which \nhalt blood loss so a wounded soldier has a better chance of getting to \nan operating room.\n  Stopping rapid blood loss from a wound is critically important \nbecause, according to the American Red Cross, half of all military \ndeaths on the battlefield are a result of excessive blood loss.\n  Distribution problems can be no excuse. We must ensure that every \nsingle soldier has at least one of these bandages or packets with them \nat all times. And, of course, the medical units should have as many as \nthey see fit.\n  Mr. President, it is more than obvious that our men and women who are \nrisking their lives should have access to any and all life saving \nitems, such as these hemostatic agents.\n  A group on Long Island called Jacob's Light Foundation has taken \nmatters into its own hands and is raising money to buy these bandages \nand packets to send them directly to soldiers. I am grateful for their \nefforts, but the bottom line is, this is the military's responsibility, \nnot the families'.\n  Families who have already sacrificed so much should not have to dip \ninto their own pockets to ensure their children survive an attack.\n  That is why when we debated the Department of Defense Authorization \nbill a few weeks ago, we added language to ensure that there are plenty \nof the bandages to go around.\n  My amendment on this bill, which I am proud to note that Senators \nColeman and Clinton have joined me on, will ensure that sufficient \nfunds are available during the fiscal year to make that happen. It \nprovides $11 million to purchase these hemostatic agents and get them \nto our troops on the front lines.\n  Mr. President, we have the means to prevent unnecessary deaths on the \nbattlefield instead, we are nickel and diming our troops.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, Lonnie Stubblefield is 17, a recent \ngraduate of Macon County High School in Lafayette, TN. He enjoys Sudoku \npuzzles and brainteasers--he likes to challenge himself. He doesn't \nlook the part, but he's in the Army now.\n  Zach Khan is 38, a small business owner and an insurance agent. He \nwanted to do something meaningful in life. He was looking for something \nwith plenty of future opportunities, great benefits, and maybe even a \nlittle prestige. He's in the Army now.\n  Linda Yanez is 19, a first generation American with Mexican roots who \ncalls herself ``a small-town girl from the woods.'' She was looking for \na way to make ``a difference somewhere to someone.'' She's in the Army \nnow.\n  Jesse Alexander is also 19, a 2003 grad of Maplewood High in \nNashville, TN. He's a student majoring in education at Tennessee State \nUniversity, and works part-time as a security guard. He's earnest, \nself-disciplined--and he's in the Army now.\n  Why do I mention Lonnie, Zach, Linda, and Jesse? Because they have \nsomething in common. Each walked into a local recruiting office in the \nVolunteer State--Tennessee--and joined America's Volunteer Army.\n  I cannot tell you how very proud I am of them.\n  Soon, they will join the ranks of the many thousands of Tennesseans \nalready risking their lives--day-in and day-out--to defend our freedom. \nCurrently, roughly 14,000 Tennesseans serve in the National Guard.\n  Across the globe, in more than 130 countries, some 247,000 troops and \ncivilians are on the frontline. Every day, they are risking their lives \nto defend our freedom--and the freedom of the people in whose countries \nthey are stationed.\n  No one would have guessed, almost 5 years ago, now, that we would be \nfree from having suffered another major terrorist attack on our soil. \nWe have been extraordinarily fortunate.\n  And we have been safe because our brave fellow Americans are putting \ntheir lives on the line to protect this country.\n  Our troops provide us an invaluable service--fighting daily to defend \nour priceless ideals. These are young Americans--men and women who have \nnever seen the world. Yet they have the pride and the courage--and most \nimportantly, the faith--to join our military and become our bravest \ndefenders.\n  Mr. President, we owe our troops a debt of honor. For their \ninvaluable service, we owe them the very best resources. And as U.S. \nSenators, it's our responsibility to provide those resources to them.\n  That is why the bill before us today--the Defense Appropriations \nbill--is so very important. It provides our soldiers with the \nresources, training, technology, equipment, and authorities they need \nto win the global war on terror.\n  From cutting edge technologies to personnel protection systems--the \nspending bill keeps our military strong so that our men and women in \nuniform can keep America safe.\n  The bill provides nearly $470 billion in resources for the Department \nof Defense--funding key readiness programs critical to combating \nterrorism and enhancing homeland defense.\n  It includes an additional $55 billion in emergency funding for \noperations in Iraq and Afghanistan--that is, operations related to the \nglobal war on terror.\n  And it contains provisions aimed at improving the quality of life of \nour service members--including a 2.2 percent across-the-board pay raise \nfor all military personnel.\n  I am confident that the bill before us today will enable our troops \nto continue anticipating and meeting the challenges and threats of \ntomorrow--while maintaining high levels of readiness today.\n  Our brave men and women place their lives at grave risk when they \nvolunteer to join our military and become our Nation's defenders at the \nfrontline. We owe them nothing less than first-class training, the \nlatest in modern technology and equipment, and quality infrastructure.\n  Senators Stevens and Inouye have worked hard to ensure that the bill \nbefore us now delivers the funding for the cutting edge resources and \nservice our troops deserve. I thank them for their dedication to seeing \nthis bill through.\n  As we wrap up debate on this bill, I urge my fellow Senators to join \nme in supporting this bill. I ask them to join me in providing the \nfunding critical to keeping our troops prepared and at the ready.\n  America's security depends on our troops. And our troops are \ndepending on us.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we have had a lot of discussion in terms of \nwhat the plans would be. We will be proceeding where we can finish the \nbills, not the Department of Defense appropriations bill tonight, but \nin all likelihood the other bills. I will propound the unanimous \nconsent request, and then we will lay out the evening.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding rule \nXXII, the cloture vote with respect to H.R. 5970, the Family Prosperity \nAct, occur following 15 minutes for Senator Grassley, 15 minutes for \nthe Democratic manager, and 15 minutes for each leader; provided \nfurther that if cloture is not invoked, the Senate then proceed \nimmediately to the consideration of H.R. 4, the pensions bill, and that \nthere be 20 minutes for debate equally divided between the two leaders, \nwith no amendments in order to the bill; further, that following the \nuse or yielding back of debate, the bill be read the third time and the \nSenate proceed to a vote on passage, with no intervening action or \ndebate; further, that it not be in order to consider any conference \nreport on H.R. 2830 during this Congress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I move that \nwe amend H.R. 4388--it is the extenders, so that everybody knows what I \nam talking about--with the text of the extenders amendment I offered \nearlier to the defense bill. In effect, what I am saying is, we are \ngoing to try to have a decision made on the protection act. Following \nthe disposition of that, we would go to the pension bill, and my \nrequest is that following that we would pass the extenders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. FRIST. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I have made \nit clear since the outset that our intention was to address the Family \nProsperity Act, which are the three bills, which people have been \nreferring to as the ``trifecta,'' unamended and without any attempt to \neither separate that and add it to the pensions bill. We will proceed \nas planned, consistent with the unanimous consent request that I \noutlined.\n  I do object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President. I understand \nthe leader. He told me that earlier today. I told him I would do this. \nI hope that when we come back, following the completion of the Defense \nappropriations bill, this will be one of the first things we work on. \nThis is an extremely important piece of legislation. I am disappointed \nthat we were not able to complete this at the conference that was \ncompleted a week or so ago. I have no objection to the majority \nleader's request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will yield to Senator Grassley when he \ncomes. I think that I will go ahead and yield myself time on this bill. \nWe have essentially 30 minutes on either side, of which 15 or 20 \nminutes of our time will be used by Senator Grassley.\n  We will be voting shortly on what we are calling the Family \nProsperity Act. Heretofore, it has been called the trifecta bill \nbecause it addresses three different issues that are critically \nimportant to the American people.\n  Each of these three bills that have been grouped together to become \nthe Family Prosperity Act are important to hard-working Americans, \nmillions of them. One of the three bills is the permanent tax relief \nbill. Let me say at the outset that this is a compromise bill that has \nbeen put together. We attempted earlier to do something that I strongly \nbelieve in, which is totally repealing this unfair and wrongful \n``death'' tax. We were unable to do that on the floor of the Senate, \nand after a lot of discussion between Republicans and Democrats, with \nthe leadership, with Senator Kyl on our side and many Democrats, a bill \nthat is a compromise was put together and is very similar to the bill \nthat is in the Family Prosperity Act.\n  Why is it important? Because this death tax punishes everyday \nAmericans by forcing them to give up their businesses, give up their \nfarms, which their loved ones--dads, moms, and grandparents--have \nworked hard to pass on to them. It has a direct impact on farming, \nranching, construction. All of these bills are labor and capital \nintensive, but the cost of passing these enterprises on to future \ngenerations in one piece is often prohibitive and impossible to do.\n\n[[Page S8726]]\n\n  About 90 percent of family businesses don't survive that third \ngeneration. Even those who do manage to pass on their family businesses \nare adversely affected. Instead of spending money to innovate and grow \nthe business, people have to pay money either to the Federal \nGovernment, to accountants and business people to, in some way, try to \nlessen the burden they would some day have to pay.\n  There are a lot of issues that we have addressed in this body. It is \ntime that we act on this one. Again, it is a compromise that we pulled \ntogether.\n  The second aspect of the Family Prosperity Act are some very \nimportant tax extenders. There is a list of those that I am sure others \nwill talk about, and one that is of particular interest to me is the \nsales tax deductibility. In my State of Tennessee, from 1986 to 2004, \nhard-working Tennesseans were placed at a disadvantage simply because \nTennessee was one of seven States that chose to raise revenue primarily \nthrough a sales tax instead of an income tax. Thankfully, in 2004, this \nbody, working with President Bush, restored fairness to that Federal \ntax policy, but that provision expired last year, and more than 64,000 \nTennessee families will suffer if that tax relief is not extended. That \nis just one provision. There are many others.\n  The research and development tax credit, we know, is absolutely \ncritical to our small businesses, mid-size businesses, and larger \nbusinesses in order to grow and to do that research and innovation that \nprepares them for the future and that creates jobs for the future.\n  The final piece of the Family Prosperity Act increases the minimum \nwage. Specifically, it increases it by 40 percent; thus, if we were to \npass this bill tonight, the Family Prosperity Act, in the very near \nterm, because it already passed the House, minimum wage workers--\nseveral million people--will have a 40 percent increase that will begin \nin the very near future. Young workers entering the job market for the \nfirst time would have a minimum wage hike that would be welcome.\n  I see that my colleague, Senator Grassley, is here. At this point, I \nwill be happy to yield to him. He has a statement of 15 to 20 minutes. \nI yield to him what time is required for his statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, it is my understanding that I have 15 \nminutes, and if I need 5 minutes off of the leader's time, I could have \nit. Would you please inform me when my 15 minutes are up, and if I need \na little bit more time, without asking unanimous consent at that time, \nto take it off of leader time. Does the Chair understand what I am \ntalking about?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, I understand the Senator. The Chair will \nmake sure the Senator knows when 15 minutes have been used.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I am going to support the trifecta bill. I want to \nspeak about the bill and around the bill and about the environment that \nhas taken place over the last week.\n  On a preliminary note, I would like to talk a little bit about the \nnickname of this bill. Its authors in the House and Senate came up with \nthat nickname. They call it the ``trifecta'' bill.\n  Many folks know I'm a bit of a frugal person. You'd definitely hear \nit from my staff. Some might say I am cheap. I would say frugal. Frugal \nfolks tend to be drudges and a bit predictable, but, at the end of the \nday, frugality tends to mean that you have your house to go home to and \na little bit of savings in the bank.\n  You don't see a lot of frugal folks that take big speculative \ngambles.\n  So, when I saw this term ``Trifecta,'' not being much of a gambler, I \ndidn't know what it meant. I asked my staff about it. They explained \nthat it was a horse or dog racing term. It refers to a compound bet. \nThat is, the bettor places a bet on three horses. The bettor indicates \nwhich horses will win, place, and show.\n  I asked my staff about the typical odds on a trifecta in a horse \nrace. They picked the 2006 Kentucky Derby. According to the record, \nBarbaro was favored to win by 6 to 1 odds, Bluegrass Cat was 30 to 1 \nodds to win, and Steppenwolfer was 30 to 1 odds to win.\n  The $2 Trifecta paid $11,418 which is a pay-out of $5,709 per every \ndollar. Big pay-off. Long odds. So does our trifecta have those kind of \nodds? The answer is no, but it does require 60 Senators to payoff.\n  Being a frugal person and a cautious legislator, you can see how I \nmight have problems with trifecta legislative strategy.\n  I guess I would look at this exercise as that kind of longshot. With \nSenate votes as horses, let's take a look. At the last race, on a \nmotion to proceed to the House death tax repeal bill, 57 horses came \nin. So, the bet was to find 3 horses among the horses that ran the \nother direction and turn them around. As a farmer with some experience \nwith horses, let me say, once they're out of the barn and running \naround, it's hard to turn them around. Senators can be similar, \nespecially when a vote is highly political.\n  It looks to me like we may not turn around many of the horses today. \nI hope I am wrong. If I am right, the bottom line is that we bet on the \nwrong horses. Maybe we should've taken a bet that was more likely to \npay-off.\n  Now, I want to turn to the substance of the bill before us. What's \nthis trifecta bill all about? There are really three key pieces. The \nfirst piece is permanent death tax relief. The second piece deals with \nexpiring tax provisions and some other items, known as the ``trailer \nbill.''\n  The last piece is a Federal minimum wage increase.\n  I am not going to describe the minimum wage piece. It is not in my \ncommittee, the Finance Committee's, jurisdiction. It was an add-on by \nthe House. I really have no history with it and feel no reason to \nexplain it, support it, criticize it, or defend it. I will leave that \nto others.\n  From a personal standpoint, I have supported minimum wage increases \nin the past. I'll continue to support them as long as the increase \ndoesn't raise teen unemployment and doesn't hurt small business.\n  I am going to focus on the first two pieces of the trifecta. That is, \nthe death tax relief and the trailer bill. Those matters are squarely \nwithin the Finance Committee's jurisdiction. I have some history with \nthose issues. I care a great deal about the policy in both of those \nareas. As chairman, I feel a lot of responsibility for the tax policy \nin these areas.\n  Let's take a look at death tax relief first. I support repeal. I take \nit from the vote we had on the motion to proceed to the death tax \nrepeal bill that a majority of the Senate also supports repeal or some \nsort of significant relief.\n  I want to make it clear to the people listening, who may not \nunderstand how the Senate works, why we need 60 votes. A vast majority \nof this Senate supports repeal of the death tax, but it won't happen \nbecause of the 60-vote requirement.\n  In this case, I did some checking around on the votes after the \ncloture motion failed. It became apparent to me, after conversations \nwith members, staff, and interested parties that the bar for getting \nthe 60 votes was pretty high. At first, the impression was kind of \nfuzzy, but it became clear as the weeks moved on. Several barriers \nexisted for the Republican leadership and Senator Kyl. One, the fact \nthat we were then so close to an election had politicized the issue. \nThe Democratic leadership were becoming invested in blocking a \nRepublican accomplishment. They made it clear to Democratic Senators \nwho might otherwise be willing to work towards good policy that those \nSenators would face the wrath of the Democratic Caucus.\n  Moreover, the Democratic leadership exploited the policy positions \nthat Senator Kyl and others considered priorities. Even though \nRepublicans moved, the movement never seemed to be enough. Also, \nDemocrats were focusing on points that they knew the Republican \nnegotiators could not be flexible. It was a troublesome negotiation. \nUnfortunately, members and staff often heard what they wanted to hear. \nThis pattern only got worse as time went on.\n  While these negotiations were going on, there was a parallel track \ndeveloping. The Senate Republican leadership came up with a different \nplan. The plan was to add the death tax compromise to the pension \nconference. I counseled against it because I thought the mix of \nconferees would not be agreeable to it and it would be an awkward \nposition to a broadly bipartisan\n\n[[Page S8727]]\n\nbill. Nevertheless, I agreed to consider this maneuver if the \nproponents could show me a path to 60 votes.\n  The proponents went against my counsel and did not deliver on the one \nthing I asked them to do: show me the votes. That plan didn't work \nbecause, as I predicted, a majority of the conferees were not \nsupportive of it, and I was one of the conferees who would have \nsupported it.\n  After 4 months of tough negotiations, none of the senior conferees, \nall of whom were invested in the pension policy, were keen to the idea \neither. And here, I am talking about both House and Senate conferees, \nRepublicans and Democrats. The mission was launched and quickly \naborted.\n  Along came plan B. Plan B was the result of my ``wily'' counterpart--\nyou know, the guy who, according to House colleagues and staff, \nsupposedly ``snookers'' the Senate year in and year out in conferences. \nMy House counterpart, who, like the rest of the conferees, was never on \nboard with the pension plan, raised this plan B with me. Plan B was the \nidea of combining some new death tax compromise with the trailer bill.\n  I counseled against this plan. It was clear that pursuing this plan \nwould cause problems with completing the pension conference. Chairman \nEnzi backed me in this view. Once again, I asked the proponents to show \nme the path to 60 votes. Once again, they didn't show the path, and \nthen, as you know, they went ahead over my objection.\n  So we are where we are right now at almost 9 o'clock on Thursday. The \nprocess was lousy and offensive, but the substance is good. I will \nsupport the bill's death tax relief proposal. I wish this death tax \npolicy would become law. If that does not happen, then we have to think \nabout the next step. We have to keep our eye on the ball. We should be \naiming for good death tax policy and for the 60 votes on how to get \nthere.\n  We have all learned a few things in this painful process.\n  One, death tax is a unique kind of issue. It is not like other tax \nissues. It is a moral issue to folks on both sides of the aisle. To be \npolitically palatable, the death tax proposal needs to be either in \nisolation or proportionate if combined with other tax proposals. Small \nso-called sweeteners don't get us over the goal line. Holding up \npopular must-do current law tax provisions also doesn't get us there. \nJust look at the vote counts in the House on the various bills. Those \nvote counts show what I am talking about.\n  So right now, we are stuck. The Democratic leadership is holding back \nMembers from voting their consciences and their State interests. That \nresistance is there now, and it is very strong. It won't last past the \npolitical season. The Democratic caucus will be accountable. If the \ntrifecta bill fails, we will be back, but we won't get anywhere until \nwe are out of the political season. That is the ugly political fact I \nhave to convey to Senators Kyl, Lincoln, and others who have worked in \na bipartisan way to get this done.\n  I took a look in the Tax Code and the recent history of the death tax \nrelief. In the past 20 years, comprehensive death tax relief occurred \ntwo times: in 1997, in a bipartisan tax relief bill, and in 2001 on \nanother bipartisan tax relief bill. Both were produced by Finance \nCommittee members with a bipartisan working group and the involvement \nof the chairman. My judgment is that if the trifecta bill fails, this \nis the way we are going to have to go again.\n  Now I turn to the other part of the trifecta, the so-called trailer \nbill. In this Congress, I have fought long and hard for extension of \ntax provisions that expired at the end of last year, now 8 months into \nthe expired year. The extension provisions were included in the tax \nreconciliation bill which passed the Senate in the spring.\n  Let's consider how we got here on extenders and the trailer package.\n  Extenders were part of a package deal that I argued for in the Budget \nCommittee. When the Budget Committee met in February and March of last \nyear, I asked for $90 billion. The $90 billion was meant to cover \nexpiring provisions, including capital gains and dividend rates and the \nhold harmless for the alternative minimum tax. Chairman Gregg agreed to \na reconciliation instruction of $70 billion. In committee and on the \nfloor, I defended the reconciliation instruction as part of this plan. \nIncluding extenders was a key part of the strategy. It came up a lot in \ndebate. It was a factor in holding the instruction on the floor and in \nconference.\n  When the reconciliation bill was marked up in the Finance Committee, \nthe extenders were part of the same package deal. The inclusion of 2 \nyears of extenders on the floor helped us hold the Finance Committee \nbill together.\n\n  When we went to conference, the House brought a year of extenders, no \nAMT hold harmless, and 2 years of capital gains and dividends. Although \nwe could not get 2 years of capital gains and dividends through this \nSenate the first time, I knew it was important to the Republican \nleadership, especially Senator Kyl, and I would even put myself in that \ncategory. We could not fit all the pieces together because, in part, \nthe House would not take our anti-tax shelter measures and loophole \nclosers. Something had to drop. That something was what we call the \nextenders.\n  Now, because the extenders were part of the plan and we were also \ninto the expired year, I insisted on assurances from Chairman Thomas of \nthe House Ways and Means Committee and also from the bicameral \nleadership. At that time, I released a statement stating that we would \nbe putting the extenders in the pension conference report. This \nstatement was based on assurances that I had from leaders in both the \nHouse and the Senate.\n  I asked for those assurances to do the right thing from a policy \nperspective and also a political perspective. From the policy \nperspective, the taxpayers should be able to rely on the tax \nlegislative process. This should be especially true with respect to the \ncurrent law expiring provisions that enjoy overwhelming bipartisan \nsupport. From a political perspective, I asked for those assurances to \ndefend Republican Senators who would be attacked when the \nreconciliation conference agreement was announced. Indeed, those \nattacks did come, and I referred to the assurances in defending the \nSenators who were under attack.\n  In addition, several Republican Senators asked me to make sure there \nwas a glidepath to those extenders. For instance, Senator Hutchison \nraised the State sales tax deductibility extender in a Senate \nRepublican leadership meeting. Republican high-tech coalition members \nasked for similar assurances.\n  My interest has always been to accomplish what is possible, not \ntaking chances with widely applicable tax relief measures on which \nmillions of taxpayers are relying. For example, over 12 million \nAmericans benefit from the State sales tax. We have charts up. I am not \ngoing to take time to refer to them much, so I hope the audience will \nlook and study them. Over 12 million Americans benefit from the State \nsales tax deduction. Over 3 million teachers benefit from tax \ndeductions for education expenses. Teachers have prepared for the \nupcoming school year, and they don't know whether supplies they buy out \nof their own pocket will be deductible. Over 3.5 million families \nbenefit from the college tuition deduction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator should be advised his 15 minutes \nhas expired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Chair. I will use a little bit of time off \nthe leader's time.\n  A week ago, I said some colleagues want to engage in a riverboat \ngamble involving these popular tax relief provisions by including it \nwith the death tax. They call Chairman Thomas's bill the trifecta bill. \nI will treat the proponents with more respect than they have treated \nthis chairman and the institution of the Finance Committee. I will \nsupport this bill.\n  The burden is on the proponents of this gambit to produce. But to do \nthat, they are going to have to deal with the realities of the votes in \nthe Senate. People want and should expect that Congress will provide \ncertainty in estate planning. My colleagues have placed all the chips \non the table. It is on them to make sure it is a winning hand. If the \ntrifecta bill fails, they need to answer to those millions of Americans \nwho relied on our promise and good will as legislators.\n  I also have a message for the Democratic leadership. While I am \nfrustrated with my leadership, let me say\n\n[[Page S8728]]\n\nthat it should also be clear that the Democratic leadership has been \nmore eager to produce press releases than results. The Democratic \nleadership has been actively and aggressively undermining efforts to \nreach a deal. This has only served to deny relief from the death tax \nfor America's small business and family farmers. This obstruction has \nalso forced these farmers and small business owners to have to live \nwith continued uncertainty of the current death tax structure. That is \nnot right. The people's business should be done.\n  The time has come for the Democratic leadership to stop playing \npolitics with family farmers and small business folks and let \nresponsible Democrats work on a fair compromise. It is wrong that the \nDemocratic leadership is preventing Senators from voting their \nconsciences in this manner. Senators should be allowed to put the \ninterests of their constituents first instead of the priorities of the \nDemocratic leadership.\n  When you cut through all the finger-pointing and the press releases, \nboth sides are to blame that we can't get these extenders done. Both \ndeath tax and expiring provisions should be processed in a bipartisan, \nconstructive way. We should be realistic and seek to accomplish the \npossible. Let's do the people's business.\n  Mr. President, I will support the bill before us, but should it fail, \nI will use my best efforts to do what needs to be done. I will stick by \nmy word to the American people and ask those who give their word to \nkeep it with me. Either result would be right for the people. To do \nneither and not act on extenders would be the wrong thing for the \npeople. That is why we are here to serve the people. We are here to \ngovern.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask to be recognized for 10 minutes on \nthe minority time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will be happy to yield 10 minutes to the \ndistinguished minority whip.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Illinois is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this legislation is known as the trifecta. \nWhat a perfect name. What a perfect name for this legislation. Do you \nknow what a trifecta is? It is when you go to the racetrack and you \npick the horses that win, place, and show in the proper order--first, \nsecond, and third. The reason that is the right name for this bill is \nthat a trifecta is a high-stakes gamble. That is exactly what this bill \nis. It is a high-stakes gamble with America's future. A trifecta is \nalso a bet where there are many more losers than there are winners. And \nthat is exactly what this bill is. There will be many more losers in \nAmerica, if this bill is enacted, than winners.\n  How about the winners when it comes to the estate tax? How many \nAmericans are affected by the estate tax? If one listened to the other \nside of the aisle, one would think that every person who gets up in the \nmorning and goes to work is going to pay the estate tax to the Federal \nGovernment. Guess what. When you take a look at the chart, look for \nthat thin red line on this big blue circle. It represents 2 estates out \nof every 1,000 in America. Mr. President, .2 percent of the estates in \nAmerica are wealthy enough to pay anything into the estate tax. So the \nobvious question is, If this estate tax, which they want to repeal, \nmeans so much to so few, how did we end up making this the flagship \nissue for the Republicans in this Congress, the most important single \nissue to them to the exclusion of every other issue, the issue that \nreturns to us on the floor with such frequency? How did they reach this \npoint?\n  The New York Times wrote an article on June 7, 2006, that explained \nit. Do my colleagues want to know how these issues become big-time \nissues in Washington? They wrote that over the last decade, 18 of the \nwealthiest families in the country have spent more than $200 million \nlobbying in the Halls of Congress to repeal the estate tax. It turns \nout that these 18 families will be huge winners if this repeal is \npassed. How many families will benefit if the estate tax is repealed? \nEach year in America, a Nation of 300 million people: 8,200 families. \nYou have to search long and hard to find them. These are families who \nare so well off, who have done so well in this great Nation, who have \nbenefited from this democracy and the blessings of liberty, who have \nenjoyed a comfortable life because of their prosperity, who now have \ntaken millions of dollars to hire the most effective lobbyists in \nWashington, DC to push through this outrageous special interest \nlegislation.\n  Trifecta: Many more losers than winners, but the winners are those \n8,200 families. That is what this is all about.\n  Of course, they came up with a new name tonight. It is not just the \ntrifecta. You have to hand it to whoever sits in the bowels of the \nCapitol and dreams up the names for the outrageous bills they bring to \nthe floor. Senator Reid has reminded us so many times that they had the \nnerve to call a bill the ``Deficit Reduction Act'' which increased the \ndeficit. They had the nerve to call a bill the ``Healthy Forest Act'' \nwhich cut down trees. They had the nerve to name a bill the ``Clean \nSkies Act'' which resulted in more air pollution. And they had the \nnerve to call a bill part of the ``ownership society'' which privatized \nSocial Security.\n  Now comes ``family prosperity.'' Oh, you just want to pull up a chair \nby the fireplace, relax, look at the ceiling and think: Thank God \nprosperity has arrived. And what does this bill do? This bill piles on \nthe national debt. This bill adds to the outrageous debt which we have \nseen accumulated under this President.\n  Take a look at this, my friends who call yourselves fiscally \nconservative. When this President was elected in 2001, our entire \nnational debt was $5.8 trillion. In 6 years of the Bush-Cheney \nownership society, family prosperity, we are now up to $8.5 trillion \nfrom $5.8 trillion. This President managed in such a short period of \ntime to increase the national debt on America by 60 percent. And look: \nFollow his policies out to the year 2011, 10 years after President Bush \nwas elected, follow them out and notice that the national debt in \nAmerica virtually doubles. Boy, if that isn't family prosperity, I \ndon't know where you would turn.\n  Where do we look to this bill? What does it do to add to family \nprosperity in America? Well, American families, look at this \nprosperity. This bill adds $753 billion to the national debt. Oh, I \ntell you, you just want to curl up by the fire and thank the \nRepublicans for coming up with this bill to make us feel so prosperous. \nThey are prosperous in terms of creating debt for America.\n  I asked Senator Frist on the floor just a day or two ago a very basic \nquestion: Is there any limit to the amount of debt you would create for \nfuture generations in order to give tax breaks to the wealthiest people \nin America? He couldn't answer the question.\n  I think the answer is obvious. Senator Frist has said repeatedly he \nwishes we could repeal the entire estate tax, which would drive us even \nfurther and further into debt. American family prosperity. We are safe \nin the bosom of the Grand Old Party when all they can dream up are new \nways to create debt by giving tax breaks to the wealthiest people in \nAmerica.\n  But there is a spoonful of sugar with this bitter medicine. They are \ngoing to finally increase the minimum wage. It didn't take them long to \ncome around to this position--only 9 years. It has been 9 years since \nwe enacted a minimum wage of $5.15 an hour; 9 years while they resisted \nus for every single attempt we have made to increase the minimum wage \nfor some of the lowest-paid, hardest-working people in America; 9 years \nof saying no to every single proposal to give single moms raising \nchildren enough money so they can put their kids safely in day care, so \nthey can buy their medicine and food and have a decent home to live in; \n9 years of saying no.\n\n  And what led to this death-bed conversion by the Republicans at this \nmoment in time? Could it be the threat of the Democrats that there will \nbe no congressional pay raise until the minimum wage is increased? That \nkind of gets your attention around the halls of Congress. Apparently it \ncaught the attention of the Republicans.\n  Could it be the looming election where the Bush-Cheney economic \npolicies are viewed so negatively across America, where people realize \nthat average working families are falling farther and farther behind, \nthat now the Republicans want to increase the minimum wage?\n\n[[Page S8729]]\n\n  Well, it could be all of those things. But even in their effort to \nget well 100 days before the election, they blew it. They blew it. \nBecause in seven States they wrote the minimum wage change in a way \nwhich will force a pay cut on thousands of hard-working people. The \nwaiters and waitresses who depend on tips in seven States will get a \npay cut with this so-called minimum wage increase.\n  It is an outrage, Mr. President. It is an outrage that we have \nreached this point in America where the party that used to pride itself \non fiscal conservatism can add $753 billion to our national debt \nwithout flinching. They don't care to cut any spending or increase any \nother taxes; they are going to heap this debt on future generations. \nBoy, if that isn't a recipe for family prosperity, I can't imagine what \nwould be. And then they turn around after 9 years of saying no every \nchance they have had to an increase in the minimum wage. Now they can \ngo along with it. They can give 6.6 million Americans an increase in \ntheir basic minimum wage--as long as we promise that the fattest of \ncats in America will get a great big bowl of tax cuts, tax cuts on the \nestate tax. That is what it has come down to.\n  They have thrown other things in this bill like tax extenders, but we \nall know what they are about. These tax extenders are kicked around \nlike a football every congressional session. You wait and decide which \nbill you put them on to try to entice people to vote for the bill \nbecause everyone agrees with them. Everyone understands that they are \nnecessary for our economy. People of all political stripes support \nthem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent for 30 additional seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would just like to say in closing, the American people \nknow better. This is a high-stakes gamble with America's future. This \ntrifecta is going to have many more American losers than winners. This \nis the worst special interest bill I have seen in my time in Congress.\n  This will not bring prosperity to America's families. This will bring \ndeeper debt to our Nation at a time when we don't need it. This is the \nfirst President in the history of the United States to call for cutting \ntaxes in the midst of a war, asking sacrifice from soldiers and their \nfamilies and turning around to the wealthiest in America and saying: We \nare going to give you a tax cut. That is an outrage.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in opposing this trifecta. Don't \nbuy a ticket on this race, because it is a loser.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from North Dakota, the ranking member of the Budget Committee.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the leader for this time.\n  We have heard a lot of talk that there is a death tax in this \ncountry. All of us in this Chamber know there is no death tax. There is \na tax that applies to estates that wealthy individuals have in this \ncountry, but only three-tenths of 1 percent of estates pay any tax in \nAmerica.\n  This shows the current level of exemptions. In 2006 a couple has to \nhave $4 million before they pay a penny of estate tax. In 2009, that \nwill rise to $7 million for a couple. Some of us believe we ought to \nincrease the exemption before 2009 to this $7 million level, but that \nis not the proposal before us.\n  The proposal before us is to virtually eliminate the estate tax or \ncertainly the revenue that flows from it. In fact, as my colleague from \nIllinois just indicated, the proposal before us will cost us three-\nquarters of the money that complete elimination of the estate tax would \ncost: $750 billion in the first 10 years that it is fully effective. \nThis at a time that we are borrowing money as a nation in an \nunprecedented way.\n\n  Last year we borrowed 65 percent of all the money that was borrowed \nby countries in the world. Let me repeat that. Last year, our country, \nwhich has now become the biggest debtor nation in the world, borrowed \n65 percent of all of the money that was borrowed by all the countries \nin the world--65 percent. A very weak second was Spain at 6.8 percent, \nand the United Kingdom at less than 4 percent.\n  The point is very clear. This is absolutely unaffordable at a time \nthat we are running up massive debt.\n  Our friends on the other side say: Well, we have a good idea. Let's \neliminate some more revenue and let's eliminate it on those who are the \nwealthiest three-tenths of 1 percent of the American population.\n  If anybody wonders about the budgetary impacts or whether this is \nfiscally responsible, here are the budget points of order that this \nlegislation before us now violates. It violates the pay-go rule. It \nexceeds the pay-go scorecard by more than $12 billion.\n  On revenue, it exceeds the 2006 through 2010 revenue floor by more \nthan $6 billion. It exceeds the outlay allocation for 2006 and 2006 \nthrough 2010 for the Finance Committee by $1.5 billion. It contains \nunfunded mandates on State and local governments that are all subject \nto a point of order.\n  It reduces the Social Security surpluses, also subject to a point of \norder.\n  Let me just say to my colleagues, if this measure would pass tonight \nand cloture would be invoked, I intend to raise every single one of \nthese budget points of order, and we will see who is serious about \nbeing fiscally responsible and who is not.\n  I have shown this chart to my colleagues many times. It took 42 \nPresidents--all the Presidents pictured here--224 years to run up $1 \ntrillion of debt held abroad. This President has more than doubled that \namount in just 5 years.\n  What are our colleagues saying? Our colleagues are saying: Let's go \nborrow some more money from abroad. Where are we going to get this \nmoney? The country we borrow the most from is Japan, so a lot of this \nmoney would be borrowed from Japan. The next country that we owe the \nmost money to is China, so we would have to borrow more money from the \nChinese to give this tax reduction to just a handful of Americans.\n  Right now, there will only be 13,000 taxable estates in the entire \ncountry in 2006. By 2009, that will be down to 7,000. When our friends \ncall this family prosperity, they are right. They are talking about \nfamily prosperity for 7,000 families in America, and they want to shift \nthe burden on to all of the other American families. That is what this \nis about.\n  If you are listening to this debate, if you have assets----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 more \nseconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. If you have assets of more than $7 million, it is true, \nyou will face a tax. If you have assets and you are a family, if you \nhave more than $7 million, you will face a tax. Now, that is the only \ninstance in which you will.\n  My friends, the proposal before us is to reduce--for 7,000 families \nin America who are in that category in any one year--reduce their \nobligation and shift it to all of the rest of us. That is not fair. \nThat is not right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The Democratic leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would say through the chairman to my \ndistinguished friend, that is a net estate; it is not 7 million worth \nof property.\n  First of all, I would like to extend my compliments to Charles \nGrassley, the senior Senator from Iowa, a gentleman farmer who we are \nso fortunate to have in the Senate. He, in his gentlemanly way, \nindicated in his speech tonight how terribly upset he was for what \nhappened a week ago. We had this all worked out. The conference was \ncompleted. The extenders would have been done. The pension bill would \nhave been passed.\n\n  Senator Baucus, who has been a partner with Senator Grassley for a \nlong time, is not here tonight. As we speak, he is in Dover, DE, \nmeeting his brother and his nephew, Philip. Philip is in a casket, \nhaving arrived from Iraq where he was killed.\n  Max Baucus would like to be here, but we are going to have printed in \nthe Record what Max Baucus said:\n\n       Political games congressional leaders played with this bill \n     are not the way to get the job done. I hope that cooler heads \n     can\n\n[[Page S8730]]\n\n     prevail and we can work together for sensible reform in the \n     future.\n\n  My distinguished friend, the majority leader, has placed a name on \nthis legislation called the Family Prosperity Act. I suggest that it \nshould be called the Prosperous Family Act. This legislation would only \nhelp the prosperous--only the prosperous. This should be called the \nProsperous Family Act.\n  Sunday's Washington Post had a quote from my friend--and I know a \nfriend of the distinguished Presiding Officer--Tennessee Congressman \nZach Wamp. In this column he is quoted about why Democrats don't \nsupport the bill we are about to vote on. Congressman Wamp said: I know \nwhy Democrats are mad. We've outfoxed them.\n  Again:\n\n       I know why you're mad. You have seen us really outfox you.\n\n  It is not us, the Democrats, they tried to outfox; it is the American \npeople. There is just one problem with this Republican legislation, \nthis Republican shell game, this trick--the American people will not \nfall for it. As my colleague, Senator Durbin, said: This is a bet, and \na bad one. The American people simply are too smart to be outfoxed. \nAmericans are too smart to be tricked into cutting the wages of 136,000 \nNevadans, and more than a million, by far, people in Oregon, \nWashington, Montana, California, Nevada. Those States, under this so-\ncalled Family Prosperity Act, would give less to those families who are \nstruggling, struggling every day. In Nevada there are 136,000 of them. \nThey work for minimum wage. If they work 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a \nyear, they make $10,700, plus some tips in those seven States. But not \nunder this bill. In seven States, the poorest of the poor would get a \npay cut. They would get a pay cut so that 8,100 multimillionaires can \nenjoy almost $800 billion in tax breaks.\n  Americans are too smart to be tricked into forgoing middle-class tax \nrevenue so America can borrow hundreds of billions of dollars to give \ntax breaks to the wealthy few. Americans are too smart to accept any \nmore debt and deception from this do-nothing Congress.\n  Here we are at 9:20, finishing this work session. The Defense bill \nisn't complete. The pension bill isn't complete. I hope it will be \nwithin an hour and a half or so. Middle-class tax relief isn't \ncomplete, the so-called extenders. Minimum wage has not been made \npossible for almost 10 years. Why? Because the majority doesn't believe \nin it. They don't believe in having a decent standard of living for the \npoor. Let the free market decide.\n  But, remember, the people drawing minimum wage are not kids at \nMcDonald's flipping hamburgers. Sixty percent of the people drawing \nminimum wage are women, and for the vast majority of those women, that \nis the only money they get for them and their families. Not only do \nthey have a tax cut for those seven States for the poorest of the poor, \nit is phased in over 3 years.\n  So the leader has said: OK, you accept this; take this or leave it. \nIf you don't accept this, we are not going to do the extenders and we \nare not going to do pensions.\n  We have worked that out. Thank goodness we have been able to do the \npensions. And we are certainly not going to do the minimum wage. We \nknew that. We know they don't like a minimum wage.\n  But it is a threat, and it is a perfect metaphor for this do-nothing \nCongress. For the last 19 months, congressional Republicans have done \nnothing for the people. The little they have done on behalf of special \ninterests and the well connected has made America less safe and the \nlife of the middle class much more difficult.\n  Look at the record. This Congress will be remembered more for \ninterfering in the Terry Schiavo case than it will for trying to solve \nAmerica's health care crisis. On every major issue, the Republican \nSenate has been missing in action.\n  Look at Iraq. Look at Iraq. Tens of billions of dollars to repair the \nequipment and machinery our fighting forces use; these gallant men and \nwomen--about 2,600 of them having been killed and more than 20,000 \nwounded, a third of them grievously, and hundreds of billions of \ndollars more in red ink. What we have said is please change course. But \non party-line votes: No.\n\n  In fact, the situation is being made worse by rubberstamping \nPresident Bush's failed policies and allowing him to stay the course, \neven as the evidence suggests we desperately need to change course.\n  It is the same on the economy. We live in a very stressful economic \nsituation. Over the last 6 years, the rich have gotten richer, the poor \nhave gotten poorer, and the middle class is being squeezed. Even the \nadministration admits their policies have failed for working Americans. \nListen to what the Secretary of Treasury had to say the day before \nyesterday, Hank Paulson.\n\n       Amid this country's strong economic expansion, many \n     Americans simply aren't feeling the benefits. . . . Many \n     aren't seeing significant increases in their take-home pay. \n     Their increases in wages are being eaten up by high energy \n     prices and rising health care costs, among others.\n\n  The Secretary of Treasury said it. Has the Republican Congress done \nanything to turn this situation around? No. In fact they are seeking to \nmake matters worse with the Prosperous Family Act--the Prosperous \nFamily Act.\n  This bill, as I said, will cut the wages of millions of people, most \nof them in the West. This bill will add to the bankruptcy coming about \nof our country, as expressed by the ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee, Senator Conrad. It will add almost $1 trillion to the debt--\n$1 trillion.\n  Oh, well, not really. It is $200 billion less than that.\n  We are told by the other side that with this trifecta--which we have \nnicknamed the ``defecta''--8,100 of the wealthy and well-off hit the \njackpot while millions of working families get $800 billion in debt. It \nis another example of this do-nothing Congress putting their political \ninterests ahead of America's interests.\n  We keep hearing from the other side how the Senate needs to repeal \nthe estate tax to preserve and protect small businesses and family \nfarms. That is a myth. Very few small businesses or family farms pay \nany estate tax.\n  The State of California is a State of 35 million people. The State of \nCalifornia is the breadbasket of this country. They grow so many things \nin the Imperial Valley and other places throughout California.\n  Senator Dianne Feinstein asked the Farm Bureau, which supports repeal \nof the estate tax: Tell us how many farms were lost by families because \nof the estate tax.\n  None. None. Over a 10-year period of time--none.\n  It is the same with small businesses. In fact, the Small Business \nCouncil of America has said that the repeal of the estate tax will \nactually harm most small business owners because of how it will change \nthe tax benefits they currently receive.\n  I am all for fixing the estate tax. I have said so. But there is no \nreason for this fiscal irresponsibility, And it is a virtual repeal.\n  I talked this morning for a little while about two of the richest men \nin the world. The richest man in the world, Warren Buffett, he is \ntotally opposed to repealing the estate tax, as well as the Gates \nfamily. Pierre Omidyar lives in Las Vegas, NV--Henderson, actually--a \nrich man, worth over $10 billion. He is a young man. He is the man who \ninvented eBay. The first time I had dinner with him he said: Whatever \nyou do, don't mess around with the estate tax. I owe my country the \nprosperity that I have.\n  In fact, I had a conversation yesterday with the head of the Business \nRoundtable. He said that all he cares about in the trifecta, the \nProsperous Family Act--or the ``defecta''--is that we do something to \nextend the R tax credit. That is so important to him, he said. Guess \nwhere the R tax credit is. It is being held hostage with this, along \nwith some of the other add-ons.\n  The American people deserve more. It is unimaginable that the \nRepublicans would deny millions of small businesses the research and \ndevelopment tax credit. It is unimaginable the Republicans would deny \n15 million workers a $2.10 raise. It is unimaginable they would deny \nmillions of middle-class families tax relief with our extenders. If \n8,100 of their wealthy\n\n[[Page S8731]]\n\nfriends don't get billions of dollars of tax breaks first--nothing.\n  Soon the Senate will say its last words regarding the estate tax for \nthis session of Congress, I hope. When this vote is completed, I hope \nwe move on to the people's business--I will use leader time right now--\nand the majority leader will consider his threat to never bring back \nmiddle-class tax relief and the minimum wage back to the floor this \nsession. If he is serious about that threat, it just can't happen, and \nwe will fight this. When the Senate returns in November, Democrats will \nnot go home until the middle-class tax relief package, the extenders, \nis passed. My friend can make all the threats he wants, but the Senate \nwill not adjourn until hard-working Americans get the help they need. \nThey have to have it. They have waited 19 months. By then it will be \nlonger.\n  America needs new direction. I began with a quote by Congressman Zach \nWamp. Here is another thing Republicans have been saying about their \n``defecta'' bill. They have been calling it a win-win.\n  My friend, the majority whip, Senator McConnell, said: ``There's no \nrisk. It's all reward.''\n  No risk? Tell that to the millions of workers who have been making \n$5.15 for the last 10 years on the verge of waiting another year at \nleast.\n  Win-win? Tell that to the millions of middle-class families and small \nbusinesses that will be denied tax relief because Republicans have put \ntheir political interests first.\n  All reward? Republicans have not outfoxed anyone. The American people \ncan see through these political games. I am hopeful that the cloture \nmotion will fail, and I am confident the Republican's cynical approach \nto dealing with the needs of our country will be rejected.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Murray be allowed \nto speak for 2 minutes. Is that OK with the majority leader? I have \ntime left. I know we want to move on.\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized for \n2 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, a question has been raised about whether \nthe minimum wage provision affecting States that allow tips to be \nexempt would be impacted by the legislation that is before us. I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from Gary \nWeeks, who is the director of the Washington State Department of Labor \nand Industries, that says definitively:\n\n       Under our preliminary analysis, this proposal, in effect, \n     appears to nullify an employer's obligation to pay the \n     minimum wage rate in RCW 49.46.020 with regard to tipped \n     employees. This means that Washington workers who receive \n     tips--typically service industry workers--would see a \n     decrease in income.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              State of Washington,\n\n\n                           Department of Labor and Industries,\n\n                                      Olympia, WA, August 3, 2006.\n     Hon. Patty Murray,\n     United States Senator,\n     Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Maria Cantwell,\n     United States Senator,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Murray and Cantwell: Your office asked me to \n     respond to an inquiry as to how the proposed HR 5970 would \n     affect workers in the state of Washington.\n       As you know, Washington State does not recognize tips as \n     part of the minimum wage. Tipped employees are entitled to \n     the full minimum wage, currently $7.63 an hour. Additionally, \n     Initiative 688, passed overwhelmingly by voters in 1998, tied \n     the minimum wage to the Consumer Price Index, to be \n     recalculated and adjusted each year.\n       The proposed bill, Section 402 of HR 5970, which amends the \n     Fair Labor Standards Act to add a paragraph that states:\n       (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, any \n     State or political subdivision of a State which on or after \n     the date of enactment of the Estate Tax and Extension of Tax \n     Relief Act of 2006 excludes all of a tipped employee's tips \n     from being considered as wages in determining if such tipped \n     employee has been paid the applicable minimum wage rate, may \n     not establish or enforce the minimum wage rate provisions of \n     such law, ordinance, regulation, or order in such State or \n     political subdivision thereof with respect to tipped \n     employees unless such law, ordinance, regulation, or order is \n     revised or amended to permit such employee to be paid a wage \n     by the employee's employer in an amount not less than an \n     amount equal to--\n       (A) the cash wage paid such employee which is required \n     under such law, ordinance, regulation, or order on the date \n     of enactment of the Estate Tax and Extension of Tax Relief \n     Act of 2006; and\n       (B) an additional amount on account of tips received by \n     such employee which amount is equal to the difference between \n     the cash wage described in subparagraph (A) and the minimum \n     wage rate in effect under such law, ordinance, regulation, or \n     order, or the minimum wage rate in effect under section 6(a), \n     whichever is higher.\n       Under our preliminary analysis, this proposal, in effect, \n     appears to nullify an employer's obligation to pay the \n     minimum wage rate in RCW 49.46.020 with regard to tipped \n     employees. This means that Washington workers who receive \n     tips--typically service industry workers--would see a \n     decrease in income. However, the proposal does give states \n     the right to amend their laws to specifically reinstate their \n     current minimum wage rate laws. Until and unless the \n     Washington State Legislature amends the minimum wage act to \n     reinstate the current wage rate provision for tipped \n     employees, it would diminish workers' rights in Washington \n     State.\n       I trust that this is useful information. Please let me know \n     if I can be of further assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Gary K. Weeks,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, their preliminary analysis shows that \nthis provision would take away the wages and reduce it dramatically for \nwaiters and waitresses, bartenders, barbers, baggage porters, cooks, \ndishwashers, hairdressers, maids, manicurists, massage therapists, \nparking lot attendants, personal care and services workers, service \nstation attendants, taxi drivers, and chauffeurs.\n  It appears, indeed, that the provision in this bill will dramatically \nreduce the income of thousands of workers in my State and other States.\n  I again reiterate that is why we are opposed to this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, important provisions in H.R. 5970 provide a \nlong-term solution for the Abandoned Mine Land, AML, program as well as \nresolve the uncertainty of the health care needs for retired miners and \ntheir families. Right now, there are 52,320 retired miners and their \nfamilies nationwide who depend on these critical funds to provide for \ntheir health care needs. At least 17,195, or about one-third of these \npeople, are in West Virginia. I have also worked for many years to keep \nthe AML program going for West Virginia and other coal-producing \nStates. This important program cleans up old mine hazards and improves \nthe environment in the coalfields. I have always been there to shore up \nthe funding for our coal miners' health care funds, and I have always \nbeen there for the AML program. The bill before us today is an \nopportunity to solve these issues permanently, and I embrace it.\n  H.R. 5970 would also address the Federal estate tax, something that \nthe small business owners and farmers of my State have made clear is a \npriority for them, and in need of reform. In the past, I have supported \nlegislation to increase the estate tax exemption, and to lower the top \ntax rate, as an alternative to permanent repeal. This bill is \nconsistent with those past efforts that I have supported.\n  Senators have raised concerns about the cost of this bill, and its \neffect on the Federal budget. The fiscal course of deficits and debt \nchosen by the administration is abominable, and I have advocated \ntirelessly that the Congress abandon it. But of the budget-busting \nmeasures endorsed by the Congress, this one does not rate top billing. \nThe revenue loss from the estate tax portion of this bill would not \nbegin for 3 years, and the effect on the Federal budget would not be \nfelt until the next decade. Meanwhile, the health care needs of my \nState's retired coal miners and their families are immediate and \nurgent. I will not vote against those miners who need this assistance \nnow, based upon budget projections that may not mean much until the \nnext decade.\n  This bill would also guarantee a $2.10 increase in the Federal \nminimum wage within the next 3 years. Should a new Congress revisit the \nissue, I hope that that schedule could be accelerated.\n  This bill would raise wages for workers who need it the most. It \nwould provide health care to retired coal miners\n\n[[Page S8732]]\n\nand resolve our Nation's mine reclamation needs. It would codify a \ncompromise measure that is less than repeal and consistent with \nprevious efforts to try to reform the estate tax to help small \nbusinesses and farmers.\n  This is a good bill for West Virginia, and it should receive an up-\nor-down vote on this floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we have seen many outrages from this \nRepublican Congress but none that demonstrates such utter contempt for \nthe American people as holding the minimum wage hostage to give tax \ngiveaways to the wealthiest Americans. The Republican leadership is \nplaying a cynical game of politics with the lives of millions of \nhardworking American families.\n  It may be a political game for Republicans, but it is hard reality \nfor low-wage workers who worry every day if they can pay the bills. The \nbill is just a bad bargain for minimum wage workers. The minimum wage \nincrease they receive does not have the same benefits as the Democratic \nproposal--1.8 million fewer workers would benefit because the increase \nis phased in too slowly.\n  And what's worse, this Republican bill takes money right out of the \npockets of more than 1 million tipped workers in seven States. It's a \npay cut for maids, waitresses, bellhops, and other Americans who rely \non tips to make a living. The Republican bill would boost the bottom \nline for America's restaurants, while taking money away from \nhardworking Americans who depend on tips to support themselves and \ntheir families.\n  Under current Federal law, restaurant owners can pay their waiters \nand waitresses as little as only $2.13 an hour, and the rest of their \ncompensation is supposed to come from tips. The same is true for hotel \nmaids, parking attendants, bartenders--all workers who rely on tips to \nmake a living. Federal labor and employment law sets a minimum floor, \nbut States are free to guarantee higher wages for tipped workers. In \nfact, the Fair Labor Standards Act encourages States to enact laws that \nare more protective for workers than the Federal law.\n  Seven States--Alaska, California, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, Oregon \nand Washington--do not allow a ``tip penalty.'' They guarantee that \ntipped workers get the full State minimum wage plus any tips they \nreceive.\n  But the Republican bill would take power away from the States by \nnullifying these State laws providing stronger wage protections for \ntipped employees than the Federal standard. In fact, the bill would \nchange the minimum wage for tipped workers in these seven States, \nrequiring them to be paid only the Federal minimum wage--not the higher \nState minimum wage--until the State enacts a law with a tip penalty.\n  Under this bill, tipped workers would see drastic reductions in their \ntake-home pay. A waitress at a family restaurant in Washington State, \nfor example, will see her hourly wages drop by $5.50 an hour. That's \nalmost $11,500 per year. A hotel maid in Oregon will see her hourly \nwages drop by $5.37 an hour. That's almost $11,200 a year.\n  Now the Republicans have spent a lot of time on the floor today \ntrying to explain why this giveaway for the restaurant industry won't \nactually hurt American workers. My Republican colleagues--particularly \nthe junior Senator from Oregon earlier this afternoon--accused \nDemocrats of misrepresenting what this bill does. And they supported \ntheir claims with a letter authored by the chief lobbyist for the \nAmerican Restaurant Industry. But the Republicans' claims that the bill \nis harmless just don't hold water--particularly when you look at this \ndocument from the American Restaurant Industry's own website claiming \ncredit for the tip provision and bragging about how much money it will \nsave employers. The Republicans know exactly what this provision does--\nit takes money out of workers' pockets. It's a scandalous special \ninterest giveaway to the restaurant industry, and it's outrageous.\n\n  When we examine other, less partisan analyses, it's clear that the \nbill would do devastating harm to workers. The Congressional Budget \nOffice says the bill ``would preempt the minimum wage laws of States \nthat exclude tips from being considered as wages in determining if \ncertain employees have been paid the minimum wage.'' The Congressional \nResearch Service says the bill would force the affected States to \nchoose ``between the federal tip credit requirements or the adoption of \na law that allows for some form of a tip credit under State law.'' Even \nthe Bureau of Labor and Industries in Senator Smith's home State of \nOregon says that this bill will ``trample States' rights and reduce the \nwages of thousands of Oregonians already struggling to make ends \nmeet.''\n  I will ask to have all three of these documents printed in the \nRecord.\n  But we don't even have to rely on these respected authorities to know \nwhat this bill does. Let's look at the language itself. The bill says, \non page 182, that any State that has a minimum wage law requiring that \ntipped workers be paid the full minimum wage plus any tips they receive \n``may not establish or enforce the minimum wage rate provisions of such \nlaw, ordinance, regulation, or order in such State or political \nsubdivision thereof with respect to tipped employees.'' It couldn't be \nmore clear. The bill is nullifying State laws. Once these State laws \nare rendered ineffective, the affected workers will be covered only by \nthe Federal law and will lose thousands from their paychecks, until and \nunless their State enacts a new law that is more to the restaurant \nindustry's liking.\n  This is despicable--it is truly Robin Hood in reverse, robbing from \nsome of the most vulnerable workers on a bill that gives tax cuts to \nthe rich. Instead of denying more than a million tipped workers the \nprotections of the minimum wage, we should raise the wage and expand \nthe protection. The people who work in our restaurants, carry our bags, \nand clean our hotel rooms work hard for a living, and they deserve \nbetter.\n  Everyone in America knows that after 10 long years without one, \nminimum wage workers deserve a raise. But this Republican bill is a \ncynical ploy to strongarm outrageous tax breaks for the wealthy through \nCongress on the backs of America's hardworking, low-wage workers. \nRepublicans are using minimum wage families as a human shield to \nsmuggle through tax giveaways. It's wrong. It's unfair. It has no place \nin America. And we're not going to let it happen.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print the documents to \nwhich I referred in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Congressional Research Service,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 2, 2006.\n\n\n                               Memorandum\n\n     To: Hon. Barbara Boxer, Attention: Alexander Hoehn-Saric.\n     From: Jon O. Shimabukuro, Legislative Attorney, American Law \n         Division.\n     Subject: Section 402 of H.R. 5970, the Estate Tax and \n         Extension of Tax Relief Act of 2006.\n       This memorandum provides a brief interpretation of section \n     402 of H.R. 5970, the Estate Tax and Extension of Tax Relief \n     Act of 2006. Section 402 would amend section 3(m) of the Fair \n     Labor Standards Act (``FLSA'') to address the treatment of \n     certain tipped employees. A tipped employee is ``any employee \n     engaged in an occupation in which he customarily and \n     regularly receives more than $30 a month in tips.''\n       Under the FLSA, an employer of a tipped employee is only \n     required to pay $2.13 per hour in direct wages if that \n     amount, when coed with the tips received by the employee, \n     equals at least the federal minimum wage. If the employee's \n     tips combined with the employer's direct wages of at least \n     $2.13 per hour do not equal the federal minimum hourly wage, \n     the employer must make up the difference.\n       Section 402 of H.R. 5970 would amend the FLSA'' to add the \n     following paragraph to section 3(m) of the Act:\n       (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, any \n     State or political subdivision of a State which on or after \n     the date of enactment of the Estate Tax and Extension of Tax \n     Relief Act of 2006 excludes all of a tipped employee's tips \n     from being considered as wages in determining if such tipped \n     employee has been paid the applicable minimum wage rate, may \n     not establish or enforce the minimum wage rate provisions of \n     such law, ordinance, regulation, or order in such State or \n     political subdivision thereof with respect to tipped \n     employees unless such law, ordinance, regulation, or order is \n     revised or amended to permit such employee to be paid a wage \n     by the employee's employer in an amount not less than an \n     amount equal to--\n       (A) the cash wage paid such employee which is required \n     under such law, ordinance, regulation, or order on the date \n     of enactment of the Estate Tax and Extension of Tax Relief \n     Act of 2006; and\n\n[[Page S8733]]\n\n       (B) an additional amount on account of tips received by \n     such employee which amount is equal to the difference between \n     the cash wage described in subparagraph (A) and the minimum \n     wage rate in effect under such law, ordinance, regulation, or \n     order, or the minimum wage rate in effect under section 6(a), \n     whichever is higher.\n       Seven states do not recognize a tip credit for employers of \n     tipped employees. In these states, the prescribed minimum \n     wage is the same for both tipped and non-tipped employees. \n     Stated differently, in these states, none of a tipped \n     employees tips may be considered for purposes of determining \n     if such employee has been paid the applicable minimum wage \n     rate. Under the proposed language, such states would seem to \n     be prohibited from enforcing the minimum wage rate provisions \n     of their laws with respect to a tipped employee unless such \n     laws are ``revised or amended to permit such employee to be \n     paid a wage by the employee's employer in an amount not less \n     than'' what is prescribed in the proposed subparagraphs (A) \n     and (B).\n       Under general principles of statutory construction, the \n     meaning of a statute must, in the first instance, be sought \n     in the language in which the act is framed. If the language \n     is plain, a reviewing court will enforce it according to its \n     terms. In this case, the proposed language would seem to \n     refer clearly to those states that exclude ``all of a tipped \n     employee's tips from being considered as wages in determining \n     if such tipped employee has been paid the applicable minimum \n     wage rate.'' California, as one of seven states that does not \n     recognize a tip credit, would probably be affected by the \n     enactment of the proposed language. As an affected state, \n     California would appear to be unable to enforce its minimum \n     wage rate laws with respect to tipped employees until it \n     ``revised or amended'' such laws to permit tipped employees \n     to be paid a wage that conforms to subparagraphs (A) and (B) \n     of the proposed language. Thus, if enacted, California would \n     appear to have to choose between the federal tip credit \n     requirements or adopt a law that allows for some form of a \n     tip credit under state law.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 1, 2006.\n     Hon. Judd Gregg,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Budget, U.S. Senate, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As you requested, the Congressional \n     Budget Office, CBO, and the Joint Committee on Taxation, JCT, \n     have estimated the direct spending and revenue effects of \n     H.R. 5970, the Estate Tax and Extension of Tax Relief Act of \n     2006.\n       The legislation would increase the estate and gift tax \n     exemption amounts and reduce the rates, as well as extend and \n     modify various other tax relief provisions. It also would \n     make several changes to the Surface Mining Control and \n     Reclamation Act, and it would increase the minimum wage. JCT \n     and CBO estimate that the legislation would decrease revenues \n     by $15.4 billion in 2007, by $48.1 billion over the next five \n     years, and by $302.4 billion through 2016. CBO and JCT \n     estimate that, under the bill, direct spending would increase \n     by $83 million in 2006, by $3.8 billion over the 2007-2011 \n     period, and by $7.3 billion over the 2007-2016 period.\n       For some budget enforcement procedures, the relevant budget \n     periods are 2006-2010 and 2006-2015. Therefore, we are \n     providing those summarized totals as well. CBO and JCT \n     estimate that enacting this legislation would decrease \n     revenues by $32.524 billion over the 2006-2010 period and by \n     $240.664 billion over the 2006-2015 period. The act would \n     increase direct spending for those periods by $3.008 billion \n     and $6.866 billion, respectively.\n       The estimated budgetary impact of the act is shown in the \n     attached table.\n       CBO has reviewed the non-tax provisions of the \n     legislation--subtitle A of title III and all of title IV--for \n     mandates and has determined that title III contains a \n     private-sector mandate and title IV contains both \n     intergovernmental and private-sector mandates as defined in \n     the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, UMRA. CBO estimates those \n     mandates would impose costs that exceed the annual thresholds \n     established in that act ($64 million for intergovernmental \n     mandates and $128 million for private-sector mandates, in \n     2006 adjusted annually for inflation.)\n       JCT did not review the tax provisions of H.R. 5970 for \n     mandates.\n       Pursuant to section 407 of H. Con. Res. 95 (the Concurrent \n     Resolution on the Budget, Fiscal Year 2006), CBO estimates \n     that enacting H.R. 5970 would not cause an increase in direct \n     spending greater than $5 billion in any of the 10-year \n     periods between 2016 and 2055. (Direct spending would exceed \n     $5 billion over the 2007-2016 period, primarily because of \n     amendments to the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act, \n     but these effects would be significantly lower for subsequent \n     10-year periods.)\n\n\n                                Revenues\n\n       H.R. 5970 would make several changes to tax law, resulting \n     in decreases in federal revenues. JCT and CBO estimate that \n     the legislation would decrease revenues by $15.4 billion in \n     2007, by $48.1 billion over the next five years, and by \n     $302.4 billion through 2016.\n       Title I would modify rules related to the estate and gift \n     taxes. Currently, the effective exemption amount for the \n     estate tax is larger than that for the gift tax. In 2009, \n     under current law, the estate exemption will be $3.5 million, \n     while the gift tax exemption will be $1 million. Under H.R. \n     5970, the estate and gift exemption amounts would be equal to \n     each other, as they were prior to enactment of the Economic \n     Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001. Further, \n     the exemption would be increased to $5 million in 2015. The \n     estate and gift tax rates would be reduced after 2009, and \n     any unused exemption amounts would be allowed to be used by a \n     surviving spouse. JCT estimates that this title would reduce \n     revenues by $14.9 billion over the 2007-2011 period and by \n     $267.6 billion over the 2007-2016 period.\n       Title II would extend and modify various tax relief \n     provisions in current law. JCT and CBO estimate that this \n     title would reduce revenues by $15.5 billion in 2007, by \n     $35.3 billion over the 2007-2011 period, and by $38.2 billion \n     over the 2007-2016 period.\n       Provisions in title II include:\n       Modification (January 1, 2007, through December 31, 2007) \n     and extension (January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2007) of \n     a research credit of 20 percent of the amount by which a \n     taxpayer's qualified research expenses exceed the base amount \n     for that taxable year. JCT estimates that this provision \n     would reduce revenues by $7.5 billion in 2007, by $16.3 \n     billion over the 2007-2011 period, and by $16.5 billion over \n     the 2007-2016 period.\n       Extension for two years of 15-year straight-line cost \n     recovery for qualified restaurant property and leasehold \n     improvement property through December 31, 2007. JCT estimates \n     that this provision would decrease revenues by $418 million \n     in 2007, by $2.9 billion over the 2007-2011 period, and by \n     $5.7 billion over the 2007-2016 period.\n       Extension for two years of taxpayers' option to deduct \n     state and local sales taxes instead of state and local income \n     taxes through December 31, 2007. JCT estimates that this \n     would reduce revenues by $3.0 billion in 2007 and by $5.5 \n     billion over the 2007-2009 period.\n       Extension for two years of the deduction for qualified \n     tuition and other higher education expenses ($2,000 to \n     $4,000, depending on gross income) through December 31, 2007. \n     This provision would decrease revenues by an estimated $1.6 \n     billion in 2007 and $1.7 billion in 2008.\n       Title III would make changes to the Surface Mining Control \n     and Reclamation Act and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. \n     CBO estimates that those provisions would increase net \n     revenues by $560 million over the 2007-2011 period and by \n     $1.0 billion over the next 10 years.\n       These estimates for title III are the net result of two \n     sets of provisions. CBO estimates that reauthorizing certain \n     fees charged to companies that produce coal would increase \n     revenues by $600 million over the 2007-2011 period and by \n     $1.3 billion over the next 10 years (net of effects on income \n     and payroll tax receipts). We also estimate that provisions \n     that affect the financing of retiree benefits for certain \n     retired coal miners would reduce federal revenues, on net, \n     primarily by reducing premiums paid by certain coal companies \n     in the future. Such changes would result in a net revenue \n     loss of $40 million over the 2007-2011 period and $300 \n     million over the next 10 years.\n\n\n                        Direct Spending Effects\n\n       H.R. 5970 includes several provisions that would increase \n     direct spending. CBO and JCT estimate that the bill would \n     increase outlays by $83 million in 2006, by $3.8 billion over \n     the 2007-2011 period, and by $7.3 billion over the 2007-2016 \n     period.\n       The bulk of the new direct spending stems from the Surface \n     Mining Control and Reclamation Act Amendments of 2006 (title \n     III). Title III would make several changes to the Surface \n     Mining Control and Reclamation Act and the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986. CBO estimates that enacting this title would \n     increase direct spending by $2.1 billion over the 2007-2011 \n     period and by $4.9 billion over the next 10 years. (Such \n     spending would drop off, though not completely, after 2016.)\n       Most of the increased spending under title III--$3.8 \n     billion over the next 10 years--would be payments by the \n     Department of the Interior to states, primarily to support \n     efforts to reclaim land that has been mined for coal and for \n     other public purposes. (Roughly $2 billion of that amount \n     would come from the general fund of the Treasury; additional \n     amounts would come primarily from revenues collected as a \n     result of the legislation.) An additional $1.1 billion would \n     be spent under the legislation for health benefits of certain \n     retired coal miners and their dependents and survivors who \n     are eligible to receive retiree health benefits through the \n     United Mine Workers of America Benefit Funds.\n       H.R. 5970 also would affect outlays by:\n       Instituting a refundable tax credit against the individual \n     alternative minimum tax, which JCT estimates would increase \n     outlays by $1.0 billion over the 2007-2011 period and $1.2 \n     billion over the 2007-2016 period.\n       Authorizing, in effect, New York City or the state of New \n     York to spend certain federal tax withholding amounts, which \n     CBO estimates would increase spending by $1.0 billion over \n     the 2007-2016 period.\n       Extending for two years, through the end of 2007, the \n     payment to the treasuries of Puerto Rico and the Virgin \n     Islands of certain amount of excise taxes on imported \n     distilled spirits. CBO estimates this provision would \n     increase outlays by $83 million in 2006 and $95 million \n     over the 2007-2008 period, assuming that H.R. 5970 is \n     enacted in August 2006.\n       Adding to the existing list of taxab1e vaccines two \n     additional vaccines, which CBO estimates would result in \n     increases in spending of $60 million over the 2007-2016 \n     period because some of the proceeds of the excise tax\n\n[[Page S8734]]\n\n     are paid as compensation to injured individuals and some of \n     the vaccines are purchased by Medicaid.\n       Extending for one year the option for individuals to \n     include combat pay in earned income for purposes of the \n     earned income credit, which JCT estimates would increase \n     refundable outlays by $10 million in 2008.\n\n\n             Intergovernmental and Private-Sector Mandates\n\n       JCT did not review the tax provisions of H.R. 5970 for \n     mandates.\n       CBO has reviewed the non-tax provisions of the bill--\n     subtitle A of title III and all of title IV--for mandates and \n     has determined that title III contains a private-sector \n     mandate and title IV contains both intergovernmental and \n     private-sector mandates as defined in UMRA. CBO estimates \n     those mandates would impose costs that exceed the annual \n     thresholds established in that act ($64 million for \n     intergovernmental mandates and $128 million for private \n     sector mandates, in 2006 adjusted annually for inflation.)\n       Specifically, section 312 of title III would create a \n     mandate by requiring certain firms that currently pay for \n     health benefits for retired coal miners (and their dependents \n     and survivors) through collectively bargained agreements to \n     make additional payments for those benefits in specified \n     years. At the same time, other provisions would generate \n     significant reductions in financial obligations existing \n     under current law with regard to payments for retiree health \n     benefits.\n       In addition, section 401 of title IV would amend the Fair \n     Labor Standards Act to increase the federal minimum wage in \n     three steps from $5.15 per hour to $7.25 per hour. The \n     provision would impose mandates, as defined in UMRA, on state \n     and local governments, Indian tribes, and private-sector \n     employers because it would require them to pay higher wages \n     than they are required to pay under current law. CBO \n     estimates that the costs to state, local, and tribal \n     governments and to the private sector would exceed the \n     thresholds established in UMRA.\n       Finally, section 402 of title IV would preempt the minimum \n     wage laws of states that exclude tips from being considered \n     as wages in determining if certain employees have been paid \n     the applicable minimum wage rate. That preemption would be \n     considered an intergovernmental mandate as defined in UMRA; \n     CBO estimates, however, that this mandate would not impose \n     significant additional costs on states.\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact for this \n     estimate is Emily Schlect.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Donald B.

Gordon Smith,\n     Russell Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith: I am writing to urge you in the \n     strongest possible terms to cast a ``No'' vote on H.R. 5970. \n     As Oregon's Labor Commissioner, I am infuriated by this move \n     by the House of Representatives to trample states' rights and \n     reduce the wages of thousands of Oregonians already \n     struggling to make ends meet.\n       I am speaking, of course, of the provision in the bill \n     imposing a ``tip credit'' upon an estimated 65,000 minimum-\n     wage workers in Oregon. It is estimated that each of these \n     workers--waiters, waitresses, bartenders etc.--stand to lose \n     on average $11,000 annually should this bill pass and become \n     law.\n       As you know, I am a long-time champion of Oregon's minimum \n     wage and was one of the petitioners in the successful ballot \n     effort to link our state minimum wage to rises in inflation. \n     Each year, it is one of my proudest duties as state labor \n     commissioner to not only regulate the payment of minimum \n     wages to workers, but to set the new wage rate. However, \n     while I agree with the original efforts of lawmakers to raise \n     the federal minimum wage above the current, embarrassing \n     level of $5.l5 per hour, the political hijacking of that \n     effort has now resulted in a bill that will hurt, rather than \n     help, average, hard-working Oregonians.\n       I would also appeal to your longstanding advocacy of \n     states' rights on a variety of issues. Why would you and your \n     colleagues waver from that stance when it comes to Oregon's \n     minimum wage?\n       For all these reasons, I strongly urge you to vote against \n     the ill-conceived and potentially damaging piece of \n     legislation. All working Oregonians will thank you for \n     protecting their right to provide for themselves and their \n     families. I thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Dan Gardner,\n     Commissioner.\n                                  ____\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we have very few hours before we \ndepart for the August break. Let's say we have 6 hours--360 minutes--\nbefore we leave to campaign or vacation or meet with constituents back \nhome.\n  How are we going to use 360 minutes?\n  The Republican leadership's idea is to use that precious time to pass \nthe so-called ``trifecta'' bill. It's a bill that was sent to us from \nthe House, and I think it symbolizes all that is wrong with the \nRepublican Congress.\n  For one, it is a cynical ruse. This bill holds the minimum wage \nhostage in exchange for a dramatic reduction in the\n\n[[Page S8735]]\n\ninheritance tax--which only the richest families in America pay.\n  The minimum wage has been stuck at $5.15 for almost a decade. That's \n$10,712 a year.\n  And even though the Republican leadership has blocked a clean vote on \nthe minimum wage for years, this ``trifecta'' bill marries the minimum \nwage increase with this huge cut in the inheritance tax. This \ninheritance tax only affects the richest one-half of 1 percent of \nfamilies in the country.\n  So, in other words, the Republican position is: we will only help \neveryday working people in America if you give multi-millionaires and \nbillionaires a bribe.\n  Mr. President, that is not the way to govern this country.\n  This bill is also offensive because it is so out of touch with the \npriorities of the American people.\n  Why aren't we taking steps to actually bring down gas prices? Gas is \nover $3 a gallon. It costs $60 to fill a tank for many people. That's \nwhat most Americans are concerned about right now.\n  Are we going to use these last 360 minutes to deal with that issue?\n  Meanwhile healthcare is in crisis. We have 43 million people without \nhealth insurance.\n  And then there is a storm brewing over the new Medicare drug law. \nIndications of this storm are appearing in newspapers from Honolulu to \nHo-Ho-Kus. This storm is called the Medicare prescription drug coverage \ngap.\n  Some call this coverage gap the ``Doughnut Hole,'' but that is too \nkind a name. It's a much more serious crisis, and can have deadly \nconsequences.\n  Here is what is happening across America because of the coverage gap: \nmillions of seniors on the new Medicare Prescription Drug Plan are \ngoing to the pharmacy counter and experiencing ``sticker shock.'' Why? \nBecause their drugs suddenly cost four times as much as last month.\n  Their drugs are costing four times as much because the Republican \nMedicare law allows drug plans to include a massive gap in coverage. In \na nutshell, once you pay $750 out of pocket from the deductible and co-\npays, your coverage just stops. And to make matters worse, your \ncoverage goes away but you still have to pay the monthly premium.\n  A lot of unhappy seniors are starting to experience this problem, and \nit will only get worse through the end of August and into September.\n  So what are we doing about it?\n  An inheritance tax break for multi-millionaires is what the \nRepublican leadership is concerned about while millions of seniors are \nfacing a financial gap in their prescription drug coverage.\n  I would like to share some stories with my colleagues from recent \nnews articles about how this coverage gap is affecting people across \nthe country.\n  The Bergen Record in New Jersey told the story of Melba Heck, who is \nin the coverage gap. When she started the Medicare Part D plan, she was \npaying $50 a month. Now, all of the sudden, the bill is $400.\n  Ms. Heck, a retired nurse, told the newspaper that ``For the first \ntime in ten years, I've had to cut back on my church pledge.''\n  Marcella Crown of Des Plaines, IL, reached the coverage gap back in \nApril. Her husband said ``Blue Cross is saying that even though she \nwill get no benefit, she must still pay the premiums. That's \noutrageous. We have never had insurance policies that gave us no \nbenefit yet required us to pay premiums.''\n  In Maryland, retired teacher Elise Cain walked into her Silver Spring \npharmacy and said she nearly ``passed out'' at the cash register. Her \ndrug monthly cost jumped from $20 to $175.\n  These are just some examples of the pain that millions of senior \ncitizens will have to endure. Unfortunately, this is only the beginning \nof this crisis.\n  We need to deal with this Medicare coverage gap crisis now. If we \nwait until September, we do so at our own peril.\n  Mr. President, this Congress is out of touch, and the Republican \npriority is to heap more wealth on a few of the richest people in \nAmerica while tens of millions of their hardworking neighbors' children \nwill struggle to get along with less as a result.\n  Let's not let it happen.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am deeply concerned about the cynical \nefforts to tie a much needed boost in the minimum wage to a massive tax \ncut for the heirs of the wealthiest Americans.\n  The economic disparities between minimum wage workers and wealthy \npeople whose large estates are subject to the estate tax are so vast \nthat pairing these two measures together defies logic. I am also hard \npressed to find a link between either of these issues and the extension \nof several expiring tax provisions that have been tacked on as well.\n  No matter how my colleagues in the majority try to dress it up, this \nis really just another vote on the estate tax. It was less than two \nmonths ago that full repeal of the estate tax failed to pass in the \nSenate. Instead of addressing the pressing problems ordinary Americans \nface on a range of economic issues, the leadership is back again trying \nto pass near-elimination of the estate tax.\n  The estate tax is an important component of our progressive federal \ntax system, it is the Federal Government's only tax on wealth, and by \n2009 less than one-half of one percent of all estates will be subject \nto the tax. Far from being a ``death tax,'' the tax falls on heirs who \nseldom had any real role in earning the wealth built up by the estate \nholder. The decedent's estate pays a portion of the total assets to the \nFederal Government and the remainder is then passed on to heirs. \nCapital gains that have built up in the estate tax free are passed on \nto the heirs on a ``stepped up'' basis, and the heirs are not liable \nfor any income tax on these gains. No tax is levied if the estate \npasses to a spouse or is donated to charity. The overwhelming majority \nof estates pay no federal estate tax.\n  As a matter of fact, the non-partisan Tax Policy Center estimates \nthat only about 8,200 estates would owe any estate tax in 2011 if the \n2009 exemption level of $3.5 million were made permanent. Those are the \npeople who would benefit from further cuts in the estate tax and their \nestimated average tax savings is about $1.3 million--a far cry from the \n$2.10 hourly wage increase that the Majority has put on the table for \nminimum wage workers.\n  A minimum wage hike is long overdue. The Federal minimum wage, which \ntoday stands at $5.15 per hour, hasn't been raised since 1997. Since \nthen, inflation has not only wiped out that pay increase but brought \nthe real value of the minimum wage to its lowest level in half a \ncentury. Over the past 9 years, the minimum wage has lost one-fifth of \nits purchasing power.\n  The majority's plan would increase the minimum wage from $5.15 to \n$7.25 per hour by the middle of 2009. The Economic Policy Institute \nestimates that 5.9 million workers would benefit directly from the \nincrease and that the average benefit would be $1,200 per year. Another \n7.1 million workers earning somewhat more than $7.25 per hour could \nbenefit indirectly as a ``spillover benefit'' of the minimum wage \nincrease. However, 1.8 million fewer workers would benefit under the \nRepublican proposal because it phases in the increase over a 3-year \nperiod rather than the 2-year phase-in under Senator Kennedy's \nproposal.\n  Senator Kennedy's minimum wage legislation, which I have cosponsored, \nalso does not contain any poison pills, such as the near-elimination of \nthe estate tax or the egregious roll back of State pay protections for \nminimum wage workers. Currently, there are seven States that have \nchosen not to include a tip penalty in their minimum wage laws. Thus, \ntipped employees in these States earn the full State minimum wage. \nUnder the Republican bill, however, one million tipped employees in \nthese seven States will see a drastic cut in their base pay.\n  Raising the minimum wage is vital because workers have been left out \nof the economic growth we have seen so far in this recovery. Strong \nproductivity growth has translated into higher profits for businesses, \nnot more take home pay for workers. The stagnation of earnings in the \nface of soaring prices for gasoline, home heating, food, health care \nand college tuition is squeezing workers' paychecks. Just this week, \nthe administration admitted as much. At a speech at Columbia Business \nSchool, Treasury Secretary Paulson stated that ``amid this country's \nstrong economic expansion, many Americans simply aren't feeling the \nbenefits. Many aren't seeing significant\n\n[[Page S8736]]\n\nincreases in their take home pay. Their increases in wages are being \neaten up by high energy prices and rising health costs.''\n  No one who works full time should have to live in poverty, but the \ncurrent minimum wage isn't enough to bring even a single parent with \none child over the poverty line--even if the parent works 40 hours a \nweek, 52 weeks a year. Five million more Americans have fallen into \npoverty since President Bush took office--37 million Americans are now \nliving in poverty, including 13 million children.\n  The minimum wage is an important policy tool to lift low-income \nfamilies out of poverty. Almost two-thirds of those who would benefit \nare adult workers, and more than a third of these adults are sole \nbreadwinners for their families. This is not pocket change for \nteenagers, as opponents of the wage floor have argued.\n  The devastation of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita last September put the \nnational spotlight on the problem of poverty in America. As Senator \nGrassley, chairman of the Finance Committee, put it last year, ``It's a \nlittle unseemly to be talking about eliminating the estate tax at a \ntime when people are suffering.''\n  While the minimum wage has steadily lost purchasing power over the \npast 9 years, Federal Reserve data show that over roughly the same \nperiod the inflation-adjusted average net worth of the 10 percent \nfamilies with the greatest wealth increased by almost 40 percent. The \nwealth of those most likely to have estate tax liability has increased \nsubstantially, but the taxes owed on an estate of any given size are \nlower now than they were in 1997 because of increases in the exclusion \nand reductions in the tax rate.\n  The differences in economic circumstances between those at the very \ntop of the income or wealth distribution and those at the bottom are \nvast and widening. Again, during his address in New York, Treasury \nSecretary Paulson stressed that ``addressing issues of wage growth and \nuneven income distribution is a longer-term challenge that we can \naddress.'' And yet, again the rhetoric of this administration does not \nmatch its actions. The consideration of this bill before us today is \nproof that the majority and the administration are not serious about \naddressing disparities.\n  Looking at earnings, minimum wage workers make about $206 for a 40-\nhour week at the current rate of $5.15 per hour. That would put them in \nthe bottom 10 percent of the distribution of usual weekly earnings of \nfull-time workers and these workers have suffered the largest declines \nover the past 5 years. Those at the upper-income levels are seeing \nearnings gains but for those at the bottom- and middle-income levels, \nthere is a loss in real earnings since the President took office \nwhereas in the 1990s, when you saw the proverbial picket fence--there \nwere positive gains at every percentile.\n  Turning to household wealth, an overwhelming majority of households \nhave very little in the way of accumulated wealth and assets and would \nnot be subject to the estate tax. Households in the bottom fifth of the \nwealth distribution have a median wealth of just $2,000. In contrast, \nhouseholds in the top 10 percent have a median wealth of $1.4 million, \nwhich is less than the current estate tax exclusion of $2 million for \nan individual or $4 million for a married couple. Because half of the \nhouseholds in that wealthiest group have less than the median net worth \nof the group, most will not owe any estate tax.\n  The inequity of this proposal is compelling enough, but the budgetary \nconsequences of nearly eliminating the estate tax make it completely \nunpalatable.\n  The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates that this estate \ntax proposal would cost about $600 billion over the 2012-2021 period, \nor about $750 billion when the associated debt service costs are \nincluded. That is about three-quarters of the cost of full repeal, but \nprobably understates the true cost because the latest proposal is not \nfully effective until 2015.\n  We are financing near-repeal of the estate tax with debt, because the \ncosts will be paid for with borrowed money. Future generations of \ntaxpayers--minimum wage workers and others who will make significantly \nless than the heirs of deceased multimillionaires and billionaires--\nwill have to repay those funds. The drain on the budget would occur at \nthe very time that the baby boom generation enters retirement and \nrising Social Security and Medicare costs would strain our budget. \nSecretary Paulson rightfully identified ``reforming entitlement \nprograms, advancing energy security and maintaining and strengthening \ntrade and investment policies that benefit American workers'' as \n``longer-term challenges that will face our economy in the years to \ncome.'' However, as we all know these are challenges that we can only \nmeet if we have the resources to do so. Making permanent fiscally \nirresponsible tax cuts only endanger our abilities to truly address \nwhat should be our national priorities.\n  Raising the minimum wage will increase the likelihood that minimum-\nwage workers will be paying taxes and drawing on fewer government \nservices. In contrast, virtually eliminating the estate tax will reduce \nFederal revenues, increase the budget deficit, and put pressure on \nother government programs that contribute to the economic well-being of \nlower-income workers, including minimum wage workers.\n  Today, we are at war and yet there is no sense of the shared \nsacrifice that has united this country in past conflicts. Ironically, \nthe estate tax was first adopted in the nineteenth century to pay for \ngovernment shortfalls due to wartime spending. Our military families \nare making tremendous sacrifices, and too many of them have made the \nultimate sacrifice in service to our country. With $320 billion \nappropriated or pending for Iraq operations to date and more than 2,500 \nservice men and women killed, the human and financial tolls are both \nmore staggering than imagined.\n  With mounting war costs, the impending retirement of the baby-boom \ngeneration and deficits as far as the eye can see, due to the \nPresident's irresponsible tax cuts, it is unconscionable to think that \nwe are going to vote again on gutting one of the most progressive taxes \non the books.\n  Putting a minimum wage hike that is so necessary for working families \nto make ends meet together with an estate tax bill that benefits a few \nwealthy heirs reveals a warped set of priorities. The same can be said \nfor holding hostage a package of tax extenders that all support. Our \nfocus should be on strengthening the safety net for American families--\nwhether it's raising the minimum wage or preserving Social Security, \npensions, and health insurance coverage.\n  I have been a consistent supporter of the minimum wage, but this is a \ncruel juxtaposition of policies which I can not support.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, it pains me to have to choose between the \nurgent needs of important groups in my constituency, which is why my \ndecision to oppose cloture on the so-called trifecta bill, combining an \nestate tax compromise, minimum wage increase, and tax extenders, is a \ndifficult one for me. However, it is one that I find to be necessary.\n  There are some good measures in this bill, particularly in the tax \nextenders package. I applaud my colleague in the House, Representative \nNeil Abercrombie, for his hard work to reinstate a tax deduction for \nspousal travel that is included in this package. It would have a \npositive effect on tourism-based economies, such as Hawaii's economy. I \nalso appreciate the extension of the research an development credit and \nhigher education above-the-line deduction, among other provisions. \nHowever, on balance, as with so many other large legislative vehicles \nthat we consider on this floor, it is not enough to convince me to \nsupport the overall package.\n  I am disheartened that the majority in Congress uses the plight of \nour low-income and disadvantaged to better the cause for the wealthiest \namong us. For years, I, along with my Democratic colleagues, have \noffered amendments and introduced freestanding bills to increase the \nnational minimum wage rate for our working men and women. If those in \nmajority leadership are serious about increasing the wage rate, then \nthey should pass freestanding bills that are currently pending action \nin both the Senate and the House of Representatives. This is truly an \noutrage that the majority has stooped so\n\n[[Page S8737]]\n\nlow to do this, and to take such a cynical view of the support that a \nminimum wage increase truly has in our country.\n  The package before us further disappoints me because its tip \nprovisions will actually hurt many of those who could use a boost in \nwages. Restaurant staff, valets, parking attendants, bartenders, maids, \nand others who support themselves or their families on tip wages will \nhave current protections taken away by this bill. States that want to \nguarantee a higher floor for tip wages would see their power to do so \nnullified. These hardworking Americans deserve to have the wage \nprotections that their States want to grant them.\n  On the estate tax, I have heard most passionately from auto dealers \nin Hawaii of the tragedies that could occur if the estate tax is not \neliminated or scaled back. Hawaii, as with other States, has lost \nnumerous family-owned businesses due to a number of factors. Our auto \ndealers, farmers, ranchers, and other family-owned entities fear that \nthey will not have the resources to keep their businesses in the event \nof the deaths of current owners, if the estate tax is not repealed or \nrolled back.\n  All of these concerns are heartfelt. I must assure those who have \nwritten that I have heard them and have taken their experiences and \nviews into consideration while deciding what position to take on this \nmatter. I have wanted to help them. However, the vote on cloture on \nH.R. 5970 can also be a missed opportunity to serve countless others in \nour home States and many who have not yet been born. I am talking about \nopposing cloture on a bill that would mortgage future generations by \nadding more than $300 billion to already alarming Federal deficits.\n  According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, provisions to increase \nthe estate tax exemption and link estate tax rates to the capital gains \ntax rate would cost nearly $268 billion over 10 years. Add that to \nextensions and expansions of several expiring tax relief provisions, \nsome of which we must pass, and the bill's cost is $306 billion over 10 \nyears. The minimum wage increase would have a negligible revenue \neffect.\n  My colleague from North Dakota, Senator Conrad, has instructed this \nbody time and time again on the dire fiscal picture that we are facing \non the federal level. Our Budget Committee ranking member noted \nyesterday that our Federal debt increased $551 billion last year and is \nprojected to increase another $600 billion this year. These figures are \nshocking to me, and they will doubtlessly translate into hard decisions \non programs that we already have a hard time funding yet are so \nessential to each of our communities.\n  In fact, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities notes that, \nshould pending budget process reforms be put into place, the combined \neffect with the implementation of estate tax provisions would be to \nforce drastic cuts in various entitlement programs that serve seniors, \nlow-income families, veterans, students, and the disabled. Some of the \nprograms that CBPP notes would surely be on the chopping block to make \nup for estate tax revenue losses include Medicare for seniors, SCHIP \nfor children, Federal civilian retirement, the earned-income tax credit \nfor lower income families, the child tax credit, military retirement, \nunemployment insurance, Supplemental Security Income for the elderly \nand the poor, veterans disability compensation and pensions, Food \nStamps, school lunch and child nutrition, and farm programs.\n  It is because of drastic impacts like this that I have heard from \nhundreds of other constituents who want me to vote to save these \nnecessary programs and others in education, health care, and social \nservices that would bear the brunt of further reductions in \ndiscretionary funding. I simply cannot put the needs of many above the \nneeds of a few, even if they are a well-deserving few, which is why I \ncannot support cloture on this package before us.\n  Once again, the choice to oppose cloture on this measure has been a \ntough one for me. It is far better than estate tax repeal in its \nprojected fiscal outcome, and I thank its authors for their willingness \nto compromise to a certain point. However, the bill does not go far \nenough for me.\n  I deeply appreciate hearing the arguments put forth on both sides of \nthis debate and the work put in on this matter, but I cannot support \nthis cloture motion.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, the Senate is considering today an \nincrease in the minimum wage, a package of tax extenders, and the \nrepeal of the estate tax. I am highly disturbed and disappointed by the \ncourse that the Senate has chosen to hold badly needed tax cut \nextenders and the minimum wage increase hostage to the estate tax bill. \nAnd I find it ironic that the Republican leadership has been referring \nto this as a ``trifecta''--betting terminology. It certainly is a \ngamble. It is a gamble with the livelihoods and pocketbooks of the \nAmerican taxpayer and American worker, and that is surely not what I \nwas elected to do.\n  Tying an increase in the minimum wage and important tax extenders to \nthe estate tax in order to further a political agenda which has \notherwise failed on this issue is outrageous and manipulative, and I \nwill not support it. And to add insult to injury, the majority leader \nhas refused to allow his Senate colleagues, who would like to \nsubstantively address these issues, to offer any amendments. This ``my \nway or the highway approach'' is quintessential partisan politics.\n  I would like to be very clear on my position here. I strongly support \nan increase in the Federal minimum wage. I supported Senator Kennedy's \namendment to the DOD authorization bill that would have increased the \nminimum wage to $7.25 over a 2-year and 2-month period, and I am a \ncosponsor of his Fair Minimum Wage Act. I am also a cosponsor of \nSenator Clinton's Standing with Minimum Wage Earners Act, S. 2725, \nwhich would raise the Federal minimum wage to $7.25 per hour and link \nfuture increases in the minimum wage to congressional raises. I have \nalways supported updating the Federal minimum wage in the past and \nwould like to have the opportunity for an up-or-down vote on the Senate \nfloor.\n  The Republican leadership in both the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives has thus far managed to block an increase in the \nminimum wage. Ironically and sadly, that leadership continues to \nprioritize tax breaks for America's most fabulously wealthy over an \nincrease in wages for hard-working families. It just makes no sense. A \nminimum wage employee working 40 hours per week, 52 weeks a year, would \nearn only $10,700, a figure far below the poverty level for even a two-\nperson family. Inflation has eroded the buying power of the minimum \nwage since it was last increased in 1997. The current minimum wage is \nwoefully inadequate to provide enough income for workers to afford \ndecent housing, set aside sufficient funds for a comfortable \nretirement, or meet any emergency needs. Increasing the minimum wage is \nabout both economics and values. I tire of hearing people talk about \n``family values'' while at the same time doing little to increase wages \nor provide affordable health care and housing.\n  I also strongly support the package of tax extenders that were left \nbehind during tax reconciliation. I was disappointed that the final tax \nreconciliation measure, H.R. 4297, failed to include provisions that \nwould allow South Dakotans to deduct their State and local sales taxes. \nSouth Dakota collects more than 50 percent of its revenue from sales \ntax assessments. It is unfair to expect South Dakotans to pay an \nadditional Federal tax liability simply because of the form of taxes my \nhome State collects, and I strongly favor making the sales tax \ndeduction a permanent part of the Tax Code. I was also disappointed \nthat this measure did not include provisions to allow families paying \ncollege tuition to deduct that tuition from their Federal taxes or \nteachers to deduct the cost of classroom supplies. These tax cuts are \nimportant to many Americans, and I support them unequivocally, but I \nwill not allow the Republican leadership to tell me that I can only \ngive these tax breaks to middle-class Americans by also voting for an \nestate tax repeal that will leave our grandchildren hundreds of \nbillions of dollars of debt.\n\n  Additionally, I will support tax cuts that target working Americans, \nso long as they are enacted in a fiscally responsible manner with \nappropriate revenue offsets. The estate tax noose that has been tied \naround this legislative\n\n[[Page S8738]]\n\npackage is not in keeping with this philosophy.\n  While I feel strongly that Congress must act to give some estate tax \npermanency and certainty to estate planning, I do not support full \nrepeal or any measure that would only benefit a tiny number of \nfabulously wealthy estates while at the same time being so costly that \nit would require massive borrowing from foreign nations and from the \nSocial Security trust fund in order to write the checks.\n  Since the Federal Government is already running several hundred \nbillions of dollars annually in the red as it is, any further tax cuts \nand giveaways for America's multimillionaires will require that we \nborrow the money to give to them. Increasingly, the borrowing will be \nfrom foreign nations and from Social Security revenues. That also means \nthat additional tax cuts for the middle-income taxpayers will be almost \nimpossible and that the middle class and their children will have to \npay higher taxes for decades to pay off the debt service on the \nmultimillionaire tax cut. That debt service already costs the taxpayers \n$1 billion per day.\n  The estate tax legislation that has come before us thus far has been \nunrealistic and costly. I would be supportive of legislation exempting \nfamily farms, ranches, and small businesses from the estate tax. In \nfact, in 2001, I voted to do just that. Unfortunately, then, the \nRepublican party decided to enact legislation that called for, among \nother things, a phaseout of the Federal estate tax that provides \ncomplete repeal in 2010 but reverts to an exemption of only $650,000 in \n2011. Because of this mistake we have had to have this discussion every \nelection year since.\n  Easing taxes on farms, ranches, and small businesses is one thing, \nbut the total repeal being pushed as a political statement during this \nrunup to the election season is irresponsible. I believe the Federal \nGovernment ought to be doing more for middle-class and working \nfamilies, rather than focusing its attention on the Paris Hilton and \nDonald Trump crowd.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my serious concerns \nwith a bill before this body, H.R. 5970, that unnecessarily links a \nlong-overdue increase in the minimum wage and a broadly-supported \npackage of tax extenders to an unaffordable and irresponsible cut in \nthe tax on multimillion-dollar estates.\n  This so-called ``trifecta'' bill sends a clear message to the \nAmerican people about the priorities of the leadership on the other \nside of the aisle--priorities that are badly out of step with the needs \nof ordinary Americans.\n  Many of us in this body support fiscally responsible reform of the \nestate tax. But compared to most reasonable proposals, the one in this \nbill would cost nearly twice as much, while adding very little \nadditional value.\n  Over the last several years, the number of Americans affected by the \nestate tax has fallen dramatically as the exemption level has been \nraised. In 2000, with an exemption of $675,000, there were 50,000 \ntaxable estates. That number has fallen to only 13,000 today, with the \nexemption level now standing at $2 million for an individual and $4 \nmillion for a couple. In 2009, the exemption will rise to $3.5 \nmillion--or $7 million for a couple--and only 7,000 estates will be \nsubject to the tax. These 7,000 taxable estates represent the largest \nthree-tenths of 1 percent of estates in America, all of which exceed \n$3.5 million in size. By 2009, only this small fraction will owe even a \ncent under the estate tax.\n  Compared to current or 2009 rates, this ``trifecta'' bill would \nprovide a tax cut for only the largest 8,200 estates in the country. \nAnd the average size of the tax benefit received by each of these \nestates would be $1.4 million. Out of a nation of 300 million people, \nonly the wealthiest 8,200 would gain from this bill's estate tax \nproposal, but it would cost the American people $753 billion over the \nfirst decade alone once it has been fully phased in.\n  The leadership on the other side of the aisle knows that this body \nwould rightly reject such a gratuitously irresponsible proposal if it \nwere offered as a stand-alone bill. So the majority leader in this body \nand his counterparts in the House of Representatives have decided, in \nwhat amounts to political blackmail, to attach this estate tax measure \nto a moving vehicle, the package of tax extenders that includes \nprovisions like the research and development tax credit that supports \ninnovation by America's businesses, the tax deduction for college \ntuition that helps students and their families pay for the skyrocketing \ncost of higher education, and the tax deduction for teacher classroom \nexpenses, among many other important items.\n  In effect, the supporters of this ``trifecta'' bill have decided to \nhold hostage these important tax provisions, which benefit families and \nbusinesses across the income spectrum, to an estate tax measure that, \non its own, would otherwise be rejected. And in a misguided attempt to \n``sweeten the deal'' or provide political cover, they have added a \nprovision to raise the minimum wage that, itself, is flawed due to the \nwage cut it would force upon many employees who earn their pay through \ntips.\n\n  Many of us in this body have been fighting for years to increase the \nminimum wage, only to have our efforts blocked repeatedly. America's \nlowest-wage workers have waited far too long for a raise--it has been \n10 years, almost to the day, since this body last voted to raise the \nminimum wage to $5.15 per hour.\n  In the time since then, the minimum wage's real buying power has \nfallen to its lowest level in 51 years. For a full-time worker, a wage \nof $5.15 per hour translates to a yearly income of $10,700--an amount \nthat is nearly $6,000 below the poverty line for a family of three. \nThese are working adults, with full-time jobs, who are living in \npoverty.\n  At those wages, these working Americans can barely afford housing and \nfood. They certainly can't afford adequate health care, child care, or \neducation needed to lift them out of a low-wage job. With gasoline \nprices and other energy costs rising, one wonders how people make ends \nmeet.\n  Unfortunately, too many are falling behind.\n  And too often, the victims are children, whose only fault was to be \nborn into the wrong family. More than a third of the 37 million \nAmericans currently living in poverty are children. Through no fault of \ntheir own, these voiceless Americans live day-to-day without adequate \nfood and shelter, forced to choose between food and rent or medicine or \nutilities.\n  In my State of Connecticut, we have a population of about 3.4 million \npeople and the perception is that we are a rich State. But we are not \nexempt, in Connecticut, from the scourges of poverty and hunger. In \nfact, more than 280,000 people in my State, many of them children, are \nfood insecure--meaning they don't have access at all times to the food \nnecessary to lead a healthy life. Two of the largest food banks in \nConnecticut provide food for more than 350,000 different people each \nyear. Working people make up 25 percent of those using those emergency \nfeeding programs. People are working hard and they can't even feed \ntheir families--how is this acceptable?\n  Raising the minimum wage from $5.15 per hour to $7.25 per hour would \ndirectly boost the earnings of 6.6 million working Americans. It would \nalso indirectly benefit an estimated 8.3 million additional workers who \ncurrently earn close to $7.25 per hour and would likely see their wages \nrise in response to a minimum wage increase.\n  Some of my colleagues have argued that raising the minimum wage would \nharm employers or reduce overall levels of employment, but study after \nstudy has shown these claims to be unfounded. A recent Gallup poll \nfound that 86 percent of small business owners do not think the minimum \nwage negatively affects their business. And a substantial body of \nresearch by well-known economists finds no significant harm to overall \nlevels of employment based on changes to the minimum wage. So while a \nminimum wage increase would dramatically improve the lives of millions \nof Americans, the potential costs would be small.\n  America's lowest-earning working men and women desperately need a \nraise--even a small one. But this bill, by tying an increase in the \nminimum wage to a costly ``virtual repeal'' of the estate tax, has the \npotential to cancel out the good that would be done. By adding $753 \nbillion to the national debt--which already stands at $8.4 trillion--\nthis estate tax proposal would\n\n[[Page S8739]]\n\nforce deep cuts in services for all Americans, regardless of income. \nBut those who earn the least would likely be hurt the most.\n  No one who supports raising the minimum wage or approving the \nbipartisan package of tax extenders should be fooled into thinking that \nthis bill represents a serious attempt to help American workers, \nbusinesses, or taxpayers.\n  The estate tax proposal that has been attached to these important \nmeasures is unaffordable and unnecessary. It would drive us deeper into \ndebt with foreign creditors, force damaging funding cuts during already \ntight budgetary times--not to mention during a time of war--and \nincrease the burden on our children and grandchildren of paying for our \nexcess.\n  For these reasons, Mr. President, I cannot support this irresponsible \nlegislation, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting against this \nbill.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the latest effort to \nreduce the estate tax for a small fraction of the wealthiest Americans \nat a cost to all Americans of more than $750 billion. This time our \nfriends in the House of Representatives realized that the Senate would \nreject such a reckless policy. So rather than scaling back Paris \nHilton's tax cut to a reasonable level or suggesting a fair way to pay \nfor their tax cuts, they have done something else. They have decided to \nhold an increase in the minimum wage hostage to a fiscally destructive \ncut in the estate tax.\n  This is cynical politics at its worst. This is government by gimmick. \nCombining the estate tax with a minimum wage increase and temporary tax \ncut extenders is not an example of finding common ground or moving to a \nreasonable compromise; this is an example of political coercion. And \nthe American people are wise to it.\n  This is simply an attempt to dare members of my party to vote against \nan increase in the minimum wage which has been one of our long-time \npriorities.\n  But why should we have to agree to nearly $800 billion of additional \nFederal debt--debt that our children and grandchildren will have to pay \nback in higher taxes down the road--in order to get a long-overdue wage \nincrease for those struggling to make ends meet that would have no \nnegative effect on the Federal budget?\n  Why should we have to agree to an average tax break of $1.4 million \nfor several thousand wealthy estates in order to add about $1,200 on \naverage to the incomes of several million working families?\n  Why should we have to agree to a permanent reduction in the estate \ntax for billionaires when all the tax benefits for students, small \nbusinesses, teachers, and neighborhoods will expire under this bill in \na year or two?\n  This bill is not the outcome of a robust policy debate or bipartisan \ncompromise in the public interest. It's not the result of honest \ntradeoffs. No. This bill is a cynical ploy to say ``gotcha'' to the \nDemocrats. At best it's politically clever, but in no way is it smart.\n  Increasing the minimum wage would make a significant difference in \nthe lives of this country's most vulnerable workers. The Federal \nminimum wage has not been adjusted since 1997 and the proposed increase \nreally just keeps workers from falling further behind in their struggle \nto keep up with inflation. It is shameful that the President and \nCongress have not acted sooner to raise the minimum wage.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle know that. So they have \ntied the minimum wage vote to the estate tax. They have tied the fate \nof several million working families and their ability to buy food and \ngas and school supplies to the ability of wealthy heirs to inherit even \nlarger estates tax free.\n  I am confident that the American people will see through this. By \n2009, the estate tax will already be repealed for more than 99 percent \nof all Americans. For the few estates that are wealthy enough to have \nto pay the estate tax, they can make unlimited charitable deductions, \nthey can pass along at least $7 million to their heirs tax free, they \ncan take more than a dozen years to pay-off the taxes owed, and the \neffective tax rate will be fair and reasonable. We could extend that \nstatus forever, and members of both parties could claim victory and \nmove on to addressing America's real priorities.\n  Instead we are here once more, debating tax cuts and adding to \nAmerica's debt.\n  Now let's be honest. This is not about saving small businesses and \nfamily farms. We can reform the estate tax to protect the few farms \nthat are affected. We can set it at a level where no small business is \never affected. We can even repeal the estate tax altogether for the \n99.5 percent of families with less than $7 million in taxable assets \nthat means families with assets almost 100 times greater than the \naverage American household's net worth. That would be compromise. That \nwould be sensible.\n  Democrats have offered to reform the estate tax in these ways time \nand time again. But over and over, our offers have been refused, which \ncan only mean that the party in power is really interested in an \nunprecedented giveaway to the wealthiest of the wealthy.\n  And don't think for a minute that there is any plan to pay for this. \nEvery proposal to enforce pay-as-you-go rules for fiscal responsibility \nhas been rebuffed. This tax cut will have to be paid for in the years \nahead by higher taxes on working families and reduced public services \nin all of our communities. This tax cut will have to be paid for by \nhigher interest rates on homes and student loans. And this tax cut will \nhave to be paid for by greater dependence on foreign countries.\n  It's amazing to me how little the Congress has actually accomplished \nthis year and how much time we have wasted on the estate tax. You would \nthink the richest among us were the most oppressed. And even now we are \nbeing blocked from dealing with bipartisan pension legislation, not to \nmention dealing with the costs of healthcare, our real homeland \nsecurity challenges, or the threat of global warming.\n  So if the Republicans want to bring up the estate tax yet again to \nuse it as an election issue later, I say go for it. Because there may \nbe no better illustration of how we differ in priorities than this \nirresponsible vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, a lot has changed in the last 10 years. \nGasoline prices have risen, up 70 percent since President Bush took \noffice in 2001. Child care costs have risen and now a typical family \ncan expect to pay almost $10,000 per year for one child, which is more \nthan the cost of public college tuition. Health care costs are soaring, \nand health insurance premiums are skyrocketing. In short, the cost of \neveryday life has greatly increased. We in Congress have certainly \ntaken notice: we have given ourselves a pay raise eight times since \n1997, totaling $30,000, and we've given the President pay raises \ntotaling $200,000. Yet in that time we have failed to give working \nAmericans a raise by increasing the minimum wage.\n  Now, facing tough reelection races and a disillusioned public, my \nRepublican colleagues are finally willing to do something about it, but \nonly on their terms. Despite the fact that the rich are getting richer \nand the poor are getting poorer, my colleagues' ``solution'' to help \nAmerican families is to attach the long-overdue minimum wage increase \nto an otherwise un-passable estate tax reform bill that will benefit \njust a few wealthy families. This is nothing more than political \nblackmail. If Congress were genuine about its care for the lives of \nhard-working Americans--if we truly believed that any honest American \nworking a full time job should not have to live in poverty--we would \nnever condition a minimum raise increase on a windfall for the wealthy.\n  Since President Bush took office, the number of Americans living in \npoverty has increased by 5.4 million, bringing the total to 37 million \nAmericans who live in poverty today, 13 million of whom are children. \nWhat's even more disturbing is that over 70 percent of children in \npoverty live in a home where at least one parent works. So today in \nAmerica we have a situation in which millions of children are living in \npoverty despite the fact that they live in homes with a working adult. \nAmong full-time, year-round workers, poverty has increased by 50 \npercent since the late 1970s.\n  This may be surprising, but if you take a minute to understand the \nsituation the picture becomes clear. Consider a single mother of two \nworking a\n\n[[Page S8740]]\n\nminimum wage job 40 hours a week for 52 weeks a year. Without taking \nany time off for illness or vacation, she earns just $10,700 a year, \nnearly $6,000 below the Federal poverty line for a family of three. The \ncurrent minimum wage equals only 31 percent of the average wage for the \nprivate sector, nonsupervisory workers, the lowest percentage on record \nsince World War II. In the past 9 years, the purchasing power of the \nminimum wage has deteriorated by 20 percent, and today the value of the \nminimum wage is as its lowest level since 1955.\n  What these figures make absolutely clear is that it's long past time \nto raise the minimum wage. Just 5 weeks ago, the Senate failed to give \nrelief to hard-working Americans by increasing the minimum wage. What \nhas changed? As far as I can tell, two things have changed. First, \nRepublicans in tight races realized their failure to address the needs \nof working Americans would hurt their chances for reelection. Second, \nthose in favor of repealing the estate tax realized that the likelihood \nof doing so was slim to none. So they agreed to increase the minimum \nwage to $7.25 over a 3-year period that will benefit millions of \nworking families, but they would only do so at a cost of $268 billion \nin estate tax relief for a few wealthy families.\n  I think we can all agree that the estate tax law needs to be \nrevisited. The current policy does not make sense, but neither does \nrelief that benefits a few. The estate tax relief before us has a long-\nterm negative impact on our deficit. The 10-year costs from 2012-2021 \nare $753 billion when interest is included. That is $753 billion that \nwill be added to the deficit or result in vital programs having their \nfunding slashed. And there is no discussion now about how to pay for \nthis bill.\n  An increase in the minimum wage should not be saddled with an \nunrelated, unnecessary, and unfair tax provision. We should pass a \nclean minimum wage bill and then work on a bipartisan estate tax bill \nthat is fiscally responsible and protects most small businesses from \nthe estate tax.\n  The legislation before us provides an average tax cut of $1.4 million \nto 8,200 estates. A minimum wage increase would provide an average \nbenefit of $1,200 to 6.6 million hard-working Americans. The package \nbefore us clearly reflects misguided priorities. I cannot think of one \nreason why minimum wage legislation should include estate tax relief.\n  When President Theodore Roosevelt advocated an estate tax nearly a \ncentury ago, he argued that, the ``man of great wealth owes a peculiar \nobligation to the state, because he derives special advantage from the \nmere existence of government.'' He further advocated that ``[w]e are \nbound in honor to refuse to listen to those men who make us desist from \nthe effort to do away with the inequality, which means injustice; the \ninequality of right, opportunity, of privilege. We are bound in honor \nto strive to bring ever nearer the day when, as far as is humanly \npossible, we shall be able to realize the ideal that each man shall \nhave an equal opportunity to show the stuff that is in him by the way \nin which he renders service.''\n  We need to return to a society that values hard work. We cannot let \nourselves become a society divided by income inequity. Defeating this \nbill is a step in the right direction toward fairness and the \nrestoration of sane, responsible fiscal policy.\n  In addition to the minimum wage, the bill before us includes so-\ncalled expiring tax provisions that Congress should pass. There is no \nreason we cannot work together to extend expiring provisions such as \nthe research and development credit and a tax deduction for the cost of \na college education, which expired at the end of 2005. It is \nembarrassing that the Senate is leaving for our August recess without \nextending these provisions, especially since the capital gains and \ndividends rates that did not expire until 2008 have been extended to \n2010. The extension of these provisions should not be threatened. The \nprice of helping families with college education should not be estate \ntax relief for the wealthiest estates.\n  Mr. President, I support raising the minimum wage. I support tax \ncredits for research development and college education. But I cannot \nsupport them when they are tied to fiscally irresponsible so-called \nreforms. I cannot support a bill that continues to put the interests of \nthe wealthy above the interests of hard-working Americans. If my \ncolleagues are serious about increasing the minimum wage, I challenge \nthem to do so in a clean bill. I challenge them to put the best \ninterests of working Americans front and center. I challenge them to \nstand up to this political blackmail and oppose the Estate Tax and \nExtension of Tax Relief Act. The American people deserve better than \nthis.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this so-called trifecta bill is a bet by \nthe Republican leadership that the American people will not notice \ntheir strategy to gut the estate tax in order to give the wealthiest \none-half of 1 percent of our families a huge tax break. I hope they \nwill lose that bet.\n  The Republicans have tried to sweeten their fiscally reckless \nproposal by extending popular tax cuts that have strong support and by \nadding an increase in the minimum wage that many of them do not even \nwant and have opposed repeatedly for years. Republican leaders know \nthat their estate tax proposal would not pass on its own, so they have \nadded other provisions that many want in hopes of drawing enough votes \nto pass their true goal--more tax cuts for the superrich. Failing that, \nthe Republican leaders seem willing to settle for having as a talking \npoint that they tried to increase the minimum wage, even though they \nhave opposed it year after year.\n  The American people will not be fooled. They know that many have \nfought tooth and nail to increase the minimum wage, and that we will \nkeep fighting. But we won't be blackmailed into supporting \nirresponsible tax cuts by a political gambit.\n  This estate tax proposal is unfair and unaffordable. Only a tiny \nfraction of all estates pay any estate tax. In 2004, only 1 percent of \nestates in Michigan and 1.2 percent nationwide paid any estate tax. And \nas the amount exempted from the tax continues to rise to $3.5 million \nper person in 2009, the percentage gets even smaller. And despite \nclaims to the contrary, even without this misguided bill, those \nfamilies actually subject to the estate tax will still be able to pass \non great wealth to their children.\n  Once phased in, this so-called ``compromise'' proposal would cost at \nleast 75 percent as much as repealing the estate tax entirely. In the \nfirst ten-year period in which the proposal would be in full effect, it \nwould cost nearly $600 billion. The cost would be $750 billion when \ninterest payments on the additional debt are taken into account.\n  We simply cannot afford such a massive tax cut that would push us \neven further into the deficit ditch. Today, each American citizen's \nshare of the debt is almost $29,000. As we continue to run up record \nyearly deficits, the country's total debt will be more than $11 \ntrillion by 2011, which is $37,000 per person. It is not just reckless \nfiscal and economic policy to saddle future generations with this kind \nof crushing debt burden; passing this kind of burden to our children \nand grandchildren goes against what should be our basic values.\n  In the words of Republican President Teddy Roosevelt, who proposed \nthe estate tax: ``[I]nherited economic power is as inconsistent with \nthe ideals of this generation as inherited political power was \ninconsistent with the ideals of the generation which established our \ngovernment.''\n  If we have any hope of getting our Federal budget deficit under \ncontrol, eliminating the estate tax for the extremely wealthy is \nexactly the wrong thing to do. We need to look out for all of our \ncitizens, not just the very wealthiest among us. This giveaway to a \ntiny fraction of estates will ultimately have to be paid for by steep \ncuts in government services or tax increases that will likely impact \nfar more Americans.\n  To achieve the goal of more tax cuts for the very few, this bill \nholds hostage two critical issues. First, it includes a desperately \nneeded, though flawed, increase in the minimum wage. And, second, it \nhas a package of popular tax benefits that includes allowing families \nto deduct up to $4,000 in tuition payments and tax credits for research \nand development.\n  Minimum wage workers have not seen a Federal raise for 10 years. \nDuring that same time period, Congress\n\n[[Page S8741]]\n\nraised its own pay eight times. An employee working full-time on \nminimum wage earns only $10,712 per year, which is below the Federal \npoverty level. It is shameful this Congress find it acceptable that \nAmericans work hard every day, all year long, at legal jobs and still \nlanguish in poverty.\n  I have cosponsored a bill that gives the working men and women of \nthis country the pay raise that they deserve, legislation that would \nraise the minimum wage to $7.25 an hour in several increments. If the \nmajority cared about rewarding the hard work of a large number of \nAmericans as much as they cared about protecting the enormous wealth of \na few others, there would be a clean vote just on raising the minimum \nwage.\n  Even though the so-called trifecta bill would raise the minimum wage \nfor many workers, it would also result in a pay cut for many Americans. \nIt includes a ``tip credit'' provision that really should be called a \ntip penalty. The bill allows workers in industries in which tips are \ncommonplace--such as waiters, waitresses, hotel maids, parking \nattendants and bartenders--to receive as little as $2.13 before the \ntips.\n  Although this tip penalty has been Federal law for years, States have \nbeen free to guarantee higher wages to workers in these industries. \nThis bill would supersede those state laws to permit the lower wages. \nThis will decrease wages in at least seven States, and it will set a \ndangerous precedent by allowing the Federal Government to interfere \nwith the States to cut the wages of the lowest-paid workers.\n  This bill also holds captive several important expiring tax \nprovisions that have broad support and would easily pass on their own. \nThe provisions include the work opportunity tax credit, which \nencourages employers to hire members of targeted groups such as high \nrisk youth, families receiving food stamps, SSI recipients, and \nqualified veterans. Another provision, the welfare-to-work tax credit, \nenables employers to claim a credit on the first $10,000 of wages paid \nto certain long-term family assistance recipients.\n  Another provision is the deduction for the expenses of elementary and \nsecondary school teachers of up to $125 for books and other supplies. \nAnd there is a deduction of up to $4,000 for qualified tuition and \nrelated expenses. There is also a provision that would help shippers on \nthe Great Lakes.\n  Finally, the expiring provisions include a critical tax credit for \nresearch and development done here in the U.S. This is an important way \nfor the Government to help our Nation's economic competitiveness, \nespecially in the manufacturing sector, which represents nearly two-\nthirds of our total private R While the R credit's cost of $16 \nbillion for two years is a significant investment by the Government, \neach dollar of the credit leads to a significant increase in business \nR spending, thus spurring economic growth. Congress should enact this \nimportant program on a permanent basis, instead of revisiting it every \nyear or two, given all the uncertainty that is created by doing so.\n  It will be shameful if these provisions--which are good for the \neconomy, important for our people, and supported by this Congress--are \nnot renewed because of the political gamesmanship on this bill.\n  Mr. President, we hopefully will not fall for this political trick. \nThe American people deserve better from their Government.\n  If the Republican leaders want to pass a minimum wage increase, give \nus a clean bill that does that and we'll pass it today. If they want to \nextend the popular and reasonable tax provisions that are expiring, \nlet's work together to do that. But the pending bill would require us \nto swallow two poison pills and one aspirin. Hopefully, that \ncombination will be resoundingly rejected by the Senate.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I favor repeal of the estate tax. \nThe estate tax often forces ranchers and farmers in my home State of \nMontana to have to struggle just to pass their land on to their \nchildren. But the political games that Congressional leaders played \nwith this bill are not the way to get the job done. I hope that cooler \nheads can prevail and that we can work together for sensible reform in \nthe future.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, our country is at war. We face fundamental \nchallenges to our security at home and abroad. The President himself \nhas compared our situation to the Cold War, to World War II. Those were \nexistential struggles, for which we made great sacrifices and which \nfundamentally realigned our priorities.\n  Thousands of American families have paid the ultimate sacrifice, tens \nof thousands of our sons and daughters have been wounded. Tens of \nthousands more have been put in the line of fire, some of them for \nmultiple tours of duty.\n  The war in Iraq alone has lasted longer than World War II, and its \ncost, at $315 billion, continues to grow.\n  Here at home, we face challenges to the American dream--the faith \nthat hard work would be rewarded with a decent job, a better future for \nour children, and secure retirement.\n  The income of the average American family has not risen in the past 6 \nyears. Global competition from a billion and a half new workers will \nchange the world our children inherit. American families have virtually \nno money left over to save, and private retirement savings are woefully \ninadequate to meet the wave of retirees now upon us.\n  To meet these challenges, we will have to make massive investments in \neducation and in research to boost the productivity and earnings of \nAmerican workers. We need to find alternative fuels to reduce our \ndependence on oil that undermines our foreign policy and holds our \neconomy hostage.\n  Over 46 million Americans are without health insurance. Only 5 \npercent of the containers that pass through our ports are inspected for \nweapons. Our passenger rail system lacks the basic lighting, fences, \ndog patrols, and cameras that could prevent attacks by terrorists we \nknow have that system in their sights. This is just a short list of the \nprofound challenges we face as a Nation. We can all think of others.\n  While our needs multiply, we lack the resources to meet them. Handed \na 10-year surplus of $5.6 trillion, this administration has dragged us \ndown, through the most dramatic reversal in our Nation's history, into \nan additional $3 trillion in debt.\n  They have doubled our debt to foreign governments. We now owe more \nthan $2 trillion to Japan, China, and others. We are losing control of \nour financial future.\n  We are borrowing from our own national retirement savings, the Social \nSecurity system. This year alone, we will borrow $177 billion from \nSocial Security.\n  Every day we go deeper into debt to foreign governments. Every day we \nspend more of our national retirement savings. And every day our basic \nneeds, from homeland security to our retirement savings to our \nchildren's future--those needs are ignored.\n  That is the setting, that is the background, those are the \ncircumstances in which we are now asked to cut taxes on just 7,000 of \nthe wealthiest heirs in our country--at a cost of over $750 billion in \nthe first decade it is in effect.\n  All of that will be borrowed. It is a transfer of $750 billion to the \nwealthiest two-tenths of 1 percent of Americans, borrowed from China, \nfrom Japan, from our own Social Security system. Somebody will have to \npay that back.\n  Our children and our grandchildren will pay that back. It is a \ntransfer from those with no voice of their own in our system, a \ntransfer to those whose wealth speaks the loudest.\n  Under current law, the estate tax will affect fewer than 7,000 \nestates in the whole country by 2009. That year, a couple will be able \nto exempt a $7 million estate from taxes--a $7 million estate will pay \nno estate taxes. None.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that only 65 family \nfarms in the whole country will be subject to estate tax at that point, \nunder current law. Sixty-five farms, period.\n  Seven thousand of the wealthiest families will be the only ones \npaying any estate tax, and only 65 of those estates will be family \nfarms, barely more than 1 farm per State across Our Nation.\n  And yet we are here today, actually considering reducing those \nnumbers further, and driving our debt deeper, to save the most \nfortunate among us from that small remainder of an estate tax.\n\n[[Page S8742]]\n\n  I believe that with the changes in current law we have accomplished \nsome appropriate reform. I believe that family businesses and family \nfarms should not be broken up to pay taxes. With the booming economy of \nthe 1990s, many more Americans joined the ranks of those who could face \nestate taxes. Raising the exemption level and lowering the rate made \nsense.\n  Under current law, in my State of Delaware, fewer than 50 families \nwill face any estate tax in 2009. Those are reforms that protect all \nbut a few from the estate tax. It protects family businesses and family \nfarms.\n  But I opposed complete repeal of the estate tax, and I oppose this \nlegislation that will cost us $750B, three quarters of the cost of full \nrepeal.\n  I oppose it, not because those who would benefit aren't good \nAmericans. I am sure they are. Because they are good Americans, I think \nmost would agree that given the world we live in today, facing a global \nthreat to our security, with gaps in our homeland security, with clear \ndomestic needs unmet, with our Federal finances already in the red--in \nthe face of those facts, full repeal is a luxury that we cannot afford.\n  We could provide our middle class with some tax relief, by extending \nprotection from the marriage penalty for $46 billion. We could extend \nthe child tax credit for $183 billion. We could extend the college \ntuition deduction for $19 billion. Instead, the top priority of the \nleadership in this Congress is a handout to the most fortunate, paid \nfor by three-quarters of a trillion dollars in debt heaped on our kids.\n  To add insult to this injury, the first pay raise for minimum wage \nworkers in 10 years is now hostage to this estate tax cut. Under \ncurrent law, you can be paid a wage that keeps you below the poverty \nline even if you are working full time.\n  Over the past 24 years, the most fortunate Americans, in the top 1 \npercent, saw their incomes more than double--from an average of \n$306,000 to over $700,000. During that same period, the incomes of \naverage Americans grew just 15 percent.\n  But the poorest fifth of our citizens saw their already inadequate \nincomes grow just $600--over 24 years.\n  We are moving apart, not coming together, as a nation.\n  The minimum wage has not increased since 1996--and all of that \nincrease has been wiped out by the cost of living. The minimum wage \ntoday, at $5.15 an hour, is even worth less in today's dollars than the \n$4.25 rate it replaced.\n  Today, the minimum wage is worth only a third of the average hourly \nwage of American workers, the lowest level in more than half a century. \nThe bottom rung of the ladder of opportunity is broken. It is time to \nfix it.\n  That means a pay raise for over 7 million workers, in three stages, \nover the next 3 years, to $7.25 an hour. That will lift the floor under \neverybody's wages.\n  But now we are told that to get those folks on minimum wage a raise, \nwe have to go three-quarters of a trillion dollars into debt to China, \nJapan, and other countries so that the sons and daughters of the 7,000 \nmost fortunate families among us will be spared the estate tax.\n  Everyone else's sons and daughters will get that bill. Our country, \nalready the world's biggest debtor nation, already borrowing 65 percent \nof all the money borrowed by countries around the world, already \nspending the retirement savings that should be going into Social \nSecurity, our country will be weaker financially because of it.\n  The American people are tired of seeing this kind of ``gotcha'' \npolitics while our country is at war, while we face serious challenges \nto our economic competitiveness, our health, our children's future. \nInstead of a long overdue adjustment in the minimum wage, we get \npolitical theater.\n  And finally, instead of extending important tax credits to promote \nresearch and development, to clean up brownfields--even to give our \nfighting forces tax credits for combat pay--we are given this take-it-\nor-leave-it deal that makes estate tax cuts the top priority.\n  Those are not the priorities of the American people, and this Senate \nshould reject them.\n  We can pass a minimum wage increase to reward work at the bottom of \nour economic ladder. We can extend the tax breaks that meet real needs \nand that serve genuine public policy needs. We can do that, and we can \nleave in place substantial reforms to the estate tax that have already \ntaken place.\n  First, we must say no to this transparent gimmick. Then we can do \nwhat we should have done in the first place.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, has time been used on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 7 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized \nfor 3 minutes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, thank you. I thank the leader for \nyielding.\n  This body is criticized a lot because we stand here and yell at each \nother and don't get a lot done. We block and we blame, we obstruct, we \ndon't do the people's business.\n  The bill that we are about to vote on, 20 years ago, 30 years ago, \nwould have been hailed by all as a compromise out of the great \ncompromises that we have seen in the Senate over the centuries, truly a \ncompromise.\n  The No. 1 highest priority of the Senate Democrats, included in this \nbill--their highest priority. We have voted on minimum wage more in \nthis Chamber than probably any other issue. The No. 1 priority in this \nbill, their highest priority with respect to taxes, the R tax credit, \nthe extenders provision, and a variety of different provisions, tax \nprovisions, that were key provisions for many Senate Democrats, \nincluded in this bill.\n  In addition to that, we have the abandoned mine lands bill that \nSenator Rockefeller and I have worked on for months and months. This is \nthe only opportunity for the abandoned mine lands issue to be voted on \nin the Senate. There may be attempts to throw this in and attach it to \nother bills and all sorts of pounding the chest of how we are not \nletting it happen.\n  This is a compromise. This is giving things that I can tell you many \non this side of the aisle don't want to give--whether it is minimum \nwage, whether it is AMT, whether it is many of the provisions in this \nbill, there are a lot of folks on this side of the aisle who do not \nlike any of this, and, in fact, have never voted for any of these \nthings.\n  In exchange for that, what most of the Members on this side of the \naisle would like to see done is to do something about the onerous death \ntax which is scheduled to expire in 2010, and then revive itself from \nthe dead the next year--horrible tax policy.\n  But that is where we are. We are trying to fix this. We are trying to \nget the priorities of both sides together in a bill to move this \ncountry forward in a way that both sides can walk away and say: We \ndidn't get everything we wanted, but we made progress; I got something \nthat was really important to me.\n  Both sides can say that. Both sides can say: I didn't get everything \nI wanted or I have to vote for something I don't like in this bill; \nThis isn't exactly the way I would do it. This problem is bigger than \nall the other good things.\n  You know what? One thing I have always learned in my time in \ngovernment is you can always find a reason to vote no. You can always \nfind a reason to vote no. It takes a bigger step to compromise, to meet \nsomeone halfway down that middle aisle, to compromise and get something \nthat is important for both sides. This bill does that.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nTexas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I was listening to the debate, and I \nheard the Democratic leader call this a ``do-nothing Congress.'' He \nsaid that several times. I have heard it before. Yet here we have a \nbill that will go directly to the President. This is a bill that brings \ntogether pieces of legislation that have been worked on for years in \nthis body, a chance to score a huge victory for all sides, that gives a \nminimum wage increase of over $2 that we have been trying to do, along \nwith tax cuts for small businesses so that it is a balance for years in \nthis Congress. We have been trying to permanently ease the burden of \nthe death tax ever since I got to this Senate.\n\n[[Page S8743]]\n\n  It is the small businesses; it is not Bill Gates, it is not Warren \nBuffett who is worried about the death tax. It is the farmer who is \ngoing to have to sell his farm when he dies or his children who will \nbecause his children can't pay the taxes because the farm is more \nvaluable than they can earn and produce to pay the taxes. It is the \nsmall business that has been built by a family. It is the restaurant \nowner that is going to have to sell the business that we are fixing \ntonight.\n  This is a bill that would take away the ability to call this a ``do-\nnothing Congress.''\n  Why is it that almost every Republican is going to vote for it and \nalmost every Democrat is going to vote against it?\n  I think this is an excuse to make this a ``do-nothing Congress'' and \nwe are turning our backs on the middle class and the poor people of \nthis country who depend on the minimum wage and death tax relief.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished \nSenator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized for 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the Senator from Washington had printed in \nthe Record a letter from an official in the State of Washington. In \nresponse and in refutation of the point of that letter, I will read \nfrom a letter from the Assistant Secretary of Employment Standards for \nthe U.S. Department of Labor, Victoria Lipnick.\n  Mr. President, this letter is dated August 2. It says, among other \nthings:\n\n       Were this passed into law, the Wage and Hour Division of \n     the Department of Labor would read section 402 as protecting \n     the current minimum wages of the tipped employees in the \n     seven states that now exclude tipped employees' tips from \n     being considered as wages. To do otherwise would be \n     inconsistent with what we understand to be the intent of the \n     Congress and Fair Labor Standards Act which the WHD enforces.\n\n  The bottom line of this legislation, as has been said, is it will \nincrease the standards of living and decrease the cost of dying.\n  I urge my colleagues to support moving forward with it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Estate \nTax and Extension of Tax Relief Act of 2006 (H.R. 5970) more commonly \nknown as the Family Prosperity Act.\n  I believe that the Family Prosperity Act is a good compromise because \nit raises the inheritance tax exemption to $10 million per couple, \nincreases the minimum wage by $2.10, and extends some personal and \nbusiness tax cuts. I support this legislation because it represents a \nfair and reasonable compromise on all three of these important issues.\n  For some time now, the Senate has debated the death tax, which is the \nmost confiscatory tax of all. It has been a battle to repeal or modify \nthis tax. In my opinion this tax is in need of modification; however, a \nfull repeal of the death tax has been unsuccessful. Congress must act \nbefore the current repeal sunsets and the death tax is reinstated in \n2011. Inaction on our part will lead to taxation of estates over $1 \nmillion at a rate 55 percent. Therefore, we are now attempting to seek \nagreement on this compromise measure that will benefit Americans. After \ncareful consideration I have concluded that this bill represents a fair \nand reasonable compromise. Furthermore, passage of this bill will bring \nrelief that is long overdue.\n  H.R. 5970 is a permanent reduction of the death tax that will exempt \n$5 million per individual and $10 million per couple. Estates under $25 \nmillion would have a maximum tax equal to the capital gain rate of 15 \npercent. Estates over $25 million would be taxed at 30 percent. The \nexemptions and $25 million threshold are indexed for inflation and will \nbe fully phased in by January 1, 2015.\n  This tax relief is substantial to States, like my home State of New \nMexico that are filled with small business owners, family farms, and \nranches. The assets accumulated by these hard-working people should not \nbe taxed a second time nor at a rate that is too high. I believe that \nby enacting this relief from the death tax, we will be fostering \neconomic growth, business investment, and entrepreneurship. Moreover, \nthis bill will decrease the number of estates that are liquidated in \norder to pay taxes and will ultimately decrease the number of estates \nthat are required to file a tax return.\n  Some have argued that this legislation is not a compromise and that \nit will preserve wealthy estates. I firmly believe that this argument \nis unfounded. This bill will continue to tax estates that hold \nconsiderable wealth while at the same time exempting small and medium \nsized estates that are overly burdened, and often times extinguished, \nby this tax.\n  I would now like to turn our attention to the minimum wage provisions \ncontained in the Family Prosperity Act. It has been almost 10 years \nsince Congress last voted to raise the minimum wage. In the meantime, \nour cost-of-living has increased annually and working families have \nstruggled to meet their most basic needs.\n  The pending legislation before the Senate will increase the minimum \nwage by $2.10 an hour--phased in over 3 years. I have said many times \nbefore that I would support an increase in the minimum wage if it was \ncrafted properly. I believe that this bill is crafted properly because \nit raises the minimum wage while extending some personal and business \ntax cuts and reduces the overreaching death tax.\n  The current Federal minimum wage just isn't sufficient. Now is the \ntime to raise the minimum wage. It's time to give low-wage workers a \nraise.\n  There was an editorial published recently in my hometown newspaper, \nthe Albuquerque Journal. The editorial was entitled ``Raise the Minimum \nWage: Reduce the Death Tax.'' The editorial hit on some very important \npoints. The focus was that we have tried to address these issues \nbefore--and we have failed. It stressed that we need compromise in \norder to get things done in this Congress.\n  Mr. President, I will ask that a copy of this Albuquerque Journal \neditorial be printed in the Record.\n  This bill is a good compromise. We have before us a chance to work \ntogether to accomplish something for the American people. We should \nembrace this opportunity and work together.\n  The Family Protection Act contains extensions of several important \ntax cuts that are currently set to expire. The research and development \ncredit is of significant importance. H.R. 5970 will extend the research \nand development credit through 2007.\n  Advanced technologies drive a significant part of our Nation's \neconomic strength. Our economy and our standard of living depend on a \nconstant influx of new technologies, processes, and products from our \nindustries. Former Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan frequently \nreinforced the critical dependence between advanced technology and our \neconomic strength.\n  Many countries provide labor at lower costs than the United States. \nThus, as any new product matures, competitors using overseas labor \nfrequently find ways to undercut our production costs. We maintain our \neconomic strength only by constantly improving our products through \ninnovation. Maintaining and improving our national ability to innovate \nis critically important to the Nation.\n  With this extension, we will significantly strengthen incentives for \nprivate companies to undertake research that leads to new processes, \nnew services, and new products. The result will be stronger companies \nthat are better positioned for global competition. Those stronger \ncompanies will hire more people at higher salaries with real benefits \nto our national economy and workforce.\n  Another important tax credit that should be extended is the deduction \nfor higher education expenses. Higher education expenses are on the \nminds of many families. Saving to invest in education is important to \nthe future of all young adults and to our society as a whole. We must \nensure our Nation's future by helping educate America's young adults. \nThat is why it is important to offer tax breaks for qualified higher \neducation tuition and expenses. The Family Protection Act allows \ntaxpayers to deduct $4,000 in qualified higher education tuition and \nexpenses through 2007.\n  The last credit that I would like to comment on is the welfare-to-\nwork credit. This bill extends the welfare-to-work credit through 2007. \nBusiness plays an important role in transitioning people receiving \nwelfare\n\n[[Page S8744]]\n\ninto the workforce, and providing incentives for employers to hire \nwelfare recipients strengthens our economy. This is an important \nprovision in the bill and provides one more reason for me to support \npassage of this compromise.\n  I support this three-part compromise package because it represents a \nfair and reasonable compromise on all of these important issues.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article to which I \nreferred be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         [From the Albuquerque Journal Editorial, Aug. 1, 2006]\n\n                  Raise Minimum Wage; Reduce Death Tax\n\n       Santa Fe did it in 2003. Albuquerque did it in April. \n     Sandia Pueblo did it in May. In fact, 17 states and the \n     District of Columbia have done it.\n       Maybe before Senators go on vacation this week, they can \n     get the United States to do it, too: Raise the minimum wage.\n       The federal minimum wage has been $5.15 an hour for almost \n     a decade. In June the Senate killed the ninth attempt in as \n     many years to increase what those on the lowest tier of the \n     pay scale make. In the interim, municipalities have had to \n     step in, creating a patchwork pay scale that follows \n     geography instead of skill set. If a minimum wage makes \n     sense, it's better done from Washington.\n       On Friday night the House passed a bill that would increase \n     the minimum wage by $2.10 phased in over 3 years, extend some \n     business tax cuts, create others, secure pensions and raise \n     the inheritance-tax exemption to $5 million.\n       Representative Tom Udall, D-N.M., says he would have \n     preferred a vote solely on the minimum wage--which apparently \n     means he would have preferred a 10th defeat in as many years \n     to a compromise.\n       The Republican majority can accept the minimum wage \n     increase if the bill also includes something for one of their \n     constituencies--in this case, excluding more wealth from the \n     estate tax, which many Democrats oppose. Under current law, \n     taxes would revert to 55 percent on estates worth more than \n     $1 million after 2011. That's not soaking the aristocracy, \n     but forcing heirs to liquidate a family-built business or a \n     farm to pay the taxman. Not to mention these family assets \n     have already been taxed.\n       Critics say Republicans want political cover come the \n     November elections--after all, they didn't come out against \n     their 2 percent raise last month.\n       But to the single mother making $10,700 a year busing \n     tables, the only important cover is covering her family's \n     bills, and $15,000 a year goes a lot further toward that end.\n       Senators have their 10th chance this week to get the United \n     States in line with Santa Fe, Albuquerque, Sandia Pueblo, 17 \n     states and the District of Columbia. They should take it.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5970, \nthe Estate Tax and Extension of Tax Relief Act of 2006. Specifically, I \nstrongly support inclusion of the Surface Mining Control and \nReclamation Act Amendments of 2006 in this piece of legislation. This \nlegislation is very important to my home State and to coal-producing \nStates throughout our Nation.\n  I have been working to fix the Abandoned Mine Land Trust Fund since I \nwas first elected to the Senate in 1996. We have legislation before the \nSenate to make that happen, and I applaud my colleagues from \nPennsylvania and West Virginia for their hard work on this proposal. \nSenators Santorum, Rockefeller, Specter, and Byrd have helped produce a \nsolid piece of legislation, and I strongly support moving this forward.\n  For years, reauthorizing the Abandoned Mine Land--AML--Trust Fund has \nbeen an issue that pitted the East versus the West. Consensus was never \nreached on the issue, and the AML Trust Fund continued to be a broken \nsystem. Members from the East argued that we needed to send more money \nto do reclamation, while members from the West argued that we needed to \ntake care of the Federal Government's promise to the States. That \npromise was made in 1977 with passage of the Surface Mining Control and \nReclamation Act, SMCRA.\n  When SMCRA was passed in 1977, a tax was levied on each ton of coal \nproduced. The purpose of that tax was to reclaim coal mines that had \nbeen abandoned before laws existed that required reclamation. Half of \nthat tax was promised to the State where the coal was mined. That money \nis known as the State share. The other half went to the Federal \nGovernment to administer the reclamation program and to send additional \nfunding to the States with the most abandoned coal mines.\n  It was a simple enough concept. Half of the money was to be sent to \nthe State share, and the other half administers the AML program and \ngoes to States with the largest reclamation needs. Unfortunately, like \nmany things in Washington, while the concept was good, the \nimplementation has been disastrous and the program has not worked as it \nwas intended. For years, States have been shortchanged and reclamation \nwork has not been done. Today, the Federal Government owes States more \nthan $1.2 billion. At the same time, more than $3 billion in \nreclamation remains unfinished.\n  When I was named the chairman of the conference committee whose job \nit was to find a compromise between the House and Senate on pension \nlegislation, I was approached by Senator Santorum who had a proposal. \nHe brought with him a coalition made up of coal companies, the United \nMine Workers of America, UMWA, environmental groups and other \nbusinesses. Together, they expressed an interest in including an AML \nTrust Fund reauthorization in the pension conference report.\n  Where I come from, when something does not work, we work to fix it, \nand so the idea of fixing the AML program on the pension conference was \nintriguing. For years, I have worked with the other members of the \nWyoming delegation to reauthorize this program, and as chairman of the \nconference committee, I was in a unique position to make a difference.\n  After listening to the proposal, I laid out a set of principles that \nwere necessary to gain my support for such a move.\n  First, I wanted to see the return of the money owed to the States, \nincluding the $550 million owed to my State. Because Wyoming is a \ncertified State, I wanted to see that money come from the Federal \nGovernment with no strings attached. The legislation we have before us \ntoday accomplishes that goal by guaranteeing that Wyoming will receive \nthe money we are owed from the Federal Government in 7 years.\n  Second, I wanted a guarantee that future monies would be directed to \nStates like Wyoming where significant amounts of coal are produced.\n  Third, it was important that more money be directed toward \nreclamation in States where the reclamation work is needed. Those goals \nare accomplished with the legislation that is included in this bill.\n  Finally, I wanted to see a reduction on the tax charged to Wyoming's \ncoal companies. Some of the companies in my State do not have the \nproblems associated with abandoned coal mines, nor do they have the \norphan miner liability that is held by some companies. Those companies \nagreed not to fight an extension of the tax if it was reduced, and this \nlegislation includes a slight reduction in the fee.\n  The priorities of other members are also included in this bill, \nincluding provisions that shore up health care for orphan miners who \nfall into the Combined Benefits Fund. Those priorities include the \naddition of health care coverage for members who fall into the 1992 \nfund and the 1993 fund. Although the shoring up of those three funds \nwas not a priority for me, this represents compromise legislation.\n  The compromise brought all of the major players on board. The coal \ncompanies strongly support this bill. The United Mine Workers of \nAmerica, UMWA, strongly support this bill. Other businesses who had \ninterests in the AML fund strongly support this bill. With all these \ngroups on board, we set out to gain support for this bill.\n  Senators Santorum and Rockefeller worked hard to bring members from \nboth sides of the aisle on board, and I commend them for their efforts. \nAt the end of the day, we had seven committee chairmen who supported \nthis bill. The chairman and ranking member of the Energy Committee, who \nhave jurisdiction over a portion of the bill, signed a letter to the \nmajority leader asking that it be included in the pension conference. \nThe chairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee, who have \njurisdiction over the rest of the bill, expressed support for moving \nthis forward.\n  As we gained support, we also learned of opposition from members who \nobjected to the cost of the legislation.\n\n[[Page S8745]]\n\nThey claimed that the bill was too expensive and that the health care \ncoverage for the orphan and widow miners was too good. As a member of \nthe Senate Budget Committee, I want to spend taxpayer dollars \nappropriately. I want programs to work the way they are intended to \nwork, and this program has not done so.\n  For my colleagues who have concerns about the cost of the \nlegislation, it is important to remember that a $1.8 billion Federal \ntrust sits in the Federal Treasury. It is important to remember that, \nalthough the fee is reduced slightly, we will continue to collect \nsignificant income from the fee. It is also important to remember that \nthe Federal Treasury will collect significant revenues from coal \nproduction.\n  For years, we have been using Federal dollars in a way that they were \nnot intended to be used. We have not made progress on the reclamation \nside, nor have we kept our promise to the States. This legislation \ncorrects that error. It sends significant amounts of money to do \nreclamation, and it returns the money that was promised to the States.\n  As for the health care aspect of the bill, it is important to know \nthat the Federal Government already provides funding for some health \ncare. It is provided for with interest from Wyoming and other States' \nmoney. The Senators who represent the families who receive this health \ncare continue to make sure the families receive it. Since miners' \nhealth care continues to be funded, we needed to find a way to fulfill \nthe promise to the States. This legislation was such a fix.\n  As more members were brought on board, I worked with my colleagues on \nthe pension conference to include this provision in the final \nconference report. Much progress was made, and at the end of the day, I \nincluded the AML bill that is a part of H.R. 5970 in my chairman's mark \nfor the pension conference. This AML fix fit nicely in a section \ncontaining important tax credits, such as a State sales tax deduction \nfrom Federal income tax for Wyoming and other States with no income \ntax.\n  A last-minute strategy decision by some House members was made to \nseparate the AML bill and the tax credits from the pension portion of \nthe conference report. The House put the AML and the tax credits in a \nbill that also included the death tax forgiveness and a minimum wage \nincrease. The second bill included many of the pension provisions of \nthe pension conference report. The House then passed the pension bill \nand the tax credit bill and then adjourned on July 29, 2006, for the \nAugust home work period. That is where we stand.\n  I also take this opportunity to voice my support for the estate tax \nrelief contained in this legislation. While I support a full and \npermanent repeal of this burdensome and unfair tax, the language \ncontained in H.R. 5970 is a big step forward. Under this legislation, \nthe estate and gift tax exemption will be increased over time to $5 \nmillion per person. The elimination of this unjust tax will allow many \nsmall, family-owned businesses throughout Wyoming and the Nation to \nkeep their businesses open.\n  As I have said time and time again, the death tax is fundamentally \nunfair because it constitutes another layer of taxation. After years of \npaying State and Federal income taxes and other property taxes while \ntrying to operate a successful business, the family must pay again at \nthe time of death. The land subject to the death tax is the exact same \nland that the owner has been paying annual property taxes on. Double \ntaxation is not only unfair on a philosophical level, it causes severe \nfinancial harm to the small businesses that are the driving force \nbehind our economy. Our tax laws should encourage investment and growth \nand not stifle small businesses.\n  In addition to affecting many small businesses, the death tax forces \nlandowners to sell their property to afford paying this tax and avoid \npassing on the costs to the next generation. Throughout Wyoming, I hear \nstories of families who are struggling to decide whether to sell part \nof their farm or ranch or risk leaving their children and grandchildren \nwith this overly burdensome tax. Families should not have to make this \nimpossible choice. In Wyoming, we work hard, in pursuit of the American \ndream, to create a better life for our children and grandchildren. Yet \nthe death tax punishes this dream and the families who must pick up the \npieces after losing a loved one.\n  There is another hidden cost to this double tax that many people do \nnot consider. The death tax also forces families to spend thousands of \ndollars on estate planning. By requiring individuals and families to \nuse vital financial resources on estate planning, money is being taken \naway from the family business, farm, or ranch. Permanently eliminating \nthis tax will move precious financial resources to the business and \nemployees themselves instead of to extensive estate planning costs.\n  Finally, I would like to briefly address one additional provision in \nthis legislation--the State and local sales tax deduction. H.R. 5970 \nincludes an extension of the State and local sales tax deduction for 2 \nyears. I applaud the extension of this deduction. The ability to deduct \nState sales tax is an issue of fairness and parity. Under this \nlegislation, taxpayers have the option to deduct their State and local \nsales tax or their State income tax. Federal taxpayers who reside in a \nState without an income tax should not be punished and forced to pay \nadditional Federal taxes. Under this extension, taxpayers can choose \nwhether to deduct their State and local sales or income tax.\n  I intend to vote in favor of the overall package. I strongly support \nthe inclusion of the AML legislation. I am also strongly supportive of \nthe tax extenders and the death tax relief. I hope that my colleagues \nwill see the importance of this legislation and will join me in \nsupporting its passage.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty seconds.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute using leader time to my \ndistinguished colleague from Kentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, how can we have bipartisanship in the \nCongress if Democrats won't take yes for an answer?\n  Of course, I am speaking about the bill before us--H.R. 5970, the \nEstate Tax and Extension of Tax Relief Act of 2006.\n  This legislation package isn't everything the Republicans wanted, and \nit is not everything the Democrats wanted. But both parties, and both \nHouses of Congress, now have an opportunity to vote on compromise \nlegislation that accomplishes the goals we all aimed for.\n  We will substantially reduce the estate tax, or as I prefer to call \nit, the death tax. No American family should be forced to visit the \nundertaker and the tax collector on the same day.\n  Nothing could place more stress on a family than the loss of a loved \none. Yet at such a difficult time, too many families in America today \nmust make decisions about selling a business or a farm that has been in \nthe family for generations in order to pay the death tax. That is \nwrong, and with this legislation, we will end that problem for many \nAmericans.\n  We will also extend tax relief for many, to help encourage economic \ngrowth.\n  At the same time, we will increase the federally mandated minimum \nwage, from its current rate of $5.15 an hour to $7.25 in 2009. My \nfriends on the other side of the aisle have continually said that \nraising the minimum wage is their top legislative priority.\n  Well, now is the time to vote for their top priority. Yet the \nDemocratic leadership is threatening to kill this bill.\n  What part of ``yes'' do my friends on the other side of the aisle not \nunderstand? What part of ``bipartisanship'' do they not want?\n  We want to meet them halfway on this compromise legislation. We have \ntaken their legislation, and some of our legislation, and also a host \nof tax provisions that we all agree on. But apparently it is not \nenough.\n  The Democrats cannot call this a do-nothing Congress on the one hand, \nand block every bill they can and try to blame the majority on the \nother.\n  We have a choice. We can work together and pass legislation that will \nbenefit millions of Americans, or we can devolve into obstruction, and \nget nothing. I think what the American\n\n[[Page S8746]]\n\npeople deserve is positive action. That means passing this bipartisan \ncompromise bill.\n  We were all elected to get something done on behalf of our \nconstituents, and this legislation will mean real, tangible results for \nmillions of Americans. As always, I stand ready to work with my \nDemocratic friends to pass much-needed tax relief, and add to the long \nlist of accomplishments of the 109th Congress.\n  Unfortunately, it appears the Democrat leadership would prefer to \nhave a political issue rather than an accomplishment.\n  Mr. President, what we have heard tonight on the other side of the \naisle is block and blame.\n  We have before us is a provision in three parts, each of which is \nsupported by a bipartisan majority.\n  Let me say that again.\n  Each of the three parts of this bill are supported by a bipartisan \nmajority of the Senate.\n  So what can possibly be wrong with passing the three bills together \nsince they are each supported by a bipartisan majority of the Senate?\n  What is going on here? It is block and blame. They want to say this \nis a ``do-nothing Congress.''\n  If there is anything this Congress has not been able to accomplish, \nyou can point the finger at the Democratic side of the aisle. Their \nstrategy is block and blame.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in closing, I will be very brief.\n  In a few moments, we will be voting on the motion to proceed to this \nvery important bill called the Family Prosperity Act. It is called that \nvery specifically for the reasons we have outlined.\n  There are three very important components: The extension of tax \nrelief--we spoke about it on the floor, key provisions such as the \nState and local tax deduction affecting the many States, in my State \nalone, 670,000 Tennessee families; college tuition deduction affecting \nmillions of families; research and development tax credit which \nstimulates growth, innovation, creativity, and jobs; teachers' \nclassroom expenses deduction, affecting 55,000 teachers.\n  Secondly, the permanent solution to the death tax challenge that we \nhave today is a compromise. It is not only a compromise that prevents \nthe death rate from escalating to 55 percent and dropping to $1 million \nin 2011, it is a $5 million exemption per spouse indexed for inflation, \nand a 15-percent tax rate from $5 million to $25 million.\n  Thirdly, a minimum wage increase, 40 percent over the next 3 years--\n40 percent.\n  In summary, an ``aye'' vote is a vote for that permanent death tax \nrelief. An ``aye'' vote is for that extension of tax relief. And an \n``aye'' vote is for that 40 percent minimum wage increase.\n  We have a lot of challenges before us. We have addressed many others \nin the last 4 weeks. This gives us the opportunity to address an issue \nthat will affect the typical American out their working, their family, \nthat farmer, that small business owner.\n  I encourage my colleagues to vote aye.\n  I ask unanimous notwithstanding rule XXII that the mandatory quorum \nbe waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to H.R. \n5970 the Estate Tax and Extension of Tax Relief Act of 2006.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of \nrule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby move to bring \nto a close debate on the motion to proceed to H.R. 5970: a bill to \namend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase the unified credit \nagainst the estate tax to an exclusion equivalent of $5,000,000, to \nrepeal the sunset provision for the estate and generation-skipping \ntaxes, and to extend expiring provisions, and for other purposes.\n         Bill Frist, Mike Crapo, Lamar Alexander, Richard C. \n           Shelby, Sam Brownback, Saxby Chambliss, Chuck Hagel, \n           Tom Coburn, Richard Burr, Orrin Hatch, Thad Cochran, \n           John Ensign, David Vitter, Pat Roberts, Craig Thomas, \n           Jeff Sessions, Mel Martinez.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote, the yeas are 56, the nays are \n42. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I now enter a motion to reconsider the vote \nby which cloture was not invoked.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is entered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the real vote would have been 57 to 41. I \nswitched my vote from ``aye'' to ``no,'' thus the reported vote is 56 \nto 42.\n  I want to clarify, very briefly, where we are now. For purely \nprocedural reasons, as leader, I switched my vote to a ``no'' vote to \npreserve all of my procedural options. As everyone knows, I strongly \nsupport cloture and moving to proceed to the three important issues in \nthe Family Prosperity Act. I initially voted ``yes'' on cloture, but by \nswitching to a ``no'' vote, I preserve my right, as leader, to revisit \nthis issue in the future as a package.\n  The Senate just had a majority vote to move forward to this bill \nwhich reforms the onerous death tax, raises the minimum wage for \nmillions of Americans, and provides a number of important tax relief \nextenders that will expire. Had the Senate invoked cloture, I am \nconfident we could have finished this measure this weekend and \npresented it to the President in the next couple of days to become the \nlaw of the land.\n  With my switched vote, I preserve the procedural option to bring the \nbill back as a package. I hope the Democratic Senators will rethink \nlong and hard over the weeks to come before we return for business in \nSeptember.\n  Mr. President, finally, just for the record, a number of comments \nwere made just prior to the vote about the tip wage issue. As my \ncolleagues know, I have made it clear to them that is an issue that we \nwould be able to address once on the bill. But we have now been \nprevented from getting on the bill.\n\n[[Page S8747]]\n\n  I am confounded. There is no other way to put it.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle come to this floor, time \nand again, raving about a ``do nothing'' Congress.\n  Well, today, just a few minutes ago, we had yet another opportunity \nto do something--as we have already many times this Congress.\n  We had the chance to bring three very important issues to the floor \nfor debate: permanent death tax relief, extension of expiring tax \nprovisions, and a minimum wage Increase.\n  These are issues that matter in the day-to-day lives of our \nconstituents--issues that actually mean something to hard-working \nAmericans.\n  And yet some of my colleagues decided these issues aren't important \nenough to debate here on the Senate floor.\n  This package--it's about securing America's prosperity.\n  It's about easing the tax burden facing America's families.\n  It's about helping hard-working Americans tackle an increasing cost \nof living head on.\n  And it's about fostering innovation and reinvestment in our homegrown \nsmall businesses and farms.\n  Quite simply, it's vital to the economic security of everyday \nAmericans.\n  These are challenging issues, and they must be addressed here on the \nSenate floor.\n  And as I have said before, these issues must be addressed as a \npackage: permanent death tax relief, tax policy extensions, and a 40-\npercent increase in the minimum wage.\n  All three together. All or nothing.\n  Not bringing this package--the Family Prosperity Act--to the floor is \ntantamount to saying, ``We don't care about America's economic \nsecurity.''\n  And I am deeply ashamed that we, the U.S. Senate, would ever dare \nsend such a message to the American people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, everyone will be relieved to know I don't \nhave anything to say.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/08/03/senate-section/article/S8747-1", "month": "08", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8747-S8765]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     PENSION PROTECTION ACT OF 2006\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 4, which the clerk will report by \ntitle.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4) to provide economic security for all \n     Americans, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there are 20 minutes \nequally divided between the two leaders.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I allocate myself 7 minutes of the 10 we \nhave on our side.\n  A year ago, we were working on a pension bill, and we were working on \nthe bill in two separate committees. We passed bills out of both \ncommittees. Then the two committees met together, and we merged it into \none bill. There were a lot of difficulties in doing that process. It \ntook quite a while. At the end of November we still had several \nproblems and because of that, the media pronounced the bill dead. A \nweek later, we had revived it and passed it in the Senate with just two \nvotes in opposition to it and 97 in favor. All that in just 1 hour. \nThen it was brought to life on the House side. They passed the bill in \nDecember of 2005.\n  Then, in March 2006, a conference was named, and we worked on it \ndiligently for hours virtually every day. A lot of moving parts started \nto fit into place. Some wondered if it would never get done.\n  I looked up the last major revisions we did on a pension bill. They \nwere not nearly as expansive as this. This is the biggest revision of \npension laws to be enacted in the past 32 years.\n  I noticed, in 1987, a big pension reform conference started in early \nMarch. The conference committee started a little earlier, but the bill \nwas enacted until December 22. In 1994, there was a second pension \nreform conference. Again, the conference started in March of that year. \nThe conferees wound up the conference agreement a little earlier than \nin 1987. This time, the bill was enacted on December 8, 1994. So we are \nway ahead of schedule compared to those two conferences. But we had to \ndo it in a little different method than we might have liked to get to \nthis point. Nevertheless, it is the most sweeping amendment to ERISA \nand the Internal Revenue Code in over 30 years. It is nearly identical \nto the product and agreements made by the members of the conference \ncommittee in a bipartisan manner. I am proud we have before us the most \nsweeping changes to our Nation's retirement laws since the enactment of \nERISA itself.\n  This legislation will provide greater security for our Nation's \nworkers who have retirement benefit plans and greater stability for the \nPension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. There is little doubt this bill \nwill be the foundation on which the future of our retirement system \nrests.\n  Today, we secure the future for American workers and their families. \nWe ensure their hard work is rewarded and their hard-earned dollars go \ntowards their retirement needs.\n  At the outset of the pension debate, I laid out three guiding \nprinciples that must be followed when the bill is enacted. Each of \nthese has been satisfied in this bill that I am proud to have helped \ncraft as chairman of the conference committee.\n  The first guiding principle is: The money workers earn for retirement \nmust be there when they retire. This legislation contains tougher \nfunding rules to ensure the money is there when workers enter \nretirement.\n  The pension bill puts an end to phony pension accounting rules that \ninflated the apparent value of pension plans, relied on inaccurate \nmeasurements of liabilities, and permitted funding holidays through the \nuse of credit balances when plans were seriously underfunded.\n  Promises made to workers for their retirement will be promises kept \nby assuring the money needed is in the fund and by appropriately \nlimiting when benefits may be increased, freezing future accruals, and \nrestricting the rapid out-flow of lump sums and shutdown benefits when \nthe plan gets into serious trouble. The bill also imposes discipline on \nmanagement by restricting new executive compensation when pension plans \nare in trouble.\n  The second guiding principle is: The new rules we craft should not be \nso draconian that they become the cause of more bankruptcies and \npension plan terminations.\n  The conference committee leaders spent nearly 4 months debating this \nexact point with regard to ``at risk'' triggers. In the final bill, I \nbelieve we have found a proper balance.\n  The legality of cash balance and other hybrid pension plan designs is \nclarified on a prospective basis under ERISA, the Internal Revenue \nCode, and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, thus ending legal \nchallenges that have driven hundreds of quality employers out of the \ndefined benefit system. We have always felt that these plans are valid \nunder the Code, ERISA and the ADEA.\n  The final guiding principle is: A taxpayer bailout of the PBGC is not \nan option. The full faith and credit of the United States does not \nstand behind the private pension insurance systems, and I am committed \nto keeping it that way by shoring up the finances of the agency without \na taxpayer bailout.\n  The legislation repeals the full funding exemption on the variable \nrate premium which reduces the deficit at the PBGC by billions over the \nnext 10 years. With this single vote, we will make the most sweeping \nchanges to ERISA since its enactment in 1974.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill. Our future \ngenerations are counting on it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following letters be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   Pension Benefit\n\n\n                                         Guaranty Corporation,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 14, 1993.\n       We write in response to your inquiry. You ask whether the \n     PBGC adheres to the interpretation of section 4225 of the \n     Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (``ERISA''), \n     as amended by the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act \n     of 1980 (``MPPAA''), set forth in its amicus curiae brief in \n     Trustees of the Amalgamated Insurance Fund v. Geltman \n     Industries, 784 F.2d 926 (9th Cir. 1986). In its brief, PBGC \n     addressed the proper application of ERISA Sec. Sec. 4225(a) \n     and 4225(b) where the withdrawn employer\n\n[[Page S8748]]\n\n     satisfies the prerequisites for the application of both \n     subsections. PBGC expressed the view that an employer meeting \n     the criteria in both subsections (a) and (b) may elect the \n     limitation that yields the lesser of the amounts determined \n     under the two subsections. The Ninth Circuit, however, \n     reached a contrary conclusion. 784 F.2d at 929-30. For the \n     reasons set out below, PBGC continues to believe that its \n     interpretation of ERISA Sec. Sec. 4225 (a) and 4225(b) is \n     correct as a matter [*2] of law.\n       Under ERISA Sec. 4225(a)(1)(A), an employer who withdraws \n     in connection with a ``bona fide sale of substantially all of \n     [its] assets in an arm's-length transaction to an unrelated \n     party'' will ordinarily be permitted to retain a portion of \n     its dissolution value. The Geltman court, however, citing \n     ``the language and . . . structure'' and the ``underlying \n     policies of ERISA and MPPAA,'' concluded that an \n     ``insolvent'' employer must be denied relief under subsection \n     (a)(1)(A), because subsection (b) provides a different \n     liability limit that is explicitly directed to ``an insolvent \n     employer undergoing liquidation or dissolution.''\n       This analysis overlooks several pertinent points. First, \n     when Congress intended to deny classes of employers relief \n     under section 4225, it did so explicitly. See ERISA \n     Sec. 4211(d) (prohibiting application of section 4225 to \n     employers who withdraw from coal-industry pension plans). \n     Significantly, nothing in the language of section 4225 \n     suggests that subsections (a) and (b) are mutually \n     exclusive.\\1\\ The two provisions have separate factual \n     prerequisites, and provide different types of relief. So long \n     as an employer satisfies the requirements of both \n     subsections, [*3] it should qualify for relief under either \n     rule, and its liability should not exceed the lesser of the \n     amounts determined under the two subsections.\n       \\1\\ Sections 4225(a) and (b) both begin with the phrase \n     ``in the case of an employer.'' The Geltman court suggested \n     this phrase was ``evidence that the sections are to operate \n     exclusive of each other. . . .'' This suggestion is \n     manifestly incorrect. The phrase ``in the case of'' is used \n     as an introduction to at least 30 provisions of MPPAA; in \n     each such instance, it is used in its normal statutory sense, \n     as a synonym for ``when'' or ``if''. 20A Words and Phrases 75 \n     (1959 & Supp. 1983).\n       This conclusion is further supported by the technical \n     definition of ``insolvency'' included in section 4225. Under \n     section 4225(d)(1), ``an employer is insolvent if [its] \n     liabilities, including withdrawal liability under the plan \n     (determined without regard to subsection (b)), exceed [its] \n     assets (determined as of the commencement of the liquidation \n     or dissolution)'' (emphasis added). Section 4201(b)(1)(D) \n     defines ``withdrawal liability'' as including adjustment \n     pursuant to section 4225. Thus, the use of the term \n     ``withdrawal liability'' in the definition [*4] of insolvency \n     incorporates any reductions in withdrawal liability resulting \n     from the application of section 4225 (including subsection \n     (a)) except the reduction set out in section 4225(b), which \n     is specifically excluded.\\2\\\n       \\2\\ The decision is therefore incorrect when it states that \n     whether ``an employer is an insolvent employer . . . is done \n     by looking to the provisions of [section 4225(d)(1)] without \n     regard to [section 4225(a)].'' Geltman, 784 F.2d at 929.\n       PBGC believes that its interpretation of section 4225 is \n     fully consistent with the ``underlying policies of ERISA and \n     MPPAA.'' Section 4225 is but one of several ERISA provisions \n     that limit the amount of withdrawal liability imposed upon \n     withdrawing employers.\\3\\ Nothing in the congressional \n     findings and policy declarations that preface MPPAA indicate \n     that the withdrawal liability limitation provisions should be \n     construed to maximize the liability of an employer. See MPPAA \n     Sec. 3, codified at 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1001a. The same is true of \n     the legislative history.\n       \\3\\ See, e.g., ERISA Sec. Sec. 4203 (b), (c), (d), and (f), \n     4204, 4207, 4208, 4209, 4210, 4217, 4218, 4219(c)(I)(B), \n     4224, and 4225. The Supreme Court has noted with approval \n     Congress's efforts to moderate the impact of withdrawal \n     liability on employers, including Congress's effort in \n     section 4225. Connally v. PBGC, 475 U.S. 211, 225, 226 n.8 \n     (1986).\n       Finally, the interpretation offered in Geltman makes little \n     economic sense. Under the rationale of the decision, an \n     employer whose liabilities exceeded its assets by only one \n     dollar is ``insolvent'' and would automatically forfeit any \n     relief under section 4225(a)(1)(A). In contrast, if the \n     employer's assets were one dollar greater than liabilities, \n     the full liability limitation would apply.\\4\\ As discussed \n     above, the application of the plain language of the statute \n     avoids this sort of anomaly.\n       \\4\\ The attached table, drawn from the PBGC's amicus brief, \n     illustrates the dramatic increase in employer liability \n     caused by the single dollar difference.\n       In conclusion, the plain wording of section 4225 dictates \n     that an employer that meets the requirements of both \n     subsections (a) and (b) is entitled to an assessment of \n     withdrawal liability that does not exceed the lesser of the \n     amounts determined under (a) and (b). Neither the legislative \n     purpose nor principles of statutory construction compel a \n     contrary conclusion. The PBGC therefore continues to adhere \n     to the position stated in its brief amicus curiae.\n       I trust this responds to your question.

Under this compromise, workers and employers can be \n     assured of predictability and transparency in their pension \n     plans.\n       This compromise includes new, accelerated funding \n     requirements for all multiemployer pension plans. It provides \n     for enhanced disclosure for workers, retirees, and employers \n     who contribute to these pensions. And it requires pension \n     plans with financial difficulties on the horizon to meet \n     strict goals to avoid these problems.\n       The most troubled pension plans--the so-called ``red zone'' \n     pensions--would be required to adopt a rehabilitation plan to \n     reach healthy funding status. The plan may require a \n     combination of employer contribution increases, expense \n     reductions, funding relief measures and restrictions on \n     future benefit accruals. In certain extraordinary \n     circumstances a rehabilitation plan may also reduce or \n     eliminate certain ancillary pension benefits for workers who \n     have not yet retired. This limited authority is necessary to \n     ensure the continued viability of the most poorly-funded \n     plans. These changes must be adopted by all bargaining \n     parties, both management and labor trustees.\n       Our bi-partisan compromise also requires multiemployer plan \n     trustees to impose upon contributing employers, within 30 \n     days after the plan provides the notice of reorganization \n     status, a series of automatic contribution surcharges. The \n     surcharge will end when a new collective bargaining agreement \n     is implemented that adopts a schedule of benefits based on \n     the rehabilitation plan.\n       We believe that all of these reforms are critical to \n     safeguarding the multiemployer pension system and protecting \n     workers' benefits. We look forward to working with you to \n     address the challenges facing America's workers and retirees.\n                                                  John A. Boehner,\n                        Majority Leader, House of Representatives.\n                                                Edward M. Kennedy,\n                            Ranking Member, Senate HELP Committee.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, this bill is nearly identical to the product \nand agreements made by members of the conference committee in a \nbipartisan manner. I am proud that we have before us the most sweeping \nchanges to our Nation's retirement laws since the enactment of ERISA \nitself.\n  This legislation will provide greater security for our nation's \nworkers who have retirement benefit plans and greater stability for the \nPension Benefit Guaranty Corporations, PGBC. There is little doubt that \nthis bill will be the foundation on which the future of our retirement \nsystem rests. Today, we secure the future for American workers and \ntheir families. We ensure their hard work is rewarded and their hard \nearned dollars go towards their retirement needs.\n  I would like to review some important aspects of this legislation. \nFor more than a year we have been working on a package of pension \nfunding rules that will strengthen defined benefit plans and thus, \nprotect plan participants from the fear of poverty in their retirement \nyears. When I have concluded that, I will speak about the process \nsurrounding the pension reform bill.\n  We were motivated to make these changes for several reasons. First, \nplans were underfunded. This occurred due to numerous and complicated \nreasons. A key factor was the combination of low interest rates and \nlowered equity values that began in the year 2000. The intersection of \nthese two economic events caused both defined benefit\n\n[[Page S8749]]\n\nplans and the federal agency that insures them, the PBGC to show big \ndeficits. More money needed to go into the plans regardless of \nfluctuations in the economy.\n  Underfunding was not caused solely by a drop in interest rates and \nequity values. It was also caused by loopholes in pension funding \nrules.\n  Second, as plan deficits rose, required contributions to plans \nskyrocketed. This put struggling companies in financial peril. When the \nterrorist attacks occurred on 9/11 the cash flow of many of those same \ncompanies froze up. Without big reserves in the plans, they could not \nmake their pension payments any longer. Some of them just declared \nbankruptcy. In turn, they dumped their pensions on the PBGC. Those \npension plan failures were quite large. Among them were some steel \ncompanies and a couple of big airlines.\n  PBGC premiums and asset recoveries from failed pension plans are not \nenough to cover the cost of paying benefits to participants of the \nfailed plans. Every time there has been a pension plan failure, the \nPBGC's deficit worsens.\n  Finally, a taxpayer bailout of the PBGC is not an option. Congress' \nadverse experience with the savings and loan problems of the past \ntaught us a lesson: A taxpayer bailout of the PBGC is not an option. A \ntaxpayer bailout of the pension insurance agency could only occur if \nthe Congress provided for it. We did not provide for a taxpayer bailout \nof the PBGC in this bill. Instead, we corrected the pension funding \nrules.\n  There have been murmurings in the media and on Capitol Hill that the \nbills produced in the House and Senate were somehow ``weaker than \ncurrent law''. The facts plainly show that neither the House nor the \nSenate bill is weaker than current law and this new bill that the House \nintroduced and passed on Friday July 28, 2006 is not weaker than \ncurrent law either.\n  Here are just a few examples of how the pension reform proposal is \ntougher than current law.\n  Under the reform proposal: plans must be funded to 100 percent; plans \nmust amortize their debts over 7 years; plans must use updated and \naccurate mortality tables; plans may not add inflated credit balances \nto deflated plan assets; liabilities must be valued using a modified \nyield curve that will better ``duration match'' assets and liabilities \nof the plans; smoothing for both assets and liabilities may be only 24 \nmonths in duration; plans that are seriously underfunded must pay an \nadditional contribution for ``at-risk'' plans. If plans are at-risk for \na long enough period of time, they will be subject to an additional \nrequirement to pay a ``load factor'' into the plan which assumes the \nplan may be at risk of terminating; benefit increases, lump sum payouts \nand additional accruals are prohibited for certain seriously \nunderfunded plans; payment of shutdown benefits are severely restricted \nfor plans that are underfunded; funding of executive compensation is \nprohibited when the plan covering rank-and-file workers is underfunded; \nand premiums payable for pension insurance are dramatically increased \nand will add billions of dollars to the coffers of the PBGC.\n\n  By contrast, under current law a pension need be funded only to 90 \npercent; liabilities are valued upon the four-year weighted average of \na long-term corporate bond and assets are smoothed over as many as five \nyear; a single accelerated payment is required for underfunded plans, \nbut there is no load factor; credit balances are added to assets and \ncan result in inappropriate contribution holidays and there are many \nother weaknesses in current law that have been corrected in the reform \nlegislation.\n  One industry that made a compelling case for special transition rules \nis the airline industry. Because airlines are vital to our economy, \nCongress agreed that different rules should apply to the plans of the \nlegacy airlines. I am a little disappointed in the language from the \nHouse bill because it fails to treat all the legacy airlines equally. I \nadmire the courage of a plan sponsor that makes the tough decision to \nfreeze its plan. When a company is suffering from financial distress or \nthe risk of it, it needs to freeze accruals. But if the company has \nmade other financial sacrifices or the employees have made other \nconcessions in order to keep the plan in place that should, (within \nlimits), be a decision of the company.\n  The Senate bill gave amortization extensions to all four legacy \nairlines but required the non-frozen plans to pay into their benefit \nplans at the ``at-risk'' rate. The frozen plans received a more \nfavorable arrangement--but all the legacy airlines received some more \nor less equivalent treatment.\n  Under the House bill, frozen plans receive 17 years to amortize their \nplan debt and an interest rate of 8.85 percent. The frozen plans would \nbe prohibited from having a follow-on DB plan or a DC plan in which \nthey pay matching contributions. If their plan should terminate within \nthe next 10 years, for any reason other than a terrorist attack, or \nother similar event, severe termination premiums are to be imposed on \nthe sponsoring company. This language controverts the provisions of the \nrecently enacted reconciliation act, P.L. 109-171, that did not impose \na termination premium on plans whose sponsor declared bankruptcy prior \nto October 18, 2005.\n  By contrast, nonfrozen plans receive some limited leeway. They would \nobtain an amortization of ten rather than seven years for the \nliabilities accrued to date under their plan. They would not have to \npay the deficit reduction contribution, DRC, for 2006 or 2007. That \nwaiver of the DRC would be a big help to their finances until the new \nrules phase in.\n  I prefer the language of the Senate passed bill, S. 1783. I am very \nsorry that the House did not see fit to accept the Senate language, as \nit was the result of many and long negotiations. The Nation cannot \nafford any more airline bankruptcies or terminations of airline pension \nplans. I hope this legislation will not worsen the finances of the \nlegacy airlines or the pension plans they sponsor.\n  The language we have before us makes other changes to law as well. \nFor example, it provides clarification regarding the use of automatic \nenrollment programs for defined contribution plans. It establishes a \nnew portable defined benefit plan that we refer to as the ``DB(k)'' \nplan. This retirement savings vehicle is especially appealing to small \nand medium sized companies. The legislation improves portability of \nretirement savings. It contains many beneficial changes to tax law \naffecting the provision of health care benefits for public safety \nofficers of state and local governments and for savings in long-term \ncare plans.\n  There are also rules that recognize the unique situation of rural \ncooperatives that are very common in my home State and are vital to all \nrural parts of this Nation.\n  In addition, the rules for calculating lump sum distributions have \nfinally been updated in this legislation. The change for this \ncalculation will be phased in very slowly so that participants will not \nbe disadvantaged by any sudden change in the rate used to make these \ncalculations. As is the case under current law, the new law allows a \nplan sponsor to use different assumptions, interest rates and/or \nmortality tables, to determine lump sum distributions so long as the \nplan provides that a participant's lump sum amount is no less than the \npresent value determined in accordance with the provision in effect \nunder this legislation.\n  While single-employer pension funding problems have been quite \nvisible, the funding problems of multiemployer pension plans, that is, \nplans that are sponsored by big labor unions and the employers who have \nan obligation to contribute to them, have been invisible. Ironically, \nthe agency that is charged with protecting the integrity of the pension \ninsurance system has consistently declined to recommend changes to the \nfunding rules for these plans. Their argument is that the multiemployer \nplans are not a threat to the insurance system.\n  I respectfully submit that, over time, these multiemployer plans have \nbecome an unseen threat to the pension insurance system and to the \nparticipants in the plans and the employers who must fund them. If \nthere were not risk inherent in these plans, the plans would never have \ncome to Congress asking for changes in their rules. The changes in the \npension reform bill will postpone the possible collapse of some \nmultiemployer plans, but it they will not cure it. Much remains work \nremains to be done in terms of multiemployer reform.\n\n[[Page S8750]]\n\n  Unlike the single-employer pension system which has been amended \nnumerous times since its enactment in 1974, the rules governing \nmultiemployer plans have been virtually untouched since the enactment \nof the rules covering these plans in 1980.\n  In 2003 the multiemployer plans came up to Capitol Hill and asked for \na blanket extension of amortization of their plan gains and losses. \nCongress pared back that request in the provisions applicable to \nmultiemployer plans that appear in the 2004 Pension Funding Equity Act, \nPFEA.\n  Since then, the unions and management agreed upon changes to ease the \nmultiemployer pension funding standards for financially distressed \nplans. The changes made here identify plans that are seriously \nunderfunded. They also establish benchmarks for improvement.\n  The two special categories are for plans we consider to be \n``endangered'' versus those that are worse funded. Those are the plans \nin ``critical'' condition. At the behest of the union and management \nmultiemployer coalition, we urge these plans to increase funding.\n  Multiemployer plans are funded through contributions specified in \ncollective bargaining agreements. The plans look like a defined \ncontribution plan to the employers who pay for them since they pay a \ncertain number of dollars per hour each participant worked under the \nplan. But, these plans function like, and they are, defined benefit \nplans for the individuals covered by them. Because the plans are funded \nby, in some cases hundreds of, collective bargaining agreements, \nimprovements to overall funding cannot necessarily occur quickly.\n  The new rules do not set painful improvement standards for \nunderfunded plans. On the contrary, these new benchmarks for \nimprovement are established with the complete approval of the \nmultiemployer coalition. The new rules allow the plans to make modest \nincreases in their overall funded status without necessarily making \nother sacrifices. There is one exception to this rule. That occurs when \na plan is in so-called ``critical'' status. Under that circumstance, \nthe multiemployer coalition asked for the right to eliminate early \nretirement subsidies for participants who are still working. Early \nretirement subsidies are an accrued vested benefit and under current \nlaw. They are protected from reduction or elimination by a plan \namendment. Labor and management clearly felt that the underfunding in \nsome multiemployer plans was so severe that the only way some of the \nplans could survive was to eliminate early retirement subsidies of \nthose who are still working.\n  It is no secret that I resisted that change. Cutbacks of early \nretirement subsidies were not reported out of the HELP Committee. \nCutbacks were not passed by the Senate. The provision allowing cutbacks \nwas added by the House of Representatives' bill.\n  The issue of the cutback of previously accrued benefits is very \ncontroversial and a few clarifying points are needed. First, the \ndrafters took great care to ensure that the decision to cutback accrued \nbenefits is one that must be made by the plan trustees, and as part of \nthe collective bargaining process. The language of the bill is clear, I \nbelieve, that any reduction of adjustable benefits can only be \naccomplished through a separate schedule. The language of the bill does \nnot permit cutbacks in the default schedule.\n  The legislation also provides a floor for benefit reductions, i.e., \nthe so-called 1 percent rule. The bill makes clear, however, that the \nplan sponsor retains the ability to prepare and provide the bargaining \nparties with alternative schedules to the default schedule that \nestablish lower or higher accrual and contribution rates than the rates \notherwise required under the provision. Thus, the plan sponsor may \nsupply schedules to the bargaining parties for their consideration that \nraise employer contributions higher than the default schedule or reduce \nbenefit accruals below the specified 1 percent level. The legislation \ndoes not require the plan sponsor to go below the 1 percent benefits \nfloor, but that is expressly permitted if the trustees and bargaining \nparties so choose.\n  In the Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee, we worked on \nmultiemployer funding reform legislation over the last year and a half. \nWe heard testimony regarding the impact of existing multiemployer \npension rules on small, privately held trucking-related companies that \nparticipate in multiemployer pension plans.\n  These businesses participate in pension plans that are badly \nunderfunded as a result of changes in the trucking industry and poor \ndecisions by some of the plans' trustees--decisions that the smaller \ncompanies had virtually no knowledge of, much less control over. \nDespite the fact that these companies have made every pension \ncontribution required of them, the withdrawal liabilities attributable \nto them has skyrocketed, and in several cases exceeds the entire net \nworth of the company by two and three times.\n  I worked diligently with my colleagues to include withdrawal \nliability reforms for these companies in the pension bill, and to \nprotect those small employers who came forward to voice their opinions \nfrom retaliation from the pension plan. I am pleased that we were \nsuccessful in securing some modest reforms.\n  One additional issue which is vitally important to these employers \ninvolves the proper interpretation of current law. ERISA section 4225 \nprovides limitations on withdrawal liability for an employer that \nwithdraws from the plan in connection with a bona-fide arms-length sale \nof assets to an unrelated third party. As the interpretation of this \nsection has been subject to some legal dispute (Trustees of the \nAmalgamated Insurance Fund v. Geltman Industries, 784 F.2d 926 (9th \nCir. 1986)), it is important for Congress to reiterate its \ninterpretation of this law.\n  Therefore, I have included for the Congressional Record a copy of \nPBGC Opinion Letter 93-3. In this opinion letter, PBGC explains that, \n``the plain wording of section 4225 dictates that an employer that \nmeets the requirements of both subsections (a) and (b) is entitled to \nan assessment of withdrawal liability that does not exceed the lesser \nof the amounts determined under (a) and (b).'' Further, PBGC says, \n``that neither the legislative purpose nor principles of statutory \nconstruction compel a contrary conclusion.''\n  As the Chairman of the Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee, \nI believe this letter provides a clear and concise interpretation of \nSection 4225 which is completely consistent with the intent of \nCongress.\n  The pension reform bill amends the anti-retaliation section of ERISA \nto provide protection for employers who contribute to multiemployer \nplans and others. Specifically, the language adds a new sentence to \nERISA Section 510 that states: ``In the case of a multiemployer plan, \nit shall be unlawful for the plan sponsor or any other person to \ndiscriminate against any contributing employer for exercising rights \nunder this Act or for giving information or testifying in any inquiry \nor proceeding relating to this Act before Congress.''\n  The new sentence is necessary to close a loophole in the existing \nwhistleblower protection. Over the course of the debate over \nmultiemployer pension reforms, several companies approached Congress \nwith concerns about how proposals would adversely affect their business \noperations. In June 2005, John Ward, of Standard Forwarding in East \nMoline, IL, speaking on behalf of those companies, testified before the \nRetirement Security & Aging Subcommittee of the Senate Health, \nEducation, Labor & Pensions Committee.\n  On several occasions after that date, the committee heard allegations \nof threats of retaliation against Mr. Ward for testifying before \nCongress and for petitioning the Congress for redress of grievances. \nThe fact is that Mr. Ward's and the small trucking companies offered a \ndissenting point of view on the proposed multiemployer reforms. The \nother companies for whom Mr. Ward testified are: Fort Transfer of \nMorton, IL; Midwest Drivers of Bloomington, MN; Billings Freight, Inc. \nof Lexington, NC; Miller Transporters of Jackson, MI; Schwerman \nTrucking Co. of Milwaukee, WI; and Steel Warehouse Co., Inc. of South \nBend, TN. Among those allegations was the concern that all or most of \nthe companies had been targeted by a large multiemployer fund.\n  The conference committee believes that such actions, if proved, would \namount to unlawful retaliation under\n\n[[Page S8751]]\n\nthe language added to ERISA by the pension reform bill under section \n205. Exercising rights under ERISA, testifying before Congress, and \ngiving information in any inquiry or proceeding relating to this Act \nare protected under this provision. Retaliation in the form of threats, \nspecial audits or singling out of employers and others for adverse or \ndisparate treatment, will not be tolerated under the law. Let me say \nthat, had there been a conference report, there was an agreement among \nthe majority staff to include the specific reference to the small \ncompanies who warranted protection under this antiretaliation provision \nbecause they believe they have been singled out for retaliation by one \nof the plans to which they had an obligation to contribute.\n  Finally, all of Title II of the pension reform bill, except \nshortening the amortization from 30 to 15 years, is sunset after \nDecember 31, 2014 although any funding improvement or rehabilitation \nplan is permitted to remain in effect.\n  One of my highest priorities for pension reform is clarification of \nthe legal status of hybrid pension plans. Since late in 1998 when \nsensational stories about these plans first hit the newspapers, the \nCongress has been struggling over how to respond. I have never doubted \nthe legality of hybrid plans. While some conversion practices may have \nbeen questioned, the plans are entirely valid.\n  Hybrid plans have been criticized on the theory that the design was \nper se discriminatory. The theory suggests that the hypothetical \nindividual account plan design unlawfully favors younger workers over \nolder ones because younger workers could accrue interest on their \naccount over a longer period of time than older workers. This theory \namounts to a declaration that the ``time-value of money'' is age \ndiscriminatory.\n  Not surprisingly, given the confused logic of stating that compound \ninterest in a pension plan is age discriminatory, most courts that have \nreviewed the age appropriateness of hybrid plan designs have found them \nto be legitimate. Indeed, the first federal court to review the \nquestion stated ``Plaintiffs' proposed interpretation would produce \nstrange results totally at odds with the intended goal of the OBRA 1986 \npension age discrimination provisions (Eaton v. Onan (S.D. N.Y. \n2000)).'' The case law validating the hybrid design includes three \nfederal court decisions issued since a 2003 rogue decision in the \nSouthern District of Illinois. These decisions explicitly reject that \ncourt's reasoning and conclusion (Tootle v. ARINC (D. Md. 2004), \nRegister v. PNC (E.D. Pa. 2005) and Hirt v. Equitable (S.D. N. Y. 2006) \nand hold the hybrid pension design to be legal. Consistent with these \nnumerous federal court decisions, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) \nfor 15 years issued approvals for individual cash balance plans and the \nTreasury Department and IRS repeatedly issued guidance as to the \nvalidity of the cash balance design. It is not time for the IRS' self-\nimposed moratorium on determination letters for sponsors of these plans \nto end.\n\n  For purposes of applying the age discrimination test, the bill \npermits a plan to express an employee's accrued benefit ``under the \nterms of the plan'' as an account balance or current value of the \naccumulated percentage of the employee's final average compensation. \nThis rule was intended to limit, for purposes of age discrimination \ntesting, the use of an account balance to cash balance plans and the \nuse of a current value to pension equity plans. However, the phrase \n``under the terms of the plan'' could create the impression that the \nrule applies only to cash balance and pension equity plans that define \nin the plan document the term ``accrued benefit'' in this way.\n  Many cash balance and pension equity plans define ``accrued benefit'' \nas an age-65 annuity, even though that annuity is determined by \nreference to an account balance or current value. In many cases, this \ndefinition has been required by the Internal Revenue Service. It is \nimportant to clarify that Congress does not intend to require a plan \ndocument to include a specific definition of the term ``accrued \nbenefit'' to apply the standard set forth in this legislation.\n  This bill sets forth a test for age discrimination in defined benefit \npension plans that compares an employee's accrued benefit with that of \nany similarly situated younger employee. For this purpose, an \nemployee's accrued benefit may be expressed as the current balance in a \nhypothetical account for any plan that determines the employee's \naccrued benefit (or any portion thereof) by reference to a hypothetical \naccount, such as a cash balance plan. Similarly, for this purpose, an \nemployee's accrued benefit may be expressed as a current value equal to \nan accumulated percentage of the employee's final average pay for any \nplan that determines an employee's accrued benefit (or any portion \nthereof) by reference to such current value, such as a pension equity \nplan.\n  But the bill does not elevate form over substance. How a plan \nexpresses the accrued benefit for purposes of the age discrimination \nrules is not contingent upon how the plan document defines the term \n``accrued benefit.'' For example, a cash balance plan may, for purposes \nof the age discrimination rules, express the accrued benefit as the \ncurrent balance of the hypothetical account determined under the terms \nof the plan, even if the plan defines the term ``accrued benefit'' in a \ndifferent form, such as an annuity commencing at normal retirement age \nthat is based on the hypothetical account.\n  Similarly, a pension equity plan may express the accrued benefit as a \ncurrent value equal to an accumulated percentage of the employee's \nfinal average pay as determined under the terms of the plan, even if \nthe plan defines the term ``accrued benefit'' in a different form, such \nas an annuity commencing at normal retirement age that is based on that \ncurrent value. This flexibility is important because pension plans will \noften define the ``accrued benefit'' in different fashions. For \nexample, the IRS has frequently insisted that plans define the term \n``accrued benefit'' as ``an annuity commencing at normal retirement \nage'', even though the annuity is determined by reference to a \nhypothetical account or a current value equal to an accumulated \npercentage of an employee's final average pay.\n  Any hybrid plan including a cash balance or pension equity plan may \nalso apply the age discrimination test by expressing the employee's \naccrued benefit as an annuity beginning at normal retirement age (or at \nthe employee's current age, if later), as determined under the terms of \nthe plan. If a cash balance or pension equity plan were to do so, it \nlikely would rely on the indexing rules elsewhere in section 701 to \nsatisfy the age discrimination test.\n  The pension reform bill also provides new specifications for hybrid \nplan conversions. These are entirely new requirements and they have \nbeen worked out among the parties to these discussions. The rule \nspecifies that for conversions, plans should follow an ``A + B'' \nformula. This means that the benefit accrued to date under the old \nformula, that was in effect prior to the conversion, must be added to \nthe benefit under the new formula beginning on the date the conversion \ntakes effect.\n  Under this A + B formula, any early retirement subsidy that was \naccrued up to the date of the conversion would be preserved in the \nbenefit of the participant. This early retirement benefit would be \npayable only if the participant earned the requisite number of years of \nservice to entitle him or her to the benefit subsidy. The participant \nwould not be entitled to any additional amount of subsidy, but only the \namount earned to-date could be paid out and only assuming he or she \nworked the number of years required under the plan to earn it. The new \nrule does not require a plan to pay an early retirement subsidy in lump \nsum unless the plan provides that it will do so. This is consistent \nwith current law and practice.\n  The hybrid language also corrects the so-called pension whipsaw for \ndistributions after the date of enactment. The parties to the pension \ndiscussions took the view that the position taken by the IRS in Notice \n96-8 was an incorrect interpretation of present law. Many of us who \nwere engaged in the pension reform discussions noted that Notice 96-8 \nwas never finalized by the IRS in their regulations and we observed \nthat the Treasury Department had been reviewing the position in Notice \n96-8 for some time, but without result.\n  The approach taken in Notice 96-8 can actually harm many \nparticipants.\n\n[[Page S8752]]\n\nMany employers have reduced the rate of interest crediting under their \nhybrid plans due to concerns that over the requirements of the notice. \nIn addition to its other flaws, the approach taken in the notice \nprovides a larger benefit to be paid to a participant who takes a \ndistribution before normal retirement age than for a participant who \nwaits to take his or her benefit distribution. Thus Notice 96-8 would \npenalize an employee who waits to take a distribution. This is a \nperverse result for a rule governing retirement plans.\n  As we developed these new rules for hybrid plans, we were cognizant \nthat the system is voluntary and as such, it must accommodate the needs \nand concerns of employers and employees. A viable pension system must \ngrant plan sponsors the ability to change their plan designs on a \nprospective basis without undue restrictions or mandates on benefit \nlevels.\n  This legislation is a clarification of the law; the action in \nproducing this clarification should not cast any negative inference on \nthe legality of the hybrid plans.\n  There are provisions in this legislation that I believe bring our \npension retirement laws into greater sync with our future retirement \nneeds for financial education and with the operations of our quickly \nevolving financial markets. One provision concerns the expansion of \ninvestment advice to workers while other provisions are designed to \nallow ERISA plans to achieve similar benefits and efficiency of our \nmodernized financial markets that is available currently to retail and \nother institutional investors.\n  The investment advice provisions will provide much needed financial \nadvice and guidance for the millions of workers and their families on \nhow to invest their hard earned monies for retirement. The compromise \nachieved in the legislation would predicate upon the development of \ncomputerized models to help workers to investment monies through 401(k) \naccounts. Significant safeguards were put into the legislation to \nensure that the computerized models were certified by independent third \nparties. In addition, greater auditing of the use of the computerized \nmodels and enhanced disclosures will ensure that the models are being \nused properly and that workers understand how investment advice should \nbe used and how they can still seek independent advice for guidance and \nhelp.\n  Everyone at the conference table recognized the significant \ndifferences between the operation of 401(k) accounts and IRA accounts. \nWhile 401(k) accounts within defined contribution plans offer a limited \nmenu of investment options, IRA accounts may have hundreds of various \ninvestment options and alternatives spanning a vast array of \nsecurities, debt, insurance and other financial products. With respect \nto these IRA accounts, I applaud the measures in the legislation that \nwould encourage the development of computerized models to give \nindividuals guidance on how to invest their IRA monies. However, I am \nafraid that the type and sophistication of the computerized models for \nIRA's may not be obtainable and that the computerized models presented \nto the Department of Labor for review may be trimmed down to encompass \nonly ``life cycle'' type of investment options. This should not be the \nobjective. As IRA accounts are different, the regulatory regime for \ngiving investment advice guidance should be based upon to overcome the \nreal world hurdles in getting appropriate investment advice to \nindividuals.\n  It also should be noted that the Department of Labor, in 2001, issued \nan advisory opinion to Sun America to provide a structure for providing \nboth traditional advice and discretionary management. It was the goal \nand objective of the Members of the Conference to keep this advisory \nopinion intact as well as other pre-existing advisory opinions granted \nby the Department. This legislation does not alter the current or \nfuture status of the plans and their many participants operating under \nthese advisory opinions. Rather, the legislation builds upon these \nadvisory opinions and provides alternative means for providing \ninvestment advice which is protective of the interests of plan \nparticipants and IRA owners.\n  The legislation also contains provisions to modernize ERISA to align \nit with our financial markets of today, not the financial markets of \n1974. These modernizations provisions, such as permitting the use of \nelectronic communication networks, will put ERISA plans in parity with \nthe current ability of retail and other institutional investors to use \nthese modernizations. Specifically with respect to the provision on \nelectronic communication networks and similar trading venues, it was \nnot the intention to overturn existing interpretations or guidance \ngranted by the Department of Labor to securities exchanges registered \npursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The legislation's \nprovision is clear that it is applicable solely to electronic \ncommunication networks and similar trading venues and not to securities \nexchanges. With respect to the block trading provisions, the \nlegislation is not intended to be inconsistent with the Department of \nLabor's views with respect to the recently amended prohibited \ntransaction exemption, PTE 75-1.\n  Should this legislation be enacted into law, I would like to comment \non the history of pension legislation. The negotiations that have given \nbirth to this new law and its place in time have been very difficult, \nbut that is by no means unique to the history of ERISA.\n  This legislation marks the first major, comprehensive reform of the \npension funding rules in 32 years. ERISA, itself, was enacted in 1974, \n11 years after the collapse of the Studebaker pension plan in 1963 and \nafter extremely heated debates in the House and Senate.\n\n  The first major reform of single-employer rules after ERISA was \nenacted occurred in 1987. Those reforms came only after a long and \ncontentious conference. The conference began in March 1987, but it did \nnot conclude easily or amicably. It was not until December 22, 1987 \nthat the legislation was signed into law. The next major reform of \nsingle-employer plans occurred in 1994, seven more years after the '87 \namendments. That legislation was not enacted until December 8, 1994. \nMultiemployer plans have not been revisited or reformed once since \ntheir enactment in 1980.\n  It seems that pension legislation is marked by disagreement and \nstrife, but this should not be the case. There have been times when \npartisanship was put aside and when House and Senate, Republicans and \nDemocrats sought to ``do the right thing'' rather than score points.\n  One example of that bi-partisan, bi-cameral cooperation is the \npension provisions of EGTRRA. Those provisions would be made permanent \nby this legislation. EGTRRA made good reforms and I hope they will \nbecome permanent. They help Americans save for retirement, increase \nportability, protect plan integrity, increase the limits on defined \nbenefit, defined contribution plans and IRAs. EGTRRA allows catch-up \ncontributions for individuals who are age 50 and older and they make \npermanent many other beneficial tax and ERISA provisions.\n  I hope we can return to those days of pension bi-cameral and bi-\npartisan cooperation. Given the graying of America and the on-coming \nretirement of the baby-boomers, the American people need Congress to \nenact legislation that will improve the day-to-day lives of ordinary \nAmericans. I hope this legislation can and will make modest steps in \nthat direction.\n  Mr. President, I would like to make a special note about the bill \nbefore us. This legislation is essentially the product of the \nconference committee of which I chaired. While I am pleased we are on \nthe verge of passing an historic measure, I must briefly mention \nconcern, as any chairman should, for how we arrived at the bill before \nus today rather than a conference report. It was our intention to make \nfinal decisions on the very last items of the conference and to report \nback to both the House and the Senate with a completed, bipartisan \nconference report. Unfortunately, the conference process was cut short \nand was taken out of our hands. I truly hope that this is not the start \nof new precedent on how conferences should be conducted. If future \nactions repeat the actions taken here, then the future significance of \nchairmen and conference committees are in severe jeopardy. At the very \nheart of the Congress as a whole and the Senate, are the traditions and \nprecedents to ensure that everyone plays by the\n\n[[Page S8753]]\n\nsame rules. When those traditions and precedents are usurped, then we \nrun the risk of making everything before us meaningless. I offer this \nstatement as one of caution and not one of damnation.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to express my appreciation to the key \npeople involved in this bill.\n  The pension bill we are about to pass could not have been drafted if \npartisanship and politics had been allowed to intervene. I want to \nthank Senators Kennedy, Grassley and Baucus for their extremely hard \nwork on a complex piece of legislation. I appreciate their commitment \nto the private pension system and their willingness to drive onward to \nsolutions to the many tough decisions we had to make. It has truly been \nan honor to work so closely with such fine statesmen.\n  I also want to thank Senators DeWine and Mikulski for their \nextraordinary work as the leaders of the Subcommittee on Retirement \nSecurity and Aging. Their hearings last year created the basis for this \nbill. Their commitment to pensions of ordinary Americans and their \nsense of fairness greatly improved the bill before us.\n  There are many people who worked behind the scenes to get this bill \ncompleted. I would like to thank all of my staff for their diligence \nand commitment. In particular I thank:\n  HELP Committee Staff Director Katherine McGuire; Greg Dean, who \nplayed a central role on the investment advice and prohibited \ntransactions bill language. He expertly managed discussions throughout \nthe process and brought the various players together time and time \nagain to move the bill forward; Diann Howland, my pension policy \ndirector, who bravely agreed to come back to the hill and take on her \nthird major pension reform bill. In light of overwhelming odds, she \nbrought a fresh perspective to complex issues every day and should be \ncommended for her leadership in getting this bill done; David Thompson, \nhe brought a superb understanding of the intricate and complex labor \nissues to the table; and Amy Angelier--my crackerjack budget staffer \nand policy advisor. She was on top of each and every aspect of the \nbudget aspects of this bill and helped guide its success.\n  My staff worked closely with the staffs of my other Senate conferees \nand those individuals deserve thanks. They are Michael Myers, Portia Wu \nand Holly Fechner of Senator Kennedy's HELP Committee staff; Kolan \nDavis, Mark Prater, John O'Neill, Judy Miller and Stu Sirkin on the \nstaff of the Finance Committee for Senators Grassley and Baucus. I \nwanted to especially commend Mark Prater for his leadership over the \nlast week helping us maneuver through troubled waters.\n  I would also like to thank the nonpartisan legislative counsels and \nstaff from the Joint Committee on Taxation for their very long hours \nand professionalism. Every person with a pension should join me in \nthanking Jim Fransen, Stacy Kern, Carolyn Smith, Patricia McDermott, \nand Nikole Flax.\n  Finally, I want to thank my chief of staff, Flip McConnaughey. He did \nan excellent job holding the office together and keeping a focus on \nWyoming-specific issues when the pension conference kicked into full \ngear.\n  In conclusion, I want to express my appreciation to key people \ninvolved in this bill over the past 2 years. The pension bill we are \nabout to pass could not have been drafted if partisanship and politics \nhad not been laid aside for the greater good.\n  I thank Senators Kennedy, Grassley, and Baucus for their extremely \nhard work on this complex piece of legislation. I appreciate their \ncommitment to the private pension system and their willingness to drive \nonward to solutions to the many tough decisions we had to make. It has \ntruly been an honor to work so closely with such fine statesmen. I also \nthank Senators DeWine and Mikulski for their extraordinary work as \nleaders of the Subcommittee on Retirement Security and Aging.\n  There are many people who worked behind the scenes to get this bill \ncompleted. I would like to thank all of my staff for their diligence \nand commitment. I will go into some of those in greater detail later. \nMy staff worked with other Senate conferees and other individuals. I \nwill mention those after we have the vote so people can be on their \nway.\n  I thank the nonpartisan Legislative Counsel's staff, Jim Fransen and \nStacy Kern. And, finally, I thank my chief of staff, Flip McConnaughey.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this historic piece of legislation \nwhich the President will quickly sign into law. It will save a number \nof pension plans, but, more importantly, it will save the people that \nneed these pensions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I believe we have 10 minutes on our side. \nI yield myself 7 minutes, and 3 minutes to the Senator from Maryland, \nMs. Mikulski.\n  I know that the hour is late, but I want to take just a few minutes \nto speak on this critical piece of legislation.\n  First, I want to thank my colleagues who were instrumental to \ncrafting this bill. Pensions are not an easy subject, and it has been \nan extraordinary effort over the last two years to develop this \ncompromise legislation, which will help to strengthen retirement \nsecurity of over 100 million Americans.\n  I thank our leadership for bringing this important bill to the floor \ntoday--Senators Frist and Reid. Americans are counting on us to act \nnow, and I thank our leaders for making this possible.\n  I want to thank Chairman Enzi, who has been both tireless, and also a \ngracious and even-handed leader, both of the HELP Committee and of this \nconference. I also want to thank Chairman Grassley of the Finance \nCommittee for his leadership and his integrity in this process.\n  And tonight all of us are remembering our good friend and colleague \nSenator Max Baucus, who has worked so hard over the last few years on \nthis legislation. Our thoughts are with him and his family and the \npeople of Montana in their time of loss.\n  Many other Senators also contributed significantly to this \nlegislation. Senators DeWine and Mikulski have worked to be sure that \nwe address the need of manufacturing companies in this country; Senator \nMikulski has been particularly interested in women's retirement \nsecurity and protections for older workers, as well. Senator Isakson \nand Senator Lott have continued to press issues important to airlines. \nAnd Senator Harkin has tirelessly advocated for older workers in cash \nbalance pensions.\n  There have also been many leaders in the House who made this \nlegislation possible. I particularly thank Majority Leader Boehner for \nhis contributions and leadership.\n  I also thank our staffs, who devoted late nights, gave up vacations \nand weekends to get the bill done and worked steadily on this issue. \nSenator Enzi: Katherine McGuire, Greg Dean, Diann Howland, David \nThompson, and Ilyse Schuman. Senator Grassley: Kolan Davis, Mark \nPrater, and John O'Neill. Senator Baucus: Russ Sullivan, Pat Heck, Judy \nMiller, and Stu Sirkin. Senator Mikulski: Ellen-Marie Whelan and Ben \nOlinsky. From the Joint Committee on Taxation: Carolyn Smith, Patricia \nMcDermott, and Nikole Flax. And from the Senate Legislative Counsel, \nJim Fransen and Stacy Kern.\n  I especially thank my own staff for their tireless efforts: Terri \nHolloway, Jeff Teitz, Jonathan McCracken, and Laura Capps. Michael \nMyers, my staff director, helps guide our work on so many issues. And \nspecial thanks to Holly Fechner and Portia Wu. Portia brings a mastery \nof the issues and a dedication to workers that made possible so much \nthat is in this legislation. And Holly is a true leader who had the \nvision and skills to make it all happen. I thank her for her work on \nthis important bill.\n  This bill is the most important action to safeguard the retirement of \nhard working Americans in a generation. It will help more than 100 \nmillion Americans today as they look forward to a financially secure \nretirement, and millions more in the future. It means greater \nretirement security for workers across the economic spectrum--from \ncashiers to flight attendants, from construction workers to auto \nworkers.\n  The danger has been obvious. More and more firms are dropping their \npensions. Half of all American workers now have no retirement savings \nplan at their job at all.\n\n[[Page S8754]]\n\n  This bill says to millions of Americans who fear their pensions may \ndisappear that help is on the way. We're helping their pension plans \nrecover and imposing tough new rules to keep them that way.\n  It gives workers a greater voice in planning their retirements \ninstead of just blind faith. It's their money and their hard work, and \nthey should know what's going on.\n  This legislation touches almost every aspect of retirement planning, \nwhether it's a pension, a 401(k) plan or personal savings. We owe it to \nour workers to give them the best information so they can make the best \nchoices for themselves and this bill makes that possible.\n  The Pension Protection Act will strengthen the financial health of \npension plans by doing as much as we can to guarantee that funds will \nbe there to pay for employees hard-earned retirement benefits.\n  It provides opportunities to increase retirement savings by \nautomatically enrolling people in workplace pension plans, and \nimproving the Saver's Credit to help moderate-income workers. Workers \nwho participate in retirement savings plans will have greater access to \ninvestment advice to help them manage their retirement savings.\n  It protects the retirement benefits of older workers when companies \nswitch to new types of cash balance pension plans. And it includes \nspecific provisions to strengthen women's retirement security.\n  In addition, it includes clear protections to prevent employees from \nbeing stranded by future Enron-type crises because firms force them to \ninvest their retirement savings in company stock.\n  The need for action is clear, and it's gratifying that Democrats and \nRepublicans, House and Senate, have been able to come together to enact \nthese major reforms.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I hope Members take the time to listen \nto what we are saying here. We are about to make history. We are about \nto pass legislation that is going to make a difference. We are going to \nmake sure that the lives of over 100 million people will be more secure \nbecause of what we have done tonight. We are going to make sure that \ngood-guy businesses will have clear, certain rules so that they can \ncontinue to provide pensions. We are going to make sure that \ngovernment, through heavyhandedness or unintended consequences, won't \nforce these businesses into bankruptcy. We are going to protect the \ntaxpayer to make sure that the pensions of hundreds of thousands of \npeople aren't dumped into the Pension Benefit Guarant Corporation, \nleaving it to the taxpayer to do what the private sector should. And we \nsucceeded because we worked together.\n  I thank Senator Enzi for his leadership and his collegiality, his \ninclusion and his civility; Senator Kennedy for the leadership he \nprovided to our side of the aisle and the very competent staff at his \ndisposal; certainly to my colleague Senator DeWine. We chaired the \nSubcommittee on Retirement Security and Aging and held some of the \nfirst hearings out of the box. We tried to go at it with intellectual \nrigor and with fortitude. We promised we would do no harm to those who \nrelied on a pension, to those who provided a pension, and to the \nPension Guaranty.\n  Do you know what? We did it. Then we moved it through the HELP \nCommittee. The Finance Committee had already started their work, and \nultimately we merged those two bills. But Senator DeWine and I come \nfrom a manufacturing base, those blue-collar workers with dirt under \ntheir fingernails and bad backs who wonder what they are going to have \nat the end of the workday. We stood up for them. There was a concern \nthat the use of credit ratings in determining whether a pension plan \nwas at risk would force manufacturing companies going through difficult \neconomic times into bankruptcy because of their pensions.\n  We held up the Senate. We said we wouldn't let the bill go on. But \nSenators Grassley and Baucus reached out to us and said: Trust us; we \ncan reach a compromise. Will you work with us? We wanted to know what \nthat compromise was. They said: We will have to work it out. Do you \nknow what we did? We trusted our colleagues on the Finance Committee \nand before long we had a sensible solution that was actuarially sound, \nfiscally reliable, and also met the needs of the pensions.\n  Tonight we come before you with something that we truly have done on \na bipartisan basis, consulting with experts, working with able staff, \ntrusting and working with each other, long hours, difficult nights, \nsometimes speed bumps and potholes. But now we have come to the end of \nthe journey. I can't tell you how proud I am to ask my colleagues to \nvote for this bill. I am proud not only because I believe tonight we \ntruly can make a difference, but also so we can use this as a model of \nhow when we work together, we can do better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, tonight I thank a number of people and \nacknowledge their very hard work: Chairman Mike Enzi of the HELP \nCommittee and Ranking Member Kennedy have been indispensable; Senator \nGrassley, who has been fantastic, along with his ranking member Max \nBaucus; John O'Neill of the staff of the Finance Committee; Diann \nHowland and Kara Marchione of the HELP Committee staff; my staff, Ed \nEigee, Glee Smith and Mike Quiello; and, in particular, Senators \nColeman and Lott, who have worked so tirelessly to bring us to this \nmoment.\n  For a second I would like to focus on what this moment is. There are \nthree distinct winners tonight. In the short run, the winners are tens \nof thousands of employees in the airline industry confronted within the \nnext 30 to 60 days with a loss of up to 70 percent of their pensions \nwith them going on the back of the PBGC. They will be grateful for the \nopportunity this bill gives to allow them and their pensions to be \nhonored.\n  Secondly, in the long run, tens of millions of Americans employed by \nsome of the greatest corporations in this country whose pensions have \ncome into jeopardy over time because of changes in the workforce, \nchanges in longevity, and the pressures that have been put on the \npension system.\n  Most importantly, the big winner tonight is the taxpayers of the \nUnited States. Because this Congress, in a bipartisan fashion, has come \ntogether and said: We can modernize our pension laws. We can keep \npensions from being defaulted upon and going on the back of the PBGC. \nAnd we can prevent the type of failures that in the past have cost the \nAmerican taxpayers tens of millions of dollars.\n  We had an earlier bill that failed tonight. It consolidated many \nefforts to bring about changes for many Americans. But as we close this \nsession tonight, with the adoption of this particular piece of \nlegislation, we will find the best in this Senate, where Republicans \nand Democrats have come together to do what is right for the taxpayers.\n  Lastly, I want to say in particular to the two Senators from Texas \nand the two Senators from Ohio--Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. \nVoinovich, and Mike DeWine--how much I appreciate their consent for us \nto move tonight and to work with them to see to it that the concerns \nthey had are addressed in the months and years ahead.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n     Type III supporting organizations and excess business holdings\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I would like to engage my colleague, the \ndistinguished Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator \nGrassley, regarding a specific point involving the charitable reform \nprovisions for Type III supporting organizations, particularly the \nauthority of the Secretary to exempt an organization from the \napplication of the excess business holdings rules. My colleague has \nworked hard to address the unintended consequences that may arise with \nregard to some of these changes as they related to the important work \nof many fine organizations that support worthy and noble causes. I have \none of these organizations in my State of Colorado--the\n\n[[Page S8755]]\n\nReisher Family Foundation--that benefits many underprivileged students \nthroughout my State and provides them the means to attend college in my \nState.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am happy to engage my distinguished \ncolleague about what the intent with this exemption is, and how we have \nworked to limit the unintended consequences for legitimate charitable \norganizations. As you are aware, some of us with interest in this \nprovision in working to address any unintended consequences thought it \nwould be a good idea to give the Secretary the ability to exempt from \nthe excess business holdings rules Type III supporting organizations in \ncertain limited circumstances.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, specifically, I want to draw the \nchairman's attention to the excess business holdings provision and the \nlanguage that allows the Secretary to waive the application of the \nexcess business holdings provisions if the holdings of the Type III \nsupporting organization are held consistent with the purpose or \nfunction constituting the basis for its exemption under section 501. I \nwant to emphasize that my understanding is correct that the Secretary \nshould make a final determination very quickly after a currently \nexisting Type III supporting organization seeks exemption from the \nexcess business holdings rules. It is extremely important that the \ndetermination be made within 6 months after the organization seeks \nexemption so that the organization knows how it must structure its \nholdings. Is that my friend's understanding?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I agree with Senator Allard on his \nunderstanding and our intent that the Secretary should make a final \ndetermination very quickly after a currently existing Type III \nsupporting organization seeks exemption from the excess business \nholdings rules. The determination should be made by the Secretary \nwithin 6 months after the exemption is sought. The joint committee will \nhave a description of several factors that the Secretary should \nconsider in making decisions to waive. The considered views of the \nState Attorney General should be a part of that decision. In addition, \nif the shares of the entity and related persons is not controlling or \nthe individual and related persons are bound to ultimately contribute \nall but a de minimus share to the charity and have no direct or \nindirect control of that charity and its investments those are \nadditional factors the Secretary can consider.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I commend the chairman for his work and for working with \nothers, such as the distinguished ranking member on the Senate Finance \nCommittee, Senator Baucus, and Senator Santorum on this much needed \nexemption. There is no question that we intend to encourage more \ncharitable giving in this country. I thank my colleague for engaging me \nin this colloquy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                    credit counseling organizations\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I want to take a minute to let my \ncolleagues know what the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator \nColeman, and I have discussed with respect to the consideration of a \nparticular section of the Pension Protection Act of 2006--Section 1220. \nNamely, that section would establish additional standards in the \nInternal Revenue Code for tax exemption for credit counseling \norganizations.\n  The chairman was the genesis of these provisions, and it is through \nhis hard work and persistence that they were ultimately included in the \nbill we are currently considering. The credit counseling reform \nlanguage will go a long way toward ensuring that the hundreds of bona \nfide tax-exempt credit counseling organizations operating today across \nthe country that serve an invaluable role in helping consumers \nunderstand, deal with, and manage their credit and debt problems will \nbe able to continue as tax-exempt under Internal Revenue Code Section \n501(c)(3), with all of the important obligations and benefits that this \nstatus entails. Ensuring the continuation of tax-exempt credit \ncounseling organizations that meet the high standards set by the \nFederal Tax Code, along with standards set by state law and by Federal \nagencies such as the Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Department \nof Justice, will mean that the necessary counseling, education and debt \nmanagement plan services will be available to all financially \ndistressed consumers who need them for many years to come. It also \nmeans that there will be sufficient tax-exempt credit counseling \norganizations available to fulfill the pre-bankruptcy counseling \nmandate of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act \nof 2005. As for the purpose of Section 1220, I would like to turn to my \ncolleague, Senator Coleman, who--as chairman of the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations--conducted an investigation into abuses \nin the credit counseling industry.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. One provision of Section 1220 of the Pension Protection \nAct of 2006 would create a new Section 501 (q)(2)(A)(ii) of the \nInternal Revenue Code. This particular subsection contains one of \nseveral new requirements for credit counseling organizations to qualify \nfor Federal tax exemption under Internal Revenue Code Section \n501(c)(3). I wanted to clarify with the chairman that this particular \nprovision is not intended to impose a limitation on all credit \ncounseling organization revenues derived from debt management plans, \nbut rather only on the revenues derived from what are commonly referred \nto as ``fair share'' payments from creditors to credit counseling \nagencies. These are payments made by creditors to credit counseling \norganizations that are attributable to the debt management plan \nservices provided by credit counseling organizations to consumers whose \ndebt is being repaid to the creditors. If the limitation were intended \nto include both ``fair share'' revenues paid by creditors and revenues \nreceived in the form of debt management plan fees paid by consumers, \nthen virtually no existing credit counseling organizations, if any, \nwould be able to qualify for tax-exempt status under Internal Revenue \nCode Section 501(c)(3). That is not the intent of Congress.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, yes, the provision is intended to get at \nfair share type payments, but note that agencies and creditors cannot \nget around the provision merely by re-labeling fair share payments as \nsomething else. This is the intent of this provision. I am also aware \nof a specific issue affecting a few States and their existing State \nlaw, and the provision before us today specifically includes a \ntransition period in part to allow the reconciliation of various State \nstatutes with the new federal provision. I will work with interested \nSenators during this period on their concerns regarding existing \norganizations. I thank Mr. Coleman and Mr. Sessions for helping to \nclarify its intent.\n\n\n                 Modifications to Sections 801 and 803\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a brief colloquy \nwith the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator \nGrassley, regarding changes to the limitations on pension deductions in \nsections 801 and 803. The legislation, in section 801, increases the \ndeduction limit for defined benefit plans for years after December 31, \n2005. Increasing this limit will encourage employers to contribute more \nto their defined benefit plans.\n  However, if an employer has both a defined benefit plan and a defined \ncontribution plan there is a separate deduction limit that applies to \nemployers with a combination of plans. Thus, this legislation in \nsection 803, also updates the limitation on deductions where an \nemployer has a combination of such plans effective for contributions \nmade for taxable years after December 31, 2005. The change in section \n803 eliminates the deduction limit for combinations of defined benefit \nand defined contribution plans for employers that do not contribute \nmore than 6 percent of compensation to a defined contribution plan.\n  If an employer has a combination of plans and wants to contribute \nmore than 6 percent of compensation to a defined contribution plan, the \nlegislation also has a provision in section 801 which permits employers \nto exclude defined benefit plans whose benefits are guaranteed by the \nPBGC, from the limits applicable to combinations of defined benefit \nplans and defined contribution plans. But, unlike the other two \nprovisions I described above which permit employers to increase their \ncontributions to defined benefit plans\n\n[[Page S8756]]\n\neffective for years after December 31, 2005, it appears that this last \nrelated provision regarding guaranteed plans may inadvertently not have \nthe same effective date as the other two.\n  It seems to me that if we are encouraging employers to fully fund \ntheir defined benefit pension plans, that the effective dates for these \nprovisions should all be effective as of December 31, 2005. I am \nhopeful that we will examine this issue and can correct this technical \noversight.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I appreciate my distinguished colleague \nfrom Virginia, Senator Allen, raising this concern. I can assure him \nthat he is correct that it makes perfect sense for provisions intended \nto encourage employers to fund their defined benefit pension plans by \nincreasing the deduction limits to have the same effective date. I also \nagree that this should especially be true for provisions that update \ndeduction limits for employers with a combination of plans. I look \nforward to working with my colleague on addressing this oversight.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \nFinance Committee for his willingness to work with me to address this \nissue.\n\n\n                              section 701\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I would like to ask the chairman of the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions a question \nregarding how section 701 of the new bill relates to capital \npreservation and loss protection. Would you please explain what types \nof plans are subject to each of the two rules and how the rules \noperate?\n  Mr. ENZI. The capital preservation rule applies to applicable defined \nbenefit plans, such as cash balance and pension equity plans. To \nillustrate how the rule operates in the case of a cash balance plan, \nthe rule requires that the cumulative effect of all the interest \ncredits to an employee's hypothetical account may not reduce the \naccount balance below the sum of all the pay credits made to the \naccount.\n  Mr. BURR. The bill refers to ``contributions credited to the \naccount'' rather than pay credits?\n  Mr. ENZI. Yes. The two terms are synonymous. Since the account in a \ncash balance plan is hypothetical, the contributions credited to it are \nhypothetical also. Hypothetical contributions is merely another name \nfor pay credits.\n  The second rule, the loss protection rule, applies to all defined \nbenefit plans that use any form of benefit indexing. Thus, the second \nrule applies not only to cash balance and pension equity plans but also \nto other defined benefit plans that index benefits.\n  The loss prevention rule would apply in the same way as the capital \npreservation rule in the above example of a cash balance plan. However, \nbecause the loss prevention rule applies to a broader group of plans \nthan just applicable defined benefit plans, the rule is written in more \ngeneral terms than the capital preservation rule, which applies to a \nnarrower universe of plans.\n  To illustrate how the loss protection rule operates in the case of a \ndefined benefit plan that indexes benefits by reference to changes in \nthe Consumer Price Index, the rule requires that the cumulative effect \nof such indexing may not cause a decrease in an employee's benefit \nbelow what it would have been in the absence of such indexing. Although \nit is very unlikely, this would occur if there were a sustained period \nof deflation in which the overall change in the CPI were negative \nrather than positive. In that extremely unlikely case, the plan could \nnot reflect the cumulative negative change in the CPI.\n  Mr. BURR. At what point are the rules applied?\n  Mr. ENZI. The capital preservation and loss protection rules are \nintended to provide long-term protection to employees, so the \ndetermination of whether the rules are satisfied is made at the time \nbenefits commence but not beforehand. In the case of plans that index \nbenefits after benefits begin, the determination is made by reference \nto the benefit in effect at the time benefits begin.\n\n\n                  lump sums from hybrid pension plans\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I would like to ask the chairman of the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, to clarify \nprovisions of H.R. 4 that address the payment of lump sums from hybrid \npension plans.\n  My first question relates to a clarification of the effective date of \nthose provisions. As you are aware, under the so-called whipsaw method \nof calculating lump sums, younger workers would receive much larger \nlump sums than identically situated older workers.\n  This result is one that Congress never intended. Furthermore, the \npractical effect of the whipsaw calculation would be to reduce benefits \nfor all participants, young and old, in cash balance plans. Therefore, \nthe intent of the whipsaw provisions is to put this issue to rest. \nAccordingly, the provisions are effective for distributions made after \nthe date of enactment, regardless of why they are made.\n  Mr. ENZI. Yes. The provisions do apply to all distributions made \nafter the date of enactment.\n  Mr. GREGG. My second question relates to the definition of ``market \nrate of return'' in the whipsaw provisions. My understanding is that \nthe term ``market rate of return'' is intended to allow plans to adjust \nbenefits in ways that benefit participants. For example, a plan could \nprovide a variable market rate of return and, in addition, protect \nparticipants by preventing the rate of return in their accounts from \nfalling below a reasonable, minimum level without having to reduce the \nvariable market rate of return. My further understanding is that the \nterm ``market rate of return'' is intended to include a fixed rate of \ninterest that is no greater than the yield on long-term, investment-\ngrade corporate bonds at any time during a reasonable period before the \nrate is first applied under the plan; is this correct?\n  Mr. ENZI. Yes, it is.\n\n\n                           credit counseling\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a brief \ncolloquy with the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, \nSenator Grassley, regarding the provision addressing tax-exempt credit \ncounseling organizations. My understanding is that the provision is \nintended to strengthen the standards for credit counseling \norganizations claiming exempt status, helping to ensure that these \norganizations do not conduct substantial activities unrelated to their \nexempt purposes of providing charitable and educational counseling. I \nwould ask Chairman Grassley to confirm that understanding and to \nbriefly explain the intent of the provision.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I am happy to confirm the understanding of my \ndistinguished colleague from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman, regarding \nthis provision. The provision is intended to buttress current exemption \nstandards by providing additional standards that must be met for a \ncredit counseling organization to claim exempt status. As the Senator \nknows, the IRS recently has challenged the exempt status of several \ncredit counseling organizations because they are operated for a \nsubstantial non-exempt purpose, substantial private benefit and private \ninurement. Certain of these organizations exist merely to generate \nincome from the sale of debt management plans, while providing minimal \nexempt purpose activities related to credit counseling. The standards \nimposed under this provision are intended to augment, not supplant, the \nIRS efforts and to ensure that exemption from consumer protection laws \napplies only to those organizations that can satisfy stricter tax-\nexempt standards. I also want to assure the distinguished Senator from \nNew Mexico that we will continue to monitor developments in this \nindustry to ensure that only those entities that serve a sufficient \ncharitable and educational purpose can claim tax-exempt status and that \nsuch tax-exempt entities do not generate significant revenues from \nactivities unrelated to their exempt purposes. If it turns out that the \nadditional standards imposed by this legislation do not have the \ndesired impact, you can be assured that we will not hesitate to revisit \nthis area.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I want to thank the distinguished chairman of the \nFinance Committee for his clarification and his leadership on these \nimportant issues.\n\n\n                          relief for airlines\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, while we consider legislation \nregarding the hard-earned pension benefits of American workers, we have \nbefore us a good bill, but flawed bill,\n\n[[Page S8757]]\n\nwhich is long overdue. It strengthens company pension plans and ensures \nthat money promised is there to pay for millions of workers' and \nretirees' benefits. It also enhances retirement savings and retirement \nsecurity by encouraging more companies to use automatic enrollment in \n401(k) pension plans, which ensures workers save more for retirement.\n  Yet despite these positive steps and necessary reforms, I have grave \nreservations over the inequities contained in the airline relief \nportion of the bill.\n  We are not here to pick winners and losers in certain industries, yet \nthe differential treatment contained in this legislation would offer \none company an unfair advantage over another. Last year's Senate-passed \nbill contained equitable relief for all, which is the correct approach, \nand I am appreciative of the work the Senate Finance and the Health, \nLabor, Education and Pensions Committees put into that effort. This \nHouse-passed bill takes a different approach and deals a better hand to \nsome at the expense of others.\n  It is not my intention to delay or hold up the bill because of this \nprovision, but I am seeking assurances for the 13,475 American Airlines \nworkers and retirees in Florida who are counting on us to make changes, \nin whatever way possible, that will put them on equal footing.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, although I will support final passage of \nthe long-awaited pension bill that aims to strengthen millions of \nworkers' pensions, including those for airline workers, I want to \nexpress my concerns regarding one provision in particular. Similar to \nthe Senate pension bill passed in October, this measure contains \nlanguage that would provide financially troubled airlines more time to \npay out their pension obligations and preserve their employees' pension \nplans. However, while the Senate-passed language was carefully crafted \nin such a way so as to not pick winners and losers between those \nairlines in bankruptcy that are freezing their defined benefit plans \nand those who have not entered bankruptcy and are intent on keeping \ntheir defined benefit plans, the House-passed language that we are soon \nto consider does pick winners and losers. The House measure gives those \nairlines that want to keep their defined benefit plans a much more \nunattractive interest rate than those airlines that freeze their plans. \nIt is simply not fair to penalize those airlines that want to keep \ntheir pension plans.\n\n  It distresses me that those airlines that choose to keep their \ndefined benefit plans will be punished and forced to compete on an \nuneven playing field. In June, concerned with the pensions of over \n10,000 American Airlines' employees in my State and thousands of others \nacross the Nation, I joined with Senator Obama and my fellow Senators \nfrom Oklahoma and Florida in sending a letter to the pension conferees \nreminding them of the importance of providing airline relief and \ntreating all airlines equally. Unfortunately, this bill does not treat \nall airlines equally.\n  In talking to my colleagues in the Senate, I believe there is a \ngeneral consensus that this differential should be corrected at the \nearliest possible legislative opportunity. If that assurance can be \ngiven by the Senate leaders on this pension legislation, I believe we \nshould pass the House bill this week and work diligently to correct the \ninequity upon our return in September.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, this is not a perfect bill. No 900-page \nbill could be. But it will push companies to stay true to the promises \nof retirement security that they have made to their employees. We have \nseen too many people hurt at companies that have gone through \nbankruptcy and dumped their pensions on the PBGC. We have also seen \ncompanies like Enron that misled their workers into putting all their \nretirement savings into employer stock. This bill takes steps to reduce \nthe incentives and capacity for firms to take either of those courses \nof action.\n  But as I said, the bill is not perfect. Among the areas that could \nhave used additional work is the disparate treatment among competitors \ncontained in the airline relief portion of the bill.\n  The Senate-passed bill contained comparable relief for all airlines \nin an effort to keep from distorting the marketplace against or in \nfavor of any one or two airlines. That was the correct approach. The \nHouse-passed bill treats different airlines differently and will \ndistort the market in a way that is unnecessary and unfair to the \n10,000 American Airlines workers and retirees in Illinois. Both as a \nmatter of retirement policy and aviation policy, this bill should not \nfavor one airline over another, and I join my colleagues who are \ncalling for parity or near parity in treatment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am glad that we are finally getting to the \npoint where we can finish this very important pension reform \nlegislation. It contains a number of measures that will improve the \nretirement security for millions of Americans.\n  One of the things that this bill does is provide targeted funding \nrelief to the airline industry--an industry that was devastated by the \nevents of September 11. In crafting the airline relief in the Senate \nbill, the managers struck the appropriate balance, being careful not to \nfavor one group of companies over another. That balance is not \nreflected in the airline relief proposal that the House inserted into \nthis bill at the last minute. Ironically, those airlines, like \nAmerican, that want to keep their pension plans for their workers get a \nmuch less favorable interest rate and a shorter amortization period. As \na result, those airlines that have done the right thing for their \nworkers are penalized relative to those airlines that have opted to \nfreeze their pension plans. That makes absolutely no sense.\n  While I agree with my colleagues that the pension reform bill should \nmove forward this evening, I also strongly support their efforts to fix \nthis portion of the bill in the very near future.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this pension bill is a good bill, but \nit is not a perfect bill. It will make sure companies put real money \nbehind their pension promises, in good times and bad. It will give \nworkers more information about their pension plans so they understand \nthe risks they face. It will create incentives to encourage more \nworkers to save for their retirement.\n  Unfortunately, the bill is not fair to all airlines. The bill gives \nadvantages for some carriers at the expense of others--especially \ndisadvantaging those in New Jersey. As a result of this bill, some \nairlines will have to contribute hundreds of millions of dollars more \nto their pensions than others. That isn't fair, and it doesn't create a \nlevel competitive playing field.\n  The Senate agreed that this isn't fair, and that is why the Senate's \nversion of airline relief treated all airlines equally. If the House \nRepublican conferees had not hijacked this conference, I believe we \nwouldn't be in this position. But we have been put in a very difficult \nplace. We are forced to choose between stopping this bill and \nendangering pensions for hundreds of thousands of workers and accepting \nan outcome that is blatantly unfair.\n  I hope and expect that when this bill passes, we will be able to work \ntogether to fix this problem at the first opportunity.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, as we consider critical pension reform \nto help secure the retirement benefits of millions of our Nation's \nworkers, I want first to commend my colleagues for all the hard work \nthey have put into this bill and their efforts to strengthen our \nNation's pension system. This bill will help ensure that companies can \ncontinue to provide pensions over the long term, it will protect the \nbenefits of current beneficiaries, and it strengthens plans so that \nbenefits will be there for workers for years to come.\n  And while I welcome this bipartisan bill and all that it will do to \nbenefit the retirement security of workers, I would like to express my \nstrong concern over the differential treatment of airlines in this \nbill. In allocating that relief, not all airlines are treated fairly, \nand therefore not on a level playing field. Some, such as Continental \nwhich has a significant economic and employee presence in New Jersey, \nare not given the same benefits and flexibility to make up the \nunderfunding of their pension plans. What especially concerns me is \nthat Continental went to great lengths to keep it from becoming \nfinancially unstable and to protect benefits for its employees, \nincluding voluntary wage reductions and freezing one of its pension \nplans. And despite those actions, because of the unequal treatment in \nthis bill, the airline is at a competitive disadvantage, and over\n\n[[Page S8758]]\n\n10,000 workers in my state could be adversely affected.\n  As this legislation has been under negotiation for months and there \nis an urgency to pass a final bill, I do not want to hold up the \npension bill from final passage. I do hope, however, that we can secure \nthe support of our leadership and work with our colleagues to come to \nan agreement that would provide more equitable treatment for \nContinental Airlines and its employees. Retirement security is a \npressing issue for many workers affected by this bill, including \nemployees at Continental. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to work with \nus in addressing this issue when we return in September.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I do not believe that the pension bill \nshould treat different, very competitive companies within the airline \nindustry in the very disparate manner that it does. This was an \nunresolved issue in the pension conference when the House leaders \ndecided not to complete the negotiations and instead sent us the \nmeasure before us. While I understand that an amendment tonight is not \ngoing to happen, I do believe that the Senate move to and insist that \nthis wrong be fixed.\n\n\n                         airline pension reform\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise to engage the majority leader \nin colloquy related to H.R. 4, the Pension Protection Act. Senator \nTalent has asked that I state for the information of our colleagues \nthat he shares my concern in regard to the issue I am raising.\n  I support the efforts being made to reform and update our Nation's \noutdated pension laws and to protect the taxpayers by reducing the \nthreat of insolvency on the part of the Pension Benefit Guaranty \nCorporation. But there is a section in the bill that is not equitable; \nit favors two airline companies over two others; and that must be \nremedied.\n  The bill affects the pension plans of four competing airline \ncompanies--American, Continental, Delta and Northwest. Two of these \ncompanies, Delta and Northwest, are currently operating in bankruptcy; \nAmerican and Continental are not. When the Senate passed its version of \nthe pension reform bill these four companies were treated equally. Our \nbill did not favor one over the other nor include provisions that would \ntilt the competitive playing field to the advantage of one or more of \nthe companies.\n  But the legislation that has been sent to us by the House of \nRepresentatives unfortunately contains that type of unfair provision. \nThe House bill allows Delta and Northwest to use an interest rate of \n8.85 percent to calculate returns from pension assets and determine the \namount of money that the companies must contribute each year to their \npension plans to make up for unfunded liabilities. But the interest \nrate allowed to be used by American and Continental is not 8.85 \npercent. It is not 8 percent. It is not even 7 percent. These two \ncompanies must use the corporate bond yield, which is now about 6.2 \npercent.\n  Translated into dollars-and competitive advantage--the difference \nbetween 8.85 percent and 6.2 percent means that the annual payment of \nAmerican and Continental could be hundreds of millions of dollars more \nthan the payment due from Delta and Northwest, quickly mounting into \nthe billions. I say to the majority leader that that is an inequity \nthat must be removed. I am not arguing that the percentage used for \nDelta and Northwest be reduced or changed in any way. But I am arguing \nthat the disparity between 8.85 percent and 6.2 percent is far too \ngreat and provides an unjust competitive advantage for Delta and \nNorthwest. Is the leader able to provide any insight on his view of \nwhen and how the Senate would have an opportunity to address this \nissue?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I certainly endorse the comments of the Senator from \nTexas. The airline industry is very competitive with thin profit \nmargins. The costs of labor and benefits are two of the few variables \nthat affect a company's bottom line. The bill that came over to the \nSenate from the House, and which we are unable to amend today, puts \nseveral of the airlines at a severe competitive disadvantage because it \ndoes not apply the same rules to each airline's pension fund. \nRecognizing the importance of the other reform measures in this \nlegislation, I understand the need to pass it and send it to the \nPresident for his signature. But before we do that, I would like to \nhear from the majority leader if he believes that he will be in a \nposition before the year ends to revisit this question and help us \nreach a more equitable resolution.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I want to echo the comments of my colleagues. As the \nchairman of the HELP Subcommittee on Retirement Security and Aging, I \nhave been working on pension reform legislation for the last year and a \nhalf. I believe it is essential that the Senate pass legislation this \nweek that will strengthen defined benefit and multiemployer plans and \nthat will encourage retirement savings by making the retirement \nprovisions of EGTTRA permanent. And while I view this bill as an \nimprovement over the bill the Senate passed last fall, with the \nelimination of the provision that used credit rating to determine at-\nrisk funding status, I believe that this bill's airline relief \nprovisions are greatly inferior to those of the Senate-passed bill. As \nmy colleagues who spoke before me made clear, this is unacceptable and \nwill need to be fixed when we return from the August recess.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I join my colleagues from Ohio and the senior Senator \nfrom Texas in their comments regarding H.R. 4, the Pension Protection \nAct. While providing the airline industry with relief, this bill does \nso unevenly and undercuts the ability of Continental Airlines and \nAmerican Airlines to compete in a global economy. These Texas airlines \nhave neither frozen their pension plans nor filed for bankruptcy. As \nSenator Voinovich stated, the airline industry operates on thin profit \nmargins and disadvantaging two profitable airlines has ramifications \nnot only for the airline industry, but also for consumers and airline \nemployees. I believe it is crucial that Congress revisits this issue \nand provides more equitable relief for all airlines and not just a few.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I, too, want to echo the comments of my colleagues. I \nshare their concern in regard to the issue that they have raised.\n  Mr. FRIST. I appreciate the comments of my colleagues. This pension \nbill--while not technically a conference report--essentially represents \nthe bipartisan and bicameral agreement reached by House and Senate \npension conferees after many months of negotiation. I am aware of the \nSenators' concern about the interest rate issue; I have had other \nSenators approach me as well.\n  Although we are not in a position to amend the bill before us, I can \npromise the Senators that I will continue to work with them on this \nissue after we return from the August recess. Until the Senate has had \nan opportunity to more fully examine the issues involved in this \ncomplex matter, we should consider it an issue that requires further \ndiscussion. As such, I think this issue needs to be reviewed further \nthis year to assure an equitable result, recognizing of course that the \nHouse would have to agree to any changes we might propose.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the leader for his comments and his offer of \nassistance. I am told that the House majority leadership is aware of \nthis matter and has given a commitment to work with interested \ncolleagues to reach a resolution that assures no bias on the part of \nCongress toward any of the four airlines involved in this issue.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will vote against the Pension \nProtection Act. While there are many constructive provisions in the \nbill, the package is deeply flawed in at least two respects. First, it \nwill add to our already massive government debt. Thanks in large part \nto the expensive tax provisions that were added, the legislation will \nadd another $66 billion over the next 10 years to the already massive \ndebt with which we are burdening our children and grandchildren. To add \ninsult to that injury, most of that cost stems from savings incentive \nprovisions that overwhelmingly benefit those who least need it. The \nprovisions that raise the contribution limits on tax-preferred savings \naccounts benefit only 1 in 16 households, and only 1 in 100 households \nwith incomes under $50,000. If we want to encourage more savings, and \nwe should, there are far better ways to do it.\n  The second matter that raises significant concerns is the so-called \nred zone\n\n[[Page S8759]]\n\nprovision which permits pension plans to cut the vested pension \nbenefits of workers. Allowing a worker's vested benefits to be cut is \nunprecedented and grossly unfair. If workers are told that they may \ntake early retirement at a certain level of earned pension, that \npromise should not be broken. But under this bill, the financial future \non which some families were planning can now come crashing down on \nthem. Retirement benefits which were promised to them and on which they \nwere relying may now be taken away. And make no mistake; if Congress \npermits earned benefits to be taken, they will be taken.\n  There is a clear need for pension reform, and many of the provisions \nin this bill make sense. But I cannot vote for a measure that is so \nirresponsible for the fiscal future of our Nation and the personal \neconomies of thousands of workers who will soon retire.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 has been \na long time coming. In the Senate, the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee and the Finance Committee reported pension \nlegislation last year. The full Senate passed pension legislation in \nNovember of 2005, The House passed pension legislation in December of \n2005.\n  We had to reconcile those bills, which was no small achievement, and \nthen we had to consider the real concerns that some of our colleagues \nhad about the impact of this bill in their States. But we got it done.\n  We had our differences, but ultimately we agreed more than we \ndisagreed. We understood the fundamental problem and sought to solve it \nthrough genuine bipartisan negotiations. We saw that our defined \nbenefit pension system was in dire straits. Too many companies had \nseverely underfunded pension plans. Companies had made promises to \ntheir employees, promises that those employees were depending on for \ntheir retirement. But the companies were falling short on those \npromises.\n  This was not good for the bottom-line of the Pension Benefit Guaranty \nCorporation, PBGC, which is now, as the result of several high profile \nbankruptcies, running at a considerable deficit. This was not good for \nemployees, who in the event of plan termination would receive dimes on \nthe dollar for their pension plans. And ultimately, it was not good for \nthe American people, who might have been stuck holding the bag if the \nPBGC was unable to meet its obligations.\n  We had to act to fix this. We had to ensure that companies were \nputting their money where their mouths were. If they made pension \npromises, they had to keep them, They had to fund their plans.\n  And this bill requires them to do just that.\n  It was not easy.\n  The conference committee assembled to reconcile House and Senate \ndifferences was incredibly unwieldy. We had multiple chairmen involved \nin both the House and the Senate. It was an important enough issue for \nAmerican workers, American taxpayers, and the American economy that \nleadership from both the House and the Senate were involved in the \nnegotiations. Not only Republicans and Democrats, but even the House \nand the Senate, did not see eye to eye on all of the issues. And our \ndecisions would impact the business plans of some of our country's \ngreatest corporations, the future of the defined benefit pension \nsystem, and the future retirement of American workers.\n  But we did it. The final result of all these negotiations is a good \nbill.\n  In short, we are going to require companies to fund 100 percent of \ntheir pension liabilities. This makes sense. Under current law, they \nare only required to fund 90 percent of their liabilities. I think that \nit makes sense to most Americans that if you make a promise, you should \nkeep that promise, and companies should be funding the plans that they \nhave promised to their employees.\n  At the same time, we recognize that these new obligations could prove \na hardship for many. So we have allowed companies with underfunded \nplans 7 years to make up their pension shortfalls. And for the \nfinancially struggling airlines, the opportunity to make up for their \npension underfunding will be extended from ten to seventeen years.\n\n  And we are going to severely curtail the practice of promising new \nbenefits for tomorrow when you cannot even keep the promises you have \nalready made. Employers with pension plans less than 80 percent funded \nwill not be able to promise future additional benefits unless the \nearlier benefits are paid for.\n  We shore up the multi-employer plans, which have unique funding \nproblems.\n  We provide legal clarity to hybrid ``cash balance'' plans that have \nelements of both defined benefit and defined contribution plans.\n  Firms that administer 401(k) plans for their employers will be able \nto provide investment advice to employees, so long as that advice is \nbased on an independently certified and audited computer model.\n  And to encourage personal saving for retirement, this bill will allow \ncompanies to automatically enroll workers in 401(k) plans.\n  This bill makes several tax incentives that encourage retirement \nsavings permanent. Most importantly, Americans can remain confident \nthat they will be able to rely on the increased 401(k) and IRA \ncontribution limits established in 2001 and scheduled to expire in \n2010.\n  This is not a perfect bill. But it is a real achievement.\n  Not only our pension system, but our entire retirement system, will \nbe better off as a result of it.\n  And I want to congratulate my colleague and fellow conferee, Chairman \nEnzi, for being able to bring everyone together in the end. I want to \nthank my colleague and fellow conferee, Chairman Grassley, for his \npersistence.\n  Our pension system was broken. Critics might complain that nothing \ngets done in Washington, but our pension system is busted, and tonight, \nthrough tough bipartisan and bicameral work, we went a long way towards \nfixing it.\n  It is late in an election year, and it says a good deal about our \ncountry that we could put our differences aside and tackle this \nimportant issue.\n  The lives of American retirees, and the health of American industry, \nwill be better as a result.\n  Mr. Akaka. Mr. President, today I will vote not against pension \nreform but against the unfair tactics being used by the majority \nleadership in Congress. As a representative of my State of Hawaii, I \nmust ensure that the voices of the people of Hawaii are heard and that \ntheir rights are not infringed upon or forgotten. This is an important \ndistinction to make at this time because the vote that I cast today is \nin support of the rights of every member in Congress and the people \nthey represent.\n  It is my understanding that the House and Senate conferees were close \nto an agreement on the conference report to H.R. 2830, the Pension \nProtection Act of 2005, but without notification, the House leadership \nintroduced H.R. 4. While this measure does include many of the \ndecisions made by the conferees, and is in some cases an improvement \nfrom the measures passed by the House and Senate, I must vehemently \nobject to the process that the House leadership used. In looking to our \nfuture, I must ensure that the process we follow in the Congress does \nnot negate the voices of the minority.\n  When the House leadership introduced H.R. 4 and then called for a \nvote on the measure, they sent a loud and clear message on how future \nmeasures may be considered by Congress. Supporting such a process would \nallow the majority to believe that they do not have to listen to \nanyone's concern. Rather than negotiating on legislation with all the \nconferees in order to amicably resolve any differences, we find \nourselves looking from the outside in. This is no way in which to \nensure that the ideals and beliefs for all will be given the due \nprocess of consideration that everyone deserves.\n  For these reasons, I am voting against H.R. 4, again, not because I \nam against pension reform and ensuring that working men and women \nretain their benefits and pensions, but against the majority \nleadership's efforts to nullify our voices. I believe that the \nconferees to H.R. 2830 were close to an agreement and should have been \nallowed to complete action to develop a true compromise piece of \nlegislation.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Pension\n\n[[Page S8760]]\n\nProtection Act. This has been a long process, but I am glad we were \nable to produce a bill that provides retirement security to millions of \nAmericans while at the same time protects the taxpayers. These reforms \nprovide tough rules to ensure that employers will keep their pension \npromises.\n  I would like to thank my colleague from Georgia, Senator Isakson, for \nall his hard work throughout this process. I appreciate it, and I know \nthe folks back in Georgia appreciate it.\n  Many companies and their employees in my home State of Georgia \nsupport this legislation and will benefit from its provisions. For \nexample, Kroger has grocery stores all over Georgia and employs 18,000 \nfolks across the State, who are depending on their pensions when they \nretire. General Motors also has a large presence in Georgia with almost \n14,000 retirees and 3,500 employees, many of whom are covered by a \ndefined benefit pension plan. The United Parcel Service, UPS, is \nheadquartered in Atlanta, GA, and over 127,000 of its employees \nparticipate in multiemployer pension plans.\n  The airline industry in particular has taken some economic hits over \nthe years, and I am pleased that Congress was able to provide critical \nprovisions for the airlines, ensuring that they will get the time they \nneed to fulfill their pension obligations.\n  Delta Airlines is headquartered in Georgia, and has a longstanding \nhistory of service to passengers throughout the world and has been an \nexemplary corporate citizen. Like many other hard-working Americans, \nDelta's some 91,000 employees and retirees have devoted years of work \nand time to their employer.\n  While our airlines are in a unique situation, many of them like Delta \nmaintain a strong commitment to keep the pension promises they made to \ntheir employees and retirees.\n  I would like to close by reiterating why we are here today: American \nworkers deserve to know their pensions will be there when they retire. \nWith the passage of this conference report, we can ease the fears of \nmillions of employees and retirees by taking the steps necessary to \nhelp ensure that pension promises will be kept and employers, not the \ntaxpayers, will be held accountable.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 4, the Pension \nProtection Act. This bill is not a conference report, and I am troubled \nby the way that the House circumvented the process and endangered swift \nenactment of this important legislation. However, the bill that will \nsoon be before the Senate does reflect the carefully negotiated \nagreement of the conferees and enjoys broad bipartisan support.\n  Our goal is to strengthen traditional pensions, which have been an \nimportant source of retirement income for hard-working Americans. \nUnfortunately, these pensions have been on the decline, as companies \nreplace them with 401(k)s that shift risk to individual workers and \ngenerally do not guarantee retirement income for life. We must ensure \nthat traditional pensions remain a viable option for companies and at \nthe same time ensure that companies keep their promises and do not dump \ntheir plans on the Government at taxpayer expense.\n  This compromise strikes the right balance of requiring companies to \ncontribute enough to their pension plans, without discouraging them \nfrom maintaining their plans. The bill enacts the commonsense \nrequirement that companies must fully fund their plans, so that they \ncan keep their promises to the 34 million workers and retirees who rely \non their hard-earned benefits. It allows companies to put in more money \nwhen times are good. It also provides relief to Delta and Northwest, \nwho have said that they will be forced to dump their plans if Congress \ndoes not enact this bill soon.\n  Aside from reforming traditional pensions, the bill also includes \nimportant provisions to boost retirement savings. Most importantly, it \nimproves and makes permanent the saver's credit, which helps low- and \nmoderate-income workers save. It encourages companies to automatically \nenroll workers in 401(k) plans and makes pensions more portable. And it \nprovides protections to workers in the wake of the Enron accounting \nscandal.\n  While this bill is not perfect, I believe that it will go a long way \ntoward improving the retirement security of all Americans, and I \ntherefore support its enactment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, last November I cast one of only two votes \nagainst the Senate's version of pension reform. One of my primary \nconcerns with that bill was that companies trying to do right by their \nworkers would be unfairly penalized. I was concerned that on balance, \nthat bill did more to drive companies away from offering guaranteed \nbenefit pension plans than it did to strengthen the system. But the \nbill before us today is much improved, and I will support it.\n  Let me state upfront that it is through a highly unusual maneuver \nthat we are taking up this issue in the form of a new bill sent over \nfrom the House last week rather than as a final House-Senate conference \nreport. As part of their ongoing efforts to ram through a reckless \nnear-repeal of the estate tax, House Republicans hi-jacked the pension \nconference process to remove a package of widely supported tax breaks \nso they could be paired up with their estate tax proposal in another \nbill. The abuse of process involved in that maneuver is serious.\n  But regardless of political games, defined-benefit pensions are \nfacing a crisis today and reforms are needed to make sure that retirees \nreceive the benefits they were promised. We need to make sure that \ncompanies are required to adequately back up the promises they have \nmade to their workers. At the same time, we should make sure that \nreforms are designed to encourage the recovery and strengthening, \nrather than the termination, of underfunded and vulnerable pension \nplans.\n  Striking this delicate balance is not easy. I am pleased that two \nmisguided provisions from the Senate bill were dropped in the \nconference negotiations that are reflected in this bill. The first of \nthose two provisions would have required companies with solid pension \nplans but who also had poor credit ratings to use actuarial assumptions \nthat require them to put away unnecessarily high amounts of money into \ntheir pension trusts. I am glad that this bill uses a more direct \nmeasure of a pension plan's financial health to determine whether \nadditional money needs to be put into the plan.\n  The second provision of concern dealt with an actuarial method known \nas ``smoothing.'' Under current law, the amount of money companies are \nrequired to put into their pension plans is determined by using a four-\nyear weighted average of the values of pension assets and/or \nliabilities. The Senate bill would have shortened smoothing to 12 \nmonths, which would have added significant volatility for companies \nwhen they are determining how much money they need to set aside for the \npension plans. The bill before us today changes smoothing to a 2-year \ntime period. I would have preferred the 3-year average proposed in the \noriginal House bill, but the 2 years in today's bill is an obvious \nimprovement over the Senate's original 1 year.\n  Based on my concerns with these credit rating and smoothing \nprovisions, Senator Voinovich and I wrote a letter to the House-Senate \npension bill conference committee members, urging them to consider the \npotentially adverse impact these provisions could have on companies \nthat offer defined benefit pension plans and the employees and retirees \nwho are counting on the stable pensions they have been promised. I was \npleased that one-third of the Senate joined us in signing this letter, \nand I appreciate the conferees addressing our concerns.\n  I am also pleased that this bill, like the Senate bill, will give \nairlines extra time to fund their pension obligations. I am told that \nthis action means that Northwest and Delta will keep their plans when \nthey emerge from bankruptcy, rather than turning their obligations over \nto the Government's pension insurer, the Pension Benefit Guaranty \nCorporation, PBGC. Passing the airline provision is a win-win. The \ncompanies should now not dump their plans on the Government, and the \nairlines' employees and retirees will get to keep their full earned \npensions.\n  I am pleased this bill includes four tariff-related bills I authored \nthat will help Michigan companies become more competitive.\n  I am also pleased that the bill encourages companies to use automatic\n\n[[Page S8761]]\n\nenrollment and automatic increase in 401(k) pension plans to ensure \nthat workers save more.\n  In addition, this bill includes long-overdue reforms to multiemployer \npension plan law. These reforms will allow multiemployer pension plans \nto address any short-term funding crises as well as add new flexibility \nto advance fund and guard against a future crisis. Unfortunately, the \nbill also takes the unwise step of allowing underfunded multi-employer \npension plans to cut benefits that workers have already earned. While I \nunderstand that shared sacrifice may be necessary in some instances, \ntaking away earned benefits is unfair, and I hope this does not set a \nprecedent for future pension laws.\n  I am also disappointed that this bill does nothing to pay for making \npermanent provisions enacted in the 2001 tax law to expand tax-\npreferred retirement and education savings accounts. The conference \nagreement makes these tax cuts permanent without offsetting their cost. \nAccording to Joint Committee on Taxation estimates, making these tax \ncuts permanent would cost $52.6 billion between 2007 and 2016. We are \ndeep in a deficit ditch and already each American citizen's share of \nthe debt is almost $29,000. Instead of just adding to our deep fiscal \ntroubles, we should be closing down abusive tax shelters and offshore \ntax havens and coming up with other ways to pay for any further tax \ncuts.\n  While this bill is less than perfect, on balance I will support it \nbecause of the critical need to address retirement security for \nmillions of Americans.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 would \nstrengthen private pension plan funding and improve the financial \nposition of the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation, PBGC. While the \nbill reflects difficult compromises, it is important that we act now to \npreserve the financial health of defined benefit pensions.\n  This legislation is an important step toward protecting the pensions \nof working Americans. Today's workers will live longer and work longer \nbut also spend more time in retirement than ever before, so it is vital \nthat the pension benefits promised to workers will actually be there \nwhen they retire.\n  The crisis in private pensions is just part of the growing problem of \neconomic insecurity for many Americans. Although the economy has been \ngrowing, job growth has been modest, wages are not keeping pace with \ninflation, income inequality is growing, employer-provided health \ninsurance coverage is falling, and private pensions are increasingly in \njeopardy. Soaring prices for gasoline, home heating, health care, and \ncollege tuition is squeezing the take home pay of most workers. Many \nworkers have little left over for retirement savings after making ends \nmeet for basic living expenses.\n  Meanwhile, many employers shift the risk and responsibility of \nadequate retirement funds onto workers, as retirement prospects are \nmore uncertain than ever. Twenty years ago, most workers with a pension \nplan could expect to receive a defined benefit based on years of \nservice and salary. Today, defined contribution plans--which shift most \nof the investment risk and responsibility onto workers--have become the \ndominant form of pension coverage.\n  Despite the shift away from traditional pensions, defined benefit \nplans remain a critical source of retirement support, with 44 million \nworkers and retirees relying on such plans as a source of stable \nretirement income. However, as we have seen with recent pension \nterminations in the airline industry, the real risk of defined benefit \nplan defaults further exacerbates workers' uncertainty and concern \nabout their retirement prospects.\n  This bill tackles the growing problem of employers not setting aside \nenough money to cover their pension obligations. The Pension Benefit \nGuarantee Corporation, PBGC, estimates that total underfunding in PBGC-\ninsured pension plans is about $450 billion, more than $100 billion of \nwhich is in plans sponsored by financially weak companies that are at \nreasonable risk of default.\n  However, the PBGC, which is the backstop to the defined benefit \npension system, has funding issues of its own due to increased defaults \nby employers. At the end of 2005, the PBGC reported a cumulative \ndeficit of $22.8 billion in its single-employer program. While the PBGC \nhas sufficient assets to pay benefit obligations for a number of years, \nwithout changes in funding, the agency will eventually run out of \nmoney. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that PBGC's cumulative \ndeficit will increase to $87 billion over the next 10 years, and \nsuggests that there is a significant likelihood that all of PBGC's \nassets will be exhausted within the next 20 years.\n  The Pension Protection Act would tighten the funding rule for defined \nbenefit plans by requiring that plans fund 100 percent of their \nliabilities, up from 90 percent under current law. Companies with \nunderfunded plans would have seven years to make up any funding \nshortfall. Financially troubled airlines with underfunded plans would \nhave 17 years to become fully funded.\n  The legislation would limit the use of credit balances to prevent \ncompanies with unfunded plans from avoiding plan contributions, \nprohibit companies with underfunded plans from increasing future \nbenefits, and require an accurate accounting of each plan's true \nfinancial condition. Plans would also be required to provide more \ninformation about their current funding status to plan participants and \nbeneficiaries.\n  In addition, the bill contains important, long overdue disclosure \nrules to protect the pension of workers, to avoid a situation like that \nof the Enron workers who lost their entire life savings. Under this \nbill, companies would be required to give workers quarterly benefit \nstatements that show the value of their assets, and explain their right \nto and the importance to diversify their investments. The companies \nwould also be required to give their employees a range of options for \ninvesting their 401(k) plans rather than just the in company stock and \nallow workers to sell the stock after three years.\n  A few of the other notable features of this bill are provisions that \nencourage low- and moderate-income workers to save for retirement by \nextending the ``saver's credit,'' and requiring automatic enrollment in \ndefined contribution pensions such as 401(k) plans.\n  The saver's credit provides a permanent non-refundable tax credit to \ntaxpayers with incomes below certain limits if they make contributions \nto an IRA or an employer-sponsored plan. Early evidence indicates that \nthe saver's credit has increased participation rates in retirement \nplans. The effects of the credit are limited, however, by its \nnonrefundability, the sharp phase-down of the credit rate for moderate-\nincome taxpayers, and the lack of indexing of the income limits. This \nbill would address one of the current problems with the credit by \nindexing the income thresholds starting in 2007.\n  The Pension Protection Act would encourage companies to use automatic \nenrollment. Under automatic enrollment, companies can enroll employees \nin contributory pension plans and defer a specified percentage of their \nearnings into an account. Employees are free to opt out of the plan if \nthey do not wish to participate. Under current rules, employees must \nmake an active decision to participate in contributory plans.\n  Studies show that automatic enrollment dramatically increases \nparticipation rates. The increase is particularly likely to benefit \nyounger workers and low-income workers, who tend to have the lowest \nparticipation rates.\n  One concern I have is that this legislation extends the higher \ncontribution limits on 401(k) and IRA contributions enacted in 2001, \nwhich would do little to encourage retirement saving while adding over \n$36 billion to the budget deficit over the next 10 years. While tax-\nadvantaged retirement saving by low- and moderate-income individuals is \nlikely to represent new saving, high-income individuals are more likely \nto use expanded savings opportunities to shift existing savings from \ntaxable accounts to tax-advantaged accounts. In its analysis of a \nsimilar proposal in the President's FY 2004 budget, CBO concluded that \nexpanding tax-free savings accounts would have little effect on \npersonal saving.\n  Nonetheless, the Pension Protection Act makes progress toward \nensuring that workers will receive the retirement benefits they have \nearned. We must continue work to improve our pensions system to ensure \nthat Americans who work hard their entire lives\n\n[[Page S8762]]\n\nhave the financial security they deserve. Part of this work will be to \nrevisit some of the elements of this bill as well as to encourage \nemployers to continue to offer retirement plans to hardworking \nAmericans. The dilemma is that it took the majority 8 months to bring \nthis bill forward and without it, more plans and workers are \njeopardized. Congress must continue concerted efforts to address the \nreal needs of American workers.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, first, I want to thank Chairman \nGrassley, Senator Kennedy, and Chairman Enzi for their hard work and \ncooperation on this bill.\n  I like the final product. It strikes a balance between getting plans \nfunded and not forcing employers out of the defined benefit pension \nsystem. It provides certainty for cash balance plans. It makes certain \nthat workers can diversify their investments out of employer stock. It \nmakes changes that will help workers save for their retirements. And it \nassures that workers and retirees will receive clear information about \nthe health of their plans and their individual situations.\n  I don't like for one minute, however, the process that got us here. \nChairman Grassley and I worked very closely to include tax extenders on \nthis bill. We had an agreement with the House to do so. We were ready \nto sign the conference agreement. Instead, we had the rug pulled out \nfrom under us. The pension bill now comes to us without the extenders.\n  There is a reason for the conference process. It was a process that \nwas working. I think that we should have continued down that path.\n  But as I said, this is a good pension bill of which we can be proud. \nWe need to pass it.\n  I will not go through all the provisions in the bill. They are too \nnumerous to do that. But there are some points that I want to \nhighlight.\n  First let me address single-employer pension plan funding. When I \nspoke last November about the pension bill that was then pending in the \nSenate, I asked my colleagues to remember that we are here to protect \nworkers' pension benefits. That has been our goal from day one. And \nthat is what this bill does.\n  The current system is broken. The Pension Benefit Guaranty \nCorporation--the Federal corporation that guarantees defined benefit \npension benefits--has a $23 billion deficit. The existing rules and \ntemporary congressional fixes have created unpredictable funding \nrequirements. As a result, employers are freezing their plans as a \npreliminary to leaving the defined benefit system altogether. And many \nview defined benefit plans as an antiquated vehicle for delivering \nretirement benefits.\n  How do we fix the system? We would all like to get the plans fully \nfunded. We would all like not to increase funding requirements too much \nfor employers who cannot afford it. We would all like to see defined \nbenefit plans continue. That is especially true for the 44 million \nAmericans now receiving retirement benefits from defined benefit plans \nor earning benefits under them.\n  Addressing these goals required a delicate balance. The balance that \nwe struck is one of which I am proud. It reflects difficult compromises \nby all parties. There is no perfect answer here. But I think that we \ncame as close as we could.\n  Employers will not be able to make promises that they don't fund. \nEmployers and unions will not be able to negotiate for benefit \nincreases without paying for them. Workers will have to push for better \nfunding if they want to continue to earn benefits.\n  The medicine may not taste very good. But it is necessary to keep the \npatient alive.\n  At the same time, there are some patients that are so sick that they \nneed more than harsh-tasting medicine. They need some understanding and \na chance to recover. We are giving that chance to the airlines. Maybe \nthat way we can avoid the harm that will come to the workers and \nretirees--and the PBGC--if the plans terminate.\n  Second, let me address cash balance plans. We have been struggling \nwith the difficult problems of a new form of defined benefit plan \ncalled a ``cash balance plan'' for many years. Most pension experts \nrecognize the cash balance design and other hybrid plan designs as the \nfuture of the defined benefit system. And that future is in limbo until \nwe provide certainty as to the governing rules. Yet there is a real \nconcern about age discrimination and what happens to workers who get \ncaught up in the switch from a traditional plan to a cash balance plan.\n  This bill once again strikes a balance. It is a balance that is not \nlikely to make anyone completely happy. We have dealt with the law \ngoing forward. We intend no inference to what the rules were prior to \nenactment. We will leave the past to the courts.\n  But in the future, employers and workers will know the guiding \nprinciples. I expect that as a result, we will see new life in the cash \nbalance world. And we also make sure that workers are protected.\n  Third, let me address diversification. While defined benefit plans \nare important, many Americans today receive retirement benefits from \ntheir defined contribution plans. What a tragedy it was in Enron and \nother situations when workers had their entire retirement wrapped up in \nEnron stock. They could not get out even if they wanted to.\n  The new law will require plans to allow workers to diversify. Workers \nwon't have to. It will be their choice. But they will have that choice.\n  Fourth, automatic enrollment: I am proud that this bill included a \nprovision that I have been pushing for some time to allow 401(k) plans \nand 403(b) arrangements to automatically enroll workers unless they opt \nout. This means that the workers' salaries will be reduced to put \nsavings into the retirement plan unless the worker instructs the \nemployer not to do this withholding. And we let employers automatically \nincrease the amount saved each year unless the worker says no. Many \nstudies have found that this ``opt-out'' approach significantly \nincreases workers'' retirement savings.\n  Fifth, let me address the saver's credit and permanence of provisions \nfrom the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, \nwhich people call EGTRRA. The bill makes permanent the EGTRRA savings \nprovisions affecting plans and IRAs. I worked very closely with \nChairman Grassley to get the savings provisions included in EGTRRA in \nthe first place. And I am very happy that this bill makes them \npermanent.\n  Perhaps more importantly, we made the saver's credit permanent. The \nsaver's credit would have expired at the end of 2006. And for the first \ntime, we indexed the saver's credit so that worker eligibility will not \nshrink over time because of inflation.\n  Sixth, we include the tax court modernization package. This package \nhas passed Finance Committee three times. It is designed to help bring \nparity between the tax court and Article III courts. And it will \nmodernize the tax court's pension system. This package is long overdue.\n  Seventh, we include important incentives for charitable giving. These \ninclude measures to promote land conservation. And these include a \nprovision to encourage IRA rollovers to charitable organizations.'\n  I have been working since 2001 to allow ranchers and farmers to claim \na special tax incentive to ensure their valuable production land \npreserved for generations of Montanans in the future. In fact, my first \nhearing as chairman of the Finance Committee in 2001 was on tax \nincentives for land conservation.\n  There are numerous other provisions in this 900-plus page bill of \nwhich we can all be proud. We have taken on a very difficult and \ncomplex subject and struck the right balance. I just regret that we \ncould not do it in the proper way and finished the conference. There \nwere important provisions included in the conference bill that are not \nincluded in the pension bill before us. We all know what they are and \nthe reasons they are not included. I am sorry that the Senate process \nhas come to such a sad state.\n  But after nearly 3 years, several hearings, and countless missed \ndeadlines, the Senate is about to pass a monumental pension bill. It \nwill enhance retirement security for millions of Americans.\n  There are many who deserve thanks for this legislation. I want to \nthank\n\n[[Page S8763]]\n\nChairman Enzi and Senator Kennedy from the Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions Committee. They provided excellent leadership and cooperation.\n  I want to thank their staffs, many of whom spent sleepless nights \ngetting this work done. In particular, I thank Diann Howland, David \nThompson, Greg Dean, Portia Wu, Holly Fechner, and Terri Holloway. They \nplayed an important role developing the retirement security provisions \nin this bill.\n  I also to thank my good friend Senator Grassley, the chairman of the \nFinance Committee, for his commitment to the retirement security of \nAmericans. I want to thank some staff members in particular. I \nappreciate the cooperation we received from the Republican staff, \nespecially Kolan Davis, Mark Prater, John O'Neill, Dean Zerbe, \nElizabeth Paris, Chris Javens, Cathy Barre, Anne Freeman, Elizabeth \nGoff and Nick Wyatt.\n  I thank the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation and Senate \nLegislative Counsel for their service, including Jim Fransen, Mark \nMathiesen, Stacey Kern, Mark McGunagle, Carolyn Smith, Patricia \nMcDermott, Nicole Flax, Roger Colinvaux, Ron Schultz and Gordon Clay.\n  I also thank my staff for their tireless effort and dedication, \nincluding Russ Sullivan, Pat Heck, Bill Dauster, Jon Selib, Melissa \nMueller, Rebecca Baxter, and Ryan Abraham. I also thank our dedicated \nfellows, Stuart Sirkin, Tiffany Smith, Mary Baker, and Tom Louthan.\n  I especially want to express my sincere gratitude to Judy Miller. Her \nextraordinary efforts and contributions on this legislation went over \nand above the call of duty. I hold her in the highest esteem. And I \ncan't thank her enough for her counsel and professionalism.\n  Finally, I thank our hardworking law clerks and interns: Christal \nEdwards, Justin Kraske, Joseph Adams, Tom Duppong, Jonathan Lebe, \nRobert Little, Chris Polhemus, Diana Ramos, Tara Rose, John Schiltz, \nThad Seegmiller, Gwen Stoltz, and Matthew Wergin.\n  This legislation really was a team effort. And the product will do a \nlot of good. I am glad that we have finally reached the day where we \ncan look forward to it soon becoming law.\n  A fair and good explanation of the bill can be found in The Technical \nExplanation of HR 4 prepared by the Joint Committee on \nTaxation.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Pension 7 \nProtection Act of 2006.\n  Every Member of the U.S. Senate should be proud to support this bill.\n  This is a bill that is about one thing--improving the retirement \nsecurity of all Americans.\n  It been a long road to get here.\n  There were times, I will tell you, when I wondered if we would ever \nget here.\n  But the fact that we are here today shows that when people stick to a \ngoal and work together, you can get great things done for the American \npeople.\n  I want to commend Chairman Enzi for his outstanding leadership and \nhis perseverance in leading us here today.\n  I can tell you that it wasn't an easy job.\n  I am also very pleased to commend the great work of my colleague and \ngood friend, Senator Baucus, who was my partner in the Finance \nCommittee and all the way through conference on this legislation.\n  We worked together and our staffs worked together.\n  I wish he could be here with me today to see final passage of this \nlegislation, but as we all know, he is attending to family matters that \nare far more important than anything we could be doing here in the U.S. \nSenate.\n  I also want to thank Senator Kennedy, who worked tirelessly on this \nbill and was critical to the bipartisan bill before us.\n  Why is this a good bill?\n  I could spend all night talking about all of the positive reforms in \nthis bill, but don't worry--I am not going to do that at 10 o'clock \nhere tonight.\n  But I do want to highlight a few parts of this legislation that will \nmake Americans more secure in their retirement.\n  First and foremost, this bill will ensure that American workers can \ndepend on their pensions. They will know that their pension will \nactually be there for them when they retire.\n  This bill will also protect the PBGC from absorbing billions of \ndollars in pension liabilities from bankrupt airlines and give those \nairlines' employees an opportunity to receive the full pension they've \nbeen promised.\n  This bill will protect workers from the next Enron by prohibiting \nemployers from stuffing company stock in their 401(k) plans.\n  This bill will make permanent the bipartisan retirement savings \nprovisions from the 2001 tax relief bill--increased 401(k) and IRA \nlimits, a permanent low-income Savers' Credit, greater portability of \nretirement assets, and a wide array of other pro-savings initiatives.\n  These provisions are vital to building a ``savers' society,'' and I \nam proud that these provisions originated in the Senate Finance \nCommittee and were included in the 2001 tax bill at the insistence of \nmyself and Senator Baucus.\n  This bill will also encourage greater participation in retirement \nplans by promoting automatic enrollment arrangements.\n  These are just a few of the key reforms in this bill. This is \nlegislation that every Member of the Senate can truly be proud to \nsupport.\n  I look forward to seeing the President sign it into law.\n  I would like to incorporate by reference a technical explanation \nbeing prepared by the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation that \ndescribes the legislative intent with respect to H.R. 4, the Pension \nProtection Act of 2006. This document expresses our understanding of \nthe provisions in the bill, and it will be a useful reference in \nunderstanding the legislation. Chairman Thomas also made a statement on \nthe floor of the House of Representatives last Friday that he had \nrequested this technical explanation. The technical explanation will be \npublished by the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation as document \nnumber JCX-38-06, Technical Explanation of H.R. 4, The Pension \nProtection Act of 2006, as passed by the House on July 28, 2006, and as \nconsidered by the Senate on August 3, 2006.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

It is a very important bill, and \nit has been a long road with a lot of twists and a lot of difficulties. \nThey all got ironed out with a very convincing vote.\n  I appreciate all the people who participated in this effort and were \nable to lend their expertise, their knowledge, their background, and \nput together something that will solve the pension difficulties for \nthis country.\n  I particularly thank Senator Kennedy, who is the ranking member on my \ncommittee. He worked with me through the drafting in committee, getting \nit through committee, then merging it with the Finance Committee, then \ngetting it through the Senate as a whole, and then serving on the \nconference committee to get it all ironed out. He has been delightful \nto work with on this issue and other issues that deal with health, \neducation, labor, as well as the pension bill.\n  I thank Senators Grassley and Baucus for their extremely hard work. \nThey brought the finance piece, the tax part together. They are experts \nin that area. They work together extremely well and extremely hard. \nWithout their participation, this bill would not have been possible.\n  I appreciate everybody's commitment to the private pension system and \ntheir willingness to strive for solutions, not just to look at issues, \nand to make the tough decisions we had to make.\n  I also thank Senators DeWine and Mikulski, again. They started the \nhearings on this bill before we ever got to the bill part, the \ndrafting. They have worked together well on the aging issues of this \ncountry for a long time. They know them backward and forward.\n  As the bill went through the process, they made sure that specific \ninstances they were aware of were known, the details were known, and we \ncould consider ways to solve those as part of an entire package as \nopposed to piecemeal. They were extremely cooperative in working on it.\n  Through the final days of the conference committee, they were engaged \nin asking questions and making a difference for this bill. I can't say \nenough about Senators DeWine and Mikulski and their extraordinary work.\n  But there are many people who worked behind the scenes to get this \nbill completed. I thank all of my staff for their diligence, \ncommitment, expertise, and hard work. Since March, many of them have \nnot had a weekend off. They have spent 12, 16, 18 hours a day working \nthis bill. That is a huge commitment. I am sure a weight has been \nlifted from their backs. Without their expertise, we would not have \nbeen able to do it.\n  First off I would like to thank my staff director, Katherine McGuire. \nWithout her, this bill never would be enacted. She had extraordinary \nefforts with the committee and then the conference committee and was \nable to pull people together to get an agreement. A lot of times, it \nmeant not a compromise but finding a whole different way of doing it \nand engaging people and doing some research to find those other ways \nand even relying on some other committees to lend their expertise to do \nit. We made it through.\n  Greg Dean, our general counsel, played a central role in the \ninvestment advice and prohibited transactions bill language. That is a \nvery specialized part. He helped me on the Banking Committee when I was \nsubcommittee chairman there and then moved to this committee. He \nexpertly managed discussions throughout the process, and he brought \nvarious players together time and again to move the bill forward. It is \na very technical area, and it takes someone with that kind of technical \nexpertise to do it.\n  I thank Ilyse Schuman, my chief counsel for the committee. She was \nable to pull together all the legal issues and was able to talk on that \nlevel with all of the other Senators and Members of the House to pull \nthis off.\n  I thank Diann Howland, who is my pension policy director, who bravely \nagreed to come back to the Hill and take on her third major pension \nreform. In light of this, she brought a fresh perspective to the \ncomplex issues every day and has to be commended for leadership in \ngetting this bill done. She probably knows more about pensions than \nanybody I have ever met and has been a valuable resource, knowing the \nhistory as well as being able to move forward on a new bill and get \nsome things done that are different from what has been done before but \nthings that have preserved pensions for people.\n  David Thompson brought a superb understanding of the intricate and \ncomplex legislation issues to the table and has a unique ability to \nexplain these difficult issues in relatively few words and also explain \nsome of the charts that went along with them. Again, I want to thank \nAmy Angelier who works as my budget staffer and approps staffer and \npolicy adviser. She knows the intricacies of how the budget and the \nappropriations and the policy all have to fit together, whether it is \npensions or whether it is banking or whether it is the rest of the \nissues we cover under Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. She was on \ntop of each and every aspect of the budget aspects of this bill and \nhelped guide it to success.\n\n  Now, my staff didn't do this alone. My staff worked closely with the \nstaffs of my other Senate conferees, and those individuals deserve \nthanks. They are Michael Myers, Portia Wu, and Holly Fechner of Senator \nKennedy's HELP Committee staff; Kolan Davis, Mark Prater, John O'Neill, \nJudy Miller, Stu Sirkin, Russ Sullivan, Pat Heck, on the staff of the \nFinance Committee for Senators Grassley and Baucus.\n  I especially commend Mark Prater for his leadership over the last \nweek helping us to maneuver through troubled waters. He really knows \nthe tax issues and knows the interplay between the moving parts in that \nwhole area and was a tremendous help.\n  I would also like to thank the nonpartisan legislative counsels and \nthe staff from the Joint Committee on Taxation for their very long \nhours and professionalism. They had to be in with all of the different \ntimes as all of these meetings were going on. Every person with a \npension should join me in thanking Jim Fransen, Stacy Kern, Carolyn \nSmith, Patricia McDermott, and Nikole Flax.\n  Finally, I thank my chief of staff, Flip McConnaughey. He did an \nexcellent job holding the office together and keeping a focus on \nWyoming's specific issues when the pension conference kicked into full \ngear.\n  So I appreciate everybody's support of this legislation. I hope I \nhaven't left anybody out. There have been so many people who have been \ninvolved in this, as I said, for just countless hours. It has been an \nincredible commitment of time and effort and knowledge, and I really \nappreciate that because without the kind of teamwork that we had on \nthis, we would not have had the kind of approval we have.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, if I could have one minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. I just wanted to thank Chairman Enzi for his tremendous \nleadership. So many people have been thanked over the course of the \nnight, and it has been a very productive 4 weeks. But if you look at \nthe committee chairman, he has probably been the busiest just \noverseeing the greatest number of bills, and then on top of that, \nhaving a very challenging conference, as we have all seen. It started \nwith pensions, and for a period developed into about three or four \nother issues. I just wanted to thank him for his work, his tremendous \nwork, his dedication, his passion, his independent but dedicated \nthinking where he listened to everybody and to his staff who have been \ntremendous on this particular bill, a very difficult bill, the pensions \nbill.\n  So on behalf of all of us, we thank Chairman Enzi.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, after great effort by many people, the \nSenate has voted to agree to H.R. 4, the Pension Protection Act of \n2006.\n  Credit must go to the dedicated members of my staff, who spent many \nhours over many months working on the issues that ultimately led to \nthis bill. Kolan Davis, Mark Prater, John\n\n[[Page S8765]]\n\nO'Neill, Dean Zerbe, Elizabeth Paris, Chris Javens, Cathy Barre, Anne \nFreeman, Elizabeth Goff, and Nick Wyatt showed great dedication to the \ntasks before them.\n  As is usually the case, the cooperation of Senator Baucus and his \nstaff was extremely valuable. I particularly want to thank Russ \nSullivan, Patrick Heck, Bill Dauster, Judy Miller, Stuart Sirkin, Jon \nSelib, Melissa Mueller, Rebecca Baxter and Ryan Abraham.\n  I want to show my appreciation towards HELP Committee Chairman Enzi's \nstaff, including Katherine McGuire, Greg Dean, Diann Howland and David \nThompson. I want to thank Portia Wu and Holly Fechner along with the \nrest of HELP Committee Ranking Member Kennedy's staff. I also want to \nthank the staff of Finance Committee member conferees on the pension \nbill. They include Evan Liddiard, Brendan Dunn, Manny Rossman, Wes \nCoulam, Jennifer Perkins, Jen Vesey, Amy Barber, Steve Bailey, and \nJames Dennis.\n  I also want to mention Thomas Barthold, the acting chief of staff of \nthe Joint Committee on Taxation and his staff. The efforts of Carolyn \nSmith, Patricia McDermott, and Nicole Flax were invaluable. Roger \nColinvaux, Gordon Clay, and Ron Schultz provided great assistance with \nthe charitable provisions that are in the bill. I also want to thank \nTheresa Pattara, who worked on my staff as a legislative fellow, for \nher work on the charitable provisions.\n  Finally, I want to show my appreciation to the staff of Senate \nLegislative Counsel, including Jim Fransen, Mark Mathiesen, Stacey \nKern, and Mark McGunagle.\n  Mr. President, after great effort by many people, the Senate has \nvoted to agree to H.R. 4, the Pension Protection Act of 2006.\n  Credit must go to the dedicated members of my staff, who spent many \nhours over many months working on the issues that ultimately led to \nthis bill.

Mr. President, I understand the paper is in the process \nof being delivered to the desk on S. 843, so while that is happening, \nlet me just make some remarks about the legislation.\n  The legislation that I am calling up on behalf of myself and Senator \nDodd and the two leaders who have been outstanding in helping us bring \nthis bill to the floor tonight is the Combating Autism Act. I know \nSenator Enzi was just speaking, but I want to thank Senator Enzi and \nSenator Kennedy also and the entire HELP Committee. If you want to talk \nabout a team effort, this has been a tremendous team effort, starting \ninitially with Senator Dodd and myself and our staffs who have just \ndone an outstanding job.\n  I thank particularly on my staff Jen Vessey, who has just put in--I \nwon't say hours of time but days of time, in working together along \nwith Senator Dodd's staff and then subsequently the entire committee \nstaff; in particular, Senators Enzi and Kennedy's staff, as well as, as \nwe brought this to the process, Senator Frist and Senator Reid.\n  This team was committed to getting this bill done and passed before \nthe August break. We had many bumps along the way, but tonight, with a \nminor change in the bill, we are going to see this piece of legislation \npass and pass by unanimous consent.\n  I am very excited about all of the work that has been put in by the \nentire autism community. I think, as Senator Dodd will attest, there \nare very many arms of the autistic community, a lot of groups who have \na very wide variety of people with respect to how to deal with Federal \nlegislation regarding autism. But we were able to sit down and work \ntogether over months of time.\n  I thank some people in particular who have worked outside of the \nCongress, outside of the Halls of Congress: Bob and Suzanne Wright \ndeserve special recognition as grandparents of an autistic child for \ntheir tremendous effort in pulling together these outside groups, along \nwith Deirdre Imus, who, again, devoted an extraordinary amount of time \nand energy in bringing all of these disparate groups in the autism \ncommunity across the country together to work toward a common goal, and \nthat is to authorize an autism coordinator, authorize work and research \nto be done at NIH that looks into all of the issues regarding autism, \nincluding the causes of autism, how to best screen for autism, how to \nbest diagnose autism, and how to best treat autism.\n  It is one of the few disorders that I am aware of that is so \nprevalent in America, and we have very few good answers on any one of \nthose issues. It creates enormous amounts of frustration for parents \nand relatives and friends of children with autism that we just seem to \nhave no answers, and we see an ever-increasing population of autistic \nchildren with fewer and fewer answers on how to diagnose, screen, test, \nand treat these young children.\n  So tonight is a real landmark. It is a step forward for a community \nthat has been seeking someone to listen to them in Washington. It has \nbeen a real honor to work with Senator Dodd. He has just been terrific, \nincluding tonight, when we ran into a bump and he was able to smooth \nthat bump. We had one on our side. After lots of discussion, and thanks \nto the leader and his work here, we were able to deal with that, and \nnow we are in a situation where we can move forward and pass this \nimportant piece of legislation. I believe the paper work is now ready.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of Calendar No. 578, S. 843.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 843) to amend the Public Health Service Act to \n     combat autism through research, screening, intervention and \n     education.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill \nwhich was reported from the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions with an amendment to strike all after the enacting clause and \ninsert in lieu thereof the following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Combating Autism Act of \n     2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, before I offer the amendment, if Senator \nDodd would like to take a few minutes to speak.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will be very brief. The majority leader is \nhere, and my friend from Pennsylvania has very adequately--more than \nadequately--described the history of this legislation. It has been a \njourney of some time here to bring this legislation to the point we are \nthis evening, to the final adoption unanimously by this body. I am very \ngrateful, as well, to the chairman of our committee, Mike Enzi, who has \nbeen tremendously helpful, along with Senator Kennedy and other members \nof the committee who voted unanimously to report this bill out on a \nbipartisan basis.\n  As the Senator from Pennsylvania has pointed out, the majority leader \nand minority leader have been tremendously helpful, along with the \nmajority and minority leader staffs who have helped us on the Senate \nfloor work through some final little knots on this bill that had to be \nworked out before we could bring this bill to the consideration of the \nfull body.\n  There are some very special people who worked very hard. The autism \ncommunity is a large community. It is a diverse one. There are many \npoints of view that have been represented by various people. It has \nbeen critically important that there has been an effort to come \ntogether. They have done that in part because of the leadership of Bob \nand Suzanne Wright, who played a very instrumental role, who are \ngrandparents of an autistic child and who work tirelessly with the \norganization they helped found, Autism Speaks. Senator Santorum also \nmentioned Deirdre Imus, a constituent of mine in Connecticut, who is \ntenacious in her commitment to issues she gets involved in and has \ncertainly been tenacious on this one. If there were one individual \noutside of the Members and staff of this body who worked so hard on \nthis, she probably deserves it more than anyone for keeping the flame \nburning on this effort on behalf on the autism community.\n  Mr. President, 1 out of every 166 children in this country are born \nwith autism spectrum disorder. It is a growing\n\n[[Page S8769]]\n\nproblem, Mr. President. The problem has increased in my own State of \nConnecticut by close to 1,100 percent since 1993. We don't know exactly \nwhat causes this. But this bill will allow us to examine all \nquestions--and I mean every question--arising of what may be provoking \nthis rapid increase in autism. Clearly, our diagnosis, diagnostic \nefforts, are better today. But that doesn't explain to most of us why \nthe dramatic increases have occurred.\n  So we believe there may be other reasons out there that deserve full \nexamination and exploration. Certainly, looking at ways to treat this \nissue is also critically important, how to support these families who \nhave an autistic child. There is a tremendous amount of pressure on \nfamilies who are confronted with this issue. They handle it very well, \nand many of these families will tell you that while one may look at it \nfrom afar as a disability, in many cases you will be amazed how many \nview it as somehow a blessing in a way. I know that sounds strange to \nmany of my colleagues to hear this, but for families with autistic \nchildren, it is difficult, but it is impressive to see how well they \nhandle this. It is inspirational to watch how many families deal with \nthis issue.\n  So tonight is a special night. It is late. We have major bills we \nhave just passed on pension reform, and we are not suggesting this bill \nis more important than that bill in significance, but I want to tell \nyou something. To an awful lot of families out there tonight who don't \nknow anything about this late hour or what has happened here earlier, \nwe are making a difference in their lives, and we may make a huge \ndifference down the road in the lives of future children and families \nbecause we may get to the cause of this and make a difference in trying \nto stem the reach of autism spectrum disorder.\n  So I am deeply proud we have been involved. We hope we can get, of \ncourse, this bill signed into law fairly quickly. But, again, I thank \nmy colleagues. I thank, particularly, Senator Santorum, who has been \nterrific on this issue and who has been a chief sponsor with me, along \nwith the other Members whom I have mentioned.\n  In conclusion, hundreds of thousands of families across America \nstruggle each and every day with autism spectrum disorder, ASD, one of \nthe fastest- growing developmental disabilities in the United States. \nWhile we used to think of ASD as relatively rare, today it is diagnosed \nat a rate that is 10 times that of a decade ago. In my home State of \nConnecticut, we have witnessed an increase in diagnoses of ASD of close \nto 1,100 percent since 1993. What these numbers tell us is that ASD \ndiagnoses are rising at truly alarming rates and we simply must provide \nmore answers to all those affected by this devastating condition. As a \nnation, we need to support the families that are struggling to raise a \nchild with ASD.\n  There are many theories as to why the prevalence of ASD has \nincreased. Some have suggested that it is a reflection of better \ndiagnostic tools and measures. Other theories focus on genetic or \nenvironmental factors. But the fact is that when it comes to autism \nspectrum disorder we just don't know for certain what causes it, we \ndon't know exactly how to diagnose it, and we don't know how best to \nintervene so that individuals with ASD can achieve their highest \npotential. It is absolutely vital that we do more for families \nstruggling with this disorder, which is why the Combating Autism Act is \nso important.\n  ASD affects as many as 6 out of every 1,000 children, and the \neconomic cost to this country due to autism spectrum disorder is \nstaggering. Healthcare for individuals with ASD over their lifetimes \ncosts an estimated $35 billion per year. Schooling alone can cost as \nmuch as $100,000 each year. By 2015, the annual cost of care will be \nabout $300 billion, but we know that this figure can be cut in half \nwith early diagnosis, services, and intervention. As many as 40 percent \nof new ASD cases are identified in our schools each year, and a child \nis likely to be nearing his or her 10th birthday before a diagnosis is \nmade. This means that interventions and services that could help these \nchildren achieve their full potential are not made available to them \nduring the critical period of early development when interventions are \nmost successful and cost-effective. As a country, we need to do a \nbetter job of diagnosing children before they start school. That means \ntraining pediatricians, early childhood educators, and day care \nproviders to recognize the early indicators of ASD so that at-risk \nchildren are referred to specialists for diagnosis and services as \nearly as practicable.\n  The Combating Autism Act will promote early detection, early \nevidence-based interventions, and services for individuals with ASD. It \nalso significantly increases our investment in the National Institutes \nof Health for autism-related research. This legislation will also \nreauthorize the epidemiologic surveillance programs at the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention. Most importantly, this legislation will \nmean answers for the families that have been so deeply affected by ASD. \nFor that reason, more than any other, I am grateful that the Senate is \nvoting to pass the Combating Autism Act today.\n  I want to thank my colleagues, Senator Santorum, Senator Enzi, \nSenator Kennedy, and their staffs for their extraordinary hard work on \nthis bill. I also wish to offer my sincere thanks and appreciation to \nall of the individuals who are personally affected by autism spectrum \ndisorder--and the many advocacy groups who represent them--for their \ncontinued dedication and passionate commitment to this legislation. \nWithout their commitment, we would not be here today on the verge of \nSenate passage of this critical legislation that will greatly advance \nour Nation's efforts to address the many issues surrounding autism \nspectrum disorder and to serve those per * * *\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, before we move to pass this bill, I, too, \nwant to add my commendation, my thanks, my appreciation, my gratitude \nto Senator Santorum and Senator Dodd. I have had the opportunity to \nwork almost daily with Senator Santorum on this particular issue and \nbecause of his focus and his dedication and hard work, indeed, at 11:15 \ntonight, we do have a reason to celebrate--celebrate not just for the \nbill itself but because it is a major step forward for the hundreds and \nthousands of families across this Nation who are exposed to, are \ntouched by, who celebrate autism, and that this bill itself recognizes \nwe have a long way to go.\n  It was a year ago that I asked the Government Accountability Office \nto look at and evaluate our country's efforts to combat autism and to \nlook at the challenges that we have before us. It was 6 years ago that \nSenator Kennedy and I cosponsored a bill, the Children's Health Act of \n2000. The report was released today, the General Accounting Office \nreport. It states that while Federal funding coordination and research \nhave increased since the Children's Health Act of 2000, there is a \nsignificant need for more coordination, for expanded research, for \nbetter strategies for education, and indeed for more health care \nprofessionals to serve the autism community.\n  If you wrap all of that up, there is a need for better research, \ndiagnosis, and treatment. And there is a need for a cure.\n  On the Senate floor we will talk about that need, but it is parents \nlike Brian and Tracy Noll who feel it every day. Brian and Tracy are \nparents, actually Pennsylvanian parents--referring to my distinguished \ncolleague, the sponsor of this bill--of a 7-year-old son with autism. \nAs an infant, their son Tyler exhibited--this is the usual course--all \nthe normal signs of a healthy baby, a happy baby. But at 18 months \nBrian started to notice that Tyler would no longer look him in the eye.\n  Again, as is the custom, after repeated visits to doctors, repeated \nvisits, there was a lot of mystery initially. He was ultimately \ndiagnosed with autism at the age of 3. Today Tyler struggles with \ncommunication and coordination, his language and sensory skills are \nlimited. He knows, yes, that he is different from other children, but \nhe really can't understand why. Brian and Tracy see their fun-loving \nson whose smile lights up the room and they hope for new treatments \nthat will help him lead a normal and productive life. They hope \nresearchers will help cure autism, and, yes, they hope\n\n[[Page S8770]]\n\nsomeday we will understand why. Because of the tremendous work of \nSenators Santorum and Dodd, under the chairmanship of Chairman Enzi and \nChairman Kennedy--who I mentioned back from our work together in 2006--\nwe are on the way to that becoming a reality.\n  It is one of the least understood developmental disorders of our \ntime. The difficulties with communication skills and social skills are \nwell known. But no case is the same. Every case is a little bit \ndifferent. It covers, as its name suggests, a spectrum of behaviors. \nApproximately 40 percent of children with autism do not talk. Others \nwill learn to talk but later stop speaking altogether. Some read at an \nadvanced pace. Some have unique athletic abilities. Some will exhibit \nexcellent fine motor skills but will have a great deal of difficulty \nwith the more simple tasks before them.\n  I think back to 30 years ago when I graduated from medical school: \nAutism was little talked about as a disorder. But over the next three \ndecades we have watched its incidence steadily grow. That is why, as I \nmentioned, in the year 2000, Senator Kennedy and I were compelled to \nintroduce that Children's Health Care Act. The intent was for America \nto better understand and treat and one day prevent a disorder that had \nfor so long eluded the scientific community as well as the medical and \nclinical community.\n  As the GAO report released today highlights, coordination of Federal \nautism activities in NIH research has increased. Indeed, NIH funding \nhas doubled between 2000 and today. Yet, for as many strides as we made \nin the last 5 years, one fact remains: There is no cure. We shed more \nlight on autism, but we are still at the very dawn of understanding the \ndisorder and its origins.\n  As a physician I have witnessed firsthand the power of research--if \nwe invest, if we set up a framework for the appropriate research. And \nwith reason, I harbor hope for a day when autism has a cure.\n  But that day depends on this body making a commitment.\n  We have laid a foundation. But today we have an opportunity to build \non it by passing the Combating Autism Act, which not only reauthorizes \nThe Children's Health Act of 2000--it addresses the specific challenges \nlaid out in the GAO report. The GAO report highlights that we need \ngreater coordination of Federal autism activities, and this bill \nensures it. The report states that surveillance of autism can be \nimproved through better coordination--and this bill ensures it. The \nreport identifies the need for more health care professionals who are \ntrained to interact with autism patients--and this bill ensures it. The \nreport makes clear that because there is no cure and no known cause, \nresearch must be continued, and it must be expanded. And this bill \nensures it.\n  For the parents of children with autism, there is so little \ncertainty. There is no guarantee when they wake up in the morning that \nit will be a good day for their child. There is no guarantee that their \nchild will learn to talk or to read or interact with his peers. And \nthere is no certainty what the future holds for that child who will one \nday be an adult.\n  Today is an opportunity to provide those parents with what little \ncertainty we can.\n  Today is the opportunity to assure them that we are continuing to \npush forward for better treatment, for more research, for a greater \nunderstanding, and one day, perhaps a cure.\n  I thank my colleagues Senators Santorum and Dodd for sponsoring this \nlegislation.\n  And I am pleased we have passed this important bill.\n  What we are about to do is a great victory for this body, for the \ncountry, and indeed for the parents of children with autism. I am \npleased in a few moments we will pass this very important deal.\n  Both of my colleagues have previously mentioned their relationship \nwith others who have autism. Again, Bob and Susan Wright have been \ntremendous leaders in their communities, across the country, and indeed \nglobally in fighting autism. A good friend, Phil Geier, who they know \nvery well, a close friend of mine, has been instrumental in shedding \nthat communication, that light on this entity. We can all celebrate \ntoday that, because of all their hard work and the leadership of \nChairman Enzi, we will be passing that bill shortly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I salute the source of this effort for \ntheir hard work, Senator Santorum, Senator Dodd, and many others, and \nask unanimous consent my name be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to add my \ncongratulations to the people who have had a key role in doing this \nbill. First of all, I want to recognize the leader, who always inspires \nus on a lot of these issues and then provides the time for us to be \nable to do it as well--not only on this but on the pensions bill. He \nhas to handle a lot of strategy and a lot of different personalities \nand does just a marvelous job moving the whole body along.\n  I primarily want to thank Senator Dodd and Senator Santorum for \nbringing this to our committee and working it diligently. I also thank \nthem for sending all the different people to see me who had an interest \nin this bill, who had a number of different likes and wants and needs. \nThey are to be commended for the tremendous effort they put into making \nsure that some day we have a solution to autism.\n  It is the most diligent-working bunch of people I think I have ever \nbeen associated with. They are also at the very beginning of a process, \nit seems. We need to expedite that process. This bill will help to get \nthat done.\n  Senator Santorum has just been a real leader on this issue and \nprobably understands it better than anybody that I have worked with and \nhas worked through all the difficulties of the last-minute kinds of \nchanges.\n  I thank all of you for getting this for America. One of the things \nthis bill does is help people understand autism better. It is \nrelatively unknown. This elevates it. As we continue to do that, we \nwill get solutions. I thank all of you for doing that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I thank Senator Enzi for just the \ntremendous commitment that he and Senator Kennedy made to being patient \nand working through the months of time it took to bring this bill \ntogether.\n  I know his intention was to move a comprehensive reform of the NIH, \nand he made an exception for this piece of legislation. Senator Dodd \nand I thank both Senator Enzi and Senator Kennedy for breaking ranks, \nmaking sure we could move this as a separate piece of legislation, \napart from the overall reauthorization of NIH.\n  I want to say to the leader, as Senator Enzi said, we wouldn't be \nhere if it were not for your commitment to get this bill done. I know \nSenator Reid, with whom I spoke just a few minutes ago, said: This is a \nvery important bill to me; this is something I want to see done. We \nworked through the bumps here right at the end to get that done thanks \nto you, our two leaders.\n  Up until the very end this has been a difficult process, but we are \nhere. Having worked on a lot of bills, I have been very blessed in the \ntime that I have been here. I have had my share of legislative \nsuccesses and bills I have worked on and worked hard on to make a \ndifference. I can't think of any piece of legislation that I will feel \nbetter about as I reflect back on what I have accomplished here than \nwhat we have done tonight.\n  People who are dealing with children with autism are a special group \nof people. Senator Dodd laid that out very eloquently. They are a \nspecial group of people who are, in many cases, just more determined to \nbe able to solve this enigma that is in their family, this disorder \nabout which they just can't seem to get the answers they need.\n  I always say when I meet with a group of autistic kids and their \nparents, the commonality in every one of those meetings is tears. In \nmost cases, we are talking to parents who are very, very stressed out \nand really sort of at their wits end as to how to grapple with this \nproblem. Tonight, hopefully, we will begin the process of drying those \ntears and creating hope for a whole group of Americans and their\n\n[[Page S8771]]\n\nfamilies who deserve better answers than what we are getting from the \nmedical community today.\n  One final note. I want to say that Senator Dodd, I think, referred to \nDeirdre Imus as the flame that just burned. I say, then her husband is \nthe torch that is burning many places--many parts of our body at times, \nin getting this legislation through. Don Imus deserves, certainly, his \ncredit for taking this issue on in a very public way and, because of \nwhat he does on the radio, increasing public awareness about this \ndisorder and making a contribution to this effort that we are seeing \nsuccessful tonight. But also the effort improving awareness of this \norder.\n\n  I am happy to yield to Senator Dodd.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I suspect that Don Imus is so dedicated to \nraising awareness of this issues because of the work of his wife. That \nis why he does this, more than anything else. We are delighted to have \nboth of their support and commitment to this important issue.\n  On my own staff, I wish to thank Jim Fenton, Tamar Magarik, and \nElizabeth Hoffman; Jen Vesey with Senator Santorum; Shana Christrup and \nSteve Northrup of Chairman Enzi's staff, and Caya Lewis with Ranking \nMember Kennedy's staff.\n  We have had some wonderful people on all sides work on this, and I am \npleased to recognize them and add their names to the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I earlier thanked my staff member, Jen \nVesey, and I want to reiterate that. I really cannot tell you how much \ncredit she deserves for this legislation and the enormous amount of \ntime she spent in pulling this altogether. As Senator Dodd mentioned \nstaff again, I thought it was important for everyone who is working out \nthere in the autism community to understand what a champion you have in \nJen Vesey, who is on my staff.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Chambliss and Senator Thune be \nadded as cosponsors to the legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I understand there is an amendment at \nthe desk. Let me explain what this amendment does before I ask consent \nit be adopted and the bill be passed, because I know people are going \nto hear that this bill passed and passed with an amendment and they are \ngoing to wonder what the amendment is and whether this does anything to \nchange the bill.\n  The amendment is as a result of one of the bumps that we ran into \ntonight, trying to get this bill passed unanimously. It is not easy to \nget the Senate to do anything unanimously, particularly anything \ncomplex, and this is a very lengthy piece of legislation that has a lot \nof complexity to it.\n  We had one issue brought up by a Member with respect to the increase \nin the amount of authorization for research. That Member thought that \nnumber was excessive and was going to object to the consideration of \nthe bill tonight unless we were able to do something about that \nauthorization number. In order to get the legislation adopted--because, \nagain, there would have been objection tonight and that objection would \nhave carried into the fall, and with a very short timeframe the \nlikelihood of that bill being able to pass this fall and be considered \nby the House and then passed and sent to the President would have been \nhighly unlikely--so I was able to negotiate with this Senator to reduce \nthe level of authorization, the increase, from $100 million in the area \nof research in the NIH to $200 million--which is what the bill calls \nfor--from $100 million to $150 million. Instead of the research going \nup $20 million a year for 5 years up to $200 million in the final year, \nit will go up at $10 million a year to $150 million in the final year. \nAgain, still a sizable increase.\n  It is a 50 percent increase in funding over 5 years in the \nauthorization. If you look at what we are doing here in the Senate \nthese days, we are not increasing funding for many programs at 50 \npercent. So it is not all we had hoped, not all we had wanted, but it \nis better than nothing. Unfortunately, with the late hour of this bill \nbeing brought up, nothing was a real alternative and not a pleasant \none.\n  As a result, that is the amendment we will be considering here in a \nmoment. After the amendment is adopted, then the bill will be \npassed. We will send the bill over to the House and hope that when the \nHouse returns in September and is willing to bring up this legislation, \npass it as it is, and send it on to the President so we can get moving \non finding a cure for the autism spectrum disorder.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 843, the \nCombating Autism Act. I am pleased to note that the Senate will pass \nthis bill today.\n  This legislation, which was recently reported out of the Senate \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, focuses on expanding \nautism spectrum disorder research and coordination at the National \nInstitutes of Health, NIH. It also increases awareness of autism \nspectrum disorder and its symptoms through the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention, CDC. Additionally, the bill integrates our \nvarious health, education, and disability programs that serve \nindividuals and families affected by autism spectrum disorder and \nensures that the community of people affected by this disorder have a \nvoice in all of this.\n  No one knows exactly how many individuals are affected by autism \nspectrum disorder, but some studies suggest it could be as high as 1 \nout of every 166 American individuals.\n  But there are many things we do know about autism spectrum disorder. \nWe know we need to begin intervention as early as possible to help \nindividuals with autism spectrum disorder reach their full potential. \nAnd given the importance of early intervention, we need further \nresearch into the possible causes of autism spectrum disorder.\n  We need to understand more about the various forms of autism spectrum \ndisorder to improve our ability to provide the right kinds of \nintervention and support. And, we need to provide better integration of \nthe health, education, and disability programs already available to \nmeet the increased demand for these interventions, supports and \nservices.\n  I believe the ``Combating Autism Act'' is an important step toward \naddressing these needs and finding some solutions that will improve the \nlives of individuals and families whose daily lives have been turned \nupside down by autism spectrum disorder.\n  This bill is the result of a tremendous amount of work across party \nlines. I want to thank the original bill cosponsors, Senators Santorum \nand Dodd for introducing this legislation and for working with me to \nfine-tune it. I would also like to express my deep appreciation and \nthanks to the ranking member, Senator Kennedy, for his hard work during \nthis process. Of course, in providing thanks to the members, I would be \nremiss if I did not mention the staff. Specifically, I want to thank \nJen Vesey with Senator Santorum; Jim Fenton, Ben Berwick, Tamar \nMagarik, and Elizabeth Hoffman with Senator Dodd, and Caya Lewis with \nSenator Kennedy's office, as well as my staff--Steve Northrup, Aaron \nBishop, Tec Chapman, Martina Bebin, and Shana Christrup.\n  I also want to thank the various groups and individuals who work on \nbehalf of individuals and families affected by autism spectrum \ndisorder. I appreciate the way in which this community of advocates has \ncome together to work with me and my colleagues on this. If they had \nnot worked together so well--with each other and with us as our \nCommittee worked on this bill--I doubt we would be here today.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, first let me express my sincere \ngratitude to Chairman Enzi and your staff for investing so much time \nand thoughtful effort in this important legislation, as well as thank \nSenators Dodd and Kennedy, and their staffs. Few things are more \nimportant than the health and happiness of our Nation's children, and \nthe Combating Autism Act will go a long way to helping those diagnosed \nwith autism live up to their full potential. We have a tremendous \nopportunity to make a real difference in the lives of children with \nautism and their families. This Federal investment will lead to better \nunderstanding of autism, increase awareness, diagnosis and \nintervention--all things that will make a profound impact on families \nstruggling for answers and hope.\n  Autism raises complex and emotional issues. All of us who worked so \nhard on\n\n[[Page S8772]]\n\nthis legislation sought to keep the primary focus of the bill on autism \nresearch and awareness. However, in addressing the key issues within S. \n843, some have raised concerns regarding a potential link between \nvaccines, vaccine components, such as thimerosal, and autism. Can the \nChairman clarify his position on this issue?\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am happy to do so. In 2004 the Institute \nof Medicine's Immunization Safety Review Committee concluded that the \nbody of epidemiological evidence ``favors rejection of a causal \nrelationship between the MMR vaccine and autism spectrum disorder'' and \nalso ``favors rejection of a causal relationship between thimerosal-\ncontaining vaccines and autism spectrum disorder.'' The IOM committee \nalso found that ``potential biological mechanisms for vaccine-induced \nautism spectrum disorder that have been generated to date are \ntheoretical only.''\n  However, the IOM committee also acknowledged that ``[a]bsent \nbiomarkers, well-defined risk factors, or large effect sizes, the \ncommittee cannot rule out, based on the epidemiological evidence, the \npossibility that vaccines contribute to autism spectrum disorder in \nsome small subset or very unusual circumstances.'' The IOM committee \nalso noted that ``experiments showing effects of thimerosal \non biochemical pathways in cell culture systems and showing \nabnormalities in the immune system or metal metabolism in people with \nautism spectrum disorder are provocative,'' and suggested that ``the \nautism spectrum disorder research community should consider the \nappropriate composition of the autism spectrum disorder research \nportfolio with some of these new findings in mind.''\n\n  I agree with the IOM committee's recommendation that ``available \nfunding for autism spectrum disorder research be channeled to the most \npromising areas.'' The HELP Committee reported this bill without making \nthe determination for the autism spectrum disorder research community \nof what are the ``most promising areas'' for investigation. Instead, \nthe bill reported by the HELP Committee contemplates key research \nactivities, including environmental research, that focus on a broad \nrange of potential contributing factors, with meaningful public \ninvolvement and advice in setting the research agenda.\n  However, I want to be clear that, for the purposes of biomedical \nresearch, no research avenue should be eliminated, including biomedical \nresearch examining potential links between vaccines, vaccine \ncomponents, and autism spectrum disorder. Thus, I hope that the \nNational Institutes of Health will consider broad research avenues into \nthis critical area, within the Autism Centers of Excellence as well as \nthe Centers of Excellence for Environmental Health and Autism. No stone \nshould remain unturned in trying to learn more about this baffling \ndisorder, especially given how little we know.\n  I also want to note that this broad statement is appropriately \nlimited to biomedical and not epidemiological research. Although S. 843 \nprovides for specific centers of excellence to examine epidemiological \nissues related to autism spectrum disorder, there is currently no \nexpectation that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention should \nfurther pursue additional epidemiological research regarding the link \nbetween autism spectrum disorder and vaccines or vaccine components, \nunless new biomedical research provides additional information about \nspecific at-risk subpopulations. At this point, given what we know and \nwhat has already been done in this area, no new epidemiological \nresearch is required.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I agree with the comments of the chairman. I thank him \nfor clarifying, and again for all of his hard work on this legislation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I also agree with the comments of the chairman.\n  Mr. DODD. As my colleagues are well aware, the prevalence of ASD in \nthe U.S. is 10 times greater than a decade ago. In my own State of \nConnecticut, ASD diagnoses have increased by close to 1100 percent \nsince 1993. What these numbers tell us is that ASD diagnoses are rising \nat truly alarming rates and we simply must provide more answer to all \nthose affected by this devastating condition.\n  We must also create a larger pool of experts in the field so that \nfamilies can be directed to nearby specialty clinics for confirmation \nof diagnosis, care and services. Waiting lists at the Nation's top \ndevelopmental disability centers are as long as 2 to 3 years, and \nfamilies are often forced to travel far from home to receive needed \ncare and to participate in clinical research studies. Increasing the \nnumber of trained physicians and allied health professionals who can \nprovide a medical home for individuals with ASD will enable all those \naffected to receive the optimal and timely care that they deserve.\n  It is my sincere hope and expectation that by expanding the federal \nresponse to ASD and other developmental disabilities through the \nCombating Autism Act, we will see improved research on ASD, including \nits causes, and families across America will get the services they so \nurgently need. In our search for the cause of this growing \ndevelopmental disability, we should close no doors on promising avenues \nof research. Through the Combating Autism Act, all biomedical research \nopportunities on ASD can be pursued, and they include environmental \nresearch examining potential links between vaccines, vaccine components \nand ASD.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment at the desk \nbe agreed to, the committee-reported amendment, as amended, be agreed \nto, the bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed, and the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon table and that any statements \nrelating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4878) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n       On page 39, line 20, strike ``2007'' through page 40, line \n     5 and insert:\n       ``(A) $68,000,000 for fiscal year 2007, $74,500,000 for \n     fiscal year 2008, $81,000,000 for fiscal year 2009, \n     $87,500,000 for fiscal year 2010, and $94,000,000 for fiscal \n     year 2011, to carry out subsections (a), (b), and (d);\n       ``(B) $24,000,000 for fiscal year 2007, $30,500,000 for \n     fiscal year 2008, $37,000,000 for fiscal year 2009, \n     $43,500,000 for fiscal year 2010, and $50,000,000 for fiscal \n     year 2011, to carry out subsection (c)(1); and\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended, \nwas agreed to.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, was read \nthe third time, and passed, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 843\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I see the majority leader is on the floor. \nI will make a unanimous consent request. I would like to very briefly \ndescribe what I am about to request.\n  I have filed S. 3765, along with Senator Sununu as my cosponsor, as \nwell as Senator Feingold and Senator Stabenow.\n  This is a bill that is very timely and important. I hope we will be \nable to have unanimous consent to go forward with this bill and pass it \nthis evening.\n  It is a bill that has been referred to the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  I have personally spoken to Senator Arlen Specter, chairman of this \ncommittee, and told am I was going to make this unanimous consent \nrequest this evening. He said he would not object. Those were his exact \nwords.\n  Senator Leahy said the same thing.\n  The reason I am taking this extraordinary step is because this is an \nextraordinary situation. We all know what happened in Lebanon today. \nYou can't turn on the news without being aware of the war that has \nconsumed both southern Lebanon and many parts of northern Israel.\n  We realize as well that many people are innocent victims on both \nsides of\n\n[[Page S8776]]\n\nthe border, and we realize that the United States has officially \nevacuated American citizens from Lebanon because of the danger.\n  We are also very aware of the fact that we have asked other Americans \nwho remained to remove themselves as quickly as possible. It is \nestimated that 20 to 25 percent of the population of Lebanon has now \nbeen displaced. They are refugees--people who have been forced to leave \ntheir homes because of the danger of remaining because of the \nhostilities that continue between Israel and Hezbollah.\n  The purpose of this legislation is not new. It is something that has \nbeen done repeatedly. It grants temporary protected status to those \nLebanese visitors in the United States who are legally here on visas \nwhich permit them to be here and which may soon expire. When they do, \nunder the law these people are expected to leave the United States and \nreturn to Lebanon.\n  We have in the past been sensitized to the fact that sending many of \nthese families from the United States to war-torn countries under these \ncircumstances may in fact endanger those families.\n  The United States has many, many times in the past said we will grant \ntemporary protected status to visitors in the United States to protect \nthem from returning to a dangerous situation.\n  It is an act of compassion, an act of humanitarian caring, and I \nthink speaks well of the United States. In the past we have even \ngranted this status to Lebanese visitors when Lebanon was at war in the \n1990s for the very same reason.\n  Today, there are seven countries around the world where the United \nStates has granted temporary protected status to visitors from those \ncountries in the United States.\n  This temporary protected status does not put these visitors on a path \nto legalization or citizenship. It simply allows them if they wish to \nstay in the U.S. while the hostilities continue up to a year. It would \nbe a renewal after that point.\n  The reason I offered it at this late hour is because it is a matter \nof great urgency. It is important that we do this in a timely fashion.\n  As we consider this measure, the Bush administration is considering \nwhether to do this administratively, which they can. We have done it \nlegislatively. It has been done administratively.\n  My concern is that tomorrow I am certain some Lebanese visitors to \nthe U.S. will find that their visas have expired, and they will face a \nvery difficult decision. If they comply with the law and leave, \nreturning to Lebanon, they could be endangering families and children \nwho are here innocently visiting members of their family and friends. \nWe don't want that to happen. These poor people from Lebanon, these \ninnocent victims, should not have to return to this scene.\n  Of course, our State Department and the Department of Homeland \nSecurity would retain the authority to review each and every person. If \nfor any reason some Lebanese visitor to the United States should not be \nallowed to remain in the United States, they can be denied the status. \nSo it is done on a case-by-case basis. It offers a protection, which I \nthink is the humanitarian thing to do.\n  Throughout history there have been times when in the course of war \npeople have turned refugees from their country, left their country and \nturned to other countries for refuge. In many instances, countries have \nwelcomed them understanding that that is the right and humane thing to \ndo. In other instances, countries have shunned them. Those countries \nhave been embarrassed by the history that was written afterwards.\n  I am lucky to be a Senator in this great country, a country which has \nextended this generosity and this welcome time and time again.\n  I am urging my colleagues this evening to join me in passing this \nbill, an extraordinary passage by unanimous consent so that we can send \na clear message to the administration and to the Lebanese visitors to \nthe United States that we deeply care about their safety and their \nsecurity.\n  I see the majority leader is on the floor. I will make the formal \nunanimous consent request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Judiciary Committee be discharged \nfrom further consideration of S. 3765, the Lebanese Temporary Protected \nStatus bill that has been introduced by myself, Senator Sununu, Senator \nFeingold, and Senator Stabenow, that the Senate proceed to its \nimmediate consideration, the bill be read a third time and passed, and \nthe motion reconsider be laid upon the table without any intervening \naction or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, reserving right to object, S. 3765 to \npermit nationals being granted temporary protected status in United \nStates is a bill that I personally support. And the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee commented to the distinguished assistant minority \nleader his support. I just received it 15 minutes ago. I am trying to \nclear it but have not heard back from everybody tonight.\n  Without giving everyone the opportunity to review it, I am going to \nhave to object tonight.\n  Again, we will see what happens over the next 30 or 40 minutes that \nwe are in tonight. Not having heard back from everyone, I am unable to \nverify. So I do object.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I understand. I gave this to the majority \nleader maybe 45 minutes ago at most. I certainly didn't want to try to \nsurprise him and mislead him because I think this is a matter that is \nvery important. I sincerely hope we can clear this tonight. If we are \nunable to clear this and pass this legislation--or even if we do--I \nurge Michael Chertoff, Secretary of the Homeland Security Department, \nto grant this status to Lebanon and to do it immediately--immediately. \nThe people of Lebanon cannot wait until Congress returns to Washington \nin September. And his immediate action will save lives and give peace \nof mind to a lot of our friends from Lebanon and to their families who \nlive in the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/08/03/senate-section/article/S8776-1", "month": "08", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Absent that \nhappening, I will have to object to this unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am disappointed that tonight we could not \npass this bill. This is the Cuba Transition Act of 2006 which I \ncosponsored along with the Senators Ensign and Martinez.\n  This bill would have authorized assistance to the people of Cuba, \nencouraged a democratic election process, and created a fund to support \nindependent civil-society-building efforts.\n  It would have created the Fund For a Free Cuba which would have \nprovided assistance to a transitional government in Cuba, and included \nassistance\n\n[[Page S8777]]\n\nto political prisoners and their families, other dissidents, \nindependent libraries, youth organizations, workers rights activists, \nagricultural cooperatives, associations of the self-employed, \njournalists, economists, and medical doctors.\n  This has been cleared by our side. I believe that the other side, the \nDemocrats, will have an opportunity to show solidarity with the Cuban \npeople. We will try to clear this bill through the Senate when we \nreconvene.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if I might be allowed to comment as well, \nas the Senator from Tennessee, the majority leader, describes the bill, \nit sounds as if it is one that I gladly and wholeheartedly would \nsupport. I know Senator Martinez has a special interest in this issue, \nhaving been born in Cuba and then coming to the United States and still \nwith the great love for the land where he was born.\n  I have spoken to him for the last several days while there apparently \nis a transition of power in place there. And I know how important this \nis to him personally and to so many other people of Cuban dissent who \nlive in the United States.\n  I am sorry that it cannot be cleared, but there are some on this side \nof the aisle who have expressed some reservation or objection at this \npoint. But I personally hope that we can do this as quickly as possible \nso that the people of Cuba can appreciate and enjoy freedom as soon as \nwe can give them a helping hand.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/08/03/senate-section/article/S8777-1", "month": "08", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8777]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RETIREMENT OF MARTY BERMAN\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the Senate community is losing a longtime \nand valued employee. After 18 years of loyal and distinguished service, \nMarty Berman is retiring from the Senate Recording Studio. Marty played \nan integral part in the television broadcast of the Senate's \nproceedings and in helping facilitate the audio and video needs of \nSenators and their staffs.\n  His service to his country really started 45 years ago. Marty served \nfaithfully, enlisting twice in a military career that began when he was \n17 and lasted 6 years, from 1961 to 1967. Before leaving the military, \nhe was a communications specialist with duty in Vietnam.\n  Marty brought extensive television experience to his job at SRS. In \nthe private sector he worked at Satellite News Network, CNN, and \nfinally at CBS. His work for Charles Kuralt and ``CBS Sunday Morning'' \nwas nominated for an Emmy. A 13-minute long story he had photographed \nwas aired, which is the television equivalent of a long book.\n  His career at the recording studio began in 1988 where he quickly \ncame to specialize in audio operations. However, his contributions were \nnot only technical. He also had just the right personal touch with \nSenators. It isn't always easy to get up in front of TV cameras and \nlights to speak, even for Senators, but Marty had the ability to put \nany Senator at ease. When floor directing, he spoke to each Senator \neasily and with warmth, and they trusted him. He was never intimidated, \nbut he was always respectful.\n  Marty can be a bit feisty, but his bark is much worse than his bite. \nTo those who have gotten to know him, he is warm and caring, too.\n  Marty ended where he had started, working the Senate television \nshift. In 18 years he braved many long days and late nights through the \nSenate's always unpredictable schedule. Throughout his time at the \nstudio, Marty could always be counted on to be at his post. That \nincluded his work as chief STV audio operator where for most days \nduring his shift he started up in the audio booth, assuring that the \nSenators could always be heard in the Chamber and on television.\n  Marty is the father of 3 grown children: Tracy, Eric, and Alex. The 3 \nhave been the pride of his life and have become responsible and caring \nadults. He is also the proud grandfather of two. His marriage to \nDarlene has brought him much happiness. Both share the same three \nhobbies: antique collecting, antique collecting, and more antique \ncollecting. Their home is a somewhat cluttered but fascinating museum \nof American Western and American Indian artifacts, pottery, Big Little \nBooks, and just about anything else you can think of. Last, but not \nleast, there are four others who hold a place in his heart. They are \nHoover the yellow lab, Clarence the bassett hound, Crystal, the cat, \nand Birdie the cockatiel. Birdie likes to lay back and listen to the \nblues with Marty and Darlene and can even whistle Colonel Bogey's March \nfrom ``Bridge on the River Kwai.''\n  Marty's unique personality, loyalty, and dedication will be missed. \nWe all join to wish Marty the best as he begins this next adventure in \nhis life and know he will enjoy the newfound time for family, friends, \npets, and antique collecting.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/08/03/senate-section/article/S8777-2", "month": "08", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8777-S8778]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n 160TH ANNIVERSARY OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S ELECTION TO THE UNITED STATES \n                        HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, Leo Tolstoy said of Abraham Lincoln that \n``His example is universal and will last thousands of years . . . He \nwas bigger than his country--bigger than all the Presidents together . \n. . and as a great character he will live as long as the world lives.''\n  Abraham Lincoln has been known and admired through the generations--\nand around the world. But Abraham Lincoln is known primarily for his \npresidency and his leadership of the United States through the dark \ndays of the Civil War. We recall his unwavering commitment to the \n``American experiment'' in democracy and his refusal to allow the \nnational Union to fail, regardless of the odds against him.\n  Few people remember, though, that Abraham Lincoln was also a Member \nof Congress at one time. Today, August 3, in fact, marks the 160th \nanniversary of Abraham Lincoln's election to a single term in the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives. I also had the privilege of representing the \n20th Congressional District of Illinois as a member of the House for 14 \nyears.\n  There is a reason few people remember Lincoln's service in Congress. \nFrankly, his one term, in the 30th Congress, which sat from December \n1847 to March of 1849, was rather unremarkable. He was a young country \nlawyer who served with the likes of John Quincy Adams in the House and \nDaniel Webster and John Calhoun in the Senate. Most of his colleagues \nviewed him as a Westerner of average talent.\n  He was a conscientious and hard-working Member, though, which isn't \nparticularly surprising. He served on various committees, he voted on \nthe floor of the House in nearly all of the rollcall votes during his \nterm, and he corresponded faithfully with his constituents.\n  His most famous contribution to the political and policy debates of \nhis term--criticism of President James Polk for the Nation's \ninvolvement in the Mexican war--earned him scorn and disfavor back in \nIllinois where the war had been popular. Illinois Democrats called \nLincoln, himself a Whig at the time, a disgrace.\n  Lincoln left Congress and returned to his legal practice, arguing \ncases in country courthouses of Illinois' Eighth Judicial Circuit, and \nthinking he had no future in politics.\n  On the contrary, Lincoln's time walking the Halls of this building \nintroduced him to the issues on the national political stage. The \nCongress in which he served debated the Wilmot Proviso, which would \nhave prevented the spread of slavery into territories newly acquired \nfrom Mexico. Those debates exposed Lincoln to the divisiveness and \nexplosiveness of the issue that severely tried his presidency a decade \nand a half later and nearly destroyed the country. His time in Congress \nalso produced personal and political connections that served him years \nlater as President and Commander-in-Chief.\n  Today, we mark the anniversary of Abraham Lincoln's election to the \nHouse of Representatives as the beginning of this great man's ascent on \nthe national political stage. In February 2009, the Nation will mark \nthe 200th anniversary of Lincoln's birth. Congress established the \nAbraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission to help our Nation mark this \nmilestone. I am privileged to cochair the Commission along with \nCongressman Ray LaHood and Lincoln Scholar Harold Holzer--we like to \ncall ourselves ``a team of rivals.'' We have been working diligently to \nensure\n\n[[Page S8778]]\n\nthat a ``fitting and proper'' commemoration is planned. I am pleased to \nreport that a number of our goals have already been met--the \nauthorization of new penny designs in the bicentennial year and the \nissuance of a commemorative coin, for example. Other educational, \nscholarly, cultural, and historical events are in various stages of \nplanning--both here in the United States and abroad.\n  After President Lincoln's untimely death, Edwin M. Stanton said, \n``Now he belongs to the ages.'' Mr. President, today we remember \nAbraham Lincoln's service in the House, his leadership during our \nNation's most perilous time, and his legacy of freedom, democracy, and \nequal opportunity. Even great life begins with a series of small but \nimportant steps. Let us keep working to carry out Abraham Lincoln's \nvision in our day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/08/03/senate-section/article/S8778-1", "month": "08", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8778-S8779]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 AFRICAN HEALTH CAPACITY INVESTMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this week I introduced the African Health \nCapacity Investment Act of 2006.\n  This bill was inspired last December, when I visited the Democratic \nRepublic of Congo with Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas.\n  The Congo is one of the poorest, most violent regions on Earth. This \npast weekend, it held its first multiparty elections in nearly 50 \nyears. That is a moment to celebrate.\n  But one of the most profound challenges that the newly elected \ngovernment will face is how to even begin to meet the health needs of \nits people. In the DRC, there are only 7 doctors and 44 nurses per \n100,000 people. In the eastern Congo, which has witnessed terrible \nconflict and disease, there is only 1 doctor per 160,000 people. And, I \nwas told, in the city of Goma, surgeons are literally one in a million. \nTo put that in perspective, imagine three surgeons in a city the size \nof Chicago. Imagine living like that, and then imagine your doctors and \nnurses leaving for countries with better working conditions, better \npay, and brighter futures.\n  That is the situation that the Congo and almost all of Sub-Saharan \nAfrica faces every day, as doctors and nurses leave rural areas for \nAfrican cities and leave African cities for the United States, the \nUnited Kingdom, and other Western destinations. Every year, Africa \nloses another 20,000 trained health professionals to European and North \nAmerican medical facilities. That is an enormous brain drain.\n  As Randall Tobias, the U.S. Director of Foreign Assistance, has \nnoted, there are more Ethiopian-trained doctors practicing in Chicago \nthan in Ethiopia.\n  In the United States, we have 549 doctors and 773 nurses for every \n100,000 people. And even at those levels, we face our own personnel \nshortages. As the baby boomers age and our health workforce retires, \nour shortages will grow. It has become our habit to recruit doctors and \nnurses from abroad and increasingly from the developing world to staff \nour hospitals, doctors' offices, and other health centers.\n  Those individuals immigrate here for the same reasons that people \nhave always migrated here. They come for economic opportunities, \ngreater freedom, and a better future for their children. As the son of \nan immigrant, I recognize their motivations and welcome the \ncontributions that they make. But I also have to look at the countries \nthat they leave behind.\n  That is what struck me so powerfully in the Congo: that we cannot \ncontinue to depend on the poorest countries in the world to train our \ndoctors and nurses. We have to expand our own health workforce. Our \nnursing schools turn away thousands of qualified applicants every year \nbecause they don't have enough faculty to teach them. We have to fix \nthat.\n  And we have to help Africa heal itself because even if the brain \ndrain stopped completely, even if every doctor and nurse on the \ncontinent of Africa stayed there, they would still have tremendous \nshortages of health personnel.\n  That is why Senators Coleman, DeWine, and Feingold and I introduced \nthe African Health Capacity Act this week.\n  The World Health Report concluded in 2003, ``The most critical issue \nfacing health care systems is the shortage of people who make them \nwork.'' The 2006 report, which focused entirely on health workforces, \nhelped provide a blueprint on how to build that critical human \ninfrastructure.\n  Sub-Saharan Africa has 11 percent of the world's population. It bears \n25 percent of the global disease burden. But it has only 3 percent of \nthe world's health workers, and it suffers nearly half of the world's \ndeaths from infectious diseases.\n  Personnel shortages are a global problem, but nowhere are these \nshortages more extreme, the infrastructure more limited, and the health \nchallenges graver than in Sub-Saharan Africa, the epicenter of the HIV/\nAIDS pandemic. We will not win the war against AIDS or any other health \nchallenge without finding solutions to this problem. It looms larger \nthan shortages of ARVs or any other single factor. The Institute of \nMedicine has called the health care worker shortage the greatest \nobstacle to fighting HIV/AIDS.\n  AIDS has had a particularly insidious effect on health workforces in \nAfrica. Beginning in the 1980s, HIV/AIDS began to take a terrible toll \namong health workers in Africa. In 2000, 20 percent of the student \nnurses in Mozambique died from AIDS. Health workers are particularly \nvulnerable because many lack access to gloves or training in universal \nprecautions that would help protect them from infection. These unsafe \nworking conditions naturally drive many people to seek either safer \njobs or employment in other countries. As illness, death, and migration \nreduce staff, those who are left face even heavier workloads, and they \ntoo may leave. This is a deadly and vicious cycle that we have to help \nAfrica break.\n  The shortage of personnel has deadly repercussions that extend far \nbeyond HIV/AIDS. A woman in Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, has a 1 in \n13 chance of dying in pregnancy or childbirth, according to UNICEF. In \nresource-rich countries such as ours, that risk is 1 out of 4100. You \nchange those terrible odds for the woman in Africa by providing greater \naccess to skilled birth attendants. You greatly improve the newborn \nbaby's chance at survival as well.\n\n  It is critically important that as we increase assistance for HIV/\nAIDS and for health and economic development more generally, that we \nwork to strengthen health systems as a whole. The Office of the Global \nAIDS Coordinator is doing terrific work at boosting health capacity in \nthe public and private sectors, and USAID has also been engaged in this \neffort.\n  This bill is intended to give these agencies the tools to do more and \nto better integrate and coordinate their activities.\n  The bill seeks to help Sub-Saharan African countries strengthen the \ncapabilities of their health systems by helping countries improve \ndangerous and Sub-standard working conditions; helping them train, \nrecruit, and retain doctors, nurses, and paraprofessionals; developing \nbetter management and public health training; and improving \nproductivity and workforce distribution. Collecting workforce data, or \nstrengthening the public health sector may not sound very glamorous, \nbut steps like these are critical to creating the health infrastructure \nthat Africa so badly needs.\n  That infrastructure may also be very important to us. With air travel \nto spread avian flu, scientists tell us that we may have only 3 weeks \nto contain an outbreak of the disease from the time that outbreak is \ndetected anywhere in the world. If we miss that window, the outbreak of \navian flu may become a pandemic and spread around the world.\n  As stated in the Harvard Public Health Review, ``Those regions of the \nworld where human expertise and resources are in shortest supply, such \nas Africa, are most likely to serve as particularly fertile ground for \ngetting a large-scale human flu epidemic off to a robust start.'' It is \nin our own interests, as well as Africa's, to improve its public health \ninfrastructure.\n  This same point was made in the President's 2002 National Security \nStrategy. This document provides the administration's fundamental view \nof how we should confront global challenges and opportunities in the \nsecurity arena. It is a measure of risks and priorities that is issued \neach Presidential term.\n  President Bush's 2002 National Security Strategy stated, ``The scale \nof the\n\n[[Page S8779]]\n\npublic health crisis in poor countries is enormous. In countries \nafflicted by epidemics and pandemics like HIV/AIDS, malaria, and \ntuberculosis, growth and development will be threatened until these \nscourges can be contained. Resources from the developed world are \nnecessary but will be effective only with honest governance, which \nsupports prevention programs and provides effective local \ninfrastructure.''\n  This bill is not just about spending more money to build African \nhealth capacity. It is also about spending that money better. This bill \nauthorizes assistance to improve management and reduce corruption \nwithin the health sector. It requires the President to establish a \nmonitoring and evaluation system to measure the effectiveness of our \nassistance.\n  Knowledge sharing is also important: Each minister of health and each \nnongovernmental organization should not have to reinvent the wheel.\n  Two years after enactment, this bill will require the production of a \ndocument publicizing best practices. This clearinghouse of information \nwill provide valuable help for developing countries throughout the \nworld.\n  The United States provides billions of dollars to fight HIV/AIDS, \nmalaria, TB, and other health challenges in Africa. It is critical, as \nwe pursue these programs, that we better integrate them within a \nframework to strengthen health systems as a whole. We need to help \ncountries better invest their own human and material resources as well \nas our assistance.\n  In 2005, 2 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa died of AIDS, and 2.7 \nmillion people became newly infected. Nearly a million African children \nunder the age of 5 died of malaria. Hundreds of thousands of Africans \ndied last year of TB, cholera, dysentery, and other infectious diseases \nor in childbirth. These devastating mortality rates also strangle \nopportunities for economic development. But we can begin to change \nthose trajectories by investing in African health capacity. Imagine \nliving in a country like Ethiopia, with 3 doctors for every 100,000 \npeople. Then ask yourself what we can do about it. This bill is a \nstart.\n  I thank my colleagues, Senators Coleman, DeWine, and Feingold, for \njoining me in introducing this bipartisan bill, and I hope others will \njoin us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/08/03/senate-section/article/S8779-1", "month": "08", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8779-S8780]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DETAINEE TREATMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to correct the public record \nwith regard to a matter raised by the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in \nHamdan v. Rumsfeld, 126 S.Ct. 2749 (2006). In part II of its opinion, \nthe majority in Hamdan addressed whether the Detainee Treatment Act \nbarred Hamdan's lawsuit from proceeding in its then-present form. As \nthe court noted, the DTA provides that ``no court, justice, or judge \nshall have jurisdiction to hear or consider'' claims filed by \nGuantanamo detainees, except under the review standards created by that \nact.\n  In the course of drafting the DTA conference language regarding \njurisdiction, Senator Kyl, myself, and several others we consulted, \nspecifically relied on the Bruner line of cases for guidance. In that \nline of cases, we had taken particular note of Justice Stevens's \nopinion in Landgraf, where, in discussing the Bruner line, he wrote \nthat the Court had a consistent practice of ordering an action \ndismissed when the jurisdictional statute under which that action had \nbeen filed was subsequently repealed. Since that was precisely what we \nwere doing in the DTA, reversing the Rasul finding of jurisdiction \nthrough the habeas statute, we were very comfortable with how our \nlanguage addressed the jurisdictional change.\n  Likewise, the Bruner/Landgraf line of cases informed the enactment \nlanguage regarding the substantive law changes we were making. Because \nof Justice Stevens's explanation in Landgraf, we felt we had to make \nthose provisions specifically apply to pending cases. However, for \neverything else, including the requirements for the executive branch to \ndo certain things within certain time periods, having a single \nenactment statement saying everything applied retroactively did not \nmake sense. So, with that and other concerns, we ended up with what \nemerged from the conference process between passage of the amendment in \nNovember and adoption of the conference product in December. It was \ncomplicated and merged a number of concepts.\n  You see, as the author of that part of the Detainee Treatment Act, it \nwas never my intent to carve out pending cases from the effect of that \nact. As I have detailed above, we knew the governing law and expected \nthe courts to apply it. And I never hid this intent or understanding. \nMy statements regarding this intent were consistent from the beginning \nof the debate on November amendment until final passage of the \nconference report on December 21. This is why I issued a joint \nstatement with Senator Levin in early January of this year which \nstated, ``[t]he intent of the language contained within the Graham-\nLevin-Kyl amendment is that Courts will decide in accord with their own \nrules, procedures and precedents whether to proceed in pending cases.''\n  In reviewing the record, Justice Scalia and the other dissenters \nrecognized this consistency. Justice Scalia stated that, ``[s]ome of \nthe statements of Senator Graham, a sponsor of the bill, only make \nsense on the assumption that pending cases are covered.'' Thus, they \ncorrectly concluded that the jurisdictional removal language included \nall pending cases.\n  Indeed, when the final version of the DTA passed the Senate, I and \nsome of the cosponsors of my November amendment included a colloquy in \nthe Record in which we made clear that we were perfectly aware of the \nSupreme Court's previous holdings governing jurisdiction-removing \nstatutes and that we had not chosen the language of the amendment by \naccident. We had initially intended to explain our provisions of the \nDTA on the floor, but with time growing short, and rather than forcing \nour colleagues to listen as we droned on, we dropped the statement into \nthe Record and everyone went home for the Christmas break.\n  The Hamdan majority addressed this statement in footnote 10 of its \nopinion. First, the Court noted that on November 15, ``Senator Levin \nurged adoption of an alternative amendment [the final version of my \namendment] that `would apply only to new habeas cases filed after the \ndate of enactment.' '' The Court then dismissed my own statement of \nviews in the following passage:\n\n       While statements attributed to the final bill's two other \n     sponsors, Senators Graham and Kyl, arguably contradict \n     Senator Levin's contention that the final version of the Act \n     preserved jurisdiction over pending habeas cases, see 151 \n     Cong. Rec. S14263-S14264 (Dec. 21, 2005), those statements \n     appear to have been inserted into the Congressional Record \n     after the Senate debate. See Reply Brief for Petitioner 5, n. \n     6; see also 151 Cong. Rec. S14260 (statement of Sen. Kyl) \n     (``I would like to say a few words about the now-completed \n     National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2006'' \n     (emphasis added)). All statements made during the debate \n     itself support Senator Levin's understanding that the final \n     text of the DTA would not render subsection (e)(1) applicable \n     to pending cases. See, e.g., id., at S14245, S14252-S14253, \n     S14274-S14275 (Dec. 21, 2005).\n\n  There are three misstatements of fact in footnote 10 of Hamdan that I \nwould like to publicly correct. First, the colloquy that Senator Kyl \nand I submitted for the Record was not submitted after the Senate's \nconsideration of the bill. It was submitted well before the final vote \non the conference report, and was necessary due to the substantial \nchanges we made between the adoption on the amendment on November 15 \nand the adoption of the conference report on December 21.\n  Second, I have had a member of my staff view the tapes of the \nSenate's deliberations on November 15 that were prepared by the Senate \nRecording Studio. These tapes confirm that the statement from Senator \nLevin that the Supreme Court quoted from that day was not made live, \nbut instead appears to have been submitted for the Record.\n  And third, my staff has viewed the tapes of the Senate's \ndeliberations on December 21. These tapes confirm that the statements \nto which the Supreme Court cites from that day, statements by Senators \nLeahy, Durbin, and Feingold, also were not spoken live on the Senate \nfloor but were instead submitted for the Record. As I will discuss \nlater, it generally doesn't matter to me if a statement is live or not, \nbut it does bear noting the distinction given the Court's focus on it \nin this case.\n  The Supreme Court appears to have been misled about the nature of the\n\n[[Page S8780]]\n\nlegislative statements regarding the Detainee Treatment Act. The court \ndismissed my and Senator Kyl's statements on the basis that they were \nsubmitted for the Record. Instead, it relied on statements where it \nthought Senator Levin had publicly ``urged'' other members to accept \nhis view, and on statements that it believed had been spoken live \n``during the debate itself' on December 21.\n  In reality, there was no ``debate itself' on the Detainee Treatment \nAct on December 21.\n  The final Defense authorization conference report was adopted by a \nvoice vote at 10 p.m. Of the 35 pages of the Congressional Record \naccompanying the final passage of that Act, virtually none of it was \nspoken live on the Senate floor. Nothing regarding the DTA was said \nlive on December 21. In other words, the statements that Senator Kyl \nand I submitted for the Record and that the Hamdan majority dismissed \nare identical in nature to all of the statements from November 15 and \nDecember 21 that the Hamdan majority quoted and cited in support of its \nconstruction of the DTA.\n  I should emphasize that although the Supreme Court was misled, I do \nnot believe that it was misled by any of my colleagues. I believe that \nSenators Levin, Leahy, Durbin, and Feingold acted entirely \nappropriately by submitting statements for the Record regarding their \ninterpretation of the DTA. As I mentioned, the Senate considered the \nfinal Defense bill that contained the DTA late in the evening four days \nbefore Christmas. Although the Senators who submitted statements for \nthe Record had every right to delight their colleagues with 6 hours of \nspeeches and debate at that hour, I am certain that every member of the \nSenate appreciated the fact that these statements were submitted for \nthe Record instead.\n  Where does the Court's mistake spring from then? The Supreme Court's \nmistake about the legislative history of the DTA appears to have been \ncreated by briefs filed by Mr. Neal Katyal, the counsel of record for \nMr. Hamdan in the Supreme Court. Much of the Hamdan majority's analysis \nof the DTA and its legislative history appears to have been adopted \nverbatim from these briefs. Mr. Katyal's brief, for example, wrongly \nasserts that the colloquy between Senator Kyl and me was ``inserted \ninto the Record after the legislation passed.'' Although statements for \nthe Record must be submitted on the same day that they are to appear in \nthe daily edition of the Record, no public record is kept of when \nexactly a particular statement was submitted. Mr. Katyal could not \npossibly have known whether my colloquy with Senator Kyl was submitted \nbefore or after final passage of the bill, unless he had asked me or my \nstaff, which he did not do. Had he done so, we would have happily \ninformed him that our statement was submitted hours before final \npassage. Yet he asserted to the Supreme Court that it was submitted \n``after the legislation passed,'' a misstatement that the Supreme Court \napparently believed and that it repeated in its majority opinion.\n  Mr. Katyal's brief also asserts that my colloquy with Senator Kyl was \n``entirely post hoc,'' and that Senator Kyl and I ``waited until the \nink was dry'' to submit our views. However, his brief's extensive \ncitations to those December 21 statements that favored petitioner \nHamdan are not accompanied by similar bold disclaimers.\n  Indeed, the very statements of Senators Leahy, Durbin, and Feingold \nthat the Supreme Court believed had been made ``during the debate \nitself' appear to have been brought to the court's attention by Mr. \nKatyal's brief. That passage of the brief makes no mention of the fact \nthat these statements were not spoken live on the Senate floor. The \nbrief also quotes at length from the same statement by Senator Levin on \nNovember 15 from which the Supreme Court later quoted in its opinion. \nNot only does the brief fail to warn the reader that this statement was \nnot spoken live, the brief even asserts that ``[e]vidence of reliance \non Senator Levin's statement was immediate,'' and it cites to a \nstatement by Senator Reid that refers to Senator Levin's views.\n\n  I can see how a reasonable person would understand this passage to \nmean that Senator Levin's and Senator Reid's statements were spoken \nlive on the Senate floor. The brief conjures up a scene of one Senator \nlistening to another Senator speak and then ``immediately'' rising to \nexpress his agreement. Yet that scene never took place. Neither Senator \nLevin's nor Senator Reid's remarks were made live on the Senate floor.\n  In the usual case, I do not think that an attorney would have a duty \nto tell a court whether the Senate floor statements that he is citing \nare live or not. Indeed, most attorneys would have no way of knowing \nwhether a particular statement is live. Under Senate rules, submitted \nstatements that pertain to pending Senate business are presumed to be \nlive statements and are automatically included in the Record among live \ndebate. In my opinion, this is critical to the effective and efficient \nfunctioning of the Chamber. I am confident that my colleagues would \nagree with me.\n  Here, however, Mr. Katyal made a point of seeking to discredit \nstatements in the Congressional Record on the basis that they had not \nbeen spoken live. Given that he stressed the introduction of some \nstatements, I believe it was incumbent on him to inform the Court that \nthe statements on which he relied also were not spoken live.\n  I should again emphasize that I do not criticize any of my colleagues \nin the Senate. Senators Levin, Leahy, Durbin, and Feingold's actions \nwere entirely honorable and aboveboard. Indeed, Senators Leahy, Durbin, \nand Feingold, as well as others who opposed the DTA had every right to \nhave their opinions, thoughts, and intent recorded, both in November \nand in December.\n  In closing, I would also like to express my concern about the \nsoundness of the distinction that the Hamdan majority drew between live \nand submitted statements. Although the reality of Senate floor debate \nis not quite as unflattering as what Justice Scalia suggests in his \ndissent, it is true that live speeches made by Senators are not always \nheard by other Members. Senate floor debate is only one of the many \nsources of information on which Senators rely when deciding how to cast \ntheir votes. Other than when Senators express agreement with one \nanother through a colloquy or by expressly referring to each other's \nviews, Senate floor statements should not be understood to represent \nthe understandings and intentions of anyone other than the Member \nmaking the statement. Nor should the courts assume that Senators are \nunaware of court precedent and rules of construction.\n  I hope that this statement will prevent further mischaracterization \nof the legislative record of the Detainee Treatment Act. Senators \nLevin, Leahy, Durbin, and Feingold's December comments on the act are \nall entitled to consideration, but no more so than mine or Senator \nKyl's. The Supreme Court was misled in Hamdan, and it appears to have \nbased its decision, at least in part, on a simple mistake of fact. That \nis a result that all those who respect the democratic process and the \nrule of law should regret.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/08/03/senate-section/article/S8780-1", "month": "08", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8780-S8781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  REMEMBERING U.S. SENATOR HIRAM FONG\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, on August 18, 2006, I will have the honor \nand privilege to commemorate the 47th anniversary of the admission of \nHawaii to the United States by dedicating the building housing the \nKapalama Post Office in honor of the late U.S. Senator Hiram L. Fong. \nIt is fitting that on Admissions Day, the State of Hawaii commemorates \nthe life of one of its strongest advocates for statehood--Senator \nFong--by dedicating the postal facility at 1271 North King Street in \nHonolulu, which stands near Senator Fong's boyhood home in Kalihi.\n  Like so many of us with immigrant parents, Senator Fong will be \nremembered not only for his many accomplishments but also for his \nhumble beginnings. As one of 11 children born to parents from China, he \ngraduated with honors from the University of Hawaii in 1930, and \ncontinued his education at Harvard University where he received a law \ndegree 5 years later. In 1959, when Hawaii achieved statehood, he was \nelected to fill one of two seats in the U.S. Senate where he served \nfrom 1959 until January 2, 1977.\n  Senator Fong was this Nation's first U.S. Senator of Asian ancestry. \nHe\n\n[[Page S8781]]\n\nserved as the ranking Republican on what was then the Senate Post \nOffice and Civil Service Committee, which is why I am so glad we are \nmarking his life's work by dedicating this post office in his memory. I \nknew Hiram Fong, and I found him to be a man of great integrity. He was \na compassionate advocate for civil rights and workers' rights, and \nthroughout his 20 years of service in Congress, Senator Fong \npersonified the spirit of bipartisan cooperation. He was instrumental \nin enacting landmark civil rights legislation; reforming U.S. \nimmigration laws to end discrimination against Asian immigrants; \nimproving job training programs for workers; and fighting for equal pay \nfor women. The people of Hawaii were truly fortunate to have been \nrepresented by Hiram Fong.\n  This son of Hawaii passed away on August 18, 2004, at the age of 97, \nfollowed by his wife Ellyn on March 25 of this year. Hiram and Ellyn \nare survived by 4 children, Hiram, Jr., Rodney, Marvin, and Mari-Ellen; \n10 grandchildren; and 2 great-grandchildren. As we remember our good \nfriend, Hiram Fong, on this Admissions Day, I ask my Senate colleagues \nand the people of Hawaii to pause for a moment to remember all he did \non behalf of the Nation and his beloved Aloha State.\n  Mr. President, as the former chairman of the Senate Postal \nSubcommittee, I was proud to introduce the legislation designating the \nKapalama Post Office in memory of my friend, Senator Hiram Fong. The \nSenate passed my bill, S. 2089, by unanimous consent on March 3 of this \nyear; the House of Representatives took action on March 7; and on March \n20, the President signed the bill, which is now Public Law 109-203.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/08/03/senate-section/article/S8781-1", "month": "08", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      VOTING RIGHTS ACT REAUTHORIZATION AND AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2006\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Now that Congress has passed the \nlaw--and the President has signed it--it is up to the President to \nensure that this law and all of its provisions are enforced fully and \nfaithfully. I was pleased last Thursday to hear the President commit to \naggressive enforcement and to defend the Act from legal attacks. \nArticle I of the Constitution provides for the Congress to write the \nlaws, and Article II provides for the President to enforce them. \nCongress has done its part, and now the President must do his. I \ncommended him for saying that he will.\n  Last week I spoke to the Senate about a letter I had sent to the \nPresident in which I urged him not to follow his usual practice of \nsigning a bill with his fingers crossed behind his back and later \nissuing a presidential signing statement undercutting the law that \nCongress passed. I return today to report to the Senate that, to the \nbest of my knowledge, the President has accepted that advice and has \nnot issued an after-the-fact signing statement. I thank the President \nfor following this course. In fact, the material posted on the White \nHouse website includes a ``fact sheet'' in which the White House \nreaffirms the President's commitment ``to vigorously enforce the \nprovisions of the law and to defend it in court.''\n  The Voting Rights Act is the keystone in the foundation of civil \nrights laws and is one of the most important methods of protecting all \nAmericans' foundational right to vote. Several generations have kept \nthe chain of support for the Voting Rights Act unbroken, and now we \nhave once again done our part to continue that legacy and revitalize \nthe Act.\n  We know that effective enforcement of these provisions is vital in \nfighting against discrimination that, unfortunately, still exists in \nthis nation today. As the President has acknowledged, the wound is not \nhealed and there is more to do to protect the rights of all Americans \nto vote and have their votes count.\n  I also note for the record that today, two weeks after final passage \nof the House bill to reauthorize and revitalize the Voting Rights Act, \nand one week after the President signed that historic legislation into \nlaw, copies of Senate Report 109-295 have finally been printed. This is \nthe committee report on S.2703 that I commented on during my statement \nto the Senate on July 27. It contains the objection of all eight \nDemocratic members of the committee. As previously noted, it is unusual \nin that it does not represent the views of a majority of the committee \nand certainly does not represent the views of the Democratic sponsors \nof that Senate legislation.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                        Washington, July 27, 2006.\n       I send greetings to those celebrating the reauthorization \n     of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n       The Voting Rights Act is one of the most important pieces \n     of legislation in our Nation's history. It has been vital to \n     guaranteeing the right to vote for generations of Americans \n     and has helped millions of our citizens enjoy the full \n     promise of freedom. By refusing to give in to discrimination \n     and segregation, heroes of the Civil Rights Movement called \n     our country back to its founding ideals of freedom and \n     opportunity for everyone. Leaders like Martin Luther King, \n     Jr., and Thurgood Marshall believed in the constitutional \n     guarantees of liberty and equality and trusted their fellow \n     Americans to do the right thing to ensure these blessings for \n     every man, woman, and child.\n       Over the years, our Nation has grown more prosperous and \n     powerful, and it has also grown more equal and just. Yet, \n     further work remains in the fight against injustice, and each \n     generation has a responsibility to write a new chapter in the \n     unfinished story of freedom. Reauthorizing this legislation \n     is an example of our continued commitment to a united America \n     where every person is valued and treated with dignity and \n     respect.\n       America is grateful for the sacrifices of citizens such as \n     Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta Scott King, after \n     whom the bill reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act was named. \n     I also appreciate the members of the House and Senate for \n     passing this historic legislation. By working together, we \n     can help build an America that lives up to our guiding \n     principle that all men and women are created equal.\n       Laura and I send our best wishes on this special occasion.\n     George W. Bush.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/08/03/senate-section/article/S8781-2", "month": "08", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8781-S8782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                Private First Class Derek James Plowman\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to a brave \nyoung man from Arkansas who lost his life while serving our Nation in \nuniform. PFC Derek James Plowman is remembered by those who knew him \nbest as a compassionate soul, who was always quick to bring a smile to \nthe faces of those around him. Having grown up in a large family that \nwas often filled with laughter, he quickly became the life of every \nparty, developing a special gift for being at ease in large groups and \nbrightening the spirits of the people he came in contact with.\n  Shortly after moving to northwest Arkansas from Florida in 2004, \nPrivate First Class Plowman graduated from Valley Springs High School. \nHoping to study psychology some day, he enlisted in the Arkansas Army \nNational Guard for an opportunity to earn money towards his college \neducation. It was also an opportunity for him to serve his country, a \ndecision that personified the selfless attitude of this young man.\n  In the Guard, Private First Class Plowman was a cook assigned to the \n142nd Brigade, a brigade comprised of citizen soldiers from north and \nnorthwest Arkansas. Upon returning home from basic training, he was \ninformed by one of his superior officers that he would soon be \nmobilized for service in Operation Iraqi Freedom. With courage and \nreassurance, he looked his Sergeant in the eye and said ``That's OK. I \nsigned on the dotted line and I've got a job to do.''\n  The 142nd was mobilized for duty in Iraq on December 7, 2005, and was \nscheduled to return next summer. Tragically, Private First Class \nPlowman died from a gunshot wound on\n\n[[Page S8782]]\n\nJuly 20 while serving with his brigade in Baghdad. In a memorial \nservice at Valley Springs High School, over 200 mourners gathered to \npay their respects for this fallen soldier and to comfort his family. \nHe was later laid to rest at Western Grove Cemetery in Harrison, AR.\n  The loss of this special young man is a sobering reminder of the \ntragic human cost of war. The loss of any of our brave men and women in \nuniform is felt by not only their friends and loved ones but also by \ncommunities and families across our Nation that they fought to defend.\n  Words cannot adequately express the sorrow felt in the hearts of the \nfamily and loved ones of Derek Plowman, but I pray they can find solace \nin the courageous way he lived his life. My thoughts and prayers are \nwith his mother and stepfather, Kim and Andrew Campbell, his father, \nDonald Plowman, his brothers and sisters, and with all those who knew \nand loved him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/08/03/senate-section/article/S8782-1", "month": "08", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On July 28, 2006, in Detroit, MI, Julia Lynn Marsh, a male \ntransvestite, was physically and verbally assaulted by three men. \nAccording to sources, Marsh suffered injuries to the head after being \nstruck by a crowbar. It appears Marsh was targeted solely because of \nhis sexual orientation.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/08/03/senate-section/article/S8782-2", "month": "08", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   GULF OF MEXICO ENERGY SECURITY ACT\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Senate passed one of the most \nimportant bills it has considered this year. We passed legislation that \nI believe is the most important thing we can do in the near-term to \nstabilize our energy prices and expand our energy supply.\n  This is American can-do legislation. With this bill, we are bringing \nvast reserves of American energy onshore from the American real estate \nthat we own out in the ocean.\n  We are doing it safely, cleanly, and responsibly. We are bringing \nthis clean energy onshore so our businesses can prosper, our farmers \ncan prosper, and American families can have much needed relief from \nhigh energy costs.\n  Right now, energy is on all of our minds. Oil prices continue to \nclimb because of instability in oil rich regions. Today, oil hovers at \njust below $75 a barrel. Natural gas prices are climbing because of the \nintense heat in many regions of our country. This week, the price \njumped 11 percent in 1 day, and right now it is at $8.05 per million \nBtu--that price is four times higher than it was 6 years ago.\n  Let me tell you why Americans care so much. Between 1999 and 2005, \nthe price of natural gas in the United States increased by 289 percent. \nAt the same time, we lost over 3 million U.S. jobs in the manufacturing \nsector.\n  The heat wave gripping our Nation has made energy supply and energy \nprices a topic of real concern for all of us. As I speak, the lights in \nthe hallways of the Senate and House office buildings are dimmed to \nconserve energy during this heat wave.\n  I think it is fitting that during a time of strong national concern \nover our soaring energy prices, the Senate will pass by what I expect \nto be a wide margin a bill to bring 1.2 billion barrels of oil and 5.8 \ntrillion cubic feet of natural gas to market. Every once in awhile, we \nget it just right. This is one of those times.\n  I am particularly pleased that we did this bill in a way that \nreinvests in our environment. For decades, our coastal States have \nproduced much of the oil and gas this Nation consumes. They will no \nlonger sit back and go along with leasing without the compensation \nneeded to fix the energy infrastructure and coastal environment that is \nso critical to our domestic energy survival.\n  Our coastal States provide 27 percent of our oil and 20 percent of \nthe natural gas. MMS estimates that Gulf of Mexico production is \nexpected to rise within the next several years to about 23 percent of \nour Nation's natural gas production and 40 percent of U.S. oil \nproduction.\n  In addition, our coastal States host nearly 50 percent of our \nrefining infrastructure. The hurricanes last fall and the soaring \nenergy prices afterward reminded all of us how critical the coastal \nStates' production and infrastructure are to our energy supply.\n  I am pleased that today marks the beginning of the end of the days of \nturning our backs on our coastal States while we turn our energy \ndollars over to hostile regimes.\n  I am pleased that the bill invests a portion of our royalties in the \ncoastal States and the coastal environment instead of forfeiting all \nroyalties and sending that money to hostile governments to buy their \nenergy. I hope the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act marks the \nbeginning of the end of this long cycle of sending our dollars abroad \nto buy the energy we use here at home.\n  This bill represents America stepping up to the plate to solve our \nenergy problems. It opens up 8.3 million new acres to development of \nnearly 6 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 1.26 billion barrels of \noil. We are talking about enough natural gas to heat and cool nearly 6 \nmillion homes for 15 years.\n  The proof of the substantive merits of this bill lies in is its broad \nsupport around the Nation from America's agricultural community, \nmanufacturing community, producers of chemicals and plastics, the \ntextile industry, the utility sector, and small businesses. Literally, \nthousands of consumer groups representing millions of Americans and \nmillions of American jobs say the same thing--that S. 3711 provides the \nmuch needed relief for the American people.\n  That is why this bill is right for America. It is right for our \nnational security. It is right for our economy, our businesses, our \nfarms, and our families. I am pleased at the strong support for this \nmeasure.\n  I thank the following Energy Committee staff for their hard work on \nthis bill: Frank Macchiarola, Bruce Evans, Marnie Funk, Angela Harper, \nKara Gleason, and Kristina Rolph.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/08/03/senate-section/article/S8782-3", "month": "08", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8782-S8783]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOMINATIONS HOLDS\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the plight of countless rural communities \nin Oregon and across the country may take a turn for the worse due to \nthe impending expiration of the county payments legislation. For this \nreason, I am putting a hold on the following two Bush nominees to \nexpress my continuing dissatisfaction with the administration's lack of \nattention to the needs of people in more than 700 rural counties in \nover 40 States: John Ray Correll, Director of the Office of Surface \nMining, Interior Department and Mark Myers, Director of the U.S. \nGeological Services, Interior Department.\n  In addition, I would also object to any unanimous consent allowing \nMr. Correll, Mr. Myers, and Mr. Bernhardt to remain on the calendar. \nInstead, I request that these three nominations be returned to the \nWhite House during the congressional August recess. Rule 31 paragraph 6 \nof the Senate Rules provides that when the Senate will be in recess for \nmore than 30 days, any nomination in committee or on the Senate \nCalendar must be returned to the White House unless the Senate, by \nunanimous consent, allows a nominee to remain on the calendar.\n  To date, the administration has proposed only one solution to funding \ncounty payments, and it is one that many of us find unacceptable. The \ncounty payments law, which provides a stable revenue source for \neducation, roads and other county services in rural areas, is due to \nexpire at the end of this year. In early 2005, I cosponsored a \nbipartisan bill, S. 267, to reauthorize county payments for another 7\n\n[[Page S8783]]\n\nyears. In February, the administration proposed reauthorizing the law \nfor only 5 years while cutting funding by 60 percent and funding that \nreduced portion with a controversial Federal land sale scheme.\n  Senator Baucus and I have proposed a sensible, alternative funding \nsource for county payments. Our legislation fully funds county payments \nby ensuring that a portion of Federal taxes are withheld from payments \nby the Federal government to government contractors. The Federal \nGovernment currently does not withhold taxes when it pays government \ncontractors. In May, the Republican-led Congress approved a major tax \nbill that uses our funding provision to instead provide tax cuts for \nthe most fortunate Americans, leaving rural counties with fewer options \nand growing fiscal concerns.\n  As I have said before, I will hold these nominees and every nominee \ncoming after them, if necessary, until the administration steps to the \nplate and delivers some leadership in finding a way to fund county \npayments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/08/03/senate-section/article/S8783-1", "month": "08", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8783]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            RENEWABLE ENERGY\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator Grassley and \nother distinguished Senate colleagues in cosponsoring S. Con. Res. 97. \nUnder this concurrent resolution, the United States sets a goal to \nprovide at least 25 percent of the total energy consumed in the United \nStates from renewable resources by January 1, 2025.\n  I have said many times and very firmly believe that our energy future \nwill be grown on our farms, ranches, and forests.\n  In my State of Montana, our farmers are already producing food and \nfiber for our country. Before long, they will be producing food, fiber, \nand fuel as agriculture will become part of the energy business. It is \nimportant we have the technology available so we do not have to choose \nbetween producing food or fuel. In Montana and elsewhere, technology is \nalready being developed to produce cellulosic ethanol. Unlike \ntraditional corn-based ethanol, cellulosic ethanol will use materials \nsuch as wheat straw and barley straw. These materials, once discarded \nas waste, can now be turned into energy.\n  On August 8, 2005, this Congress passed one of the most comprehensive \nenergy research, development, and conservation bills this country has \nseen in decades: the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Now, just 1 year later, \nthe initial outcomes are impressive. Twenty-seven new ethanol plants \nhave broken ground. Over 400 E85 pumps have been installed. New wind \npower production has spurred over $3 billion in economic activity and \ngenerated 2,000 megawatts of new usable wind power online. These \nfigures are staggering but pale in comparison to the accomplishments \nthat are possible in the next 20 years.\n  We have set an ambitious goal. I am pleased this resolution does not \ninclude mandates for how to achieve this energy vision. The combination \nof American ingenuity and widespread public support for this initiative \nwill move the free market toward achieving this attainable goal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/08/03/senate-section/article/S8783-2", "month": "08", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8783]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HOSTILITIES BETWEEN HEZBOLLAH AND ISRAEL\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Dodd, Senator \nSununu and our other cosponsors in offering Senate Resolution 548, \nwhich expresses the sense of the Senate regarding the need for the \nUnited States and the international community to take certain actions \nwith respect to the hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel.\n  Like all Americans, I am deeply concerned about the ongoing violence \nand the loss of civilian lives in the Middle East.\n  Hezbollah, an organization on the State Department's list of \nterrorist organizations, must accept full responsibility for sparking \nthis latest round of violence. I support Israel's right to defend \nitself in response to Hezbollah's acts of terrorism against it. As this \nresolution urges, I hope that the governments of Iran and Syria will \nend their material and logistical support for Hezbollah and use their \nsignificant influence over Hezbollah to disarm the group and release \nall kidnapped prisoners.\n  As this resolution also urges, I favor the United States and the \ninternational community working with the governments of Israel and \nLebanon on an urgent basis to attain a cessation in the hostilities \nbetween Hezbollah and Israel based on: the safe return of Israeli \nsoldiers held by Hezbollah; the disarmament of Hezbollah, the removal \nof all Hezbollah forces from southern Lebanon, and the replacement of \nthose forces with army and security forces of the Government of \nLebanon; an reaching an agreement to fully implement United Nations \nSecurity Counsel Resolution 1559 and to create and deploy an \ninternational stabilization force with a clear mandate to enforce a \npermanent ceasefire.\n  I also hope that the U.S. Government and the international community \nwill work together to organize an international donors conference to \nsolicit and ensure the provision of international support for the \nreconstruction of Lebanon's infrastructure; and to remain engaged to \npromote sustainable peace and security for Israel and Lebanon and the \ngreater Middle East.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/08/03/senate-section/article/S8783-3", "month": "08", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8783-S8792]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             EUROPEAN UNION COMPLIANCE TO THE KYOTO TREATY\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to address a growing misperception \nconcerning the European Union's ability to meet its obligations under \nthe Kyoto Treaty. There are many climate change skeptics who claim that \nthe EU will not be able to meet their greenhouse gas emission reduction \ntargets under the Kyoto Treaty. In turn, they argue that the U.S. \nshould not participate in any ``cap and trade'' system for the \nreduction of greenhouse gas emissions.\n  Under the Kyoto Treaty, the EU has committed to greenhouse gas \nreductions target of 8 percent below their 1990 emission levels and \ncovers the years 2008 through 2012. This target is shared by the 15 EU \nmember states, EU-15, that existed at the time of the EU ratification \nof the protocol in May 2001. An additional 10 countries joined the EU \nin May 2004, eight of which have individual targets under Kyoto that \nrange from 6 to 8 percent below the 1990 levels. Two of them, Malta and \nCyprus, are developing countries and, therefore, do not have any \nemission targets under the treaty.\n  In December 2005, the EU, as required by the Kyoto Treaty, reported \non the progress made toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The \nreport indicated that EU policies and actions by member states to date \nhave made annual carbon dioxide emissions reductions of 5.5 percent in \nthe year 2003 across all 25 of the EU member states, EU-25.\n  The report makes the following assessments:\n  For the EU-15:\n\n       Existing measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases \n     that are projected to be 1.6 percent below the year 1990 \n     levels in 2010. Savings from additional domestic policies and \n     measures being planned by the EU-15 would result in total \n     emission reductions of 6.8 percent.\n       EU-15 member states forecast that they will be able to \n     achieve lower emissions of 9.3 percent below the year 1990 \n     levels through the use of the Kyoto flexibility mechanisms in \n     the year 2010. They include such activities as emissions \n     trading, forest sequestration, and participating in \n     International projects that result in greenhouse gas \n     reductions through the Joint Implementation and Clean \n     Development Mechanism programs.\n\n  For the EU-25:\n       The total of all member states' projections of greenhouse \n     gas emissions will be 5 percent below base year levels in \n     2010 as a result of measures already implemented.\n       The implementation of additional measures is projected to \n     reduce the EU-25 greenhouse gas emissions to 9.3 percent \n     below 1990 levels by 2010 and, with the use of Kyoto \n     flexibility mechanisms, to 11.3 percent below the year 1990 \n     levels.\n\n  The December 2005 report concludes that the EU-15 states can meet \ntheir target of 8 percent below the 1990 levels if the additional \ndomestic measures and the Kyoto flexibility mechanisms that are planned \nare implemented.\n  According to the February 14, 2006 statement of the acting head of \nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Richard \nKinley, 34 industrialized countries under the Kyoto Treaty were ``on \ntheir way to lower their emissions levels by at least 3.5% below the \n1990 levels during the first commitment period.'' ``With the help of \nadditional measures and the use of Kyoto market-based mechanisms, they \nwill as a group be able reach their agreed Kyoto reduction targets.''\n\n[[Page S8784]]\n\n  In June, the European Environment Agency issued the Annual European \nCommunity Greenhouse Gas Inventory 1990-2004 and Inventory Report 2006. \nThe report indicates that the EU-15 greenhouse gas emissions for 2004 \nincreased by 0.3 percent--11.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide \nequivalents--over 2003. However, compared to the base year, emissions \nin 2004 were 0.9 percent lower. Assuming a linear target path from 1990 \nto 2010, total EU-15 greenhouse gas emissions were 4.7 index points \nabove this target path in 2004. It should be noted that this linear \ntarget path is not intended as an approximation of past and future \nemission trends. It does provide a measure of how close the EU-15 \nemissions are in 2004 to a linear path of emissions from 1990 to the \nKyoto target period of 2008-2012, assuming that only domestic measures \nwill be used. Therefore, it is not a measure of future compliance of \nthe EU-15 with its greenhouse gas emission targets in 2008-2012, but \naims at evaluating overall EU-15 greenhouse emissions in 2004 alone.\n  The EU is fully committed to the Kyoto Treaty. It has adopted a \nseries of policies and measures, such as the EU's greenhouse gas \nemissions trading scheme, to meet its target in a cost-effective \nmanner. The most recent projections show that these measures, together \nwith the EU's participation in the global carbon market, will allow the \nEU to meet its target.\n  To ensure its compliance with the Kyoto Protocol, the EU has adopted \na series of measures under the European Climate Change Programme, ECCP. \nMost of these measures have recently entered into force and will start \nto show their full effect over the next few years. These include:\n  The EU greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme; the promotion of \nelectricity from renewable energy sources; the promotion of \ncogeneration, CHP; increasing the energy performance of buildings; the \npromotion of the use of biofuels for transport; the reduction of land-\nfilling of biodegradable waste\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record documents from \nthe European Commission and the European Environmental Agency's reports \nwhich summarize the EU's efforts to address climate change.

ECCP policies and \nother actions by Member States to date, in combination with \nrestructuring of European industry, particularly in Central and Eastern \nEurope, have contributed to an absolute reduction of annual carbon \ndioxide emissions of some 305 million tonnes, 4.8 percent, across the \nEU-25 in 2004.\n  Attachment II provides an overview of the performance of individual \nMember States. In 2004, the EU-15, which shares the EU's Kyoto target \nof an 8 percent reduction, had reduced their greenhouse gas emissions \nby 0.9 percent compared to 1990 levels even though they recorded \neconomic growth of 32 percent from 1990 to 2004. The average EU-15 \nmember state's emissions over the most recent 5-year period are \ncurrently 2 percent below 1990 level.\n  Attachment III provides an overview of the planned use by individual \nMember States of the Kyoto mechanisms. The EU will make use of the \ncost-effective reduction options offered by its participation in the \nglobal carbon market, based on the Kyoto's flexible mechanisms, to meet \nits target.\n  In summary Mr. President, the EU has made good progress and its \nultimate success will depend upon the speed and thoroughness of the \nimplementation by Member States of legislative and domestic measures. \nTotal projections for the EU-15 Member States show that the Kyoto \ntargets can be met if Member States implement additional planned \ndomestic measures and use the flexible mechanisms.\n  Despite this meaningful progress, the EU realizes that much more has \nto be done. Its climate change policy does not stop in 2012, the end of \nthe Kyoto Treaty. The European Commission has also adopted a \nCommunication outlining key elements for a strategy for further action \npost 2012. They include: the need for broader participation by \ncountries and sectors; the development of low-carbon technologies; the \ncontinued and expanded use of market-based instruments; and the need to \nadapt to the inevitable impacts of climate change. A follow-up \nCommunication with proposals for concrete steps at European and \ninternational levels is planned for the end of 2006.\n  These policies, and others like them, provide the necessary strong, \nlong-term signals to industry, EU Member State governments, and the \nwider international community that the EU is committed to tackling \nclimate change and expects all of its institutions, businesses, and \ncitizens to do their part.\n  Many here in the US will try to use another country's failure or \ninaction as an excuse for not doing anything. But it is just that, an \nexcuse. The harsh reality is that we all need to be doing more--and \nthat means the United States too. Just as we cannot allow the EU \nchallenges to serve as the basis for our inaction, I certainly hope \nthat the EU would not allow our lack of action to hinder their efforts \nto address this significant problem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/08/03/senate-section/article/S8792-1", "month": "08", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8792]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    GRAND OPENING OF THE ROTARY CLUBS OF MODESTO CENTENNIAL JUNCTION\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I celebrate the grand opening \nof the Rotary Clubs of Modesto Centennial Junction section of the \nVirginia Corridor and to recognize the United Rotary Clubs of Modesto's \nextraordinary contributions and support for the Virginia Corridor \nRails-to-Trails project. When I visited the site in July of 2002, the \nVirginia Corridor was very much just an idea. However, as a result of \nthe hard work of a number of city officials and staff members, and the \ndetermination of a group of motivated citizens, the entire Virginia \nCorridor will soon become a reality.\n  The United Rotary Clubs of Modesto, an organization that played an \ninstrumental role to this project, is comprised of the five local \nRotary clubs: the Modesto Rotary Club, the Modesto East Rotary Club, \nthe Modesto Gateway Rotary Club, the Modesto North Rotary Club, and the \nModesto Sunrise Rotary Club. Together, the local rotary clubs \ncontributed significant funding for the trail segment between Roseburg \nand Orangeburg Avenues. The rotary clubs donated and installed \nlighting, a 10-foot wide asphalt trail surface, a kiosk, fencing and \nirrigation. This quarter mile trail, which will be known as the Rotary \nClubs of Modesto Centennial Junction of the Virginia Corridor, features \na trail with lighting, landscaping, benches, picnic tables and seat \nwalls.\n  The Virginia Corridor Rails-to-Trails project is a truly \ncollaborative effort between the city of Modesto, the State of \nCalifornia, the Federal Government, and a host of local community \ninterests that, once completed, will successfully transform a once \nabandoned rail corridor into a premier linear park, trail and \nrecreational gathering place in one of the fastest growing cities in \nCalifornia's Central Valley.\n  When completed, the Virginia Corridor will stretch nearly 4 miles \nfrom Modesto's central business district to the northern boundary of \nthe city. Once completed, this trail will link neighborhoods by \nproviding a safe and scenic commuter route to schools, parks, and \nrestaurants for bicyclists and pedestrians. The Virginia Corridor will \nalso offer a place for Modesto's outdoor enthusiasts to pursue a myriad \nof outdoor activities, as it will link three primary bike paths that \ninclude: the Hetch Hetchy Trail in North Modesto, the class I trails in \nDry Creek Regional Park and the Tuolumne River Regional Park.\n  I congratulate the city of Modesto on the opening of the Rotary Clubs \nof Modesto Centennial Junction of the Virginia Corridor. I especially \ncommend the invaluable contributions of the United Rotary Clubs of \nModesto which, through their generosity and commitment to public \nservice, have provided a community jewel that will go a long way \ntowards improving the quality of life for the people of \nModesto.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/08/03/senate-section/article/S8792-2", "month": "08", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8792]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HONORING OFFICER MICHEL O. CONLEY\n\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Officer \nMichel O. Conley, who lost his life in Colorado's Big Thompson Flood of \n1976.\n  Thirty years ago, more than 1 foot of rain fell in a matter of hours, \ncausing a flash flood in Big Thompson Canyon. One hundred and forty \nfour people were killed and over $30 million in property damage \noccurred. We remember those who died in this natural disaster and also \nthe survivors who had to rebuild their lives, working as a community to \nstart over again. This week, outside of my hometown of Loveland, CO, \nsurvivors of this tragedy gathered to commemorate the Big Thompson \nFlood. Though I could not be with them, my thoughts and prayers were. I \nspeak on the Senate floor today as a tribute to this special event.\n  I ask that the following letter, which I wrote for the Memorial \nService for Officer Michel O. Conley, be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows.\n                                                     July 31, 2006\n\nMemorial Service for Officer Michel O. Conley; 30th Anniversary of the \n                           Big Thompson Flood\n\n       Dear Ms. Marks and Guests: As we look back thirty years ago \n     today we remember the shock and devastation that took place \n     in the Big Thompson Canyon, and the loss of Officer Michel O. \n     Conley.\n       Joan and I arrived just after the crest from the flood had \n     passed through Loveland and were astounded by the \n     destruction. We were devastated by the tragedy which affected \n     our community.\n       The loss of Officer Michel Conley of the Estes Park Police \n     Department is part of that tragedy. However, in his acts of \n     service and selflessness he helped to prevent what could have \n     been more losses. He helped to save approximately 60 people \n     before he was lost in flood. His gallantry and bravery are to \n     be commended.\n       Joan's and my prayers and thoughts are with you today as \n     you commemorate the Big Thompson Canyon Flood and the life of \n     Officer Conley, and with all whose lives were affected by \n     this tragedy.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Wayne Allard,\n     U.S. Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/08/03/senate-section/article/S8792-3", "month": "08", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8792-S8793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  IN MEMORY OF DR. FELICIA H. STEWART\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to an \nextraordinary woman, renowned reproductive health expert Dr. Felicia \nHance Stewart. Dr. Stewart died on April 13 at the age of 63. Her \nenergy, compassion, intelligence and tireless commitment to\n\n[[Page S8793]]\n\nwomen's health made a difference for countless women in the U.S. and \naround the world.\n  Dr. Stewart's keen mind and affinity for medicine were apparent from \nher distinguished educational background. She received her bachelor of \narts degree from the University of California, Berkeley, graduating Phi \nBeta Kappa and with honors in biochemistry. In 1969, she received her \nM.D. degree from Harvard University Medical School. She did her \npostgraduate training at Cambridge City Hospital in Massachusetts and \nat the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center.\n  Dr. Stewart's passion for empowering women through increased access \nto reproductive health services was evident throughout her \nextraordinary career. Dr. Stewart began her practice in obstetrics and \ngynecology in Sacramento, working for Sutter Medical Group, doing \nclinical research with a focus on contraceptives. She also worked as \nassociate medical director of Planned Parenthood in Sacramento.\n  In 1994, Dr. Stewart was appointed Deputy Assistant Secretary for \nPopulation Affairs in the Clinton administration's Department of Health \nand Human Services, HHS. Working with then-Secretary of HHS Donna \nShalala, Dr. Stewart was the senior expert responsible for family \nplanning.\n  In 1996, she became director of Reproductive Health Programs at the \nHenry J. Kaiser Family Foundation in Menlo Park, CA. She was most \nrecently codirector of the Bixby Center for Reproductive Health \nResearch and Policy at UCSF.\n  Dr. Stewart wrote ``Understanding Your Body: Everywoman's Guide to a \nLifetime of Health,'' 1987, and ``My Body, My Health: The Concerned \nWoman's Guide to Gynecology and Health,'' 1979. She cowrote \n``Contraceptive Technology,'' a major professional reference book that \nhas been published in 18 editions, and ``Emergency Contraception: The \nNation's Best Kept Secret.'' She also published nearly 100 scientific \njournal articles.\n  Dr. Stewart's passionate and reasoned advocacy for increasing access \nto emergency contraception brought national attention to this critical \nwomen's health issue. Dr. Stewart was instrumental in conducting \nresearch which established that emergency contraception was safe and \neffective without a physician's prescription. Her research has helped \nincrease access to emergency contraception in pharmacies throughout \nCalifornia.\n  In 1973, after Roe v. Wade was handed down, none of us thought we \nstill would be fighting the same battle to protect fundamental women's \nreproductive rights in 2006. But the fight is more challenging than \never. Not only are we fighting to maintain abortion rights, but access \nto comprehensive health services, including contraception.\n  Dr. Felicia Stewart was at the forefront of that fight throughout her \ncareer. Her work helped prevent countless unintended pregnancies and \nempowered women to take control of their reproductive health. Dr. \nStewart impacted many lives, from the women and men she served in \nclinics to the doctors, researchers and activists she inspired to \nfollow in her footsteps. She leaves us with the inspiration to work \nharder and never give up the fight to secure the full range of \nreproductive health services for women. She leaves a lasting legacy \nthat will not be forgotten.\n  Dr. Stewart is survived by her son Matthew Stewart and daughter \nKathryn Stewart; her parents Lena and Harold Hance; her brother Allan \nHance; stepchildren Tammy Barlow, Wayne Stewart, and Michael Stewart.\n  I am proud to have stood with Dr. Felicia Stewart in our fight to \nincrease access to women's reproductive health services. She was a \nwonderful ally and supporter of my work in the Senate. She will be \ngreatly missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/08/03/senate-section/article/S8793-1", "month": "08", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MEL STREETER\n\n Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, earlier this summer, Seattle lost \none of its most impressive and inspiring leaders. As an outstanding \narchitect and an extraordinary man, Mel Streeter left his mark on our \ncommunity and changed the lives of so many.\n  When he died on Monday, June 12, we lost a great friend and a true \npioneer.\n  For more than 50 years, Mel's dedication, optimism, and good cheer \nmade him a Seattle institution. For years to come, his creativity, \ngenerosity, and mentorship will provide a model and an inspiration.\n  As one of the first African-American architects to lead a Seattle \nfirm, Mel broke down barriers and created new opportunities for others \nwho followed.\n  As a proud and active member of Tabor 100, the America Institute of \nArchitects Seattle Diversity Roundtable, and the Seattle Planning \nCommission, he strengthened our region and shaped its growth.\n  And as a tireless advocate for low-income and senior housing, Mel \nshowed his bold spirit and his big heart.\n  His ingenuity and influence live on across the Pacific Northwest.\n  We are all so lucky to have seen Mel's vision made real in beautiful \nstructures across our State. We are luckier still to have had him in \nour lives.\n  Next week, the people of Seattle will come together at a special \nmemorial ceremony to celebrate Mel Streeter's life. My prayers and \nthoughts are with his wife Kathy and sons Doug, Jon, Ken, and Kurt. May \nyour memories serve always as a source of comfort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/08/03/senate-section/article/S8793-2", "month": "08", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       125TH NATIONAL ENCAMPMENT\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, today I commemorate the Sons of \nUnion Veterans of the Civil War on the occasion of its 125th National \nEncampment being held August 10 through the 14 in Harrisburg, PA. The \nevent honors the brave men who fought to preserve our Nation during the \nCivil War.\n  In 1866, Union Veterans of the Civil War organized into the Grand \nArmy of the Republic, GAR, and became a social and political force that \nwould control the destiny of the Nation for more than six decades. \nMembership in the veterans' organization was restricted to individuals \nwho had served in the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, or Revenue Cutter \nService during the Civil War. In 1881, the GAR formed the Sons of \nVeterans of the United States of America to carry on its traditions and \nmemory. On August 20, 1954, the U.S. Congress, under the leadership of \nGEN Douglas MacArthur and GEN Ulyssess S. Grant, III, formally \nchartered the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War.\n  Today, more than 6,500 members represent the Union Veterans of the \nCivil War throughout the United States. Their members devote a great \ndeal of time, energy, and resources to preserve the history of the \ncivil war in schools throughout the United States. They study the \nAmerican Civil War from all perspectives in order to facilitate a \ndeeper understanding of one of the most important events in our \nNation's history.\n  In closing, I would like to again praise the Sons of Union Veterans \nof the Civil War on the occasion of its anniversary for its work to \nperpetuate and honor the brave men who fought for us to preserve our \nNation. As a veteran myself, I understand the importance of honoring \nour veterans and preserving our history, especially that of the Civil \nWar. I hope my colleagues in the Senate join me in honoring the work of \nthe Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/08/03/senate-section/article/S8793-3", "month": "08", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8793-S8794]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   125TH ANNIVERSARY OF MAYVILLE, ND\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize a \ncommunity in North Dakota that recently celebrated its 125th \nanniversary. On July 27-30, the residents of Mayville gathered to \ncelebrate their community's history and founding.\n  Mayville's post office first opened on June 20, 1877, under the \nguidance of Mrs. Alvin Arnold, who served as the postmaster. It is \nbelieved that the community may have been named after her daughter May \nor for the wife of another postmaster in a nearby town. In 1888, led by \nMayor E.M. Paulson, Mayville became a city.\n  Today, Mayville is thriving. Located in the beautiful Goose River \nValley, Mayville prides itself on providing residents with a nice \ncountry living. Low crime, excellent education, and diverse economic \nopportunities set Mayville apart.\n  Mayville is also home to Mayville State University, which offers 2-\nyear and 4-year liberal arts and professional degrees to over 700 \nstudents of all ages. Mayville State was the fourth university in the \nNation to provide all of its\n\n[[Page S8794]]\n\nstudents with a notebook computer. It is also home to the Traill County \nTechnology Center, a business incubator.\n  Mayville celebrated its 125th anniversary with a weekend of events \nthat included parades, auctions, an all-school reunion, and community \nbreakfasts.\n  Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me in congratulating \nMayville, ND, and its residents on their first 125 years and in wishing \nthem well through the next century. By honoring Mayville and all the \nother historic small towns of North Dakota, we keep the great \npioneering frontier spirit alive for future generations. It is places \nsuch as Mayville that have helped to shape this country into what it is \ntoday, which is why this fine community is deserving of our \nrecognition.\n  Mayville has a proud past and a bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/08/03/senate-section/article/S8794-1", "month": "08", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8794]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE LIFE OF LEON EPSTEIN\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD.

Born in 1919 in Beaver Dam, he went on to study at \nthe University of Wisconsin-Madison, where he earned a B.A. and then an \nM.A. in economics. He then spent virtually his entire academic career \non the Madison campus, where for 40 years he was a beloved fixture in \nthe political science department--a department from which I was proud \nto graduate. He made an impact on countless students as he taught \nintroductory courses and supervised doctoral dissertations for four \ndecades.\n  Throughout his life, Leon remained dedicated to his own research and \nindependent work. He received many prestigious fellowship grants and \npublished six books. He was widely recognized for his book ``Political \nParties in Western Democracies,'' which received the first book award \nfrom the Political Organizations and Parties Section of the American \nPolitical Science Association. He also served as president of the \nMidwest Political Science Association, the British Politics Group, and \nthe American Political Science Association.\n  Leon also held the position of dean of the College of Letters and \nScience from 1965 to 1969. In every capacity, Leon earned the respect \nand friendship of those with whom he worked.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Texas \n     relative to memorializing Congress to enact legislation \n     relating to the assessment of penalties by a financial \n     institution for an insufficient funds check; to the Committee \n     on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n                       House Resolution No. 1300\n\n       Whereas, The paper check, one of the world's oldest and \n     most common forms of payment, is widely accepted in the \n     United States and internationally; it is used by businesses, \n     governments, and consumers as payment for almost every type \n     of commerce; and\n       Whereas, In most states, if the issuer of a check has \n     insufficient funds to cover that check, state law authorizes \n     a financial institution to impose a reasonable penalty \n     against the issuer in order to cover the administrative cost \n     of processing that dishonored check, and many financial \n     institutions elect to do precisely that; and\n       Whereas, In addition, the recipient's financial institution \n     may charge the recipient--who typically is unaware of the \n     check's dubious status--a penalty for the dishonored check \n     and possibly could go so far as to charge back to the \n     recipient's account the amount of the insufficient funds \n     check even if the recipient's financial institution had \n     already made the funds available to the recipient, which may \n     consequently create overdrafts of the recipient's account \n     resulting in the recipient incurring additional penalties \n     arising from those overdrafts; and\n       Whereas, Imposing a penalty upon the recipient of an \n     insufficient funds check is an unfair business practice \n     because it punishes the wrong party in this very common type \n     of financial transaction; and\n       Whereas, Because financial transactions involving checks \n     frequently cross state boundaries, it is desirable that a \n     uniform, nationwide standard be established to address this \n     problem; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the 79th \n     Texas Legislature hereby respectfully urge the Congress of \n     the United States to enact legislation to prohibit a \n     dishonored check recipient's financial institution from \n     assessing a penalty against the recipient and to instead \n     authorize the recipient's financial institution to assess a \n     penalty against the issuer's financial institution, which may \n     in turn pass that penalty down to the issuer; and, be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the chief clerk of the Texas House of \n     Representatives forward official copies of this resolution to \n     the president of the United States, to the speaker of the \n     house of representatives and the president of the senate of \n     the United States Congress, and to all the members of the \n     Texas delegation to the congress with the request that this \n     resolution be officially entered in the Congressional Record \n     as a memorial to the Congress of the United States of \n     America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/08/03/senate-section/article/S8799-1", "month": "08", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. ENZI, from the Committee on Health, Education, \n     Labor, and Pensions, with an amendment in the nature of a \n     substitute:\n       S. 843.

A bill to provide wage parity for certain prevailing rate \nemployees in Rhode Island; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Rhode Island \nFederal Worker Fairness Act of 2006. This bill will merge the \nNarragansett Bay wage area with the Boston, MA, wage area to provide \nRhode Island Federal blue-collar workers with pay equity in the region. \nThese workers include janitors, mechanics, machine tool operators, \nmunitions and explosive operators, electricians, and engineers.\n  Federal employees within the Narragansett Bay wage area are paid \nunder one of the lowest Federal wage system, FWS, pay scales while \nresiding in an area with one of the highest costs of living. \nSignificant disparities between Narragansett Bay wages and those in \nproximate wage areas raise serious questions about the fairness and \nequity of the Federal wage pay scales. The average wage grade worker in \nRhode Island earns $18.01 per hour compared to the same worker in \nBoston who earns $20.25 per hour or an employee in Hartford who earns \n$20.05 per hour. As a result, Rhode Island may be losing experienced \nFederal employees to the same jobs, at the same grade levels, just \nmiles away because of better pay. Enacting this legislation would help \nthe approximately 500 wage rate workers in Rhode Island better provide \nfor their families, and it will ensure that Rhode Island keeps \nqualified and trained Federal workers.\n  Roughly 80 percent of all FWS employees in the United States work \neither in the Department of Defense or the Department of Veteran \nAffairs. Indeed, Naval Station Newport employs the most FWS workers in \nthe Narragansett Bay area. These employees perform work that is \nimportant to our national security, and competitive compensation is the \nbest way to ensure that these workers are qualified and effective. \nMerging these two wage areas would reduce the disparity between the \nsalaries of these Federal workers and keep Federal workers in Rhode \nIsland from abandoning their Government jobs for higher paying \npositions in Massachusetts and Connecticut.\n\n[[Page S8805]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3784\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 to \nimprove surety bond guarantees, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Surety Bond \nImprovement Act, a bill designed to reinvigorate the Small Business \nAdministration's Surety Bond Guarantee Program. This bill's primary \npurpose is to ensure that small businesses are able to secure the \nsurety bonds they need to compete for contracts, grow, and hire more \nemployees.\n  Surety bonds are critical to small companies' survival and \ncompetitiveness. Without bonding, small firms cannot secure the \ncontracts they need to grow. Unfortunately, many new, small businesses \nlack the stable credit histories and assets they need to secure surety \nbonding. Many sureties also refuse to bond small companies because of \nthe greater risk that comes with insuring unproven firms. For many \nsmall businesses, difficulties obtaining surety bonds act as a barrier \nto entry and prevent them from competing in defense contracting, \nconstruction, services, and other markets.\n  Insuring against loss, surety bonds are most often used on large \ncontracts where the sequential work of many subcontractors is necessary \nto finish a project on time. The principal contractor will require that \neach subcontractor obtain a surety bond. A subcontractor's surety bond \nwill guarantee that they will meet their contract's time and quality \nrequirements whether it be for framing a building or installing \nspecific computer equipment. The majority of small and large businesses \nfulfill their contractual obligations, and claims against surety bonds \nare infrequent. If a claim occurs, the surety firm is responsible for \nany monetary damages that occur because the bonded company did not \nfulfill its contractual obligations.\n  Many new small contractors are only able to obtain surety bonds \nthrough the SBA's Surety Bond Guarantee Program. In order to reduce the \nrisk to- surety firms, the SBA promises to cover between 70 and 90 \npercent of any possible claims on bonds underwritten through the Surety \nBond Guarantee Program. The Surety Bond Guarantee Program then helps \nsmall businesses establish a bonding history so that with time they can \noutgrow the program and obtain bonds in the competitive marketplace.\n  It is critical to understand that the number of participating \nsureties in the Surety Bond Guarantee Program directly affects the \nnumber of small companies that can receive surety bonds. Over the last \nseveral years, a number of SBA actions have greatly reduced the \nprofitability of surety companies participating in this SBA program. \nDeclining profitability has forced sureties to leave the program, \ncausing a severe downturn in the total number of small businesses \nobtaining surety bonds.\n  In 2003, the Surety Bond Guarantee Program issued 8,974 bonds to \nsmall businesses. In 2004, the number declined to 7,803 bonds, and in \n2005, the number declined again to 5,678 bonds. This year, even though \nthe need for surety bonds has not decreased, as of March 2006, only \n1,760 surety bonds have been issued. The sureties argue that SBA's \noutdated fee structure and other actions, such as unwinding bond \nguarantees and recent fee increases, make it impossible for them to \nearn a profit and continue participating in the program.\n  One of the greatest obstacles to profitability is the Preferred \nSurety Bond Program's outdated fee structure. Currently, sureties in \nthe preferred program are forced to use insurance rates set on August \n1, 1987, almost 20 years ago. Many sureties have left the program \nbecause the SBA's outdated rates prevent them from making a profit on \nthe small business bonds they issue.\n  To address this problem, my bill would grant participating sureties \ngreater rate setting flexibility by allowing them to charge rates that \nare approved by the insurance commissioner of the State in which the \ncontract will be performed. It will also raise the current limit on the \nmaximum amount of a contract that a company can bond through the \nprogram from $2 million to $3 million, an adjustment that inflation \nmakes necessary.\n  My bill prohibits the SBA from unwinding a surety bond guarantee \nafter the agency has already underwritten and approved the bond. \nCurrently, the SBA will often find technical reasons, which should have \nbeen discovered during the underwriting process, to avoid paying on a \nclaim against an SBA guaranteed bond. When this occurs, the surety \ncompanies must honor the SBA's financial obligations and cover any \nlosses caused by the breach of contract. Most sureties can only afford \nto have the SBA unwind a bond once or twice before they are forced to \nleave the Surety Bond Program.\n  My bill also addresses recent SBA fee increases. In August of 2005, \nthe SBA moved to increase surety bonding companies' premium fees by 60 \npercent and then directed that none of the fee increase could be passed \nalong to small companies seeking surety bonds. I was concerned that \nthis fee increase would provide an additional reason for surety \ncompanies to stop underwriting small companies and further decrease the \nability of small firms to receive surety bonds.\n  The SBA's fee increase made it necessary for me to evaluate the \nunderlying terms of the surety program. After working with the SBA, \neventually the agency agreed to allow the surety companies to split the \nfee increase with small firms, a much more palatable solution than \nforcing the bonding companies--or the small businesses--to absorb all \nof the increase.\n  The bill requires the SBA to be transparent in its fee structure and \nany calculations the agency uses to justify future fee increases. The \nbill also clarifies that Congress does not require the Surety Bond \nGuarantee Program to be entirely self funding or self sufficient.\n  I am working with the SBA to reverse the decline in participating \nsureties and increase the number of small businesses receiving surety \nbonding. To achieve this goal, the Surety Bond Guarantee Program is \nworking to reduce approval times by increasing companies' ability to \nsubmit underwriting applications and claim requests online. The program \nalso plans to restructure its field offices and conduct outreach to new \nsureties and small businesses needing surety bonding. These changes, \nalong with the necessary legislative changes I have proposed today, \nwill help the program attract new sureties and increase the overall \nnumber of small companies able to secure sureties underwriting through \nthe program.\n  Mr. President, I would like to encourage my colleagues to support the \nSurety Bond Improvement Act. This bill was written after consulting \nwith small business owners and surety bonding companies on how best to \nrevitalize this critical program. Without these changes, the number of \nsureties participating in the program will continue to decline--as will \nthe ability of small businesses to secure surety bonds. Without these \nbonds many small businesses will be unable to compete for contracts and \ngovernment work. For new companies, obtaining a surety bond will become \na barrier to entry and competition they are unable to overcome.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 3786. A bill to reauthorize and improve the Small Business Act and \nthe Small Business Investment Act of 1958, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n\n[[Page S8806]]\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Small \nBusiness Information Security Act of 2006. This bill will establish \nwithin the Small Business Administration a Small Business Information \nSecurity Task Force to advise the SBA and help small businesses both \nunderstand the information security challenges they face and identify \nresources to help meet those challenges.\n  As chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, one of my goals is to ensure small businesses are \nprotected from the mounting information security threats they face \nevery day. This legislation will create a clearinghouse of information, \nresources, and tools--compiled by a task force consisting of public and \nprivate sector experts in the field--that will ease the trouble, \nconfusion, and cost often associated with enhancing information \nsecurity measures within a small business. The task force will \ncontinually update information and resources as new technologies and \nnew threats arise. Currently, potential and existing owners of small \nbusinesses turn to the SBA for resources regarding a number of other \naspects when developing and maintaining their ventures. But information \nsecurity resources are not as readily available. This measure will \npresent an opportunity for the SBA to create a repository for small \nbusinesses to meet their information security needs.\n  According to a 2005 survey by the Small Business Technology \nInstitute, more than half of all small businesses in the United States \nexperienced a security breach in the last year. Furthermore, the study \nconcludes that nearly one-fifth of small businesses do not use virus-\nscanning for e-mail, over 60 percent do not protect their wireless \nnetworks with encryption, and two-thirds of small businesses do not \nhave an information security plan.\n  As these statistics illustrate, small businesses are increasingly at \nrisk of data breaches and other forms of malicious attacks on their \ninformation technology infrastructure. The Small Business Information \nSecurity Task Force will provide resources and information to small \nbusiness owners to help them overcome these obstacles and decrease the \nrisks posed to their small businesses by cybercriminals. I encourage \nall of my colleagues to support this vitally important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM (for himself, Mr. Pryor and Mrs. Dole):\n  S. 3787. A bill to establish a congressional Commission on the \nAbolition of Modern-Day Slavery; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I am joined today by Senator Pryor and \nSenator Dole to address an important issue that is all too often hidden \nfrom public view--the practice of modern day slavery.\n  One of my political heroes is the 18th century British statesman, \nWilliam Wilberforce. Wilberforce was one of the leaders of the moral \ncrusade to rid the British empire of slavery. He devoted 20 years to \nabolishing the British slave trade and another 26 years to abolishing \nslavery altogether. He and his fellow abolitionists had a profound \naffect on the American abolitionist movement, and their dedication \nfueled some of our greatest leaders, including John Quincy Adams, \nBenjamin Franklin, James Monroe, and John Jay. His influence reached \nWilliam Wells Brown, Paul Cuffe, Benjamin Hughes, Frederick Douglass, \nand Abraham Lincoln, and he helped pave the way for abolitionists like \nThaddeus Stevens and Richard Allen.\n  These great men opened the eyes of the United Kingdom and the United \nStates to see the injustice that marked our countries. Thankfully, \ntheir work helped end the U.S. and U.K. slave trade. Later, our country \nconstitutionally abolished slavery and took a significant step to \neffectuate the vision of the Declaration of Independence, that all \npeople are created equal.\n  We, as a country, often rush to divorce ourselves from our historic \nmalfeasance. We want to forget the stories of human beings--women and \nchildren--suffocating on slave ships, tied to whipping posts and bound \nwith bruising fetters. We want to forget the blatant oppression, our \ncountry's inhumane drive for profit and obvious disregard for the \nvalue, worth and freedom inherent in every life. The slavery of our \npast offends every modern sensibility we have; yet, we cannot bury \nthese stories as just part of the distant past.\n  Slavery exists today. Despite the heroic work of liberators centuries \nbefore us, and despite the fact that almost every country in this world \nhas constitutionally outlawed slavery, as many as 27 million people are \nin bondage according to the 2006 Trafficking in Persons Report. This \nslavery, although in many ways different from the slavery in centuries \npast, is equally horrifying and brutal. Among other practices, it \nincludes sexual exploitation, bonded labor, forced labor, forced \nmarriage, chattel slavery and child labor.\n  An estimated 800,000 persons are trafficked across international \nborders each year, and an estimated 18,000 to 20,000 victims are \ntrafficked into the United States each year. Approximately 80 percent \nof the victims are female and an estimated 40 to 50 percent are \nchildren. Unfortunately, unlike the slavery of our past, modern-day \nslavery takes on myriad, subtler forms, making it more difficult to \nidentify and eradicate. Within countries where the trade originates, a \nseemingly endless supply of victims remains available for exploitation, \nand within the destination countries there seems to be an endless \ndemand for the ``services'' of victims. Organized criminal networks--\nsome large and some small--have taken control of this economic supply \nand demand situation, establishing an appalling, but often invisible \ntrade of humans in the 21 century.\n  This modern-day slavery is notable for the variety and complexity of \nthe trafficking networks that operate and sustain it. The forms of \nslavery, such as sex-trafficking, are incredibly adaptive: these \nnetworks extend to every region and virtually every country in the \nworld--representing a truly global industry. Slavery of all forms is \nextremely profitable for the exploiters, and they capitalize on the \nweak and vulnerable, the desperate and unstable. They are most \nsuccessful in areas of conflict and postconflict, transitioning states, \nsudden political change, economic collapse, widespread poverty, and \nnatural disasters. Weak legal infrastructure, corrupt law enforcement \nofficials, globalization and the lack of equal employment opportunity \nhave fed this iniquitous multibillion-dollar criminal industry.\n\n  Women are often lured by promises of employment as shopkeepers, \nmaids, seamstresses, nannies, or waitresses but then find themselves \nforced into prostitution upon arrival to their destination. Their \ntraffickers seize travel documents, create enormous and unsubstantiated \ndebt demands, and subject the women to brutal beatings if their \nearnings are unsatisfactory.\n  Girls, as young as five, are often kidnapped or even sold by trusted \nrelatives into the transatlantic sex trade. They are often raped, \nbeaten, and forced to sleep with 10 to 15 men per night. These young \nchildren are manipulated, coerced, and held in bondage. Victims are \noften isolated, unable to speak the language of the land they are \ntransported to, and are often unfamiliar with the culture. Without the \nsupport network of their family and friends, they are incredibly \nvulnerable to their oppressors' demands.\n  The victims of modern-day slavery often face torture, violence, poor \nnutrition, and drug and alcohol addiction. They contract HIV/AIDS, \nsuffer from severe trauma and depression, and are stripped of dignity \nand hope for their future. As I have continued to work on legislation \nthat reaches the populations most deeply affected by the HIV/AIDS \nepidemic, violence against women, and child exploitation, I am offended \nby the complete disrespect for life that binds these horrors together.\n  We, as a nation, cannot stand idle. As William Wilberforce said, ``it \nis we who are now truly on trial before the moral sense of [this \nworld], and if we shrink from it, deeply shall we hereafter repent our \nconduct.'' As a Congress, we have come together to call our country and \nothers to action in the fight against human trafficking; I commend the \nwork of this administration, the NGOs, and the freedom-fighters \nthroughout the world who have been working to address this nefarious \nissue.\n  Yet despite our hard work, we have an obligation to do more. Today I \nam submitting a resolution and introducing a bill that call for a \ndeeper commitment to the cause of abolishing\n\n[[Page S8807]]\n\nmodern-day slavery. The resolution calls us to make modern-day slavery \na priority in our foreign and domestic policy. This resolution resolves \nthat the abolition of modern-day slavery should be prioritized at the \n2007 G8 Summit and calls for the trade policy of the United States to \nreflect our commitment to freedom for all people.\n  I am also introducing a bill for the formation of a bipartisan \ncongressional commission that will conduct a thorough and thoughtful \nstudy of all matters relating to modern-day slavery, working alongside \nthe programs we have implemented so far. This commission will make \nrecommendations for our country and for abolitionists worldwide \nincluding identifying the countries which provide the greatest \nopportunity for abolition of modern-day slavery specific to U.S. \ninvolvement. Currently, many of the very qualified groups that work to \nfree slaves are scattered. Some of these groups are better at \nextraction, while others are better at rehabilitation; the commission \nwill make recommendations that seek to bring these incredible groups \ntogether to provide the most sustainable options for rescued victims.\n  The commission will examine the economic impact on communities and \ncountries that have demonstrated measured success in fighting modern-\nday slavery. I recently learned of a small village in South Asia where \nover 70 emancipated slaves have now been elected to positions of \nleadership in their community. They have built their first well to \nserve the community and are representing others who are vulnerable to \noppression.\n  Additionally, this commission will make recommendations which work to \nincrease education and awareness about modern-day slavery throughout \nthe United States with the purpose of fighting modern-day slavery.\n  The potential exists for real and systemic change. Together, this \ncommission and this resolution will work to support a full and rich \ncircle demonstrating the power of emancipation. We have a tremendous \nopportunity to reaffirm our commitment as a nation to spreading freedom \nfor all people by eradicating the horrendous scourge of modern-day \nslavery. I look forward to following the example of the abolitionists \nbefore us to end this worldwide evil.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3787\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Congressional Commission on \n     the Abolition of Modern-Day Slavery Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. MODERN-DAY SLAVERY.\n\n       In this Act, the term ``modern-day slavery'' means the \n     recruitment, harboring, transportation, receipt, procurement, \n     or control of persons through the use of force, fraud, \n     coercion, abduction, deception, abuse of power, or of a \n     position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of \n     payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person \n     having control over another person, for the purpose of \n     subjection to debt bondage, serfdom, involuntary servitude, \n     forced labor, chattel, forced marriage, peonage, sexual \n     exploitation, or trafficking.\n\n     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Declaration of Independence recognizes the inherent \n     dignity and worth of all people and states that all people \n     are created equal and are endowed by their Creator with \n     certain unalienable rights, and the right to be free from \n     slavery and involuntary servitude is among those unalienable \n     rights.\n       (2) Despite international laws outlawing modern-day \n     slavery, modern-day slavery affects virtually every country \n     in the world, and as many as 27,000,000 people are victims. \n     Modern-day slavery is one of the fastest growing areas of \n     international criminal activity and is an increasing concern \n     to the United States Administration, Congress, and the \n     international community; the Federal Bureau of Investigation \n     estimated that modern-day slavery generates over \n     $9,000,000,000 every year.\n       (3) Traffickers use threats, intimidation manipulation, \n     coercion, fraud, shame, and violence to force victims into \n     modern-day slavery. Traffickers capitalize on areas of \n     conflict and post-conflict, transitioning states, sudden \n     political change, economic collapse, civil unrest, internal \n     armed conflict, chronic unemployment, widespread poverty, \n     personal disaster, lack of economic opportunity, and natural \n     disasters.\n       (4) Modern-day slavery: contributes to the breakdown of \n     societies due to the loss of family support networks; has a \n     negative impact on the labor market in countries; brutalizes \n     men, women, and children and exposes them to rape, torture, \n     HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases, violence, \n     dangerous working conditions, poor nutrition, drug and \n     alcohol addiction, severe psychological trauma from \n     separation, coercion, sexual abuse, and depression; and \n     strips human beings of dignity, respect, and hope for their \n     future.\n       (5) The United States has given priority to combating human \n     trafficking through the Victims of Trafficking and Violence \n     Protection Act of 2000 (Public Law 106-386) and the \n     Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2005 \n     (Public Law 109-164).\n       (6) The State Department issued its sixth congressionally \n     mandated Trafficking in Persons Report (TIP) in June, 2006, \n     which categorizes countries into tiered groups according to \n     the efforts they are making to combat trafficking. The \n     countries that do not cooperate in the fight against \n     trafficking (Tier 3 Countries) have been made subject to \n     United States sanctions since 2003, under the President's \n     direction.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to create a set of effective voluntary national \nexpectations, and a voluntary national curriculum, for mathematics and \nscience education in kindergarten through grade 12, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nhelp ensure that American students are competitive in the global \neconomy of 21st century. If approved, The National Mathematics and \nScience Consistency Act would ensure that America's children have \naccess to a rigorous math and science education. This bill will help \nyoung men and women in America compete successfully with students from \naround the world.\n  Last fall the National Academy of Sciences, NAS, outlined the \nchallenges to American competitiveness in its report, ``Rising Above \nthe Gathering Storm: Energizing and Employing America for a Brighter \nEconomic Future.'' The reality is that modern technology makes it \nincreasingly possible for employers to hire the most skilled workers \nwherever in the world they live. Unfortunately, too many American \nstudents--even some graduates of high school and college--are not \nequipped with the skills they need to compete successfully in the \nglobal economy.\n  Among 12th graders, America ranks 21st out of 40 industrialized \nnations in tests of math and science knowledge. Just one in three of \nAmerica's college graduates earn degrees in math, science, and \nengineering while two in three college graduates of other countries do \nso. We must act now to improve education and research in science, \ntechnology, engineering, and mathematics, STEM, if America is to retain \nleadership of the global economy in the 21st century.\n  In ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm,'' the National Academy of \nSciences made 20 recommendations for how America can increase its \nglobal competitiveness. Nineteen of the 20 recommendations were \nproposed in the PACE Acts--PACE-Education, PACE-Energy, and PACE-\nFinance. I was proud to cosponsor these bills, and it is a testament to \nthe widespread concern regarding this issue that each bill has been \ncosponsored by more than 60 Senators.\n  The Mathematics and Science Consistency Act would implement the final \nNAS recommendation--for the Department of Education to convene a \nnational panel of experts that will collect proven effective K-12 \nscience and mathematics teaching materials, and, if effective models \ndon't exist, create new ones. All materials would be made available \nonline, free of charge, as a voluntary national curriculum that would \nprovide an effective standard for K-12 teachers to use as a resource.\n  Regrettably, many States have set standards for math and science \neducation at an abysmally low level. A Fordham report entitled ``The \nState of State Science Standards 2005'' found that nearly half of the \nStates are doing a poor job of setting academic standards for science.\n  The result of low State standards is that States think their students \nare passing, teachers think their students are passing, and students \nthink they are passing when they in fact are not. For example, a review \nof 12 diverse States by a team at the University of California at \nBerkeley found that the typical State reports that 77 percent of its \nfourth graders are proficient in mathematics as assessed by the State \nstandard, while just 36.5 percent of fourth grade students in the \ntypical State score as proficient in mathematics as assessed by the \ngold-standard National Assessment of Education Progress. Lowering \nacademic standards does not adequately prepare our students to meet the \ndemands of the global economy.\n  The Mathematics and Science Consistency Act will help States raise \nstandards and invest in high-quality teaching through the collection of \nbest practices and ensure that a world-class curriculum is available. \nUnder my bill, it is entirely up to States whether to adopt the \nrecommendations of the panel. States that do would be eligible for \ngrants to acquire instructional materials, to make those materials \navailable online and free to teachers and school staff, and to train \nteachers to effectively use the instructional materials.\n  Again, I want to emphasize that this bill provides assistance to \nStates that wish to work together to ensure that all children are \ntaught a rigorous, common curriculum. The Mathematics and\n\n[[Page S8809]]\n\nScience Consistency Act would implement the final recommendation made \nin the Gathering Storm report, and it will help ensure that our \nchildren are prepared to compete with success in the 21st century.\n  It is high time to do what is best for our children and their \neconomic future. I am hopeful that my Senate colleagues from both sides \nof the aisle will join me today to move this legislation to the floor \nwithout delay.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MARTINEZ:\n  S. 3792. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ncredit against tax for qualified elementary and secondary education \ntuition; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, today I rise to discuss a bill that aims \nto give America's children access to greater educational opportunities. \nAs history has taught us, advanced societies are always built on a \nfoundation of a few shared values--and education is a chief component \nof that foundation.\n  For 21st century America to continue to lead the world, the leaders \nof this great Nation of ours must remain committed to providing every \nAmerican child the opportunity to succeed in the classroom. A quality \neducation unlocks the doors that lead to bigger life opportunities. As \nthe axiom goes, knowledge is power [attributed to Sir Francis Bacon].\n  In addition, our educational system should be helping parents to make \nbetter choices, not taking choices away from them.\n  That is why I am introducing the Tax and Education Assistance for \nChildren (TEACH) Act of 2006.\n  Representative Vito Fossella of New York has already introduced this \nbill in the House of Representatives, where it has collected 34 \ncosponsors. Six of those cosponsors come from my home State of Florida. \nThose cosponsors are Jeff Miller, Ginny Brown-Waite, Dave Weldon, John \nMica, Katherine Harris and Tom Feeney.\n  There is a good reason for this. In Florida and across America today, \nour public schools are facing new and troubling challenges.\n  Many public schools are suffering from overcrowding, leading to a \nmyriad of problems such as teacher shortages, threats to campus \nsecurity, a lack of books, desks, and computers, to name a few. In this \ncountry, known to the world as a ``land of opportunity,'' American \nparents deserve better than to have their children suffer through a \nfailing school system.\n  We live in a consumer-driven society where numerous choices abound: \ncar or SUV, caffeinated or decaf, book in print or book on tape.\n  We live in a country where you can make airline reservations from a \nportable electronic device, where a doctor can remotely assist in a \nsurgery from thousands of miles away, where we can power our homes with \nSun, wind, or water, and yet too often parents do not have a basic \nchoice for their children: public school or private school.\n  Many parents would like to send their children to a traditional \nprivate, religious, or military school, however, they are often unable \nto do so because of the high costs of such an endeavor.\n  Many middle-class parents make enough to take care of their families, \nbut not enough for their families to pick up and move to a better \nschool district or for them to send their children to a private school \nwhere they are living.\n  As we know, it is the innate desire of parents to want to provide the \nvery best for their children. While public schools are the right choice \nfor tens of millions of American children each and every year, more \nthan 5 million American students currently attend private schools at \nlittle or no cost to American taxpayers.\n  We want to help students reach their maximum potential. In this \ncountry and around the globe, the best educated people are nearly \nalways the ones leading their respective communities forward.\n  This bill would establish a tax credit of up to $4,500 per family for \nprivate elementary or secondary school tuition. Single parents would \nalso be eligible for the credit.\n  And because we always want to be responsible with how taxpayers' \nmoney is spent, the tax credit is nonrefundable. To elaborate, this \nmeans that if tuition is only three thousand dollars at a school, \nfamilies will only be able to deduct that amount.\n  This credit would pass along a small portion of taxpayer savings back \nto the families that help generate it.\n  For all those middle-class and lower income families across America \nwho feel trapped, who feel as if they don't have the power to choose \nwhat is best for their children and their educational needs, the TEACH \nAct of 2006 will make it possible for them to choose the best learning \nenvironment for their children.\n  It is also important to note that this bill does not institute a \nvoucher program. Instead, as a Federal income tax credit, it helps \nfamilies to have choices, while not detracting from the funding sources \nneeded to continue upkeep of and improvements in our public schools.\n  This bill would alleviate the financial burden on our public schools, \nand thus allow schools to devote greater resources toward improving the \neducational experience for all students.\n  And the American taxpayer should not worry that this bill will reduce \nthe funding for their child's school or for any other public school--it \nwon't. What it will do is increase the value of every child's \neducational experience, be it in a public or private school.\n  According to the U.S. Census Bureau statistics from 2004, the cost of \neducating a student in the public school system is close to $8,000 a \nyear. Multiplied out, this comes to a total savings of over $42 billion \na year for our public school systems.\n  If the millions of privately educated students in this country were \nto be publicly educated, every taxpayer would have to bear that burden.\n  With this legislation, parents win because their children get the \nbest education possible and the American taxpayer wins because they owe \nnothing more.\n  And where Florida is concerned, according to the aforementioned U.S. \nCensus Bureau statistics, approximately, $6,000 is spent annually per \npublic school student in the Sunshine State.\n  With more than 350,000 students attending private schools in Florida \nannually, our State's taxpayers save $2.2 billion--and that savings can \nbenefit public schools.\n  The TEACH Act of 2006 would help to add to those savings.\n  America is an ownership society where people get to make choices \nabout how they spend their money and where they are going to spend it.\n  With a choice as important as where and how our children are \neducated, we need to put more of the power in the hands of the parents.\n  While this is in no way comprehensive education reform, it is another \nbig step in the right direction.\n  I encourage my Senate colleagues to learn more about the TEACH Act \nand to work with me to push through this legislation that will help our \nchildren across America receive the education that they need.\n  Remember, if we do not continue to invest in our future today, \ntomorrow will not show us the bright promise that it can. Let us carry \nthat promise home to more Americans today.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3792\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the implementation of the Owyhee \nInitiative Agreement, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Owyhee \nInitiative Implementation Act of 2006, a bill which is the result of a \n5-year collaborative effort between all levels of government, multiple \nusers of public lands, and conservationists to resolve decades of \nheated land-use conflict in the Owyhee Canyonlands in the southwestern \npart of my home State of Idaho.\n  This is comprehensive land management legislation that enjoys far-\nreaching support among a remarkably diverse group of interests that \nlive, work and play in this special country.\n  Owyhee County contains some of the most unique and beautiful \ncanyonlands in the world and offers large areas in which all of us can \nenjoy the grandeur and experience of untouched western trails, rivers, \nand open sky. It is truly magical country, and its natural beauty and \ntraditional uses should be preserved for future generations.\n  Owyhee County is traditional ranching country. Seventy-three percent \nof its land base is owned by the United States, and it is located \nwithin an hour's drive of one of the fastest growing areas in the \nnation, Boise, ID.\n  This combination of attributes, including location, is having an \nexplosive effect on property values, community expansion and \ndevelopment and ever-increasing demands on public land. Given this \nconfluence of circumstances and events, Owyhee County has been at the \ncore of decades of conflict with heated political and regulatory \nbattles.\n  The diverse land uses co-exist in an area of intense beauty and \nunique character. The conflict over land management is both inevitable \nand understandable--how do we manage for this diversity and do so in a \nway that protects and restores the quality of that fragile environment?\n  In this context, the Owyhee County Commissioners and several others \nsaid ``enough is enough'' and decided to focus efforts on solving these \nproblems rather than wasting resources on an endless fight. In 2001, \nThe Owyhee County Commissioners, Hal Tolmie, Dick Reynolds and Chris \nSalove met with me and asked for my help.\n  They asked whether I would support them if they could put together at \none table the interested parties involved in the future of the County \nto try and reach some solutions. I told them that if they could get \ntogether a broad base of interests who would agree to collaborate in a \nprocess committed to problem-solving, I would dedicate myself to \nworking with them and if they were successful, I would introduce \nresulting legislation. They agreed.\n  Together, we set out on a 5-year journey on a road that is as \nchallenging as any in the Owyhee Canyonlands. Sharp turns, steep \ninclines and declines, big sharp rocks, deep ruts, sand burrs, dust and \na constant headwind is exactly what those of us who have worked so hard \non this have faced every day.\n  This is very difficult work and in speaking of difficult work, I want \nto acknowledge the effort of my friend and colleague from Idaho, \nRepresentative Mike Simpson, and the challenge he has taken on as he \nadvocates his Central Idaho Economic Development Act. I support his \nwork and his legislation.\n  The Commissioners appointed a chairman, an extraordinary gentleman, \nFred Grant. They formed the Work Group which included The Wilderness \nSociety, Idaho Conservation League, The Nature Conservancy, Idaho \nOutfitters and Guides, the United States Air Force, the Sierra Club, \nthe county Soil Conservation Districts, Owyhee Cattleman's Association, \nthe Owyhee Borderlands Trust, People for the Owyhees, and the Shoshone \nPaiute Tribes to join in their efforts. All accepted, and work on this \nbill began.\n  As this collaborative process gained momentum, the county \ncommissioners expanded the Work Group to include the South Idaho Desert \nRacing Association, Idaho Rivers United and the Owyhee County Farm \nBureau. Very recently, the commissioners have further expanded the \neffort to include the Foundation for North American Wild Sheep and the \nIdaho Backcountry Horsemen.\n  The commissioners also requested that the Idaho State Department of \nLands and the Bureau of Land Management serve, and those agencies have \nprovided important support.\n  This unique group of people chose to work without a professional \nfacilitator, preferring instead to deal with differences face-to-face \nand together create new ideas. For me, one of the most gratifying and \nemotional outcomes has been to see this group transform itself from \npolarized camps into an extraordinary force that has become known for \nits intense effort, comity, trust and willingness to work toward a \nsolution.\n  They operated on a true consensus basis, only making decisions when \nthere was no voiced objection to a proposal.\n  They involved everyone who wanted to participate in the process and \nspent hundreds of hours discussing their findings, modifying \npreliminary proposals and ultimately reaching consensus solutions. They \nhave driven thousands of miles inspecting roads and trails, listening \nto and soliciting ideas from people from all walks of life who have in \ncommon deep roots and deep interest in the Owyhee Canyonlands.\n  They sought to ensure that they had a thorough understanding of the \nissues and could take proper advantage of the insights and experience \nof all these people.\n  While this whole process and its outcomes are indeed remarkable, one \nof the more notable developments is the Memorandum of Agreement between \nthe Shoshone Paiute Tribes and the County that establishes government-\nto-government cooperation in several areas of mutual interest. I want \nto particularly note the efforts and support of Mr. Terry Gibson, \nChairman of the Shoshone Paiute Tribes, a great leader and a personal \nfriend of mine.\n  All of these individuals and organizations have asked that I seek \nSenate approval of their collaborative effort, built from the ground up \nto chart their path forward.\n  The Owyhee Initiative transforms conflict and uncertainty into \nconflict resolution and assurance of future activity. Ranchers can plan \nfor subsequent generations. Off-road vehicle users have access assured. \nWilderness is established. The Shoshone-Paiute Tribe knows its cultural \nresources will be protected. The Air Force will continue to train its \npilots.\n  Local, state and Federal agencies will have structure to assist their \njoint management of the region. And this will all happen within the \ncontext of the preservation of environmental and ecological health. \nThis is indeed a revolutionary land management structure--and one that \nlooks ahead to the future.\n  Principal features of the legislation include:\n  Development, funding and implementation of a landscape-scale program \nto review, recommend and coordinate landscape conservation and research \nprojects;\n  Scientific review process to assist the Bureau of Land Management;\n  Designation of Wilderness and Wild and Scenic Rivers;\n  Release of Wilderness Study Areas;\n  Protections of tribal cultural and historical resources against \nintentional and unintentional abuse and desecration.\n\n[[Page S8811]]\n\n  Development and implementation by the BLM of travel plans for public \nlands;\n  A board of directors with oversight over the administration and \nimplementation of the Owyhee Initiative.\n  This can't be called ranching bill, or a wilderness bill, or an Air \nForce bill, or a tribal bill. It is a comprehensive land management \nbill.\n  Each interest got enough to enthusiastically support the final \nproduct, advocate for its enactment, and, most importantly, support the \nobjectives of those with whom they had previous conflict.\n  Opposition will come from a few principal sources: those who simply \ndon't want to have wilderness designated; those who don't want \nlivestock anywhere on public land; and, those who do not want to see \ncollaboration succeed. While I respect that opposition, I prefer to \nmove forward in an effort that manages conflict and land, rather than \nexploit disagreements.\n  The status quo is unacceptable. The Owyhee Canyonlands and its \ninhabitants, including its people, deserve to have a process of \nconflict management and a path to sustainability. The need for this \npath forward is particularly acute given that this area is an hour's \ndrive from one of the nation's most rapidly-growing communities. The \nOwyhee Initiative protects water rights, releases wilderness study \nareas and protects traditional uses.\n  I commend the commitment and leadership of all involved. We have \nestablished a long-term, comprehensive management approach. It's been \nan honor for me to work with so many fine people and I will do \neverything in my power to turn this into law.\n  The Owyhee Initiative sets a standard for managing and resolving \ndifficult land management issues in our country. After all, what better \nplace to forge an historical change in our approach to public land \nmanagement, than in this magnificent land that symbolizes livelihood, \nheritage, diversity, opportunity and renewal?\n  And with that, I would like to recognize and thank the people who \nhave been the real driving force behind this process: Fred Grant, \nChairman of the Owyhee Initiative Work Group, his assistant Staci \nGrant, and Dr. Ted Hoffman, Sheriff Gary Aman, the Owyhee County \nCommissioners: Hal Tolmie, Chris Salova, and Dick Reynolds and Chairman \nTerry Gibson of the Shoshone Paiute Tribes. I am grateful to Governor \nJim Risch of the Great State of Idaho for all of his support.\n  Thanks to: Colonel Rock of the United States Air Force at Mountain \nHome Air Force Base, Craig Gherke and John McCarthy of The Wilderness \nSociety, Rick Johnson and John Robison of the Idaho Conservation \nLeague, Inez Jaca representing Owyhee County, Dr. Chad Gibson \nrepresenting the Owyhee Cattleman's Association, Brenda Richards \nrepresenting private property owners in Owyhee County, Cindy and Frank \nBachman representing the Soil Conservation Districts in Owyhee County, \nMarcia Argust with the Campaign for America's Wilderness, Grant Simmons \nof the Idaho Outfitters and Guides Association, Bill Sedivy with Idaho \nRivers United, Tim Lowry of the Owyhee County Farm Bureau, Bill Walsh \nrepresenting Southern Idaho Desert Racing Association, Lou Lunte and \nWill Whelan of the Nature Conservancy for all of their hard work and \ndedication. I'd also like to thank the Idaho Back Country Horseman, the \nFoundation for North American Wild Sheep, Roger Singer of the Sierra \nClub, the South Board of Control, and the Owyhee Project managers, and \nall the other water rights holders who support me today. This process \ntruly benefited from the diversity of these groups and their \nwillingness to cooperate to reach a common goal.\n\n  The Owyhee Canyonlands and its inhabitants are truly a treasure of \nIdaho and the United States; I hope you will join me in ensuring their \nfuture.\n  It is my honor and privilege to introduce this legislation today to \nprotect and preserve this tremendous part of Idaho and the people who \nlive there.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH (for himself, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Isakson, Mr. \n        DeWine, Mr. Burr, Mr. Bingaman, Ms. Stabenow, and Mr. \n        Menendez):\n  S. 3795. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for a two-year moratorium on certain Medicare physician payment \nreductions for imaging services; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend and \ncolleague from Oregon, Senator Smith, to introduce the Access to \nMedicare Imaging Act of 2006. This legislation would require a 2-year \nmoratorium on the imaging cuts enacted as part of the Deficit Reduction \nAct, pending the outcome of a comprehensive study of Medicare imaging \nutilization and payment by the Government Accountability Office, GAO.\n  Each year, millions of Medicare patients receive medical imaging \nservices, including x-rays, CT-scans, MRIs, and PET scans, to name just \na few. Imaging devices allow doctors to more accurately diagnose and \ntreat a wide range of human conditions, and patients who receive \nimaging services enjoy the peace of mind that comes from more precise \ndiagnoses of disease. It would not be an overstatement to say that \nmedical imaging has revolutionized the manner in which physicians \npractice medicine and the manner in which patients receive health care.\n  The widespread use of digital imaging equipment allows providers to \neasily exchange images across the Internet, facilitating greater and \nmore timely physician consultation and, most people believe, improving \nthe quality of care received by the patient. This same technology \nallows greater access to radiology professionals across the country for \nindividuals living in rural and other medically underserved areas, \nwhich is a big deal in West Virginia.\n  Consider, if you will, Braxton Memorial Hospital in the small town of \nGassaway in central West Virginia. Braxton Memorial is a remote, \ncritical access hospital without the services of a radiologist. Because \nof imaging technology, trained medical staff at Braxton Memorial can \ntake a digital x-ray and, within minutes, send a precise copy to a \nmajor medical facility in Charleston. There, it is read by a \nradiologist, who then returns a written report by e-mail. A few years \nback this was still science fiction, but now it happens every hour of \nevery day across the country.\n  As incredible as these services may seem and as important as they are \nto the practice of effective clinical medicine, there is a perception \nthat imaging services also come with an increased cost. Over the past \nfew years, the use of imaging services by Medicare beneficiaries has \nincreased significantly. In fact, MedPAC reported in March 2005 that \nimaging grew at twice the rate of all other physician fee schedule \nservices between 1999 and 2003. During that time, MRI and CT procedures \nincreased by 15 percent to 20 percent per year on their own.\n  In addition to rising costs, MedPAC further reinforced ongoing \nconcerns about potential overuse of imaging services and the sudden \nincrease of outpatient-based imaging in primary care settings. Citing a \nlack of training and implementation of imaging guidelines, MedPAC \ncalled upon Congress to direct the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to define and execute such standards.\n  Given the MedPAC report, imaging reimbursement became an easy budget \ntarget during the reconciliation debate last year. I am concerned, \nhowever, that the $8 billion in imaging cuts were prematurely added to \nthe Deficit Reduction Act. I believe these cuts were arbitrarily \ndetermined in order to meet a budget target and were not based on sound \npublic policy. I am also very concerned about the impact these cuts \nwill have on the imaging profession and on Medicare beneficiaries' \naccess to imaging services.\n  We should not put the health of our seniors at risk in order to \nachieve an arbitrary budget target. So today I join Senators Smith, \nBingaman, Isakson, Stabenow, DeWine, Menendez, and Burr in calling for \na 2-year delay of these cuts so that a comprehensive GAO study can be \ncompleted. A thorough GAO analysis of Medicare reimbursement for \nimaging services will provide greater insight into this important field \nof medical practice and help inform our decisions going forward. I urge \nmy colleagues to join with us in supporting this timely legislation.\n\n[[Page S8812]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3795\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish demonstration projects to provide at-\nhome infant care benefits; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today \nlegislation to provide parents new options to balance family and work.\n  The reality of today's economy is that most parents must work to \nprovide economic security for their families--a reality that is \nparticularly true when a new baby is welcomed into the family. In fact, \n55 percent of women with infants younger than one year of age work. As \na result, working parents face the challenge of providing economic \nsecurity for their family while simultaneously ensuring that their \ninfant receives the quality care that he or she needs.\n  Research shows that the quality of caretaking in the first months and \nyears of life is critical to a newborn's brain development, social \ndevelopment and well-being. Yet there is currently a severe shortage of \nsafe, affordable, quality care for infants. The number of licensed \nchild care slots for infants meets only 18 percent of the need. The \nshortage is particularly acute in rural areas, and especially in rural \nareas that have many low-income residents.\n  In the ideal circumstance, I think we would all agree, parents who \nneed affordable, high-quality care for their infant would provide that \ncare themselves. Unfortunately, in many low- and moderate-income \nfamilies, having a parent quit his or her job or reduce work hours to \ncare for an infant is not financially viable. Doing so would plunge the \nfamily into an economic crisis. Rather, parents should have the choice \nof using a state child care subsidy to obtain infant care outside the \nhome or of keeping the subsidy so they can stay home and care for their \nchild themselves without risking their family's financial security.\n  The Choices in Child Care Act of 2006 would provide parents this \nchoice. The bill amends the child care development block grant, CCDBG, \nso that low- and moderate-income parents have the option of forgoing a \nState childcare subsidy for infant care outside the home and instead \nreceiving a comparable stipend to provide the care themselves while \nkeeping the family economically stable. Providing support for at-home \ninfant care would give thousands of working families the help they need \nto balance work and care for their infant children. The bill would also \nhelp meet the critical shortage of infant childcare, provide cost \nsavings to state child care programs, support quality care for the \ncritical first years of a child's development, and value parenting as a \nform of work.\n  The time has come for us to recognize the challenges facing families \ntoday and give parents additional resources and options to address \nthose challenges. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the \nChoices in Child Care Act of 2006.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 3798. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to exclude \nand defer from the pooled reimbursable costs of the Central Valley \nProject the reimbursable capital costs of the unused capacity of the \nFolsom South Canal, Auburn-Folsom South Unit, Central Valley Project, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \nis based on the simple fairness principle that you should pay for what \nyou get, no more and no less. In this case California water districts \nhave been paying for years for conveyance capacity on the Folsom South \nCanal that they do not use.\n  This bill would direct the Secretary of the Interior to exclude and \ndefer from the pooled, reimbursable costs of California's Central \nValley Project, CVP, the capital costs of the unused capacity of the \nFolsom South Canal. Congressman Lungren has introduced similar \nlegislation in the House of Representatives.\n  In 1970, two CVP contractors signed contracts with the Bureau of \nReclamation to take water from the Folsom South Canal, which had yet to \nbe built. The canal diverts water out of Lake Natomas, a regulating \nreservoir immediately downstream of Reclamation's Folsom Reservoir, to \nareas in southern Sacramento County.\n  The canal was originally designed to incorporate five ``reaches''--or \nsections--and deliver water to southern Sacramento County, San Joaquin \nCounty, and to the San Francisco Bay area. Because the planned East \nSide Division irrigation project was never constructed, the anticipated \ndeliveries through the Folsom South Canal never materialized. Only two \nreaches of the canal were constructed, and those are dramatically \noverbuilt. In a departure from normal reclamation policy, which \ndictates that signed contracts are required prior to construction of \nprojects, signed contracts were not obtained.\n  The canal was built with the capacity to deliver 2.5 million acre-\nfeet of water per year, but the only entity currently diverting water \nthrough the canal--the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, SMUD--has \nonly diverted a maximum of 20,000 acre-feet per year. In short, a \nsignificantly oversized canal has been used to deliver a very small \nquantity of water.\n  Under reclamation policy, the agency allocates the capital costs of \nthe canal to the pool of all CVP municipal and industrial water--M\nusers regardless of whether they divert water through the Folsom South \nCanal. There are 32 M customers that are paying for the canal, \nincluding SMUD, Sacramento County Water District, East Bay MUD, Santa \nClara Valley Water District and Contra Costa Water District. Today, \nonly SMUD diverts any water through the canal, albeit only about 8 \npercent of the canal's capacity; the other customers have little or no \nbenefit to the project that they fund. This inequity is difficult to \nexplain to ratepayers that are already burdened with replacing aging \ninfrastructure and upgrading water treatment technologies.\n  My legislation would direct the Secretary of the Interior to exclude \nand defer from those pooled reimbursable costs of the CVP, the costs of \nthe unused capacity of the Folsom South Canal. While final deferral \ncalculations will be performed by reclamation as directed by this bill, \nit is estimated that this bill will result in a deferral of \napproximately $35 million excess capacity costs.\n  The concept of deferring costs is not unique to the Folsom South \nCanal. Congress has authorized deferrals for other elements of the CVP \nand in other reclamation projects. Even though there are many instances \nwhere customers pay for unused capacity, there are no instances that \ncome close to approaching the absurd inequity of being forced to pay \nfor a canal that is producing 8 percent of what reclamation promised it \nwould deliver.\n  Should the amount of CVP water conveyed through the Folsom South \nCanal change in the future, this bill includes a provision directing \nInterior to review the change and adjust the deferred costs accordingly \nfor unused capacity.\n\n[[Page S8813]]\n\n  I strongly believe this deferral is the correct approach to this \nissue. Reclamation made the decision to oversize this canal based on \nfuture planned expansions--expansions that did not materialize. The \nwater districts that use the existing canal for limited conveyances \nshould not pay for the consequences of public policy decisions that \nresulted in a significantly oversized canal. Water districts should pay \nfor the canal conveyance capacity that they use--I think this is a \nfairness principle that we can all accept.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3798\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CERTAIN AMOUNTS EXCLUDE AND DEFER FROM THE POOLED \n                   REIMBURSABLE COSTS RELATED TO THE CENTRAL \n                   VALLEY PROJECT.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Interior (referred to \n     in this section as the ``Secretary'') shall exclude and defer \n     from the pooled reimbursable costs of the Central Valley \n     Project the reimbursable capital costs of the unused capacity \n     of the Folsom South Canal, Auburn-Folsom South Unit, Central \n     Valley Project.\n       (b) Calculation of Amount of Deferred Use.--The Secretary \n     shall calculate the amount to be assigned to deferred use as \n     soon as practical and such shall be reflected in future \n     years' water rates.\n       (c) Calculation of Capital Costs.--For the purpose of \n     calculating the excluded reimbursable cost for the Folsom \n     South Canal facility, the Secretary shall multiply the \n     existing total reimbursable cost for the facility by a \n     factor, to be determined by dividing the current minimum \n     unused conveyance capacity of the canal by the original \n     design conveyance capacity of the canal. The minimum unused \n     conveyance capacity of the canal shall--\n       (1) be determined by the Secretary;\n       (2) be based upon actual historic measured flows in the \n     canal and planned future flows; and\n       (3) include the amount of Central Valley Project water that \n     was originally conveyed or was historically projected to be \n     conveyed through the Folsom South Canal which may have been \n     contractually assigned to another entity.\n       (d) Review and Adjustment.--The Secretary shall review and \n     adjust--\n       (1) the amount described in subsection (b)(3) as \n     appropriate and recalculate the amount of such unused \n     capacity of the Folsom South Canal; and\n       (2) the amount of reimbursable capital costs of the Folsom \n     South Canal.\n       (e) Conveyance of Certain Water.--So long as an entity that \n     is allocated and that pays capital, interest, and operation \n     and maintenance costs associated with an amount of Central \n     Valley Project water historically assigned to the Folsom \n     South Canal does not use the Folsom South Canal for the \n     conveyance of Central Valley Project water, that entity shall \n     be entitled, without additional cost, to convey up to an \n     equivalent amount of non-Central Valley Project water through \n     the Folsom South Canal.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH (for himself and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 3801. A bill to support the implementation of the Darfur Peace \nAgreement and to protect the lives and address the humanitarian needs \nof the people of Darfur, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Peace In \nDarfur Act of 2006, along with my distinguished colleague from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kennedy. Our intention is to continue to press \nthe Sudanese Government and rebel groups to honor the Abuja peace \nagreement reached on May 5 in Nigeria. We hope that this legislation \nwill help bring about peace in the region.\n  Mr. President, I will ask animous consent to have printed in the \nRecord the following letters from the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, the \nAmerican Jewish Committee and the Archdiocese of Portland, OR.\n  Tragically, despite the Abuja peace agreement, the conflict in the \nDarfur region of Sudan has continued unabated throughout this spring \nand summer. The Janjaweed, a government supported militia, continues to \nattack innocent citizens and the government is unable, or unwilling, to \nstop this brutality.\n  This violence has led to an increasingly--dire humanitarian \nsituation. More then 3 million people are dependent upon humanitarian \nassistance. Imagine the entire state of Oregon, which has three and a \nhalf million citizens, dependent upon humanitarian aid. This is what we \nface in Darfur today.\n  I commend the Bush administration for the work it has done in \nbringing about the Abuja peace agreement. America has been \nextraordinarily generous in providing over $1 billion worth of \nhumanitarian assistance to those suffering in the region. Yet more must \nbe done to bring an end to the conflict and give the Sudanese people a \nchance to live a normal life.\n  The Peace in Darfur Act of 2006 seeks to increase the prospect of \nfull implementation of the Abuja peace agreement and address the unmet \nhumanitarian needs in Darfur. The bill supports the deployment of a \nUnited Nations peacekeeping force to Darfur, intensifying the \ninternational pressure on the Government of Sudan to comply with the \nagreement and allow in U.N. peacekeepers. This bill also codifies \nexisting sanctions and calls for additional targeted sanctions on \nSudan's leaders.\n  While the African Union Mission in Sudan has performed admirably \nunder difficult conditions, a stronger force must be deployed to \nprovide stability, allow refugees to return to their homes, and restore \nsome semblance of normalcy to those affected by the fighting. Section 4 \nof our legislation calls upon the Government of Sudan to allow a United \nNations peacekeeping force into Darfur to achieve these important \nobjectives.\n  Section 4 of our legislation also assigns the special envoy for \nSudan, authorized in the fiscal year 2006 supplemental appropriations \nbill, the task of supporting the peace process. The urgency of this \nsituation demands a constant level of attention at the highest level of \nour government, a task that the special envoy can facilitate.\n  Section 5 of the bill codifies sanctions against Sudan that were \nimposed by Executive Order 13067. Codifying these sanctions will send a \nstrong message to the Sudanese government that signing the peace \nagreement is not sufficient--we expect their full compliance and \ncooperation to bring about a peaceful resolution to the ongoing \nconflict.\n  Section 6 of the bill requires the State Department to issue a report \non the implementation of the Darfur Peace Agreement and a description \nof the humanitarian crisis. It also calls for the President to report \non the international community's efforts to support the peace process \nand address humanitarian shortfalls. I believe this will hold \naccountable those countries that are actively undermining the peace \nagreement.\n  If the President certifies that the Government of Sudan is \nimplementing the peace agreement and has agreed to allow the presence \nof a U.N. peacekeeping mission, then the legislation requires the \nPresident to request recommendations to further the peace process from \nthe special envoy for Sudan.\n  However, if the President finds the Sudanese Government is impeding \nthe peace process, the bill calls for the President to impose \nadditional measures against Sudan, including enacting targeted \nsanctions on the Sudanese leadership and their immediate families.\n  Section 7 requires a State Department report on those companies \ninvesting $5 million or more in Sudan. This information can then be \nused to deter investment groups, retirement funds, and others from \ninvesting in corporations doing business in Sudan. The legislation \nrequires the Department of the Treasury to issue a report summarizing \nthe assets of Sudanese leaders in the United States and elsewhere. This \nreport will give a full accounting of the Sudanese leaders' assets and \nwill allow the Department of the Treasury to take actions on these \nassets.\n  Finally, section 8 of the legislation authorizes $150 million for \nhumanitarian needs in Darfur (fiscal years 2008-2012 to alleviate the \nsuffering of these needy people.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that Senator Kennedy has joined me in \nthis effort. Our legislation is an important step in the efforts needed \nto bring peace to the region. We hope that it will continue to focus \nattention on the crisis and pressure the major actors to abide by the \nAbuja peace agreement.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letters to which I \nreferred earlier by printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S8814]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                The American Jewish Committee,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 2, 2006.\n       Dear Senator: ``First they came first for the Communists, \n     and I did not speak out because I was not a Communist. Then \n     they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out, \n     because I was not a Socialist; Then they came for the trade \n     unionists, and I did not speak out because I was not a trade \n     unionist. Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak \n     out because I was not a Jew. Then they came for me, and there \n     was no one left to speak out for me.''\n       In 1945 Lutheran Pastor Martin Niemoller's voice echoed \n     around the globe as the world grieved over millions of lives \n     lost at the hands of genocide. Sixty years later, America \n     grieves as millions of innocent victims are being displaced, \n     raped, tortured, and murdered in the Darfur region of Sudan.\n       Pressure is mounting for the Sudanese government to end its \n     genocide. Over the past two years, Congress has allocated \n     more than $250 million to expand and strengthen the role of \n     the African Union Mission in Darfur and to provide additional \n     humanitarian disaster relief throughout the region. As the \n     nation's oldest human relations organization, the American \n     Jewish Committee applauds Congress' action in approving these \n     funds, but we believe that more must be done.\n       The fragile peace agreement reached in May now seems \n     shattered as fighting continues to rage throughout the \n     region. To halt the killing and displacement, civilians must \n     be protected, the peace agreement must be implemented, and a \n     secure environment must be established for the delivery of \n     humanitarian aid. As atrocities, crimes against humanity and \n     genocidal acts continue throughout the region, we urge you to \n     take further action toward protecting besieged Sudanese \n     civilians by supporting the Peace in Darfur Act.\n       The Peace in Darfur Act, introduced by Senators Gordon \n     Smith and Edward Kennedy, directs the President to appoint a \n     new special envoy to Sudan. The Special Envoy, in \n     collaboration with international partners, would be best \n     positioned to advance the Darfur peace process. The bill also \n     calls on the government of Sudan to allow a UN peacekeeping \n     force to enter Darfur; NATO to provide humanitarian, \n     logistical, and personnel support to the UN; NATO to enforce \n     the no-fly zone over Darfur; and the international community \n     to not only support the African Union Mission (AMIS) in \n     Sudan, but also to provide humanitarian assistance. The bill \n     also authorizes an additional $150 million in humanitarian \n     aid for Fiscal Years 2008-2012. Further, the bill mandates a \n     Presidential report on the situation in Darfur that will cast \n     new light on the Sudanese government's actions and provide a \n     basis to impose targeted sanctions if necessary.\n       On behalf of a community that has suffered persecution and \n     even genocide all too often in our history, we urge you to \n     support this crucial piece of legislation. The time to act is \n     now. History has demonstrated the price of standing idly by \n     in the face of such horrors.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                Richard T. Foltin,\n     Legislative Director and Counsel.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          The Hebrew Immigrant Aid\n\n\n                                                      Society,\n\n                                       New York, NY July 28, 2006.\n     Hon. Gordon Smith,\n     Senate Russell Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Senate Russell Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith and Senator Kennedy: I am writing on \n     behalf of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS) to express \n     our strong support for the ``Peace in Darfur Act of 2006.''\n       For over 125 years, HIAS has helped millions of people \n     fleeing persecution and poverty through rescue, resettlement \n     and reunion. The Jewish tradition's emphasis on refugee \n     protection and our community's experience with the trauma of \n     genocide and refugee flight make what's happening in Darfur \n     an issue of primary concern for the Jewish community. We \n     therefore applaud this bill for taking concrete steps to \n     alleviate the inconceivable suffering and hardship that so \n     many innocent Sudanese have endured in the past three years.\n       Specifically, we are pleased that this bill authorizes $150 \n     million in additional funding to help meet tbe unmet \n     humanitarian needs in Darfur. With an office in eastern Chad \n     and programs in three refugee camps, HIAS has seen first-hand \n     the dire consequences when the basic necessities of life, \n     including food, water, and health services, are not met. In \n     June 2005, HIAS launched the Initiative for Sudanese Refugees \n     in Chad, which is intended to strengthen the refugees' \n     psychological and social conditions and to convey skills \n     needed to survive and function in the aftermath of extreme \n     violence. Re-acquisition of these basic skills is crucial to \n     break the chain of dependence and suffering caused by severe \n     psychological trauma. By allocating additional funding to \n     provide such basic necessities as food and water, this bill \n     will help remove yet another hurdle to the Darfuri refugees' \n     ability to support themselves and regain control over their \n     lives and well-being.\n       The Jewish community, knowing all too well what results \n     when genocide is met with silence and inaction, has \n     aggressively denounced the genocide in Darfur and called on \n     the U.S. Government to do more in response. By requiring the \n     Administration to take several important actions, including \n     appointing a Special Envoy for Sudan, the ``Peace in Darfur \n     Act of 2006'' is a significant and vital bill that should be \n     supported by all Members of Congress. To us, ``never again'' \n     is more than just a quote--it is a mandate.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Gideon Aronoff,\n     CEO and President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            Archdiocese of Portland in Oregon,\n\n                                      Portland, OR, July 31, 2006.\n     Sen. Gordon Smith,\n     Portland, OR.\n       Dear Senator Smith: Thank you for the opportunity to \n     comment on the draft legislation ``Supporting Peace and \n     Alleviating Suffering in Darfur'' that you are co-authoring \n     with Senator Kennedy. The continuing violence and atrocities \n     being committed in Darfur are tragic and deplorable. As \n     people of faith we are compelled to do everything in our \n     power to protect the lives and dignity of the victims. I \n     deeply appreciate your leadership on this issue, and in \n     particular your continuing efforts to introduce legislation \n     in the U.S. Senate.\n       Archbishop Vlazny wrote that people of faith must \n     demonstrate a willingness ``to go beyond our own boundaries \n     to serve those in need and to work for global justice and \n     peace. Ours is a shrinking and suffering world. Every once in \n     a while a particular need in some corner of today's world \n     becomes so acute that, for a time, it serves as the unique \n     moral test of our society with respect to our care for the \n     weakest among us . . . The Khartoum government has the \n     greatest responsibility [for the violence and harassment \n     directed against the Fur Zagahawa and Masaalite black African \n     ethnic groups by the Janjaweed] and must be pressured to do \n     what it can to bring an end to the conflict. We continue to \n     urge the United Nations and our own government to apply that \n     pressure.'' (Catholic Sentinel, August 26, 2004)\n       Even though the atrocities being committed against the \n     population of Darfur were declared to be genocide by the \n     international community in July 2004, the violence has \n     continued unabated. It is clear that much more intensive and \n     sustained engagement is required of the international \n     community.\n       In May 2006, the Sudanese Government of National Unity and \n     the Sudan Liberation Movement signed the Darfur Peace \n     Agreement. Bishop Wenski, Chairman of the U.S. Conference of \n     Catholic Bishops Committee on International Policy, said the \n     peace accord ``will open the way for the United States to \n     hold the Sudanese government to its promise of allowing the \n     African Union peacekeeping force (AMIS) to be transformed \n     into a more robust and mobile UN mission with a strong \n     mandate. It is essential to strengthen significantly the \n     presence and responsiveness of peacekeeping forces in Darfur, \n     both to guarantee implementation of the peace agreement and \n     to win the confidence of the people.''\n       In answer to the Gospel's call to protect human life and \n     dignity, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops joined the \n     Save Darfur Coalition, an alliance of over 150 faith-based, \n     humanitarian, and human rights organizations that organized \n     the Million Voices for Darfur Campaign, in calling upon our \n     leaders to no longer remain silent in the face of the \n     killings, rape and wanton destruction occurring daily in \n     Darfur.\n       The specific actions that were requested included:\n       (1) Retain urgently needed funding for humanitarian relief \n     in the FY 2006 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill.\n       (2) Pressure the government in Khartoum to disarm the \n     warring factions, cease all attacks against innocent \n     civilians, provide unimpeded humanitarian access and bring to \n     justice those perpetrating crimes against humanity.\n       (3) Pressure both the government and the rebels to respect \n     the existing ceasefire agreement and to intensify the search \n     for a durable peace during ongoing negotiations in Abuja, \n     while simultaneously urging both Sudan and Chad to refrain \n     from any escalation that might lead to threatened \n     hostilities.\n       (4) Urge the U.S. to use its voice in the U.N. Security \n     Council to ensure the continuation of the mandate of the \n     African Union in Darfur to monitor the ceasefire, protect \n     innocent civilians, and assist international humanitarian \n     relief organizations, while urging NATO to provide AMIS with \n     all possible logistical support until the transition to full-\n     fledged UN peacekeeping force can be completed.\n       (5) Hold the signatories to the Comprehensive Peace \n     Agreement fully accountable, and honor the promise to provide \n     substantial financial and political support to the government \n     of national unity to undertake the reconstruction of the \n     country and its civil society.\n       (6) Urge the U.N. Security Council to continue its support \n     for the peacekeeping mission that is working with all parties \n     to the\n\n[[Page S8815]]\n\n     national-unity government to implement the peace accord. The \n     United States should provide adequate funding and logistical \n     support so that peace and security might be achieved.\n       The draft legislation that you have proposed (``Supporting \n     Peace and Alleviating Suffering in Darfur Act'', July 12, \n     2006 version) addresses these requested actions in a \n     comprehensive and thorough manner. We are deeply grateful \n     that you have demonstrated leadership on this issue and are \n     willing to take the necessary steps to protect the people of \n     Darfur from further harm. We join you in hoping that these \n     measures will be fully effective.\n       The events of the past few months demonstrate that \n     significant progress can be made with high level engagement \n     on the part of the U.S. Congress and Administration. Please \n     share our appreciation and gratitude with everyone who made \n     this initial step toward peace possible. We offer our full \n     support for continued and sustained leadership in the \n     difficult time ahead.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             David Carrier, Ph.D.,\n                            Director, Office of Justice and Peace.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Senator Smith and I have sent a bill to \nthe desk to address the heart-wrenching crisis in Darfur and support \nthe peace process there, and we look for its early consideration.\n  The horrifying violence in the Darfur region of Sudan was recognized \nby Congress and the Bush administration as genocide over 2 years ago, \nand it continues unabated today. However, rays of hope for peace can be \nseen on the horizon. On May 5, the Government of Sudan and the main \nrebel group, the Sudan Liberation Movement led by Minni Minnawi, agreed \nto a plan that, if implemented, could bring peace to Darfur.\n  The plan calls for an immediate cease-fire and requires the \nGovernment of Sudan to neutralize and disarm the Janjaweed militia, the \ngunmen supported by the government who have been conducting a bloody \ncampaign to forcibly displace non-Arab tribes from Darfur.\n  The Darfur Peace Agreement is an opportunity we need to seize. To do \nso, greater international pressure on the Sudanese government will be \nrequired in order to improve the prospects of effective implementation. \nDevelopments since its signing indicate that the present level of \ninternational pressure isn't enough.\n  Three months have passed, but the Sudanese Government has done little \nto take the most important step in the peace plan--disarming the \nJanjaweed. Khartoum's past record is not encouraging. It has pledged to \ndisarm the Janjaweed on previous occasions but then failed to follow \nthrough. This reluctance is not unexpected in light of the government's \ncynical use of the Janjaweed to exercise power in the Darfur region.\n  In recent months, the violence in Darfur has spilled over into \nneighboring Chad. The two governments each support armed groups opposed \nto the other. Sudanese helicopters and planes attack innocent villagers \nin Darfur, despite a United Nations order not to fly over Darfur.\n  The African Union Mission in Sudan, which has 7,000 peacekeepers in \nDarfur, has made a valiant effort to provide security and assist the \npeople of Darfur. Nonetheless, the African Union peacekeepers are not \nable even to defend themselves, much less the two million refugees and \ninternally displaced persons fleeing the violence. This mission is \nobviously unprepared and ill-equipped to press for and verify the \nimplementation of the May 5 peace agreement.\n  Sudan appears to be waiting to see whether the international \ncommunity will again just lament the crisis and make hollow threats, or \nis now ready and willing to take concrete steps. As one high-ranking \nSudanese Government official said to a Boston Globe reporter, ``The \nUnited Nations Security Council has threatened us so many times, we no \nlonger take it seriously.'' It is time for the United States and the \ninternational community to let the Sudanese Government know that this \ntime we expect Sudan to carry through on its commitments in the Darfur \nPeace Agreement. Fortunately, the international community has already \ntaken initial actions to support the May 5 Peace Agreement. The African \nUnion and the United Nations are planning for the transfer of \npeacekeeping responsibilities from the African Union to the United \nNations. In addition, NATO has begun planning on how to support a U.N. \npeacekeeping mission, and the European Union hosted a conference in \nJuly on assistance for Darfur.\n\n  Although the international community has signaled support for the \nDarfur Peace Agreement, Khartoum has been dragging its heels. In \nparticular, it has not yet agreed to allow a U.N. peacekeeping mission \ninto Darfur. The international community must strengthen its effort to \npersuade the Sudanese Government to comply with the agreement and \npermit the U.N. peacekeepers in Darfur.\n  One of the tragic outcomes of the Darfur violence is an alarming \nhumanitarian crisis. More than 3 million people in Darfur are dependent \non humanitarian assistance for survival. The violence in Darfur has \nforced millions to flee from their homes. The U.N. Office for the \nCoordination of Humanitarian Assistance reports that significant needs \nfor health, food and water, and sanitation are not being met in Darfur. \nThe World Food Program warns of a $400 million shortfall in the funds \nit now has for Sudan. Because of the shortages in food relief, the \nrefugees are receiving only partial rations.\n  The children suffer most. One in four children in Darfur die before \nthe age of five. The most needy frequently remain hidden, because \ninsecurity in the region prevents them from making the dangerous trip \nto international relief centers.\n  The United States has been the largest single donor of humanitarian \nassistance to the people of Darfur, and we must continue our effort in \norder to give the people of the region much-needed aid. We must do more \nto encourage the international community to do so as well.\n  Sadly, the continuation of violence in the region has severely \nhindered humanitarian aid efforts. In the past 6 months, aid groups in \neastern Chad have lost 26 vehicles to armed hijackers. One UNICEF \nworker was shot and nearly killed. It is unfair to put relief agencies \nin a situation where they must either risk having their aid workers \nmurdered or raped, or pull out and leave thousands in Darfur to die. \nU.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan said of this crisis, ``Giving aid \nwithout protection is like putting a Band-Aid on an open wound.''\n  To give peace the best chance of taking hold, peace, the Sudanese \nGovernment must be persuaded to implement its commitment to neutralize \nand disarm the Janjaweed. The Sudanese can be influenced by what the \nrest of the world does. Sudan is not an isolated, remote land. It is \nthe largest country in Africa, and has significant economic and \npolitical ties to the rest of Africa and the world.\n  Now is the time for the United States, in concert with other \ncountries, to act on Darfur. This is why Senator Smith and I have \nintroduced legislation to urge the Sudanese parties to honor their \ncommitment in the peace accord. The bill also helps to address the \nunmet humanitarian needs in Darfur.\n  At its core, the legislation is intended to encourage greater \ninternational pressure on the Government of Sudan to fulfill its \nobligations in the peace agreement and to allow U.N. peacekeepers into \nDarfur.\n  In preparing this legislation, we have worked closely with the NGO \ncommunity of experts. Groups such as the International Crisis Group, \nRefugees International, Save Darfur Coalition, the Hebrew International \nAid Society, the American Jewish Committee, the American Jewish World \nService, and Physicians for Human Rights have endorsed it. I will ask \nthat the letters of endorsements that I have submitted be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The legislation assigns to the Presidential envoy for Sudan the \nresponsibility for supporting the Darfur peace process and, together \nwith the international community, to press the Sudanese parties to \nimplement the agreed-upon ceasefire and disarm the Janjaweed militia.\n  It calls on the Government of Sudan to immediately allow a U.N. \npeacekeeping force to enter Darfur and to implement the Darfur Peace \nAgreement.\n  It calls on NATO to enforce the no-fly zone over Darfur, if requested \nby the U.N., and to provide airlift, and logistical and intelligence \nsupport to the peacekeepers.\n  It calls on the international community to act promptly to meet the \noutstanding humanitarian assistance\n\n[[Page S8816]]\n\nneeds. We must do our part too. The legislation authorizes $150 million \nin additional funds for each of the next 5 fiscal years to meet these \nneeds.\n  Under the legislation, the President will report on whether the \nSudanese Government is implementing the peace agreement and has agreed \nto allow a U.N. peacekeeping mission to enter Darfur. If so, then the \nPresidential special envoy for Sudan will be requested to develop \nrecommendations to advance the peace process. If the Sudanese \nGovernment refuses, then the President will impose sanctions targeted \non the leaders of Sudan, urge the international community to do the \nsame, and continue to oppose normalization of its relations with Sudan.\n  In addition, the bill requires reports from the Commerce Department \nidentifying companies investing $5 million or more in Sudan and a \nlisting of the assets of Sudanese leaders in the United States and \nelsewhere.\n  With so much other violence erupting in the world, we must not ignore \nthe crisis in Darfur. Without international action, the genocide will \ngo on. The Sudanese Government will balk or move slowly on disarming \nthe Janjaweed and bringing an end to the violence. Experts estimate \nthat since the conflict in Darfur began in 2004, up to 300,000 people \nhave been killed, and an estimated 1.9 million have been displaced. \nEvery day that we fail to act, those shameful numbers will increase.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letters to which I \nreferred be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                   International Crisis Group,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 1, 2006.\n     Hon. Edward Kennedy,\n     Russell Senate Building,\n     Washington DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: The International Crisis Group \n     strongly supports the Peace in Darfur Act of 2006, which you \n     are co-sponsoring with Senator Smith.\n       For the past 2 years, Crisis Group has advocated for tough \n     legislation to address the ongoing atrocities in Darfur, \n     Sudan. Last year, we endorsed the Darfur Accountability Act \n     (HR 1424) and the Darfur Peace and Accountability Act (HR \n     3127). The Peace in Darfur Act complements previous \n     legislation by calling explicitly for the U.S. to do the \n     following: name a special envoy and lead multilateral \n     efforts; increase pressure on the government of Sudan to \n     allow the deployment of a robust UN peace support mission \n     under Chapter VII of the UN Charter; and encourage non-\n     signatories to sign the Darfur Peace Agreement by addressing \n     its inadequacies.\n       Congressional action has been crucial in providing life-\n     saving humanitarian assistance to millions of conflict-\n     affected civilians in Darfur and in supporting African \n     peacekeepers, but the situation remains critical. Concerted \n     pressure on the government of Sudan, including U.S. support \n     for the work of the International Criminal Court, is vital to \n     hold perpetrators of atrocities accountable and to ensure \n     that UN forces are deployed to protect civilians.\n           Yours sincerely,\n                                                Mark L.

Edward Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: I am writing in support of the Peace \n     in Darfur Act of 2006, which you and Sen. Smith are co-\n     sponsoring. This important piece of legislation keeps the \n     pressure on the government of Sudan and other parties to \n     honor and implement the Darfur Peace Agreement. It recognizes \n     the need to support the African Union force (AM IS) while \n     moving toward a UN force in Darfur, and it calls for the \n     continuation of necessary humanitarian aid.\n       Last week I returned from Darfur, where death, displacement \n     and suffering are continuing, despite the signing of the \n     Darfur Peace Agreement on May 5th. Based on talks with \n     internally displaced people, rebel leaders, Sudanese \n     government officials, civil society leaders, diplomats and UN \n     officials, it is clear to me that the U.S. must keep the \n     pressure on the government of Sudan to disarm the Janjaweed \n     militia and work for peace. The appointment of a presidential \n     envoy will give the U.S. more leverage and focus in its \n     efforts to promote peace in Darfur.\n       Please ask your office to contact me if I can be of further \n     assistance in supporting the Peace in Darfur Act of 2006.\n           Sincerely,\n     Kenneth H. Bacon,\n                                  ____\n\n                                                        President.\n\n\n                                 Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society,\n\n                                      New York, NY, July 28, 2006.\n     Hon. Gordon Smith,\n     Senate Russell Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Senate Russell Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith and Senator Kennedy: I am writing on \n     behalf of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS) to express \n     our strong support for the ``Peace in Darfur Act of 2006.''\n       For over 125 years, HIAS has helped millions of people \n     fleeing persecution and poverty through rescue, resettlement \n     and reunion. The Jewish tradition's emphasis on refugee \n     protection and our community's experience with the trauma of \n     genocide and refugee flight make what's happening in Darfur \n     an issue of primary concern for the Jewish community. We \n     therefore applaud this bill for taking concrete steps to \n     alleviate the inconceivable suffering and hardship that so \n     many innocent Sudanese have endured in the past three years.\n       Specifically, we are pleased that this bill authorizes $150 \n     million in additional funding to help meet the unmet \n     humanitarian needs in Darfur. With an office in eastern Chad \n     and programs in three refugee camps, HIAS has seen first-hand \n     the dire consequences when the basic necessities of life, \n     including food, water, and health services, are not met. In \n     June 2005, HIAS launched the Initiative for Sudanese Refugees \n     in Chad, which is intended to strengthen the refugees' \n     psychological and social conditions and to convey skills \n     needed to survive and function in the aftermath of extreme \n     violence. Re-acquisition of these basic skills is crucial to \n     break the chain of dependence and suffering caused by severe \n     psychological trauma. By allocating additional funding to \n     provide such basic necessities as food and water, this bill \n     will help remove yet another hurdle to the Darfuri refugees' \n     ability to support themselves and regain control over their \n     lives and well-being.\n       The Jewish community, knowing all too well what results \n     when genocide is met with silence and inaction, has \n     aggressively denounced the genocide in Darfur and called on \n     the U.S. Government to do more in response. By requiring the \n     Administration to take several important actions, including \n     appointing a Special Envoy for Sudan, the ``Peace in Darfur \n     Act of 2006'' is a significant and vital bill that should be \n     supported by all Members of Congress. To us, ``never again'' \n     is more than just a quote--it is a mandate.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Gideon Aronoff,\n     CEO and President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                The American Jewish Committee,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 2, 2006.\n       Dear Senator: \n       ``First they came first for the Communists, and I did not \n     speak out because I was not a Communist. Then they came for \n     the Socialists, and I did not speak out, because I was not a \n     Socialist; Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did \n     not speak out because I was not a trade unionist. Then they \n     came for the Jews, and I did not speak out because I was not \n     a Jew. Then they came for me, and there was no one left to \n     speak out for me.''\n       In 1945 Lutheran Pastor Martin Niemoller's voice echoed \n     around the globe as the world grieved over millions of lives \n     lost at the hands of genocide. Sixty years later, America \n     grieves as millions of innocent victims are being displaced, \n     raped, tortured, and murdered in the Darfur region of Sudan.\n       Pressure is mounting for the Sudanese government to end its \n     genocide. Over the past two years, Congress has allocated \n     more than $250 million to expand and strengthen the role of \n     the African Union Mission in Darfur and to provide additional \n     humanitarian disaster relief throughout the region. As the \n     nation's oldest human relations organization, the American \n     Jewish Committee applauds Congress' action in approving these \n     funds, but we believe that more must be done.\n       The fragile peace agreement reached in May now seems \n     shattered as fighting continues to rage throughout the \n     region. To halt the killing and displacement, civilians must \n     be protected, the peace agreement must be implemented, and a \n     secure environment must be established for the delivery of \n     humanitarian aid. As atrocities, crimes against humanity and \n     genocidal acts continue throughout the region, we urge you to \n     take further action toward protecting besieged Sudanese \n     civilians by supporting the Peace in Darfur Act.\n       The Peace in Darfur Act, introduced by Senators Gordon \n     Smith and Edward Kennedy, directs the President to appoint a \n     new special envoy to Sudan. The Special Envoy, in \n     collaboration with international partners, would be best \n     positioned to advance the Darfur peace process. The bill also \n     calls on the government of Sudan to allow a UN peacekeeping \n     force to enter Darfur; NATO to provide humanitarian, \n     logistical, and personnel support to the UN; NATO to enforce \n     the no-fly zone over Darfur; and the international community \n     to not only support the African Union Mission (AMIS) in \n     Sudan, but also to provide humanitarian assistance. The bill \n     also authorizes an additional $150 million in humanitarian \n     aid for Fiscal Years 2008-2012. Further, the bill mandates a \n     Presidential report on the situation in Darfur that will cast \n     new light on the Sudanese government's actions and provide a \n     basis to impose targeted sanctions if necessary.\n       On behalf of a community that has suffered persecution and \n     even genocide all too often\n\n[[Page S8817]]\n\n     in our history, we urge you to support this crucial piece of \n     legislation. The time to act is now. History has demonstrated \n     the price of standing idly by in the face of such horrors.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                Richard T.

A bill to amend the Consolidated Omnibus Budget \nReconciliation Act of 1985 to expand the county organized health \ninsuring organizations authorized to enroll Medicaid beneficiaries; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this bill will allow two California \ncounties, Ventura and Merced, to provide health care to Medi-Cal \nbeneficiaries through the model they have determined best meets their \ncommunities' needs.\n  This legislation allows Merced and Ventura to establish community \noperated health systems, COHS, and raises the percentage of Medi-Cal \nbeneficiaries who are enrolled in these programs from 16 percent to 18 \npercent.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3802\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to prohibit commercial air tour operations over \nKalaupapa National Historical Park, Kaloka-Honokohau National \nHistorical Park, Pu'uhonua o Honaunau National Historical Park, and \nPu'ukohola Heiau National Historic Site; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwill prohibit commercial air tour operations over Kalaupapa National \nHistorical Park, Kaloko-Honokohau National Historical Park, Pu`uhonua o \nHonaunau National Historical Park and Pu`ukohola Heiau National \nHistoric Site.\n  When Congress first established the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park in \n1916, the intent was to preserve the integrity and peace of the park's \nnearly 400 square miles of volcanoes, rivers, forests, wildlife and \nsacred sites. In the last few decades, however, the growth of the air \ntourism industry has considerably interrupted the tranquility of \nHawaii's National Parks. Air tourism has had an adverse impact on the \nability of Native Hawaiians to practice peaceful protocols of sacred \nsites. The sound from aircraft activity can significantly impinge on \nthe solemnity of sacred sites and ceremonies.\n  Sacred sites, including the airspace of the designated locales, are \nan important resource for the Hawaiian people and we must do what is \nnecessary to ensure that the value of these sites is not diminished. By \nprohibiting air tourism over these areas, the Hawaiian Sacred Sites \nNoise Reduction Act affords Natives Hawaiians, residents and visitors \nto our beautiful state the peace and tranquility to enjoy these sacred \nsites. I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mrs. Lincoln, Mrs. Hutchison, and Mr. \n        Kerry):\n  S. 3806. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na shorter recovery period for the depreciation of certain improvements \nto retail space; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that will \nprovide relief and equity to our Nation's 1.5 million retail \nestablishments, most of which have less than five employees. This \nlegislation is one in a series of proposals that, if enacted, will \nreduce both the amount of taxes that small businesses pay, but also the \nadministrative burden that unfairly saddles them as they attempt to \ncomply with our Nation's tax laws.\n  The proposal reduces from 39 to 15 years the depreciable life of \nimprovements that are made to retail stores that are owned by the \nretailer. Under current law, only retailers that lease their property \nare allowed this accelerated depreciation, which means it excludes \nretailers that also own the property in which they operate. My bill \nsimply seeks to provide equal treatment to all retailers.\n  Before I talk about the specifics of this particular provision, let \nme first explain why it is so critical that we begin evaluating how we \ncan best reform the Tax Code, which increasingly keeps our small \nbusinesses trapped in a paralyzing state of regulatory limbo. As is \nwell-known small businesses are the foundation of our Nation's economy. \nAccording to the Small Business Administration, small businesses \nrepresent 99 percent of all employers, employ 51 percent the private-\nsector workforce, and contribute 51 percent of the private-sector \noutput.\n  Despite the fact that small businesses are the real job-creators for \nour Nation's economy, the current tax system imposes large and \nexpensive requirements in terms of satisfying their reporting and \nrecordkeeping obligations. This is a problem Congress must address \nbecause small companies are disadvantaged most in terms of the money \nand time spent in satisfying their tax obligation. Why create \ndistractions for them as they simply seek to comply with the law?\n  For example, according to the Small Business Administration's Office \nof Advocacy, small businesses spend an astounding 8 billion hours each \nyear complying with government reports. They also spend more than 80 \npercent of this time on completing tax forms. What's even more \ntroubling is that companies that employ fewer than 20 employees spend \nnearly $1,304 per employee in tax compliance costs; an amount that is \nnearly 67 percent more than larger firms.\n  These statistics are disturbing for several reasons. First, the fact \nthat small businesses are being required to spend so much money on \ncompliance costs means they have fewer earnings to reinvest into their \nbusiness. This, in turn, means that they have less money to spend on \nnew equipment or on worker training, which unfortunately has an adverse \neffect on their overall production and the economy as a whole.\n  Second, the fact that small business owners are required to make such \na sizeable investment of their time into completing paperwork means \nthey have less time to spend on doing what they do best--running their \nbusiness and creating jobs.\n\n  Let me be clear that I am in no way suggesting that small business \nowners are unique in having to pay income taxes, and I am certainly not \nexpecting them to receive a free pass. What I am\n\n[[Page S8818]]\n\nasking for, though, is a change to make the Tax Code fairer and simpler \nso that small companies can satisfy this obligation without having to \nexpend the amount of resources that they do currently.\n  For that reason, the package of proposals that I have introduced will \nprovide not only targeted, affordable tax relief to small business \nowners but also simpler rules under the Tax Code. By simplifying the \nTax Code, small business owners will be able to satisfy their tax \nobligation in a cheaper, more efficient manner, allowing them to be \nable to devote more time and resources to their business.\n  Specifically, the proposal that I am introducing today will simply \nconform the tax codes to the realities that retailers on Main Street \nface. Studies conducted by the Treasury Department, Congressional \nResearch Service and private economists have all found that the 39-year \ndepreciation life for buildings is too long and that the 39-year \ndepreciation life for building improvements is even worse. Retailers \ngenerally remodel their stores every 5 to 7 years to reflect changes in \ncustomer base and compete with newer stores. Moreover, many \nimprovements such as interior partitions, ceiling tiles, restroom \naccessories, and paint, may only last a few years before requiring \nreplacement.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is a tremendous opportunity to help \nsmall enterprises succeed by providing an incentive for reinvestment. \nEvery Member of this body has small retail constituents in small towns \nwho may be in buildings that they have owned for generations and are \nstruggling to compete. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting \nthis vital legislation as we work with the President to transform such \na critical investment incentive into law. Finally, I would like to \nthank Senators Lincoln, Hutchison, and Kerry for joining me as \ncosponsors to this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3806\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, along Main Street, in a countless number of \ntowns, many small businesses are placed at a competitive disadvantage \nby our tax laws. Business owners need to remodel their store every 5 to \n7 years. Consumers' tastes and needs change, and to stay competitive, a \nstore needs to reflect those changes. If a store is owned, the owner is \nrequired to depreciate the renovation costs over 39 years, but a store \nthat has leased space in the strip-mall across town, depreciates \nrenovation costs over a 15-year period. The result: a Main Street store \nowner pays twice as much to renovate as their counterpart who leases.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation along with Senator Snowe that \nwill even the playing field for businesses that own the real estate \nwhere their business is located. We want parity between the business \nowners who own and those who lease their property.\n  The Treasury Department, the Congressional Research Service, and \nprivate economists have found that the depreciation life for \nrenovations is far too long. These tax rules generate high tax costs, \nlaying the burden on small town, rural retailers who are more likely to \nown their property than retailers in urban areas. It is time to address \nthis inequity by reducing the 39-year tax depreciation period to 15 \nyears. I urge my colleagues to support our Main Street stores through \nsupport of this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENZI (for himself and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 3807. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act and the \nFederal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to improve drug safety and \noversight, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a very important \nbill, one that my colleague Senator Kennedy and I have been working on \nfor some time.\n  In 2005, the HELP Committee held two hearings on the issue of drug \nsafety. We received over 50 recommendations from witnesses at those \nhearings. At that time, Senator Kennedy and I pledged to develop a \ncomprehensive response to the drug safety issues raised. The Enhancing \nDrug Safety and Innovation Act is the product of working across party \nlines, and creates a structured framework for resolving safety \nconcerns.\n  Under the Enhancing Drug Safety and Innovation Act, FDA would begin \nto approve drugs and biologics, and new indications for these products, \nwith risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, REMS. The REMS is \ndesigned to be an integrated, flexible mechanism to acquire and adapt \nto new safety information about a drug. The sponsor and FDA will assess \nand review an approved REMS at least annually for the first 3 years, as \nwell as in applications for a new indication, when the sponsor suggests \nchanges, or when FDA requests a review based on new safety information.\n  The development of tools to evaluate medical products has not kept \npace with discoveries in basic science. New tools are needed to better \npredict safety and efficacy, which in turn would increase the speed and \nefficiency of applied biomedical research. The Enhancing Drug Safety \nand Innovation Act would spur innovation by establishing a new public-\nprivate partnership at the FDA to advance the Critical Path Initiative \nand improve the sciences of developing, manufacturing, and evaluating \nthe safety and effectiveness of drugs, devices, biologics and \ndiagnostics.\n  The Enhancing Drug Safety and Innovation Act also establishes a \ncentral clearinghouse for information about clinical trials and their \nresults to help patients, providers and researchers learn new \ninformation and make more informed health care decisions.\n  Finally, the Enhancing Drug Safety and Innovation Act would make \nimprovements to FDA's process for screening advisory committee members \nfor financial conflicts of interest. FDA relies on its 30 advisory \ncommittees to provide independent expert advice, lend credibility to \nthe product review process, and inform consumers of trends in product \ndevelopment. The bill would clarify and streamline FDA's processes for \nevaluating candidates for service on an advisory committee, and address \nthe key challenge of identifying a sufficient number of people with the \nnecessary expertise and a minimum of potential conflicts of interest to \nserve on advisory committees.\n  I want to thank the dozens of stakeholders, including the Food and \nDrug\n\n[[Page S8819]]\n\nAdministration, patient and consumer groups, industry associations, \nindividual companies, and scientific experts who have taken the time \nand effort to give us their comments and input on the bill. Their \nassistance has been invaluable.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to advance this \nimportant piece of legislation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Senator Enzi, chairman of the Senate \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, and I are introducing \nthe Enhancing Drug Safety and Innovation Act of 2006. The goals of this \nlegislation are to enhance the Food and Drug Administration's authority \nover the safety of prescription drugs after they are approved; to \nencourage innovation in medical products; to improve access to clinical \ntrials for patients and ensure that the doctors and patients learn \nabout the results of clinical trials involving the drugs they prescribe \nand use; and to improve the screening of members of FDA's scientific \nadvisory committees to avoid conflicts of interest.\n  The withdrawal of the drug Vioxx from the market nearly 2 years ago \nshowed us once again that all prescription drugs have risks, many of \nwhich we may not know about when a drug is approved or even for years \nafter approval. That is why we need a more effective system to identify \nand assess the serious risks of drugs, inform health care providers and \npatients about such risks, and manage or minimize these risks as soon \nas they are detected.\n  Our bill will require every drug to have a risk evaluation and \nmitigation strategy, or REMS, when it is approved. For many drugs, the \nREMS will include only the drug labeling, reports of adverse events, a \njustification for why only such reporting is needed, and a timetable \nfor assessing how the REMS is working.\n  The FDA will be able to include additional requirements for a drug \nthat poses serious risks, such as by requiring the drug to be dispensed \nto patients with labeling that patients can understand, that the drug \ncompany have a plan to inform health care providers about how to use \nthe drug safely, or that a drug should not be advertised directly to \nconsumers for up to 2 years after approval. If a serious safety signal \nneeds to be understood, FDA can require further studies or even \nclinical trials after the drug is approved. Enhanced data-collection \nand data-mining techniques will help identify risk signals earlier and \nmore thoroughly.\n  For a drug with the most serious side effects, FDA will be able to \nrequire that its REMS include the restrictions on distribution and use \nneeded to assure its safe use.\n  The FDA will be able to impose any of these requirements at the time \na drug is approved, and the agency can also modify the labeling or \notherwise alter a drug's REMS after the approval. The drug's \nmanufacturer will propose the REMS, or modifications to it, and the FDA \nand the company will try to work out an adequate REMS. If the agency \nand the company cannot agree, the agency's Drug Safety Oversight Board \ncan review the dispute and recommend a resolution to senior FDA \nofficials, who will make the final decision.\n  Civil monetary penalties are added to FDA's traditional enforcement \ntools to ensure compliance. Drug user fees will be used to review and \nimplement the program.\n  The bill formalizes and makes mandatory what is now only informal and \nvoluntary. Our intent is not to change standards for approving drugs \nbut to ensure that the FDA has the ability to identify, assess, and \nmanage risks as they become known. Better risk management will mean \nthat drugs with special benefits for some patients will remain \navailable, despite their serious risks for other patients, because FDA \ncan better identify the risks and minimize them.\n  The bill helps to improve drug safety in other ways as well. The \nReagan-Udall Institute for Applied Biomedical Research will be a new \npublic-private partnership at the FDA to advance the agency's Critical \nPath Initiative, which is intended to improve the science of \ndeveloping, manufacturing, and evaluating the safety and effectiveness \nof drugs, biologics, medical devices, and diagnostics.\n\n  The institute will be supported by Federal funds and by contributions \nfrom the pharmaceutical and device industries. Philanthropic \norganizations will be able to supplement Federal support. The institute \nwill have a board of directors and an executive director, and will \nreport to Congress annually on its operations.\n  The bill will also expand the public database at NIH to encourage \nmore patients to enroll in clinical trials of drugs. This database \nwould build on the current systems and would include late phase II, \nphase III, and all phase IV clinical trials for all drugs.\n  A second, publicly available database would include the results of \nphase III and phase IV clinical trials of drugs, with the possibility \nthat late phase II trials would be added later. Posting of results \ncould be delayed for up to 2 years, pending the approval of the drug or \nthe publication of trial results in a peer-reviewed journal. The public \nneeds to know about the results of clinical trials on drugs. \nTragically, such information was not adequately available for the \nclinical studies of antidepressants in children.\n  Posting information in the clinical trials registry and the clinical \ntrials results database will be requirements for Federal research \nfunding and for drug review and approval by the FDA. Both the FDA and \nthe Inspector General Office of the Department of Health and Human \nServices would review the content of submissions to the results \ndatabase to ensure they are truthful and nonpromotional. These Federal \nrequirements would preempt State requirements for clinical trial \ndatabases.\n  Finally, the bill will improve FDA's process for screening advisory \ncommittee members for financial conflicts of interest. The agency \nrelies on its advisory committees to provide independent, expert, \nnonbinding recommendations on significant issues. Ideally, committee \nmembers should be free of any financial ties to the companies affected \nby an issue before a committee. But at times, there may be no \nindividual without financial ties to such companies--for example, when \nthe issue involves a rare disease or a cutting edge medical technology. \nIn these cases, the FDA must be able to grant a waiver to allow an \nindividual with essential expertise to serve on the committee. The bill \nwill require the agency to seek qualified experts with minimal \nconflicts, clarify how it makes waiver decisions, and disclose those \ndecisions at least 15 days before a committee meeting.\n  Our bill is a comprehensive response to drug safety and other \nimportant issues involving prescription drugs and other medical \ntechnologies. I commend Chairman Enzi and his dedicated staff--\nespecially Amy Muhlberg--for working closely with us on this proposal, \nand I urge our Senate colleagues to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 3809. A bill for the relief of Jacqueline W. Coats; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I offer today private relief \nlegislation to provide lawful permanent residence status to Jacqueline \nCoats, a 26-year-old widow currently living in San Francisco.\n  Mrs. Coats came to the U.S. in 2001 from Kenya on a student visa to \nstudy mass communications at San Jose State University. Her visa status \nlapsed in 2003, and the Department of Homeland Security began \ndeportation proceedings against her.\n  Mrs. Coats married Marlin Coats on April 17, 2006, after dating for \nseveral years. The couple was happily married and planning to start a \nfamily when, on May 13, Mr. Coats tragically died in a heroic attempt \nto save two young boys from drowning.\n  The couple had been on a Mother's Day outing at Ocean Beach with some \nof Mr. Coats's nephews when they heard cries for help. Having worked as \na lifeguard in the past, Mr. Coats instinctively dove into the water. \nThe two children were saved with the help of a rescue crew, but Mr. \nCoats, caught in a riptide, died. Mrs. Coats received a medal honoring \nher husband.\n  Four days before Mr. Coats's death, the couple prepared and signed an \napplication for a green card at their attorney's office. Unfortunately \nthe petition was not filed until after his death,\n\n[[Page S8820]]\n\nrendering it invalid. Mrs. Coats currently has a hearing before an \nimmigration judge in San Francisco on August 24, but her attorney has \ninformed my staff that she has no relief available to her and will be \nordered deported.\n  Mrs. Coats, devastated by the loss of her husband, is now caught in a \nbattle for her right to stay in America. At a recent news conference \nwith her lawyer, Thip Ark, she explained of her situation, ``I feel \nlike I have nothing to live for. I have nothing to go home to. . . . \nI've been here 4 years. . . . It would be like starting a new life.''\n  Ms. Ark explains that Mrs. Coats is extremely close with her late \nhusband's family, with whom she lives in San Leandro, CA. Mrs. Coats \nhas said that her husband's large family has become her own. Ramona \nBurton of San Francisco, one of Marlin Coats's seven brothers and \nsisters explains, ``She spent her first American Christmas with us, her \nfirst American Thanksgiving. . . . I can't imagine looking around and \nnot seeing her there. She needs to be there.''\n  The San Francisco and bay area community is rallying strong support \nfor Mrs. Coats. The San Francisco chapters of the NAACP, the San \nFrancisco Board of Supervisors, and the San Francisco Police \nDepartment, have all passed resolutions in support of Mrs. Coats's \nright to remain in the country.\n  Unfortunately, if this private relief bill is not approved, this \nyoung woman, and the Coats family, will face yet another disorienting \nand heartbreaking tragedy. Mrs. Coats will be deported to Kenya, a \ncountry she has not lived in since she was 21. In her time of grieving, \nshe will be forced to leave her home, her job with AC Transit, her new \nfamily, and everything she has known for the past 5 years.\n  I cannot think of a compelling reason why the United States should \nnot allow this young widow to continue the green card process. Had her \nhusband lived, Mrs. Coats would have filed the papers without \ndifficulty. It was because of her husband's selfless and heroic act \nthat Mrs. Coats must now struggle to remain in the country. As one \nconcerned California constituent wrote to me, ``If ever there was a \ncase where common fairness, morality and decency should reign over \nlegal technicalities, this is it. We, as a country, need to reward \nheroism and good.''\n  I believe that we can reward the late Mr. Coats for his noble actions \nby granting his wife citizenship. It is what he intended for her. It \ncan even be argued that a green card for his wife was one of his dying \nwishes, as the papers were signed just 4 days prior to his death.\n  For these reasons, I offer this private relief immigration bill and \nask my colleagues to support it on behalf of Mrs. Coats.\n  I also ask for unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3809\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS FOR JACQUELINE W. COATS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of \n     section 201 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1151), Jacqueline W. Coats shall be eligible for issuance of \n     an immigrant visa or for adjustment of status to that of an \n     alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence upon filing \n     an application for issuance of an immigrant visa under \n     section 204 of that Act or for adjustment of status to lawful \n     permanent resident.\n       (b) Adjustment of Status.--If Jacqueline W. Coats enters \n     the United States before the filing deadline specified in \n     subsection (c), Jacqueline W. Coats shall be considered to \n     have entered and remained lawfully and shall be eligible for \n     adjustment of status under section 245 of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1255) as of the date of enactment \n     of this Act.\n       (c) Deadline for Application and Payment of Fees.--\n     Subsections (a) and (b) shall apply only if the application \n     for issuance of an immigrant visa or the application for \n     adjustment of status is filed with appropriate fees within 2 \n     years after the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (d) Reduction of Immigrant Visa Numbers.--Upon the granting \n     of an immigrant visa or permanent residence to Jacqueline W. \n     Coats, the Secretary of State shall instruct the proper \n     officer to reduce by 1, during the current or next following \n     fiscal year, the total number of immigrant visas that are \n     made available to natives of the country of birth of \n     Jacqueline W. Coats under section 203(a) of the Immigration \n     and Nationality Act or, if applicable, the total number of \n     immigrant visas that are made available to natives of the \n     country of birth of Jacqueline W. Coats under section 202(e) \n     of that Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 3810. A bill to prevent tobacco smuggling, to ensure the \ncollection of all tobacco taxes, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Schumer to \nintroduce the Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking, PACT, Act of 2006. As \nthe problem of cigarette trafficking continues to worsen, we must \nprovide law enforcement officials with the tools they need to crack \ndown on cigarette trafficking. The PACT Act closes loopholes in current \ntobacco trafficking laws, enhances penalties for violations, and \nprovides law enforcement with new tools to combat the innovative new \nmethods being used by cigarette traffickers to distribute their \nproducts. Each day we delay passage of this important legislation, \nterrorists and criminals raise more money, states lose significant \namounts of tax revenue, and kids have easy access to tobacco products \nover the Internet.\n  The cost to Americans is not merely financial. Tobacco smuggling also \nposes a significant threat to innocent people around the world. It has \ndeveloped into a popular, and highly profitable, means of generating \nrevenue for criminal and terrorist organizations. Hezbollah, for \nexample, earned $1.5 million between 1996 and 2000 by engaging in \ntobacco trafficking in the United States. Al-Qaida and Hamas have also \ngenerated significant revenue from the sale of counterfeit cigarettes. \nThat money is often raised right here in the United States, and it is \nthen funneled back to these international terrorist groups. Cutting off \nfinancial support to terrorist groups is an integral part of the \nprotecting this country against future attacks. We can no longer \ncontinue to let terrorist organizations exploit weaknesses in our \ntobacco laws to generate significant amounts of money. The cost of \ndoing nothing is too great.\n  This is not a minor problem. Cigarette smuggling is a multibillion \ndollar a year phenomenon, and it is getting worse. In 1998, the Bureau \nof Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, BATFE, had six active \ntobacco smuggling investigations. In 2005, the that number swelled to \n452.\n  The number of cases alone, however, does not sufficiently put this \nproblem into perspective. The amount of money involved is truly \nastonishing. Cigarette trafficking, including the illegal sale of \ntobacco products over the Internet, costs States billions of dollars in \nlost tax revenue each year. It is estimated that Federal tax losses to \nInternet cigarette sales will reach $1.4 billion this year. As lost \ntobacco tax revenue lines the pockets of criminals and terrorist \ngroups, states are being forced to raise college tuition and restrict \naccess to other public programs. Tobacco smuggling may provide some \nwith cheap access to cigarettes, but those cheap cigarettes are coming \nat a significant cost to the rest of us.\n  According to the Government Accountability Office, GAO, each year, \ncigarette trafficking investigations are growing more and more complex, \nand take longer to resolve. More people are selling cigarettes \nillegally, and they are getting better at it. As these cases get \ntougher to solve, we owe it to law enforcement officials to do our part \nto lend a helping hand. The PACT Act enhances BATFE's authority to \nenter premises to investigate and enforce cigarette trafficking laws, \nand increasing penalties for violations. Unless these existing laws are \nstrengthened, traffickers will continue to operate with near impunity.\n  Just as important, though, we must provide law enforcement with new \nenforcement tools tools that enable them to combat the cigarette \nsmugglers of the 21st century. The Internet represents one of those new \nobstacles to enforcement. Illegal tobacco vendors around the world \nevade detection by conducting transactions over the Internet, and then \nemploying the services of common carriers and the U.S. Postal Service \nto deliver their illegal products around the country. Just a few years\n\n[[Page S8821]]\n\nago, there were less than 100 vendors selling cigarettes online. Today, \napproximately 500 vendors sell illegal tobacco products over the \nInternet.\n  Without new and innovative enforcement methods, law enforcement will \nnot be able to effectively address the growing challenges facing them \ntoday. The PACT Act sets out to do just that by cutting off the \ndelivery. A significant part of this problem involves the shipment of \ncontraband cigarettes through the United States Postal Service, USPS. \nThis bill would cut off access to the USPS by making tobacco products \nnon-mailable. We would treat cigarettes just like we treat alcohol, \nmaking it illegal to ship them through the US mails and cutting off a \nlarge portion of the delivery system.\n  It also employs a novel approach, one being used in some of our \nStates today, to combat illegal sales of tobacco over the Internet. \nSpecifically, it will allow the Attorney General, in collaboration with \nState and local law enforcement, to create a list of companies that are \nillegally selling tobacco products. That list will then be distributed \nto legitimate businesses whose services are indispensable to illegal \ninternet vendors--common carriers. Once a common carrier knows which \ncustomers are breaking the law, this bill will ensure that they take \nappropriate action to prevent their companies from being exploited by \nterrorists and other criminals.\n  It is important to point out that this bill has been carefully \nnegotiated with the common carriers, including UPS, to ensure that it \ndoes not place any unreasonable burdens on these businesses. Many \nchanges were made to the bill that was introduced in the last Congress \nto ensure that the legislation was written to conform to the \ntechnological capabilities of these companies. In light of these \nchanges, there is no question that private carriers will be able to \nfully comply with this bill without interrupting their existing \ndelivery practices and procedures.\n  In addition, the legislation makes clear that we are not asking for \nperfection. For example, carriers will not be held liable for the \nactions of their employees if they have effective policies and \nprocedures in place to ensure compliance. The key word here is \n``effective.'' These policies must be much more than mere words. We are \nnot asking common carriers to ensure that every single pack of \ncigarettes is stopped before it moves through their delivery system, \nbut we do expect a vigorous effort to ensure that they and their \nemployees do the very best they can to stop doing business with people \nthey know to be using their services to violate State and Federal laws. \nThat is not too much to ask.\n  In addition to these important law enforcement needs, it is important \nto mention another aspect of this legislation that is equally \nimportant. One of the primary ways children get access to cigarettes \ntoday is on the internet and through the mails. The PACT Act now \ncontains a strong age verification section that will ensure that online \nvendors are not selling cigarettes to our children. This provision \nwould prohibit the sale of tobacco products to children, and it would \nalso require sellers to use a method of shipment that requires a \nsignature and photo ID check upon delivery. Most States already have \nsimilar laws on the books, and this would simply make sure that we have \na national standard to ensure that the Internet is not being used to \nevade similar ID checks we require at our grocery and convenience \nstores.\n  The recognition that this is a significant problem, along with the \ncommonsense approach taken in the PACT Act to combat it, has brought \ntogether a coalition of strange bedfellows. The legislation has not \njust garnered the support of the law enforcement community, including \nthe National Association of Attorneys General, and public health \nadvocates, such as the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids. It also has the \nstrong support of tobacco companies like Altria. These groups, who \nsometimes find themselves on opposite sides of these issues, all agree \nthat this is an issue begging to be addressed. They all recognize the \nurgent need to provide our law enforcement officials with the tools \nthey need to combat a very serious threat to our security and protect \npublic health.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation, and I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3810\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Prevent \n     All Cigarette Trafficking Act of 2006'' or ``PACT Act''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the sale of illegal cigarettes and smokeless tobacco \n     products significantly reduces Federal, State, and local \n     government revenues, with Internet sales alone accounting for \n     billions of dollars of lost Federal, State, and local tobacco \n     tax revenue each year;\n       (2) Hezbollah, Hamas, al Qaeda, and other terrorist \n     organizations have profited from trafficking in illegal \n     cigarettes or counterfeit cigarette tax stamps;\n       (3) terrorist involvement in illicit cigarette trafficking \n     will continue to grow because of the large profits such \n     organizations can earn;\n       (4) the sale of illegal cigarettes and smokeless tobacco \n     over the Internet, and through mail, fax, or phone orders, \n     make it cheaper and easier for children to obtain tobacco \n     products;\n       (5) the majority of Internet and other remote sales of \n     cigarettes and smokeless tobacco are being made without \n     adequate precautions to protect against sales to children, \n     without the payment of applicable taxes, and without \n     complying with the nominal registration and reporting \n     requirements in existing Federal law;\n       (6) unfair competition from illegal sales of cigarettes and \n     smokeless tobacco is taking billions of dollars of sales away \n     from law-abiding retailers throughout the United States;\n       (7) with rising State and local tobacco tax rates, the \n     incentives for the illegal sale of cigarettes and smokeless \n     tobacco have increased;\n       (8) the number of active tobacco investigations being \n     conducted by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and \n     Explosives rose to 452 in 2005;\n       (9) the number of Internet vendors in the United States and \n     in foreign countries that sell cigarettes and smokeless \n     tobacco to buyers in the United States has increased from \n     only about 40 in 2000 to more than 500 in 2005; and\n       (10) the intrastate sale of illegal cigarettes and \n     smokeless tobacco over the Internet has a substantial effect \n     on interstate commerce.\n       (c) Purposes.--It is the purpose of this Act to--\n       (1) require Internet and other remote sellers of cigarettes \n     and smokeless tobacco to comply with the same laws that apply \n     to law-abiding tobacco retailers;\n       (2) create strong disincentives to illegal smuggling of \n     tobacco products;\n       (3) provide government enforcement officials with more \n     effective enforcement tools to combat tobacco smuggling;\n       (4) make it more difficult for cigarette and smokeless \n     tobacco traffickers to engage in and profit from their \n     illegal activities;\n       (5) increase collections of Federal, State, and local \n     excise taxes on cigarettes and smokeless tobacco; and\n       (6) prevent and reduce youth access to inexpensive \n     cigarettes and smokeless tobacco through illegal Internet or \n     contraband sales.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to require the payment of compensation to members of \nthe Armed Forces and civilian employees of the United States who \nperformed slave labor for Japanese industries during World War II, or \nthe surviving spouses of such members, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it is my privilege today to introduce \nlegislation that attempts to right wrongs and help those who have \nsuffered.\n  I can think of few Americans who have suffered more than those brave \nWorld War II veterans who were subjected to slave labor conditions by \nJapanese industries during that difficult conflict. This legislation \nwould provide long overdue compensation to our brave veterans who were \nforced into slave labor by our enemies.\n  Some might ask: why don't these veterans seek a remedy from the \ncourts? The answer is that they have. Unfortunately, due to decisions \nthat were made during the Cold War, our government relinquished the \nright of these veterans to successfully seek redress of their \ngrievances on this matter in our nation's courts.\n  Regrettably, the Japanese Government has also declined to provide \ncompensation.\n  Today, many of these American POWs are now in their eighties and \nnineties. Every day, more and more of these veterans pass away without \never realizing that their country truly cares for them and wants to \nright the wrongs of the past. If those who remain are to receive \ncompensation, they must receive it now or this injustice will never be \nrighted.\n  Remember, many of these men are the survivors of the Bataan Death \nMarch, which occurred in April of 1942 when the 70,000 Allied troops \nthat comprised the defense of Bataan peninsula were ordered to \nsurrender. Corregidor would fall a month later, but for the soldiers of \nBataan the infamous Death March from the peninsula to holding camps \nthroughout the Philippines was about to begin. During this march of 85 \nmiles approximately 10,000 Allied forces were killed.\n  American POWs in the Pacific theater are also the survivors of the \n``Hell Ships'' where servicemembers were placed in cargo ships destined \nfor Japanese industrial sites. These ships were usually incredibly \novercrowded and American POWs were subject to the horrific sanitary and \nliving conditions.\n  After all this, when American servicemembers arrived at their \ndestination, the majority were treated as slave labor, they faced \nfierce corporal punishment for minor infractions, and unnecessary \nstarvation and cruel work environments.\n  It is important to note that this bill, which I am honored to say is \ncosponsored by Senator Bingaman and Senator Biden, is not to embarrass \nor to ridicule the people of Japan; far from it. For over 60 years, \nJapan has been one of our great allies. As the ranking member on the \nSenate Intelligence Committee, I well know the invaluable support and \nassistance that Japan has rendered in the global war on terrorism, \nincluding committing hundreds of ground troops to assist in the \ndevelopment of Iraq's infrastructure. I know that all Americans are \ngrateful for this assistance.\n  Mr. President, it is time to do the right thing and provide these \nveterans with the minimal level of compensation they deserve. I believe \nthat this limited compensation is a debt of honor that we should not \nwithhold.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ISAKSON (for himself and Mr. Reed):\n  S. 3812. A bill to require the Food and Drug Administration to \nconduct consumer testing to determine the appropriateness of the \ncurrent labeling requirements for indoor tanning devices and determine \nwhether such requirements provide sufficient information to consumers \nregarding the risks that the use of such devices pose for the \ndevelopment of irreversible damage to the skin, including skin cancer, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my colleague, \nSenator Isakson, to introduce the Tanning Accountability and \nNotification--TAN--Act of 2006. A House counterpart measure was \nintroduced by Representatives Maloney and Brown-Waite in February.\n  Close to a million people will be diagnosed with skin cancer this \nyear. Approximately 1 in 5 Americans will develop skin cancer in their \nlifetime, and these numbers are on the rise.\n  There are many factors that contribute to these startling figures. In \nrecent years efforts have been undertaken by various organizations to \nbetter inform the public about the risk of sun exposure and ways to \ndecrease the chance of developing skin cancer. One area, however, where \nbetter information is sorely needed is on the use of indoor tanning \nsalons.\n  Every day approximately 1 million people visit a tanning salon. It is \na practice particularly popular among teens, the group that seems most \nat risk from the effects of indoor tanning. The American Academy of \nDermatology, the Food and Drug Administration, FDA, the National \nInstitutes of\n\n[[Page S8828]]\n\nHealth, NIH, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, and \nthe World Health Organization, WHO, all discourage the use of indoor \ntanning equipment.\n  This message and the current information about the risks of indoor \ntanning I fear are not being adequately passed on to consumers. The FDA \nhas not updated its warnings on tanning beds since 1979. Regular users \nof indoor tanning beds deserve to be fully informed.\n  The TAN Act calls upon the FDA to revisit the current label on indoor \ntanning beds and determine through a process of public hearings and \nconsumer testing what kind of labeling requirements would convey \nimportant information on the risks of indoor tanning.\n  This legislation is not about introducing new regulations but \nensuring that the current FDA regulations remain effective in \ncommunicating accurate, current, and clear information to consumers of \nindoor tanning salons.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues towards passage of this \nimportant, bipartisan legislation. Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH (for himself, Mr. Bingaman, and Ms. Murkowski):\n  S. 3813. A bill to permit individuals who are employees of a grantee \nthat is receiving funds under section 330 of the Public Health Service \nAct to enroll in health insurance coverage provided under the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits Program; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Community Health \nCenter Employee Health Coverage Act, a bill that will help provide \ncommunity health centers, CHCs, better access to more affordable health \ninsurance for their employees. I am pleased to have my colleagues \nSenators Bingaman and Murkowski join me as original cosponsors on this \nimportant proposal.\n  CHCs form the backbone of the Nation's health care safety net. They \nprovide essential medical services to some of our most vulnerable \ncitizens, including the uninsured and Medicaid and Medicare \nbeneficiaries. In my home State of Oregon, health centers provide over \n130 points of access, where upwards of 180,000 individuals receive care \neach year. Approximately 41 percent of those served are uninsured and \n36 percent are on Medicaid, and most all reside in either a rural or \neconomically depressed area. Clearly, CHCs have an important role in \nensuring that those who otherwise might be unable to afford health \ncoverage have access to the care they need.\n  CHCs also serve their patients in a very efficient manner. Studies \nhave shown that care provided Medicaid patients at CHCs costs 30 \npercent less than care provided in other settings. This is mainly due \nto a lower number of specialty referrals and fewer overall hospital \nadmissions. CHCs effectively demonstrate how focusing on primary and \npreventive care can help keep individuals healthier, which ultimately \nenhances their lives and saves the broader health care system money. \nAbove and beyond the efficiencies CHCs have achieved in service \ndelivery, patients report overwhelming satisfaction for the treatment \nthey are provided. Health care providers across the spectrum would be \nwell-served by emulating CHCs' example of delivering affordable, high-\nquality health care in an efficient manner.\n  Given the enormous value CHCs have to the U.S. health care system, I \nbelieve Congress should do all it can to support their mission. I \ncommend President Bush's commitment to increasing funding for health \ncenter expansion in recent years. I am pleased the administration's \nrequest for $180 million in new funding in fiscal year 2007 was \nincluded in the Senate's version of the budget resolution. As the \nappropriations process continues to move forward, I hope that those \nmuch-needed funds are ultimately approved by Congress.\n  The bill I am filing today will compliment the increased funding CHCs \nhave received in recent years. Just like businesses across the nation, \nhealth centers are coping with the rising cost of providing health \nbenefits to their employees. Premiums for private health insurance grew \nby 9.5 percent in 2005--the fifth consecutive year of increases over 9 \npercent. Because CHCs operate on very limited budgets, it has become \nmore and more difficult for them to absorb these increased costs while \ncontinuing to provide affordable health care to their patients.\n  It is important to note that CHCs rely upon the Federal Government \nfor more than half of their operating revenues. Each year, health \ncenters receive 26 percent of their funding from direct Federal grants \nand another 36 percent from the Medicaid Program. Because CHCs are \npredominantly a Federal enterprise, I believe it makes sense for them \nto be able to reap many of the same benefits of other Federal entities. \nThat is why the bill I am filing today would allow CHCs to purchase \nmore affordable health insurance coverage for their employees through \nthe Federal Employee Health Benefits Program, FEHBP.\n  Allowing federally funded entities to purchase health coverage \nthrough FEHBP is not unprecedented. Employees of Gallaudet University \nand certain U.S. Department of Agriculture grantees already are able to \nparticipate in FEHBP as if they were directly employed by the Federal \nGovernment. Considering that CHC providers are already deemed ``Federal \nemployees'' for the purpose of receiving medical liability protection \nthrough the Federal Government, it is a logical next step to allow them \nto purchase health coverage through FEHBP. In doing so, we will be able \nto provide CHCs much needed security in knowing that their employees \nwill have steady access to affordable health insurance.\n  I believe that in the long run, CHCs will be able to achieve a great \ndeal of savings by purchasing health coverage for their employees \nthrough FEHBP. Premiums for policies purchased through FEHBP \nconsistently grow at a much slower rate than other commercial policies. \nEvery dollar CHCs save in employee benefit costs can be redirected into \nmedical care for the vulnerable populations they serve. Access to FEHBP \ncoverage also may help some CHCs provide health benefits to their \nemployees for the first time. This could help recruit much needed \nmedical personnel in underserved and rural communities. I am hopeful \nhealth centers in rural parts of my State will be able to attract the \nphysicians they so desperately need by offering them FEHBP coverage.\n  There is wide support for CHCs in the Senate, as evidenced by the \nintroduction of two other CHC-related measures this week. Senator \nBingaman and I also are filing the Strengthen the Safety Net Act that \nwill allocate unspent Medicaid disproportionate share hospital funds to \nCHCs and other community-based health care providers. And, I am joining \na bipartisan group of my colleagues in introducing the CHC \nReauthorization Act to ensure that CHCs can continue providing health \ncare to some of our most vulnerable citizens for years to come. I hope \nthe Senate's leadership will move this package of three bills quickly \nthrough the process, as a sign of appreciation for the important role \nCHCs play in the U.S. health care system.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH (for himself and Mrs. Lincoln):\n  S. 3815. A bill to improve the quality of, and access to, long-term \ncare; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Long-Term \nCare Quality and Modernization Act of 2006. I am pleased to be joined \nby my colleague, Senator Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas.\n  As chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, I am committed \nto improving the financing and delivery of long-term care. The Centers \nfor Medicare and Medicaid Services estimate that national spending for \nlong-term care was almost $160 billion in 2002, representing about 12 \npercent of all personal health care expenditures. While those numbers \nare already staggering, we also know that the need for long-term care \nis expected to grow significantly in coming decades. Almost two-thirds \nof people receiving long-term care are over age 65, with this number \nexpected to double by 2030.\n  I know that providing quality long-term care services for America's \nfrail, elderly, and disabled is the priority of\n\n[[Page S8829]]\n\nnursing homes and assisted-living facilities. I applaud their work but \nrecognize we must do more to improve care and contain costs. When you \nconsider that 8 of 10 nursing home residents rely on Medicare and \nMedicaid for their long-term care needs, it is apparent that Congress \nhas a responsibility to improve these programs so they are sustainable \nfor years to come.\n  That is why I am introducing the Long-Term Care Quality and \nModernization Act of 2006 with Senator Lincoln. This bill will address \nseveral problems nursing homes are experiencing with payments, \nregulations, workforce shortages, taxes, and disaster preparedness \nfunding. The issue of long-term care expenditures need not be an \ninsurmountable task. It will require action and cooperation by public \nofficials and private providers as we work to find ways to help \nAmericans become better prepared for their long-term care needs.\n  However, we cannot do it alone. Individuals must take responsibility \nand begin planning for their long-term care needs. With our national \nsavings rate in steady decline, I fear the American middle class is \nwoefully unprepared to meet the coming challenges of their long-term \ncare. As we move forward in our effort to help individuals stay \nfinancially stable in their later years, we must encourage them to \npurchase long-term care insurance and save for long-term care services. \nIncluded in the bill I am introducing today is the Long-Term Care Trust \nAccount Act of 2006. My legislation will create a new type of savings \nvehicle for the purpose of preparing for the costs associated with \nlong-term care services and purchasing long-term care insurance. An \nindividual who establishes a long-term care trust account can \ncontribute up to $5,000 per year to their account and receive a \nrefundable 10 percent tax credit on that contribution. Interest accrued \non these accounts will be tax free, and funds can be withdrawn for the \npurchase of long-term care insurance or to pay for long-term care \nservices. The bill will also allow an individual to make contributions \nto another person's long-term care trust account. This will help many \npeople in our country who want to help their parents or a loved one \nprepare for their health care needs.\n  It is my hope that this legislation will help all Americans save for \ntheir long-term care needs. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to support this important bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS:\n  S. 3816. A bill to prohibit the shipment of tobacco products in the \nmail, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will help crack down on illegal sales of tobacco to underaged \nyoung people by banning the shipment of cigarettes and other tobacco \nproducts through the U.S. mail. Not only does the delivery of \ncigarettes and other tobacco products through the mail create \nopportunities for tax evasion, but it also creates an easy means \nthrough which children and young people can obtain these potentially \ndeadly products.\n  Tobacco remains the No. 1 preventable cause of death in the United \nStates today, accounting for more than 400,000 deaths a year and \nbillions of dollars in health care costs. Moreover, tobacco addiction \nis a ``teen-onset'' disease: Ninety percent of all smokers start before \nthey are 21. If we are to put an end to this tragic, yet preventable, \nepidemic, we must accelerate our efforts not only to help more smokers \nto quit, but also to discourage young people from ever lighting up in \nthe first place.\n  Internet sales of tobacco are growing and growing fast. \nUnfortunately, effective safeguards against illegal sales to young \npeople are virtually nonexistent on the more than 400 Web sites selling \ntobacco, making it easier and cheaper for kids to buy cigarettes.\n  A 2002 American Journal of Public Health study found that 20 percent \nof cigarette-selling Web sites do not say anything about sales to \nminors being prohibited. More than half require only that the buyer say \nthey are of legal age. Another 15 percent require only that the buyer \ntype in their date of birth, and only 7 percent require any driver's \nlicense information.\n  It is no wonder that Internet ``stings'' conducted by attorneys \ngeneral in at least 15 States have found that children as young as 9 \nyears old are able to purchase cigarettes easily. One study in The \nJournal of the American Medical Association reported that kids as young \nas 11 were successful more than 90 percent of the time in purchasing \ncigarettes over the Internet. Moreover, since Internet cigarette \nvendors typically require a two-carton minimum purchase, many high \nschool and middle school buyers of Internet tobacco also end up serving \nas suppliers of cigarettes to other kids.\n  In an effort to combat this problem, all of the major credit card \ncompanies have taken steps to ensure that their systems are not used to \nprocess payments for illegal cigarette sales. Moreover, all of the \nmajor commercial carriers--UPS, DHL and FedEx--have agreed to put a \nstop to the mail order sale and delivery of tobacco products. This \nleaves our U.S. Postal Service as the sole remaining courier for the \ndelivery of tobacco products to minors. I believe that it is time for \nus to close this final delivery gap so that cigarettes and other \ntobacco products are not so easily accessible to our Nation's children.\n  The Postal Code already makes it illegal to mail alcoholic beverages \nand guns. The legislation I am introducing today will amend title 39 of \nthe United States Code to add cigarettes and smokeless tobacco to the \nlist of restricted, nonmailable matter. Any person found guilty of \nmailing such a product would be liable for a civil penalty of up to \n$5,000 or 10 times the estimated retail value of the tobacco products, \nincluding all Federal, State, and local taxes, whichever is highest, \nfor a first violation. Civil penalties of up to $100,000 would be \nimposed for a second or each subsequent violation.\n  Mr. President, the U.S. Postal Service should not be the delivery \nagent for illegal cigarette traffickers. The legislation I am \nintroducing today will close a loophole that has allowed Internet and \nmail order companies to circumvent the law, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this reform.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 3818. A bill to amend title 35, United States Code, to provide for \npatent reform; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce with Senator \nLeahy the Patent Reform Act of 2006.\n  This bill addresses many of the issues and problems that my \ncolleague, Senator Leahy, and I have identified through a series of \nhearings and discussions with stakeholders. We also had the benefit of \nknowing the priorities identified by Chairman Lamar Smith and Ranking \nDemocratic Member Berman, who have introduced an analogous bill in the \nHouse.\n  I would like to thank the Senator Leahy for all of his hard work and \nassistance in developing this bill and for his willingness to reach a \ncompromise on those issues where our policy views conflicted.\n  This bill is not perfect, and is not the bill that either I or my \nesteemed cosponsor would have introduced independently, but I believe \nthat it fairly reflects a compromise between my priorities and the \npriorities of Senator Leahy.\n  We have also attempted to achieve some balance between the priorities \nidentified by the various industries and stakeholders that we consulted \nwhile formulating our policy views in this area.\n  I am sure that further refinements will be made to this bill during \nthe legislative process, so I would encourage those who are either \npleased or displeased by any of the aspects of the bill to continue \nworking with us to resolve any outstanding issues.\n  This bill addresses many of the problems with the substantive, \nprocedural, and administrative aspects of the patent system, which \ngoverns how entities here in the United States apply for, receive, and \neventually make use of patents covering everything from computer chips \nto pharmaceuticals to medical devices to--I am told--at least one \nvariety of crustless peanut butter and jelly sandwich.\n  As the Founding Fathers made clear in Article 1, section 8 of the \nConstitution, Congress is charged with ``promot[ing] the Progress of \nScience\n\n[[Page S8830]]\n\nand useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors \nthe exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.''\n  There is a growing consensus among those who use the patent system \nthat significant reform is needed.\n  While there appears to be a high degree of consensus on some issues \nrelating to patent reform--such as the advisability of creating a new \npost-grant review process, there are significant disagreements about \nother changes to the patent system and about how best to streamline \npatent litigation.\n  By all accounts, patent litigation has become a significant problem \nin some industries. There are a number of factors in patent law that \ndrive up the cost and uncertainty of litigation in ways that are \nunjustified. However, some of the principal problems and costs \nassociated with patent litigation are not uniform across industrial \nsectors. This has led to substantial and sometimes vociferous \ndisagreements about the nature of the underlying problems and, thus, \nwhat the appropriate solutions might be. We have done our best to \nresolve these disagreements based on our judgment about what is likely \nto preserve a balance between patent holders and alleged infringers in \nthese actions.\n  There is also substantial consensus regarding a number of basic, \nstructural changes to the patent system. The most significant of these \ninvolves moving from our current first-to-invent system to something \napproximating a first-to-file rule in determining which of two \nconflicting inventors has the right to obtain a patent.\n  While there is general agreement regarding some of the changes \nnecessary to move toward a first-to-file system, there are some \ndisagreements that remain unresolved by the current language of this \nbill. Although we have done our best to preserve many of the principles \ndefining what constitutes ``prior art'' under current law, patent \nexperts continue to disagree over whether we have achieved this goal.\n  Additionally, shortly before introduction, a concern emerged that we \nhad not adequately preserved the changes enacted by the Cooperative \nResearch and Technology Enhancement Act--CREATE Act, P.L. 108-453--\ninvolving some types of double patenting. Since Senator Leahy and I \nwere original cosponsors of that law, I can assure you that we will be \nreceptive to concerns in this regard and try to fix them.\n  With that preface, I would like to discuss several of the more \nsignificant changes made to the current patent system by this bill.\n  Sections 1 and 2 of the bill contain the short title, table of \ncontents, and other similar provisions. Sections 3 and 4 contain \namendments to implement the first-to-file rule and other changes to the \nmanner in which patent applications are filed with the Patent and \nTrademark Office and the process governing the examination of \napplications. Much of this language is similar to language in previous \nbills. However, as I have mentioned, several significant issues remain \nunresolved, and we will continue to work with stakeholders and other \nmembers to ensure an appropriate resolution.\n  Section 5 changes the remedies available to plaintiffs in patent \ninfringement suits, as well as the available defenses to patent \ninfringement. The two most substantial changes involve limitations on \nthe availability of enhanced damages upon a showing of ``willful'' \ninfringement by a plaintiff and a parallel limitation on the \navailability of unenforceability under the doctrine of ``inequitable \nconduct.'' Willfulness and inequitable conduct were two of the three \nmajor subjective elements that were identified in a major report on the \ncurrent patent system by the National Research Council of the National \nAcademy of Sciences. The report, entitled ``A Patent System for the \n21st Century,'' recommended limiting both willfulness and the \ninequitable conduct defense to streamline patent litigation. We were \nunable to reach agreement on repealing the ``best mode'' requirement, \nwhich was the third subjective element identified both in the report \nand by various stakeholders, but I am hopeful that we will continue to \nwork toward a mutually-acceptable compromise on that issue.\n  Section 5 also contains a provision expanding ``prior user rights.'' \nThese prior user rights are, in reality, a defense to infringement \nliability for those making or preparing to make commercial use of an \ninvention prior to a patent being issued. Prior to a patent's issuance, \nsuch a user often has no way of knowing that he is--or will be--\ninfringing a patent. In some cases, the user has independently invented \nthe subject matter in question, in which case it would be inequitable \nto subject him or her to infringement liability. Currently, the prior \nuser defense is available only with respect to method patents. The bill \nexpands the prior user defense to all categories of patents and makes \nrelated changes to this defense.\n  Additionally, Section 5 contains two of the more controversial \nprovisions in the bill. The first is a rough codification of an \n``apportionment'' rule for calculation of damages. There is an \nexisting, uncodified rule for such apportionment that exists in case \nlaw. However, codifying the rule will increase its clarity and mandate \nits application in all appropriate cases.\n  The second controversial provision in this section is a mandatory fee \nshifting provision. The language of this provision requires courts to \naward attorneys' fees to a prevailing party in cases where the non-\nprevailing party's legal position was not substantially justified. This \nlanguage is similar to the test used in the Equal Access to Justice \nAct. This provision is intended to discourage litigation in those cases \nwhere a plaintiff's or defendant's case is so weak as to be objectively \nunreasonable.\n  Finally, this section also contains a repeal of Section 271(f) of \nTitle 35. Under current law, either a foreign or domestic patent holder \nmay be able to obtain damages based on foreign uses of domestically-\nmanufactured components of an infringing article. In essence, current \nlaw provides for the extraterritorial application of domestic law in a \nmanner that benefits foreign manufacturers and patentees in some \nsituations.\n  Section 6 contains procedures for instituting a new type of post-\ngrant review preceding that will allow the validity of a patent to be \nchallenged in an administrative proceeding conducted by the Patent and \nTrademark Office rather than in court litigation.\n  Under current law, there are narrow reexamination procedures by which \nthe PTO may reconsider a patent's validity at the request of an \ninterested party. However, current reexamination proceedings are very \nlimited and do not allow for a full consideration of a patent's \nvalidity. As a result, even when reexamination is available, potential \nlitigants generally wait to challenge a patent's validity until an \ninfringement suit has been brought despite the higher costs and \nprolonged uncertainty of doing so.\n  I believe that by adopting a more robust post-grant review proceeding \nwe are providing a more efficient means of challenging a patent's \nvalidity in an administrative proceeding. This is necessary to address \nsystemic problems in our patent system, making post-grant review an \nessential component of any meaningful reform legislation. While there \nappears to be substantial agreement regarding the need for a more \nmeaningful post-issuance review, there are strong disagreements over \nits specific attributes and scope.\n  During hearings conducted in the Subcommittee on Intellectual \nProperty and during meetings with stakeholders, we encountered widely \ndisparate proposals and suggestions regarding post-grant review from \nstakeholders, academics, and lawmakers. At one end of the spectrum are \nproposals that would create a low-cost, streamlined proceeding by \nsimply expanding the current inter partes reexamination. At the other \nend of the spectrum are those that would like to see the creation of \nspecialized patent courts that would partially supplant Federal court \nlitigation. With this bill, we have introduced a proposal that falls \nsomewhere in between these two extremes.\n  This bill institutes a robust post-grant opposition system. The new \nprocedures for post-grant cancellation proceedings create a new system \nfor challenging the validity of problematic or suspect patents, which \nwill allow those who are concerned about infringing such a patent to \ntest its validity in an administrative proceeding instead of waiting to \nassert invalidity as a defense in an infringement action. The\n\n[[Page S8831]]\n\nnew procedures are tiered in such a way as to encourage challenges to \noccur within the first year after a patent's issuance. After the one-\nyear ``first window,'' challenges may still be brought by those who are \nable to demonstrate a substantial economic stake in the outcome of the \nproceeding. To deter piecemeal litigation, if a party institutes a \nproceeding after the first year, any challenge to patentability \navailable to that party with respect to the patent must be either \nraised or waived. Thus, a challenger who participates in a proceeding \noutside the first year is estopped from raising any grounds relating to \npatentability that were or could have been raised in the previous \nchallenge.\n  In addition to the new post-grant review proceedings, language in \nsection 9 of this bill makes substantial improvements to the existing \ninter partes reexamination proceeding that are based on recommendations \nfrom the PTO and stakeholders. The most significant change to the \nreexamination proceedings is the modification of the estoppel effect of \nsuch proceedings. Currently, participants in an inter partes \nreexamination are barred from subsequently raising any grounds they \n``raised or could have raised.'' Thus, parties who wish to challenge a \npatent more than a year after its issuance will have the option of \nbringing a narrow challenge that will not subject them to full estoppel \nas an alternative to bringing a full post-grant opposition proceeding \nor reserving their arguments for court. This approach provides a range \nof alternatives to legitimate challengers, while still providing \nbalanced protections against harassing or abusive litigation for the \npatentee.\n  Section 8 would amend the current statutory provision that determines \nthe appropriate venue for patent litigation. The intent of the venue \nlanguage is to serve as a starting point for discussions as to what \nrestrictions--if any--are appropriate on the venue in which patent \ncases may be brought. Section 8 also contains a provision allowing for \ninterlocutory appeals of decisions involving the claim construction of \na patent. Again, this language is intended to generate discussion about \nthe current interplay between the Federal district and appellate \ncourts. As both academics and the patent bar have noted, the resolution \nof the legal questions involving claim construction appear to be taking \nup a greater and greater portion of the docket of the Federal circuit \ncourt of appeals.\n  Given the high percentage of reversals on claims construction issues, \nsome experts believe that an interlocutory appeal of Markman decisions \nmight allow parties to resolve disputes as to claim construction more \ndecisively prior to proceeding to a full trial. Alternatively, other \nexperts believe that a return to the treatment of claims construction \nas a mixed question of law and fact might induce more deferential \nreview by the appellate court. Still others have suggested that \nincreased expertise among the district court judges trying patent cases \nmight result in a lower reversal rate. In that regard, I should note \nthat Congressman Issa has a bill authorizing a pilot project that \nappears to be a promising approach to increasing the expertise of \nFederal judges who handle patent cases, and I am considering \nintroducing a similar bill here in the Senate. While I am not wedded to \nany particular approach or combination of approaches, I believe this is \nan issue that should receive serious attention and consideration by \nCongress.\n  Section 9 of the bill includes additional statutory changes that \neither implement or complement provisions found elsewhere in the bill. \nIt also includes expanded authority for the PTO to conduct substantive \nrulemaking, as well as the changes to the inter partes reexamination \nprocedures that I mentioned previously.\n  Section 10 includes a generic effective date provision. Obviously, I \nwill need to modify the effective dates of the various provisions in \nthe bill once we have been able to assess the difficulty of \nimplementing various provisions in this bill.\n  In closing, I would like to thank my cosponsor, the senior Senator \nfrom Vermont, for all the work he has put into this bill and to \ncompliment his intellectual property counsel, Susan Davies, for her \nefforts as well. I am committed to moving this legislation forward and \nhope that my colleagues will join me in my efforts to refine and enact \nthis important bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate is about to adjourn for its \nAugust recess--4 weeks when we get to reconnect with our constituents, \ncatch up on the concerns of our home States, and study our legislative \nplans with a depth and attention that we cannot devote during the \nhectic days we are in session. Some of us may even spend a little time \nwith our families and friends. As I have done in years past, I will be \nin Vermont. The choice between spending August in Washington, DC, or \nMiddlesex, VT, has always been an easy one for me.\n  When the Senate is in session, our obligations are many and varied, \nas important as they are diverse. We hold hearings, and then we pursue \nfollowup questions. We try to engage in oversight, though that has not \nbeen a particularly fruitful exercise with this current administration. \nWe investigate issues, and then we endeavor to craft solutions. We vote \nand we caucus and we deliberate.\n  It is not always a process that yields results, but today I can \nreport it has. I am pleased to join with the chairman of the \nIntellectual Property Subcommittee today in introducing a bipartisan \nbill on patent reform. The bill is the result of almost 2 years of hard \nwork on hard issues. We held several hearings, had innumerable meetings \nwith a universe of interested participants in the patent system, and \nreceived input from a number of voices in debate about patent reform. \nWe delved deeply into the myriad problems plaguing our patent system, \nespecially those that hinder the issuance of high-quality patents.\n  In introducing this bill together, we take a productive step toward \nupdating the most outdated aspects of the patent code and attempt to \nbolster the Patent and Trademark Office in its administrative review of \npatents throughout the process. We are striving to place incentives on \nthe parties with the most information to assist the PTO by sharing that \ninformation. We place our patent system in line with much of the rest \nof the world, by moving from a ``first-to-invent'' system to a ``first-\nto-file.''\n  Congress needs to address the urgent needs for revision and renewal \nin our patent system, and we must harness the impressive intellectual \npower and varied experiences of all the players in the patent community \nas we finalize our new laws. I believe that, while introducing this \nbill today is not the end of the process--and indeed, in many respects, \nit is truly the beginning--it is a significant accomplishment that we \nhave come together to set down a comprehensive approach to overhauling \nour patent system. If the United States is to preserve its position at \nthe forefront of innovation, as the global leader in intellectual \nproperty and technology, then we need to move forward, and this bill is \nour first step. We must improve and enhance the quality of our patent \nsystem and the patents it produces.\n  This legislation is not an option but a necessity. Senator Hatch and \nI have made genuine progress on this complex issue. We agreed on many \nsalutary changes, but it can be no surprise that we differed on some \naspects of the effort as well. Recognizing the critical importance of \ncompromise, of offering a bill to the interested public to study and \nimprove, and of taking a clear first step down the path to genuine \nreform, we both made concessions. This is not the bill I would have \nintroduced if I were the sole author, and I expect Senator Hatch would \nsay the same. I appreciate the concessions that Senator Hatch made. I \nhave tried to be both reasonable and accommodating in honoring my \ncommitment to him--a commitment that he requested specifically--to \nintroduce a bill before the August recess.\n  In particular, I am concerned about how some of the changes proposed \nwould affect the generic pharmaceutical industry, especially the \nprovision that would limit the ``inequitable conduct'' defense to only \nthose cases in which a patentee's willful deception of the PTO results \nin an invalid patent claim. While I think we should expect the highest \ncaliber of behavior by those who are seeking patents--which are, after \nall, often highly profitable government monopolies--surely we can at\n\n[[Page S8832]]\n\nleast insist on an absence of affirmative deceit. I hope and expect \nthat we can continue the discussion on this issue as the year \nprogresses.\n  I also want to ensure the delicate balance we have struck in the \npost-grant review process and make certain that the procedure is both \nefficient and effective at thwarting some strategic behavior in patent \nlitigation and at promoting a healthier body of existing patents. Fee-\nshifting, even in a limited set of cases, likewise raises concerns that \nshould have a more public airing.\n  I respect the necessity for considering and balancing a number of \ndifferent concerns as we draft comprehensive and complicated \nlegislation. I will never sacrifice the quality of the laws we produce \nto expediency, but I recognize the utility of such compromises when, as \nwith this bill, introduction is a first step in a larger and longer \ndiscussion.\n  I am extremely pleased that Senator Hatch and I have come together to \ntackle these important and urgent issues. Many hours of hard work were \nspent by both of our offices to develop legislative language so that we \ncan, today, jointly introduce a bill to move the debate forward. The \nbill is a remarkable achievement and a substantial step toward real \nreform. I look forward to continuing to work with Senator Hatch, other \nmembers of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the affected parties on \nthese matters.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Smith, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Pryor, \n        and Mr. Akaka):\n  S. 3819. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for redistribution and extended availability of unexpended \nmedicaid DSH allotments, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwith Senators Smith, Lincoln, Pryor, and Akaka entitled the \n``Strengthening the Safety Net Act of 2006.'' This legislation is \nimportant to the continued survival of many of our Nation's safety net \nhospitals that provide critical health care access to our Nation's 46 \nmillion uninsured citizens through the Medicaid disproportionate share \nhospital, or DSH, program.\n  In recognition of the burden certain hospitals bear in providing a \nlarge share of health services to the low-income patients, including \nMedicaid and the uninsured, the Congress established the Medicaid DSH \nprogram in the mid-1980s to give additional funding to support such \n``disproportionate share'' hospitals. By providing financial relief to \nthese hospitals, the Medicaid DSH program maintains hospital access for \nthe poor. As the National Governors Association has said, ``Medicaid \nDSH's funds are an important part of statewide systems of health care \naccess for the uninsured.''\n  Mr. President, I request unanimous consent for the text of the bill \nand the text of the fact sheet on the legislation be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3819\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

These networks would be required to provide \n     high quality primary, outpatient, inpatient and specialty \n     care to uninsured and other medically vulnerable populations.\n       In 2007, the bill would redistribute $300 million in \n     unexpended funds; in 2008, $500 million; and in 2009 and \n     thereafter $800 million. These levels would be prorated \n     downward if there are insufficient unexpended funds to meet \n     the statutory amounts. This legislation will:\n       Keep funds allocated to the safety net with the safety net; \n     Provide money to test implementation of high quality \n     integrated networks of safety net providers; and, Allow \n     networks of community health centers to purchase specialty \n     care services.\n\n\n                               Background\n\n       Congress created the Medicaid DSH requirement in 1981 to \n     ensure that state Medicaid programs provide adequate payments \n     to hospitals whose patient populations are disproportionately \n     composed of low income Medicaid and uninsured patients. \n     Medicaid DSH payments have evolved into one of the most \n     important sources of financing for the nation's safety net. \n     Each year, each individual state is allocated a DSH \n     allotment. The allotments vary considerably from state to \n     state and a state's ability to draw-down its DSH allotment \n     varies depending on its financial resources. Each year, some \n     states do not utilize their entire DSH allotment.\n       In part, this legislation would permit a redistribution of \n     unused DSH funds to states that have lower DSH allotments. \n     Two categories of states would be prioritized to receive \n     redistributed DSH money to supplement their existing DSH \n     allotment: (1) low DSH states (i.e. states that are \n     designated by the MMA as a low DSH state due to DSH \n     expenditures being less than 3 percent of total Medicaid \n     expenditures in fiscal year 2000) and (2) states whose DSH \n     allotment per Medicaid enrollee and uninsured individual is \n     below the national average. Only states that have spent at \n     least 90 percent of their DSH allotment would be eligible for \n     the redistribution.\n       Redistributed DSH dollars also would fund ``Health Access \n     Network'' demonstration projects designed to improve access, \n     quality, and continuity of care for uninsured individuals \n     through better coordination of care. To obtain funding under \n     this legislation, health access networks would be required to \n     submit a plan to the Secretary of the Department of Health \n     and Human Services that details how the network plans to:\n       Reduce costs associated with the provision of health care \n     services to uninsured individuals; Improve access to, and the \n     availability of, health care services provided to individuals \n     served by the health access network; Enhance the quality and \n     coordination of health care services provided to such \n     individuals; Improve the health status of communities served \n     by the health access network; and, Reduce health disparities \n     in such communities.\n       Health access networks would be required to identify \n     measurable performance targets and demonstrate progress in \n     order to qualify for future year funding. Grantees would have \n     to spend 90 percent of awarded funds for direct patient care \n     services.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN:\n  s. 3820. A bill to expand broadband access for rural Americans; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill entitled \nBroadband for Rural America Act of 2006.\n  There is no question that broadband is an essential component of our \nlives, both at work and at home. Broadband access is becoming a vital \nservice, much like water, sewer, gas, and electricity are essential \nresources for our daily living. Our homes and businesses need \naffordable and easy access to an always-on, high speed and high \ncapacity Internet connection, much like our homes and businesses need \nthe traditional utility services.\n  Additionally, people who work outside the confines of an office \nbuilding need broadband access on the go. Often, it is not enough to \nhave only a cell phone to remain in touch with your boss, coworker, \nclient, or supplier. In today's global economy, we need easy methods to \ntransfer a vast quantity of data, fast and reliably, even if we are not \nnear a landline phone, fax, or computer terminal.\n  Yet for so many Americans today, broadband access is still a foreign \nconcept. The digital divide remains a reality. Rural broadband \ndeployment\n\n[[Page S8834]]\n\ncontinues to lag behind urban deployment, and the differential \ncontinues to grow, even as broadband usage has grown significantly in \nour Nation.\n  When I travel to small or rural towns in downstate Illinois and \nelsewhere, I meet people who tell me that they cannot wait to have \nbroadband, but that there is no service available where they live. I am \ncertain that all of my colleagues in the Senate can identify with \nsituations like this, where they have met constituents who are eager to \njump onto the Information Superhighway, yet there is no on-ramp.\n  According to a 2004 report issued by the U.S. Department of Commerce, \nonly about 25 percent of rural households that use the Internet have \nbroadband access, compared to over 40 percent of the same households in \nurban areas. Similarly, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's 2005 \nreport found that farm households have home access to broadband at \nalmost half the level of all U.S. households nationwide.\n  The Pew Internet and American Life Project found similar results. In \nits 2006 report, Pew found that only 18 percent of rural adults \nreported a home broadband connection in the year 2005, compared to 31 \npercent of urban adults.\n  All these different studies issued by various authorities point to a \nconsistent conclusion: Americans living in urban areas are almost twice \nas likely to have home broadband access as do their rural counterparts.\n  Contrary to popular belief, however, rural households use computers \nand information technology in ways that are very similar to their urban \ncounterparts. Thus, it appears that the main obstacle to improving \nrural broadband adoption is not differences in the users themselves, \nbut in the availability and price of broadband service.\n  It is clear that citizens in small towns and rural areas simply do \nnot have the same options that people in cities and urban areas do. \nAnd, in some of the rural areas where broadband is available, these \ncustomers often pay more for inferior quality than customers in the \nmore populated areas.\n  As our rural residents are falling behind city dwellers, so too, is \nour Nation falling behind the rest of the developed world.\n  The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development found that, \nin 2004, America ranked 12th among developed nations in broadband \naccess per 100 inhabitants. However, the same study had found that in \n2001, we ranked 4th in the developed world. So, this means that in just \n3 short years, we lost our competitive edge to 8 countries.\n  Broadband is critical to community and economic development, as it \nencourages investment, creates jobs, improves productivity, fosters \ninnovation, and increases consumer benefits in every corner of our \nNation.\n  A 2003 study by Criterion Economics found that adoption of current \ngeneration broadband would increase the gross domestic product by \n$179.7 billion, while sustaining an additional 61,000 jobs per year \nover the next 19 years. The study also projected 1.2 million jobs could \nbe created if next generation broadband technology were rapidly \ndeployed.\n  In early 2004, President Bush called for universal and affordable \naccess to broadband by the year 2007, because it will enhance our \nNation's economic competitiveness and help improve education and health \ncare for all Americans. Kevin Martin, the chairman of the Federal \nCommunications Commission, has said he is committed to expanding the \nnumber of broadband users in our country so that we can improve our \nrank in the world.\n  I agree with both President Bush and Chairman Martin. The \nadministration, the FCC, Congress, and the States can all contribute to \nclosing the digital divide, ensuring that rural Americans are not left \nbehind in the 21st century's digital economy.\n  We need to work together to address this critical shortfall in our \nNation's infrastructure. We need a seamless national network of \nbroadband providers that will serve everyone in America.\n  Whether it is through telephone wire, cable, fiber, satellite, \nwireless, powerline, or any other medium, we need every existing and \nfuture broadband service provider to step up to the national challenge.\n  That is why I am introducing a bill that will encourage rapid \ndeployment of high quality and affordable high speed broadband service, \nespecially in the rural areas that desperately need this technology.\n  The Broadband for Rural America Act of 2006 includes five major \nprovisions. Each provision is designed to eliminate obstacles that \nhinder broadband deployment in rural America today.\n  First, my bill creates a new Federal program specifically targeted to \nassist people who are doing the necessary work at the earliest stages \nto bring broadband to their communities.\n  These are future customers who are weary of waiting for \ntelecommunications and cable companies to eventually reach their \ncorners of the State. These are individuals, businesses, and co-ops who \nwant to create a demand pool to entice new or existing carriers to \nquickly expand broadband service to areas where they work and live.\n  We have several groups like this in my home State of Illinois. They \ncannot wait any longer, so they have taken the initiative to work for \naccess to affordable high quality broadband service.\n  Many of these groups and individuals work in collaboration with like-\nminded community leaders, businesspeople, engineers, and other experts \nto learn all they can about their region. They are the local experts on \nthe unique geographic, economic, and lifestyle needs of their market. \nThey can conduct the mapping and surveying work, to find out where \nthere are services and gaps in their neighborhoods, and what technology \nis best suited to serve their region.\n  And, if they discover that no existing provider wants to expand \nservice to where they are, based on the company's internal cost-benefit \nanalysis, these groups are willing to start a communications service of \ntheir own, using technology they can afford, to provide broadband for \nand by themselves. These good people do not want to be left out of the \nnew economy. They need our help.\n  Yet, currently, there is no readily accessible source of funding from \nthe Federal Government for these groups that are undertaking the \ncritical early stage groundwork. If they were already communications \nservice providers, they could look for funding through other programs, \nincluding the USDA's Rural Utilities Service Program, the universal \nservice fund, or the Small Business Administration. They could also go \nto the financial markets to seek venture capital and operating funds \nfrom established private sector investors.\n  But as startup groups trying hard to serve their local or rural \ncommunity's needs, they have few places to turn to for financial \nassistance.\n  My bill creates a new Office of Broadband Access within the FCC that \nwould administer a trust fund from which Federal grants can be issued \nto these startup groups. Under my bill, eligible entities include \nnonprofits, academic institutions, local governments, and commercial \ncompanies that will work to identify broadband access needs in unserved \nareas of the country.\n  The types of projects to be funded through this new program will \ninclude feasibility studies, mapping, economic analysis, and other \nactivities undertaken to determine the reasons for the current lack of \nservice and the scale, scope, and type of broadband services most \nsuitable for the particular unserved area.\n  To further assist with these startup projects, my bill requires the \nFCC to collect more useful information from current broadband service \nproviders to ascertain where and how broadband service is available, \nand to report to Congress on the areas that are unserved.\n  This reporting requirement is a bipartisan idea that Senator Bill \nNelson and Senator Jim DeMint recently presented before the Senate \nCommerce Committee. I am happy to work with them to further encourage \nthe FCC to collect more useful data on the state of broadband \ndeployment.\n  Finally, the revenues to fund this trust fund will be derived from \ndirect appropriations of $10 million per year for 5 years, plus 1 \npercent of proceeds from all auction sales of spectrum conducted by the \nFCC, which are to be set aside for this unique purpose. I believe this \nshould generate enough revenues to sustain this trust fund for the next\n\n[[Page S8835]]\n\n5 years, which is the critical time for Federal assistance.\n  When Congress created the Rural Utilities Service Broadband Loan and \nLoan Guarantee Program in the 2002 farm bill, we charged the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture with providing much needed funds to bring \nbroadband to rural America. The bill authorized $100 million for fiscal \nyears 2002 to 2007 to provide below market-rate loans and loan \nguarantees for the construction and improvement of facilities and \nequipment to provide broadband service.\n  While this loan program has had some successes over the past 4 years, \nit has also faced serious internal and external criticism.\n  For example, in September 2005, USDA's inspector general issued an \ninternal audit report pointing out major problems with the program. \nAmong other concerns, the report alleges that, in decisions that were \ninconsistent with provisions of authorizing statute, USDA has funded \nentities in suburban--not rural--areas, and in places that are already \nreceiving broadband service.\n  The internal report also accuses the agency of mismanaging the \nprogram, leading to irregularities and even fraud in the decisionmaking \nand approval processes for applications.\n  To add more controversy to this program, in May of this year, USDA \nwas sued by the cable industry for allegedly failing to follow the \nstatutory mandates that created the broadband loan program.\n  Striking a tone similar to the inspector general's internal audit \nreport, the lawsuit alleges among other issues that USDA has diverted \nFederal funds to suburban areas and has failed to ensure that unserved \ncommunities receive first priority.\n  I support the USDA's rural broadband loan program, and I want to see \nthe program grow and continue to fund worthy projects. But I also \nbelieve that these recent internal and external developments merit \nserious consideration. So, in the spirit of working with the USDA to \nreform the problematic areas, my bill reforms and extends the life of \nthe loan program for another 5 years, to expire in 2012, not 2007.\n  The bill goes to the heart of the concerns raised by the critics of \nthe program. It amends the definition of an eligible rural community to \nexclude any area located within 10 miles of any city with a population \nof over 25,000. This should prevent the program from funding urban or \nsuburban areas that may be technically considered rural under some \ndefinitions, but are in reality, located adjacent to areas that already \nreceive broadband service.\n  Additionally, my bill prevents any rural area from being funded where \na majority of its residential customers already have access to \nbroadband service offered at a price per megabit of speed comparable to \nthe nearest urban area. Under this definition, any area where rural \nresidents are already enjoying affordable high speed broadband service \nshould not be allowed to receive additional Federal funds.\n  These funds should be saved for the truly needy communities.\n  My bill also provides language to authorize in statute a rural \nbroadband grant program to be administered by the USDA, together with \nits rural broadband loan and loan guarantee program.\n  While the USDA has created its own grant programs to fund certain \nbroadband providers, a formal grant program was never authorized by \nCongress. By authorizing it, Congress will have more oversight and \nimpose accountability, while keeping the grant program funded at an \noperational level for many years to come.\n  Finally, although USDA's inspector general has recommended several \nreform measures, I believe we should force the agency to implement \nthese changes in order to improve the loan and grant programs. \nTherefore, my bill requires the USDA to undertake a comprehensive and \ntransparent rulemaking process in response to the recent internal \naudit.\n  The FCC has been looking to make more spectrum available for \ninnovative unlicensed wireless uses, including wireless broadband. This \nnew ``unlicensed'' spectrum holds tremendous potential for allowing \nwireless broadband to be deployed in rural areas. This would be \nespecially helpful in large rural geographic regions where it would be \ncost prohibitive to build out a broadband infrastructure with wires, \ncable, or fiber.\n  Some of this spectrum would come from space made newly available when \ntraditional analog over-the-air TV broadcasters transition to digital \ntransmission by 2009. Other spectrum may be found in narrow gaps \nbetween currently existing licensed users that could be utilized by \nsmaller and localized products, such as garage openers, cordless \nphones, wireless baby monitors, and of course, broadband.\n  While I support making more spectrum available to new users, I \nbelieve we need to do so with clear safeguards in place so that new \nwireless users will not cause undue interference problems with existing \nbroadcasters, public safety officials, and others that use wireless \nproducts such as microphones.\n  My bill requires the FCC to complete a rulemaking process to make new \nspectrum available for wireless broadband services in rural areas as \nsoon as practicable. The bill specifically requires the FCC to ensure \nthat new unlicensed wireless users provide engineering testing results \nto prevent harmful interference problems.\n  The FCC also has been planning an auction sale of spectrum in the 700 \nMHz band, which is ideal for wireless broadband use. I support this \nauction, and I encourage the FCC to conduct it as soon as possible, so \nthat new service providers can enter the wireless broadband market to \nfill in the gaps in service that wireline providers cannot or will not \nmeet.\n  However, we have learned from previous FCC auctions that the true \nvalue of spectrum depends on who uses it and for what purposes. We also \nhave learned that different carriers will bid in different auctions, \ndepending on the size of the blocks of airwaves available for purchase. \nLarge national wireless carriers will choose to bid on large geographic \nmarkets, while smaller or local carriers will bid on smaller market \nsizes.\n  For the 700 MHz band, I agree with a bipartisan idea that Senator \nOlympia Snowe and Senator Byron Dorgan proposed in the Senate Commerce \nCommittee. In our view, it makes the most sense to configure the plan \nfor this band to designate up to 12 MHz of paired recovered analog \nspectrum to be auctioned for smaller geographic licenses.\n  This will maximize the participation of small, regional, and rural \nservice providers, because these are the most likely entities to \nprovide wireless broadband service in rural areas.\n  My bill therefore requires the FCC to evaluate its auction plans and \nto divide some of the frequency allocations into smaller area licenses \nso that regional and rural wireless companies can compete in the \nbidding process.\n  I look forward to working with Senators Snowe and Dorgan to ensure \nthat the FCC maximizes the value of these public airwaves for the \nbenefit of all Americans, especially those living in rural areas.\n  As with many States, my State of Illinois has struggled over the past \nfew years with ways to bring universal and affordable broadband to \nevery corner of our State. Many leaders in our State and local \ngovernments have studied various proposals, and have sought the \nguidance of experts in the private sector.\n  Additionally, telecommunications and cable companies that provide the \nvast majority of broadband service in the nation today are generally \nregulated at the state and local levels. Therefore, in our effort to \ndevelop a national broadband policy, I think it makes sense for \nCongress to learn from the varied experiences gained in many states \nthat have tried innovative solutions to encourage or mandate broadband \nservices in their regions.\n  My bill establishes a task force consisting of experts in Federal, \nState, and local governments, trade associations, public interest \norganizations, academic institutions, and other relevant areas, to \nstudy best practices for rapid deployment of broadband services in \nStates, particularly those with large unserved rural areas.\n  The bill requires the task force, within 6 months, to provide to \nCongress and to each governor a report detailing a comprehensive list \nof specific measures adopted by State or local governments that have \nhelped provide incentives for\n\n[[Page S8836]]\n\ncommunications carriers to deploy broadband services in areas that \nlacked such services.\n  For too long, we have been talking about the need to bring universal \nand affordable broadband to every corner of our Nation. Yet progress \nhas been too slow. It is time to reengage our national, state, and \nlocal policy leaders to focus our attention, and work with the private \nsector toward achieving this goal.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting Broadband for Rural \nAmerica Act of 2006.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3820\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Broadband for Rural America \n     Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) High speed broadband communications is no longer a \n     luxury. It has become a vital service for all Americans, much \n     like water, sewer, gas, and electricity are essential \n     resources for our daily lives.\n       (2) Broadband infrastructure is critical to community and \n     economic development, by encouraging investment, creating \n     jobs, improving productivity, fostering innovation, and \n     increasing consumer benefits.\n       (3) Despite the ongoing efforts by traditional \n     communications carriers to expand broadband services, the \n     rate of deployment in America is still far from ideal. Recent \n     reports indicate that America continues to trail other \n     leading industrialized countries, per capita, in the \n     availability and use of broadband communications.\n       (4) As our Nation falls behind the developed world in \n     broadband access, so, too, are rural residents falling behind \n     city and urban residents. In small towns and rural America, \n     broadband service remains largely non existent. In places \n     where it is available, rural broadband customers often pay \n     more for inferior quality than customers in cities and urban \n     areas.\n       (5) A national policy is needed to accelerate the \n     deployment of broadband services so that, no matter where \n     they live, every American can have access to affordable and \n     high-quality broadband service as soon as possible.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are to encourage the rapid \n     deployment of high quality and affordable high speed \n     broadband service to every corner of our Nation by--\n       (1) establishing a new source of funding for entities that \n     work to identify unserved regions of the Nation and to \n     address the lack of broadband service in those areas;\n       (2) reforming the rural broadband loan program to ensure \n     that Federal funds are provided only to qualified entities \n     that will serve truly rural and unserved regions of the \n     Nation, while providing statutory authority and Federal \n     funding for the rural broadband grant program;\n       (3) making more unlicensed spectrum available for \n     innovative wireless broadband uses that will not cause \n     harmful interference and degradation of service to other \n     wireless services;\n       (4) encouraging rural, regional, and smaller wireless \n     carriers to enter the wireless broadband market by \n     reconfiguring the size of spectrum auctions into smaller \n     market sizes; and\n       (5) studying policies and programs adopted by State and \n     local governments that have worked to provide incentives for \n     rapid broadband deployment.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to authorize certain athletes to be admitted \ntemporarily into the United States to compete or perform in an athletic \nleague, competition, or performance; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Creating \nOpportunities for Minor League Professionals, Entertainers and Teams \nthrough legal Entry--COMPETE--Act. This bill will level the playing \nfield for minor league sports teams that depend on getting the best \nathletic talent. I thank Senators Feinstein, Cornyn, Lieberman, \nMikulski, and Leahy for joining me in introducing this measure.\n  The core problem we address is that under current law, minor league \nplayers who have to use the H-2B visa category face severe visa \nshortages, while major league players qualify automatically for \nplentiful P-1 visas.\n  The H-2B visas are intended for use by industries facing seasonal \ndemands for labor, such as the hospitality and logging industries. \nHowever, this type of visa is also used by many talented, highly \ncompetitive foreign athletes who are recruited by U.S. teams.\n  A chronic H-2B visa shortage over the last few years has posed \nchallenges for all industries using the H-2B visa category. In recent \nfiscal years, including 2006, the 66,000 visa cap was met early in the \nyear. While we were successful last year in crafting a temporary, 2-\nyear fix for the H-2B shortage, this fix will expire at the end of the \ncurrent fiscal year.\n  However, solving this problem goes beyond fixing the H-2B visa cap. \nMinor league players simply do not belong in the same visa category as \nseasonal workers. There is no rational basis for automatically \nqualifying major league players for P-1 visas, which are granted to \ntalented athletes, artists, and entertainers, while denying them to \nminor league players. My amendment would remedy this unfair situation.\n  The problem of requiring minor league athletes to use the H-2B visa \ncategory has posed a particular challenge to those of us in Maine who \nenjoy cheering on our sports teams. The MAINEiacs, a Canadian junior \nhockey league team that plays its games in Lewiston, ME, has faced \ntremendous difficulties obtaining the H-2B visas necessary for the \nmajority of its players to come to the United States to play in the \nteam's first home games.\n  Last year, due to uncertainty surrounding the availability of H-2B \nvisas at the end of the fiscal year, the team had to reschedule its \nseason home opener and cancel several early season games. This forced \nthe team to schedule make-up games for those normally played in \nSeptember. The problems created by the visa situation creates an \nunnecessary hardship for this team, in addition to threatening the \nrevenue the team generates for the city of Lewiston and businesses in \nthe surrounding area.\n  The Portland Sea Dogs, a Double-A baseball team affiliated with the \nBoston Red Sox, is another of the many teams that relies on H-2B visas \nto bring some of its most skilled players to the United States. \nThousands of fans come each year to see this team, and others like it \nacross the country, play one of America's favorite sports. Due to the \nshortage of H-2B visas, however, Major League Baseball reports that, in \n2004 and early 2005, more than 350 talented young, foreign baseball \nplayers were prevented from coming to the United States to play for \nminor league teams. These teams have been a traditional proving ground \nfor athletes hoping to make it to the major leagues and players often \nmove from these teams to major league rosters.\n  Including these highly skilled athletes in the H-2B visa category \nseems particularly unusual when you consider that major league athletes \nare permitted to use an entirely different nonimmigrant visa category--\nthe P-1 visa. This visa is available to athletes who are deemed by the \nCitizenship and Immigration Services to perform at an ``internationally \nrecognized level of performance.'' Arguably, any foreign athlete whose \nachievements have earned him a contract with an American team would \nmeet this definition.\n  CIS, however, has interpreted this category to exclude minor and \namateur league athletes. Instead, the P-1 visa is typically reserved \nfor only those athletes who have already been promoted to major league \nsports. Unfortunately, this creates something of a catch-22 for minor \nleague athletes--if an H-2B visa shortage means that promising athletes \nare unable to hone their skills and prove themselves in the minor \nleagues, they are far less likely to earn the major league contract \nrequired for a P-1 visa.\n  A simple, commonsense solution would be to expand the P-1 visa \ncategory to include minor league and certain amateur-level athletes who \nhave demonstrated a significant likelihood of graduating to the major \nleagues. Major League Baseball strongly supports the expansion of the \nP-1 visa category to include professional minor league baseball \nplayers. In correspondence to me, the league has pointed out that \nmaking P-1 visas available to this group of athletes, teams would be \nable to make player development decisions based on the talent of its \nplayers, without being constrained by visa quotas. The P-1 category, \nthe league believes, is appropriate for minor league players because \nthese are the players that major league clubs have selected as some of \nthe best baseball prospects in the world.\n  There is no question that Americans are passionate about sports. We \nhave high expectations for our teams and demand only the best from our \nathletes. By expanding the P-1 visa category, we will make it possible \nfor athletes to be selected based on fair competition in talent and \nskill, rather the artificial limits of visa availability. In addition, \nwe would reduce some pressure on the H-2B visa category making more of \nthose visas available to the industries that need them.\n  Mr. President, the inequity of our current policy is clear. Let us \ntake this simple step toward a more rational visa policy.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am introducing today the COMPETE Act \nof 2006, along with Senators Collins and Cornyn.\n  This is a bill which amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to \nallow certain minor league athletes and ice skaters to be admitted \ntemporarily into the United States to compete or perform in an athletic \nleague, competition or performance under the same non-immigrant visa \ncategory as professional athletes.\n  The purpose of this legislation is to level the playing field for \nminor league sports teams that depend on getting the best athletic \ntalent, regardless of where in the world that talent is discovered.\n  Under current law, minor league players and ice skaters who use the \nH-2B temporary visa category face severe visa shortages, while major \nleague players qualify for uncapped P-1 temporary visas.\n  This unfair discrepancy in the law needs to be remedied, and the bill \nwe are introducing today provides a commonsense solution because it \nallows minor league athletes--whether in baseball, basketball, hockey, \nor ice skating--who will perform competitively in the United States to \napply for a P-1 temporary visa as opposed to an H-2B visa.\n  By way of background, The H-2B temporary visa category allows U.S. \nemployers in industries with seasonal or intermittent needs to augment \ntheir existing labor force with temporary workers or augment their \nlabor force when necessary due to a one-time occurrence which \nnecessitates a temporary increase in workers.\n  Typically, H-2B workers fill labor needs in occupational areas such \nas construction, health care, landscaping, lumber, manufacturing, food \nservice and processing, and resort and hospitality services.\n  Additionally, and perhaps what people do not know, is that not only \nis the\n\n[[Page S8840]]\n\nH-2B visa category used by loggers, lifeguards, crab pickers, amusement \npark employees, hotel and restaurant employees, but it is also used by \nmany talented, highly competitive foreign athletes who are recruited by \nU.S. teams and theatrical ice skating productions.\n  A chronic H-28 visa shortage over the last 3 years has posed \nchallenges for all industries using the H-2B visa category. In fiscal \nyears 2004, 2005, and 2006, the 66,000 visa cap has been reached, \nleaving American teams and the athletes they are recruiting out in the \ncold.\n  The COMPETE Act is a solution that not only helps professional \nAmerican teams, but it also relieves the stress on the H-2B visa \nprogram added by a misclassified group.\n  The reality is that minor league athletes do not belong in the same \nvisa category as seasonal workers. There is no reason major league \nathletes can't and shouldn't qualify for P-1 visas, which are granted \nto talented athletes, artists, and entertainers. The COMPETE Act would \nremedy this unfair situation.\n  What follows are some examples of how classifying minor leaguers and \nice skaters as H-2B workers harms American sports and how it would be \nbetter that they be reclassified as other athletes for temporary P-1 \nvisas.\n  Disney on Ice has seven domestic tours per year, bringing \napproximately $400,000 to each of the 150 to 170 U.S. cities in which \nit stops. There are not enough U.S. skaters to fill the roles each \nproduction requires, thus the organization relies on foreign skaters to \nsupplement its cast. As the cap on H-28 visas has been consistently \nreached before the commencement of their training period--(August in \nFlorida--and subsequent touring seasons--September through February or \nMarch--they are often short of ice skaters for their productions.\n  Major League Baseball was unable to bring 350 baseball players to the \nUnited States in the 2004 and 2005 seasons as a result of the H-28 visa \ncap having been met. Promotions of promising young players to the U.S. \nMinor League affiliates could not be made. Due to the unavailability of \nvisas, signings of Canadian players drafted in baseball's June first-\nyear player draft have declined by 80 percent. Furthermore, clubs who \nhave already signed talented non-U.S. citizens have been prevented from \nbringing these players to the United States given that the H-2B cap has \nbeen reached in past years.\n\n  National Hockey League recruits from independent minor league teams, \nsuch as the American Hockey League, Central Hockey League, and the East \nCoast Hockey League, for foreign players to fill its ranks. Most minor \nhockey league teams' rosters are filled with a majority of foreign \nnational professional athletes. This is evident by the number of slots \nthat are requested each year by the minor leagues on their temporary \nlabor certification applications filed with the Labor Department. For \ninstance, the AHL requests approximately 21 player slots out of a \nroster of approximately 26 players; the other leagues are similarly \nsituated where the number of requests for slots on temporary labor \ncertifications is usually in the ballpark of 80 percent of the roster.\n  Further, hockey leagues usually have a few if not more clubs that are \nlocated in Canada. Of course these players do not need H-2Bs to play \nfor a Canadian team, but in the event that they are traded during the \nseason to a U.S. team, the acquiring team would have to file an H-2B. \nThis frequently presents problems when the numbers have been exhausted \nas the trade becomes dependent upon the availability of a visa number \nand not the professional needs of the team. In addition, players are \nsigned throughout the season; this can also prevent teams from signing \nplayers if the numbers have been exhausted. This is particularly true \nat the end of the season--usually March or April 1--when the numbers \nhave been exhausted and the need to sign players for playoffs and \nfinals increases.\n  National Basketball Association created a developmental league in \n2001. The NBA Development League, or D-League, has functioned both as a \nfeeder system for the NBA, whose teams annually call up players to fill \nout NBA rosters beginning in January and, commencing with the 2005-06 \nseason, as a place where inexperienced NBA Players, within their first \ntwo seasons, may be assigned to get additional playing time. The D-\nLeague, currently comprised of 12 teams across the country, signs and \nrecruits the best basketball athletes from around the world who are not \nplaying in the NBA. On average, international players comprise \napproximately 10 percent of active D-League rosters, which currently \nstand at 10 players per team. The H-2B cap has prevented the D-League \nfrom being able to sign a significant number of qualified international \nplayers during each of the past two seasons.\n  So a simple, commonsense solution would be to expand the P-1 visa \ncategory to include minor league and certain amateur-level athletes who \nhave demonstrated a significant likelihood of graduating to the major \nleagues. This is what the COMPETE Act would do.\n  Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Association, the \nNational Hockey League, and Feld Entertainment, which owns Disney on \nIce, all support the expansion of the P-1 visa category to include \nminor league players and ice skaters.\n  Americans love their sports teams and want to see the highest caliber \nathletes competing or performing. By expanding the P-1 visa category, \nwe will make it possible for athletes to be selected based on talent \nand skill rather than visa availability.\n  In addition, we would reduce some pressure on the H-28 visa category \nmaking more of those visas available to the industries that need them.\n  I am pleased to be joined by Senators Collins and Cornyn, as well as \nMikulski, Leahy, and Lieberman, in introducing the COMPETE Act of 2006.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. OBAMA:\n  S. 3822. A bill to improve access to and appropriate utilization of \nvalid, reliable and accurate molecular genetic tests by all populations \nthus helping to secure the promise of personalized medicine for all \nAmericans; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Genomics and \nPersonalized Medicine Act of 2006. This bill will expand and accelerate \nscientific advancement in the field of genomics, which is already \nbeginning to change the paradigm of medical practice as we know it and \nwill have profound implications for health and health care in this \nNation.\n  Almost 150 years ago, Gregor Mendel made history when he established \nthe Laws of Heredity, which detailed his early knowledge about the \nfundamentals of inheritance. As has happened so many times throughout \nhistory, Mr. Mendel's fellow scientists didn't fully understand, \nsupport or necessarily agree with his hypotheses on genes, specifically \nhow they are transmitted from one generation to the next, and how they \nhelp to define who we are. But he persevered--growing, observing and \nexperimenting on 10,000 pea plants for almost a decade--and we know now \nthat his ideas were right.\n  I mention Mr. Mendel not just because he was an early pioneer in the \nfield of genetics, and is considered by many to be the father of \ngenetics, but also because he had vision, intellectual curiosity, \ncourage to think independently and question the status quo, and of \ncourse tenacity, all of which ultimately opened the door to a \nscientific revolution.\n  Since that time, our knowledge about genetics has dramatically \nincreased. We have unlocked many of the mysteries about DNA and RNA, \ntheir structure and function, and how their code is translated into the \nproteins that make up the tissues and organs of the human body. \nResearchers have also made discoveries about DNA replication, and \ngenetic recombination and regulation, just to name a few, and have \ndeveloped the necessary technologies to do all of this work.\n  This knowledge isn't just sitting in books on the shelf. We have used \nthese research findings to pinpoint the causes of many diseases, such \nas sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, and chronic myelogenous \nleukemia. Moreover, scientists have used genetic information to develop \nseveral treatments and therapies.\n  We have made so many achievements and come a long way in our \nunderstanding and application of genetics\n\n[[Page S8841]]\n\nknowledge. And yet we are just beginning to realize the full potential \nof this science to predict the onset of disease, diagnose earlier, and \ndevelop therapies that can treat or cure Americans from so many \nafflictions.\n  Just 3 years ago, scientists at the National Institutes of Health and \nthe Department of Energy reached another major landmark, with the \ncompletion of the sequencing of the entire human genome, described by \nmany as the Holy Grail of biology.\n  The completion of the Human Genome Project, HGP, has paved the way \nfor a more sophisticated understanding of disease causation. HGP has \nexpanded focus from the science of genetics, which refers to study of \nsingle genes, to genomics, which describes the study of all the genes \nin an individual, as well as the interactions of those genes with each \nother and with that person's environment.\n  We know that all human beings are 99.9 percent identical in genetic \nmakeup, but differences in the remaining 0.1 percent hold important \nclues about the causes of disease and response to drugs. Simply put, \nthe study of genomics will help us learn why some people get sick and \nothers do not and will allow us to use this information to better \nprevent and treat disease.\n  The relatively new field of genomics is the key to the practice of \npersonalized medicine. Personalized medicine is the use of genomic and \nmolecular data to better target the delivery of health care, facilitate \nthe discovery and clinical testing of new products, and help determine \na patient's predisposition to a particular disease or condition. \nPersonalized medicine represents a revolutionary and exciting change in \nthe fundamental approach and practice of medicine\n  Pharmacogenomics--the study of how genes affect a person's response \nto drugs--is a critical component of personalized medicine. Even so-\ncalled blockbuster drugs are typically effective in only 40 to 60 \npercent of patients who take them. Other studies have found that up to \n15 percent of hospitalized patients experience a serious adverse drug \nreaction, resulting in more than 100,000 deaths each year. \nPharmacogenomics has the potential to dramatically increase the \neffectiveness and safety of drugs, both of which are major health care \nconcerns.\n  We have a few examples already of how pharmacogenomics research has \nhelped to save lives. For example, the chemotherapy Purinethol is a \nlifesaver for kids with leukemia, but in 11 percent of cases, patients \nsuffer severe, sometimes fatal, side effects. In the 1990s, researchers \nidentified the gene variant that prevents affected patients from \nproperly breaking down Purinethol, allowing doctors to screen patients \nand adjust dosages for safer use of the drug.\n  Herceptin is a breast cancer drug that initially failed in clinical \ntrials. However, researchers discovered that 1 in 4 breast cancers have \ntoo many copies of a certain gene that helps cells grow, divide, and \nrepair themselves. Extra copies of this gene cause uncontrolled and \nrapid tumor growth. As it turns out, Herceptin is an effective drug for \npatients with this type of cancer, with significantly improved survival \nfor affected women.\n  Our Federal agencies have shown leadership in this area, as have many \nof our private sector partners. I have introduced the Genomics and \nPersonalized Medicine Act today to support their efforts and to \nencourage them to do even more and do it faster. Realizing the promise \nof personalized medicine will require: continued Federal leadership and \nagency collaboration; expansion and acceleration of genomics research; \na capable genomics workforce; incentives to encourage development of \ngenomic tests and therapies; and greater attention to the quality of \ngenetic tests, direct-to-consumer advertising, and use of personal \ngenomic information.\n\n  The Genomics and Personalized Medicine Act of 2006 will address each \nof these issues. The bill requires the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to establish the Genomics and Personalized Medicine \nInteragency Working Group to expand and accelerate genomics research, \nand application of findings from such research, through enhanced \ncommunication, collaboration and integration of relevant activities.\n  Genetic and genomics research will be expanded to increase the \ncollection of data that will advance both fields. The Secretary will \nalso develop a plan for a national biobanking research initiative and a \nnational distributed database, and provide support for local biobanking \ninitiatives.\n  This bill requests that the Administrator of the Health Resources and \nServices Administration support efforts to recruit and retain health \nprofessionals in the genomics workforce through educational and \nresearch opportunities, financial incentives, and modernization of \ntraining programs. In addition, the Secretary will promote initiatives \nto increase the integration of genetics and genomics into all aspects \nof medical and public health practice, with specific focus on training \nand guideline development for providers without expertise or experience \nin the field of genomics.\n  A financial incentive is included to encourage the development of \ncompanion diagnostic tests. Specifically, this Act provides a 100-\npercent tax credit for research and development costs associated with \ncompanion diagnostic tests. This bill also requests the National \nAcademies of Science to formally study this issue in order to provide \nexpert guidance about the level of incentives and potential approaches \nto really move this area forward.\n  The safety, efficacy, and availability of information about genetic \ntests, including pharmacogenetic and pharmacogenomics tests, is another \nfocus of this bill. The Secretary will contract with the Institute of \nMedicine to conduct a study and make recommendations regarding Federal \noversight and regulation of genetic tests. After this study is \ncomplete, the Secretary will develop a decision matrix to help \ndetermine which types of tests require review and the level of review \nneeded for such tests as well as the responsible agency. The Secretary \nwill also establish a specialty area for molecular and biochemical \ngenetics tests at CMS and direct a review the practice of direct-to-\nconsumer marketing.\n  Last but not least, the bill includes a sense of the Senate regarding \ngenetic nondiscrimination and privacy. The Genetic Information \nNondiscrimination Act of 2005, which passed the Senate with a vote of \n98 to 0 in February of 2005, contained a number of important provisions \nto protect the use of personal genetic information and prevent \ndiscrimination based on such information. This section reaffirms the \nimportance and the necessity of that act for the responsible \nadvancement of personalized medicine.\n  Mr. President, we stand at this new frontier of personalized \nmedicine, and like Gregor Mendel, we must explore and test the \nhypotheses and innovations in the area of genomics that can protect and \npromote our health. Genomics holds unparalleled promise for public \nhealth and for medicine, and the Genomics and Personalized Medicine Act \nof 2006 will help us to fulfill this promise. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport me in passing this critical legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE:\n  S. 3823. A bill to amend the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 \nand the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 to provide a means \nto combat discrimination on the basis of age or disability, by \nconditioning a State's receipt or use of Federal financial assistance \non the State's waiver of immunity from suit for violations under such \nacts; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Civil Rights \nRestoration Act of 2006. Today, there is a serious loophole in our \nNation's civil rights laws. If you are the victim of age or disability \ndiscrimination and you work in the private sector, you can sue your \nemployer in Federal court for money damages. If, however, you work for \none of the States, you cannot sue in Federal court for money damages \nunder either the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, ADEA, or the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, ADA.\n  This loophole is not the result of anything that we have done in \nCongress. In fact, when we passed the ADEA and the ADA, we clearly \nprovided that the States, just like private entities, cannot \ndiscriminate on the basis of age or disability. And, we said that if \nthey do, they can be sued for\n\n[[Page S8842]]\n\nmoney damages in Federal court. In our view, the right of an individual \nto be free from discrimination on the basis of age or disability did \nnot depend on where one works.\n  Instead, this loophole was created by the Supreme Court. In several \nrecent decisions, the Supreme Court has reinterpreted the 11th \namendment to the Constitution and severely limited Congress's power to \nsubject States to lawsuits under section 5 of the 14th amendment. In \nKimel v. Florida Board of Regents, 528 U.S. 62, 2000, for instance, the \nCourt held that Congress lacks the power to subject States to suit for \nmoney damages under the ADEA. In Board of Trustees of the University of \nAlabama v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356, 2001, the Court again held that \nCongress lacked the power to subject States to suit for money damages, \nthis time under title I of the ADA.\n  Although individuals can still sue the States for injunctive relief, \nthe Supreme Court's restriction on suits for money damages has taken \naway an essential tool for the victims of discrimination. As one \nwitness explained during hearings on the ADA, ``civil rights laws \ndepend heavily on private enforcement.'' ``[D]amages are essential to \nprovide private citizens a meaningful opportunity to vindicate their \nrights. Attempts to weaken the remedies available under the ADA are \nattacks on the ADA itself, and their success would make the ADA an \nempty promise of equality.''\n  Unfortunately, by restricting the ability of individuals to sue for \nmoney damages, the Garrett and Kimel decisions have severely limited \nthe ``promise of equality'' guaranteed by the ADA and the ADEA. \nLawsuits for money damages are the primary means for private \nindividuals to obtain redress for discrimination. They promote \ndeterrence and provide an important way for the Federal Government to \nenforce antidiscrimination laws. By eliminating the ability of State \nemployees to sue their employers for such damages, the Supreme Court's \ndecisions in Kimel and Garrett have made enforcement of these civil \nrights laws more difficult.\n  In addition, the Garrett and Kimel decisions have created a legal \nregime that gives State employees fewer rights than other employees \ncovered by the ADA and the ADEA. At present, employees of local \ngovernments and employees in the private sector are entitled to sue in \nFederal court for money damages for violations of the ADA or the ADEA. \nFor the more than 2,500,000 individuals who work for the States, \nhowever, such relief is no longer available.\n  Finally, the Garrett and Kimel decisions themselves are hardly a \nmodel of clarity. In fact, several scholars have said that they find \nthem to be inconsistent with prior case law, at odds with the clear \nlanguage of the Constitution, disrespectful of Congress's role in our \nsystem of government, and insensitive to the plight of those who are \nthe victims of discrimination.\n  In my opinion, Chairman Specter of the Judiciary Committee put it \nwell when he referred to these cases as ``inexplicable decisions.'' \nDuring the confirmation hearing for Chief Justice Roberts, Chairman \nSpecter said that the test that emerges from these Supreme Court \ndecisions ``has no grounding in the Constitution, no grounding in the \nFederalist Papers, no grounding in the history of the country, [and] \ncomes out of thin air[.]''\n  I happen to agree with him. In my view, Garrett and Kimel were \nwrongly decided. And, they should be overturned.\n  My bill will do just that. The Civil Rights Restoration Act of 2006 \nwould provide that any State that receives Federal financial assistance \nmust allow plaintiffs the ability to sue the State for money damages in \nFederal court if that State violates the terms of the ADEA or the ADA. \nOf course, those plaintiffs must meet all the other requirements to \nbring such a suit. My bill does not otherwise change the substance of \nthe ADA or ADEA, and it does not guarantee an outcome. It merely gives \nthe victims of discrimination access to federal courts so that they may \nseek the relief to which they are otherwise entitled. In other words, \nit will give the victims of age and disability discrimination the same \nrights that we intended to give them when we first passed the ADEA and \nthe ADA.\n  This is a simple bill with a simple purpose: it closes a loophole \ncreated by the Supreme Court; it re-establishes the original intent of \nthe ADA and the ADEA; and it restores to the victims of discrimination \nthe rights to which they have long been entitled. I am proud to \nintroduce the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 2006, and I ask my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3823\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Civil Rights Restoration Act \n     of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) For over 30 years, Congress has outlawed employment \n     discrimination by State employers. In 1974, in the face of \n     pervasive age discrimination by State and other employers, \n     Congress amended the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of \n     1967 (29 U.S.C. 621 et seq.) (referred to in this Act as the \n     ``ADEA'') to outlaw age discrimination by such employers. In \n     1990, Congress passed the Americans with Disabilities Act of \n     1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.) (referred to in this Act as \n     the ``ADA'') to provide a ``clear and comprehensive national \n     mandate'', as described in section 2(b)(1) of that Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 12101(b)(1)), to eliminate discrimination against \n     individuals with disabilities, even when that discrimination \n     came at the hands of States, including State employers.\n       (2)(A) Many years have passed since the enactment of those \n     laws, but discrimination on the basis of age or disability \n     remains a serious problem in the United States.\n       (B) Discrimination has invidious effects on its victims, \n     the workforce, the economy as a whole, and government \n     revenues. Discrimination on the basis of age or disability--\n       (i) increases the risk of unemployment among older workers \n     or individuals with disabilities, who may, as a result of the \n     discrimination, be forced to depend on government programs;\n       (ii) adversely affects the morale and productivity of the \n     workforce;\n       (iii) perpetuates unwarranted stereotypes about the \n     abilities of older workers or individuals with disabilities, \n     thus reducing the effectiveness of government programs \n     promoting nondiscrimination and integration; and\n       (iv) prevents the best use of both public and private \n     resources.\n       (3) Since the passage of the ADA and the ADEA, private \n     civil suits by the victims of discrimination have been an \n     essential tool in combating illegal discrimination. As one \n     witness explained during hearings on the legislation that \n     became the ADA, ``civil rights laws depend heavily on private \n     enforcement''. ``[D]amages are essential to provide private \n     citizens a meaningful opportunity to vindicate their rights. \n     Attempts to weaken the remedies available under the ADA are \n     attacks on the ADA itself, and their success would make the \n     ADA an empty promise of equality.''. Field Hearing on \n     Americans with Disabilities Act, Before the Subcommittee on \n     Select Education of the House Committee on Education and \n     Labor, 101st Cong. 68 (1989) (statement of Mr. Howard Wolf).\n       (4) In recent years, however, the Supreme Court has created \n     a serious loophole in the ADA and the ADEA, weakening their \n     ``promise of equality''. In Kimel v. Florida Board of \n     Regents, 528 U.S. 62 (2000), for instance, the Supreme Court \n     held that Congress lacked the power to subject States to suit \n     for money damages under the ADEA. In Board of Trustees of the \n     University of Alabama v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356 (2001), the \n     Court again held that Congress lacked the power to subject \n     States to suit for money damages, this time under title I of \n     the ADA (42 U.S.C. 12111 et seq.).\n       (5) As a result of those decisions, State employees who are \n     victimized by discrimination on the basis of age or \n     disability cannot sue in Federal court for money damages to \n     vindicate their Federal rights. Those decisions have, in \n     turn, had 2 unfortunate consequences.\n       (6) First, they have undermined the enforcement of the ADA \n     and the ADEA. Lawsuits for money damages are the primary \n     means for private individuals to obtain redress for \n     discrimination. In addition, lawsuits for money damages \n     promote deterrence and provide an important way for the \n     Federal Government to enforce antidiscrimination laws. By \n     eliminating the ability for State employees to sue their \n     employers for such damages, the Supreme Court's Kimel and \n     Garrett decisions have made enforcement of these civil rights \n     laws more difficult.\n       (7) Second, they have created a legal regime that gives \n     State employees fewer rights than other employees covered by \n     the ADA and the ADEA. At present, employees of local \n     governments and employees in the private sector are entitled \n     to sue in Federal court for money damages for violations of \n     the ADA or the ADEA. For the more than 2,500,000 individuals \n     who work for the States, however, such relief is no longer \n     available.\n\n[[Page S8843]]\n\n       (8) Although most States have laws in effect that bar \n     discrimination on the basis of age or disability, those laws \n     are insufficient to provide redress for those individuals who \n     are subjected to discrimination by State employers or \n     agencies.\n       (9) A few States apply the doctrine of sovereign immunity \n     to completely bar State employees from suing in State court \n     for age discrimination. In several States, it is still \n     unclear whether State law claims can proceed in State court \n     for age discrimination or whether those claims are barred by \n     sovereign immunity. Finally, there are many States that \n     severely limit or restrict the kinds of remedies or monetary \n     relief available to State employees who bring suits for \n     discrimination on the basis of age.\n       (10) The same problems exist with State laws regarding \n     disability discrimination. In fact, one recent analysis has \n     shown that there are significant gaps in the coverage and \n     remedies available under State laws outlawing discrimination.\n       (11) Thus, while State laws are important in trying to stem \n     discrimination on the basis of age or disability, they are \n     currently inadequate to close the loophole created by the \n     Kimel and Garrett decisions.\n       (12) In the years since the Kimel and Garrett decisions, \n     many States have also challenged the constitutionality of \n     title II of the ADA (42 U.S.C. 12131 et seq.). These \n     challenges have forced individuals with disabilities into \n     extensive litigation about sovereign immunity when they seek \n     redress for disability discrimination in such fundamental \n     areas as access to the courts, access to community-based \n     services, access to State-sponsored health insurance, access \n     to public transportation, access to handicapped parking, \n     access to mental health services, and access to public \n     education. The Supreme Court has issued several decisions \n     that invite even more litigation. In Tennessee v. Lane, for \n     instance, the Court held that, under the particular facts of \n     that case, a plaintiff could sue the State for money damages \n     under title II of the ADA, even though the Court, in the \n     Garrett case, had barred a claim for such damages under title \n     I of that Act (42 U.S.C. 12111 et seq.) Tennessee v. Lane, \n     541 U.S. 509 (2004).\n       (13) After the Lane decision, some claims against States \n     are permitted to proceed under the ADA, while others are not. \n     This has made it extremely difficult for the victims of \n     discrimination, States, and Congress to determine precisely \n     when States are subject to suit under the ADA and when they \n     are not. The confusion has spawned a significant amount of \n     litigation in the lower Federal courts. This jurisprudence \n     has even caused the Chairman of the Committee on the \n     Judiciary of the Senate, Senator Arlen Specter, to condemn \n     the Court's recent decisions as ``inexplicable''.\n       (14) The Constitution provides Congress with the power to \n     enact legislation--\n       (A) to clarify that, despite the Supreme Court's decisions \n     in the Kimel and Garrett cases, the States are subject to \n     suit just like other entities when the States violate the ADA \n     and the ADEA; and\n       (B) to end the confusion created by the Court's decision in \n     the Lane case.\n       (15) Under section 8 of article I of the Constitution, \n     ``The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes, \n     duties, imposts and excises, to pay the debts and provide for \n     the common defense and general welfare of the United \n     States''.\n       (16) Congress' power under this language, known as the \n     Spending Clause, is well-established. Under this Clause, \n     Congress has the power to require the States to abide by \n     certain conditions in exchange for receiving Federal \n     financial assistance. This authority has been recognized by \n     the Supreme Court repeatedly through the years and reaffirmed \n     recently. United States v. Butler, 297 U.S. 1 (1936) \n     (declaring that Congress may exert authority through its \n     spending power); South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203 (1987) \n     (upholding condition requiring the establishment of a \n     drinking age of 21 years in exchange for the receipt of \n     Federal highway dollars). In fact, the Supreme Court has \n     specifically held that Congress may require a State, as a \n     condition of receiving Federal financial assistance, to waive \n     its immunity from suit for violations of Federal law. College \n     Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Education \n     Expense Board, 527 U.S. 666 (1999).\n       (17) Congress has previously used its spending power to \n     require States to waive their immunity from suit in exchange \n     for receiving Federal financial assistance. For instance, the \n     provisions of section 1003 of the Rehabilitation Act \n     Amendments of 1986 (42 U.S.C. 2000d-7) provide that a State \n     shall not be immune from suit under the 11th amendment for \n     violations of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 \n     (29 U.S.C. 794), title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 \n     (20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.), the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 \n     (42 U.S.C. 6101 et seq.), and title VI of the Civil Rights \n     Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq.). At least one court, \n     however, has suggested that those provisions do not apply to \n     the ADA or the ADEA. Brown v. Washington Metro Area Transit \n     Authority, No. DKC 2005-0052, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16881 (D. \n     Md. 2005).\n       (18) By requiring States to waive their immunity from suit \n     under the ADA and the ADEA in exchange for receiving Federal \n     assistance, the Federal government can ensure that Federal \n     dollars are not ``frittered away'' on unlawful \n     discrimination. Such a conditional waiver will help Congress \n     ``protect the integrity of the vast sums of money distributed \n     through Federal programs''. Sabri v. United States, 541 U.S. \n     600 (2004). ``Simple justice requires that public funds, to \n     which all taxpayers . . . contribute, not be spent in any \n     fashion which encourages, entrenches, subsidizes, or results \n     in . . . discrimination''. Lau v. Nichols, 414 U.S. 563 \n     (1974). This simple principle applies whether the \n     discrimination is based on race, as in the Lau case, or age, \n     or disability, as in Barbour v. Washington Metro Area Transit \n     Authority, 374 F.3d 1161 (D.C. Cir. 2004).\n       (19) Such a conditional waiver does not coerce a State in \n     any way. The Supreme Court has recognized that a State's \n     voluntary waiver of its 11th amendment right is \n     constitutional. College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid \n     Postsecondary Education Expense Board, 527 U.S. 666 (1999) \n     (citing Clark v. Barnard, 108 U.S. 436 (1883)). The Court has \n     explicitly recognized that a State's acceptance of Federal \n     funds constitutes a knowing agreement to a congressionally-\n     imposed condition on the funds. Thus, while Congress may not \n     compel States to waive their immunity granted under the 11th \n     amendment, a voluntary State waiver condition is wholly \n     permissible. Alden v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706 (1999).\n       (20) The Kimel and Garrett decisions frustrate the ability \n     of the ADA and the ADEA to protect individual rights and \n     remedy violations of Federal law. In the wake of those \n     decisions, and in recognition that State laws may be \n     insufficient to protect against discrimination on the basis \n     of age or disability, it is essential to require that States \n     waive their immunity from suit under the ADA and the ADEA for \n     those programs or activities receiving Federal financial \n     assistance.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to provide to any State employee or person aggrieved by \n     any program or activity that receives Federal financial \n     assistance the right to sue the State for money damages for \n     any violation of the ADA or the ADEA; and\n       (2) to provide that a State's receipt or use of Federal \n     financial assistance for any program or activity of a State \n     shall constitute a waiver of sovereign immunity, under the \n     11th amendment to the Constitution or otherwise, to a suit \n     brought by any employee or person aggrieved by that program \n     or activity for any violation of the ADA or the ADEA.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to end the flow of methamphetamine and precursor \nchemicals coming across the border of the United States; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today because, despite the heroic \nefforts of law enforcement agencies in Montana and elsewhere around the \ncountry, the use of methamphetamine continues to rise. In the Senate, \nwe have passed legislation to fund efforts to go after domestic \nproduction of meth--from provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act, which \nrestricted the sale of pseudoephedrine, to funds for the cleanup of \nmeth labs. While law enforcement officials report that these efforts \nare in fact reducing the production of meth within our borders, they \nalso tell me that foreign-produced meth is being imported to fill the \nsupply void.\n  For this reason, I have introduced the ``Methamphetamine Trafficking \nPrevention Act of 2006'' in order to bring additional Federal resources \nto bear on this problem. I want to thank my colleagues, Senate Majority \nLeader Frist, Senator DeWine, Senator Allard, Senator Coleman, Senator \nAllen and Senator Smith for joining me in sponsoring this legislation. \nThe United States shares around 4,000 miles of border with Canada and \nalmost 2,000 miles with Mexico. Controlling what comes across these \nborders must be a top priority for national security.\n  A report recently released by the President's Office of National Drug \nControl Policy, the Department of Justice, and the Department of Health \nand Human Services had this to say:\n\n       The most urgent priority of the Federal Government toward \n     reducing the supply of methamphetamine in the Untied States \n     will be to tighten the international market for chemical \n     precursors, such as pseudoephedrine and ephedrine, used to \n     produce the drug. Most of the methamphetamine used in \n     America--probably between 75 and 85 percent--is made with \n     chemical precursors that are diverted at some point from the \n     international stream of commerce . . . Although domestic \n     enforcement continues to be a priority, the impact of State \n     laws controlling retail access to precursors, together with \n     Federal, State, and local enforcement efforts, has had a \n     significant impact on the domestic production of \n     methamphetamine. As a result, a larger proportion of the \n     methamphetamine consumed in the United States is now coming \n     across the border as a final product . . .\n\n  Meth trafficking has quickly adapted to increased domestic efforts to \nstem production and the need for an international solution is clear.\n  This legislation will provide an additional $15 million for the \nDepartment of Justice's Meth Hot Spots Program for the creation of \n``Border Technology Grants'' to support technology used to detect meth \nand substances used to make meth on the border through aerial \nsurveillance and to find meth labs around the border with hyperspectral \nsensors. Another $5 million will be provided to the Drug Enforcement \nAgency for trace chemical detectors to be used\n\n[[Page S8845]]\n\non U.S. borders. These sensors will also assist in locating explosive \ndevices.\n  The international nature of meth trafficking makes Federal action \nnecessary, but the United States cannot act alone. This legislation \nwill also coordinate Federal drug enforcement efforts with foreign \ncounterparts in order to devise a strategy to fight meth production \nacross national borders. Officials from the U.S. Trade Representative \nwill discuss meth trafficking with trading partners in multi- and bi-\nlateral negotiations in order to curb the shipment of this dangerous \nsubstance.\n  The impacts of the meth crisis are felt nationwide. In Montana, I \nhave seen first-hand the consequences of meth addiction on individuals, \ntheir families, and communities. Nowhere are these problems more \nserious than on Indian Reservations. In Montana, there are several \nreservations on or near the Canadian border. While Montana's law \nenforcement has done a good job shutting down meth labs in Montana, the \nflow of meth from Canada and Mexico has more than replaced domestic \nmeth production. This bill would require the Department of Justice to \nreport to Congress the problems faced on these reservations with \nrespect to meth abuse and trafficking.\n  It is time to take the response to this crisis to a new--\ninternational--level and I encourage my colleagues to support these \nefforts.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MENENDEZ:\n  S. 3826. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exclude \nfrom gross income military pay received by a member of a reserve \ncomponent of the Armed Forces of the United States who is called to \nactive duty; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, over the past few decades, our country \nhas seen a major shift in the way that our Reserve component has been \nused. Traditionally, National guardsmen and reservists have \nsupplemented our active-duty troops at times of a major war or \nconflict. But as America faces ever-increasing military challenges, we \nsee these forces now replacing active duty troops in operations around \nthe world.\n  Since September 11, a large number of our Reserve component has been \ncalled to active duty, and it is expected to remain that way for the \nforeseeable future. Our Nation not only relies on the National Guard \nduring times of war, but during crises and disasters within our \nborders. In my home State of New Jersey, we have witnessed the critical \nrole the Guard plays in supporting our first responders and assisting \nwith domestic emergencies. The Guard immediately responded to the 9/11 \nattacks, provided relief in the aftermath of the hurricanes on the gulf \ncoast, and aided New Jerseyans after the flooding in our State.\n  As our Nation continues to rely on the efforts of National Guard \nmembers and reservists, it is imperative that we provide them and their \nfamilies the support they need at home. Unfortunately, many married \nGuard members and reservists on active duty lose their income from \ntheir civilian jobs when they are activated. It is unconscionable that \nwe would make these soldiers choose between their duty to our country \nand the financial security of their families.\n  That is why I am introducing the Citizen Soldier Relief Act, which \nwould exempt from taxation incomes earned by members of the Reserve \ncomponent that are called to duty outside the traditional 1 weekend per \nmonth and 2 weeks per year. My bill would address a current void that \nexists in tax relief for our National Guard members and reservists who \nserve in noncombat-related capacities.\n  By providing tax relief for these hard-working men and women, we can \nshow them that our Nation appreciates their service and their \nsacrifice.

A bill to amend title 4, United States Code, to declare \nEnglish as the official language of the Government of the United \nStates, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, there are many things we take for granted \nthat have made our Nation prosperous. The Founding Fathers spent their \nlives seeking to create a United States of America that could survive \nagainst the great powers of England, France, and Spain.\n  These men knew that America had at least one advantage over the \nEuropean powers: size. President Jefferson's Louisiana Purchase of 1803 \neffectively doubled the size of the United States and provided a means \nby which America's inland farmers would have a guaranteed way to ship \ntheir products to market.\n  Even today, the comparison remains striking when you ask, ``How far \nwill one gallon of fuel move one ton of freight?''\n  One gallon of fuel can move a ton of freight 59 miles by truck and \n386 miles by rail. That same gallon of fuel will move a ton of freight \nby water 522 miles.\n  One of the main reasons for the economy of waterborne shipping lies \nin something physics students know as friction and we pilots know as \ndrag.\n  The more that friction or drag increase, the more that fuel economy \ndecreases. There is a lot of friction between a road and a truck. There \nis far less between a ship and a river.\n  This simple rule led me to lead the fight for the Water Resources \nDevelopment Act a few days ago. As one of the most fiscally \nconservative Members of this body, I have long argued that the two most \nimportant functions of the Federal Government are to provide for \nnational defense and public infrastructure.\n  Efficiency and economics require the Government to not only plan but \nto construct and maintain public infrastructure. Investments in real \npublic infrastructure, like waterways and barge canals, create \neconomies of scale that have made the American economy a wonder of the \nworld.\n  My determination to stand up in this Chamber at every opportunity on \nbehalf of national defense and public infrastructure is a large part of \nthe reason I am introducing legislation today to make English America's \nofficial language.\n  A common means of communication has created one giant market for \ngoods and labor from Maine to California. A resident of Tulsa can seek \nwork in New Hampshire, Oregon, or Georgia without having to learn a \nsecond language. A company based in Oklahoma City can readily sell its \nproducts from Portland, ME, to Los Angeles, CA.\n  In Europe, by contrast, a resident of Berlin cannot look for work in \nParis or\n\n[[Page S8846]]\n\nWarsaw without surmounting considerable language barriers. A German \ncompany cannot easily sell its products in Madrid, again, in part \nbecause of the language barrier.\n  The European Union is an effort to create a United States-like common \nmarket in Western Europe, among other things. Europeans are spending \nbillions of euros to try to replicate what we Americans have enjoyed \nfor free these past 230 years.\n  There are too many signs that we are allowing this great advantage of \nan American nation united by a common language to slip through our \nfingers.\n  President Bill Clinton created the most radical language policy 6 \nyears ago when he signed Executive Order--E.O.--13166 on August 11, \n2000.\n  E.O. 13166 declared that all recipients of Federal funds had to be \nready to provide all services in any language anyone wished to speak at \nany time.\n  E.O. 13166 means that while Canada has only two official languages \nand the United Nations just six, the United States now has over 200 \nofficial languages.\n  Efforts to repeal E.O. 13166 have run aground because of a \nfundamental misunderstanding of what repeal would mean.\n  After the debate on my official English amendment, S.A. 4064, to the \nSenate immigration bill, S. 2611, E.J. Dionne, Jr., told readers of the \nMay 23 Washington Post that he was still going to pray over his \nchildren in French. I have only one word to say to Mr. Dionne: relax.\n  Neither my earlier amendment to the immigration legislation nor the \nlegislation I am introducing today will have any impact whatsoever on \nthe prayers of the Dionne family or, for that matter, a dinner table \nchat in Spanish or a family discussion in Navajo.\n  Official English laws are not directed at the language people \nthemselves choose to speak but, rather, in what language the Government \nspeaks to the American people.\n  My bill basically recognizes the practical reality of the role of \nEnglish as our national language. It states explicitly that English is \nour national language and provides English a status in law it has not \nbefore held.\n  Making English the official language will clarify that there is no \nentitlement to receive Federal documents and services in languages \nother than English. My legislation declares that any rights of a \nperson, as well as services or materials in languages other than \nEnglish, must be authorized or provided by law. It recognizes the \ndecades of unbroken court opinions that civil rights laws protecting \nagainst national origin and discrimination do not create rights to \nGovernment services and materials in languages other than English.\n  If passed, my bill will also repeal all bilingual, or foreign-\nlanguage, ballot mandates. There is a reason bilingual ballots make so \nmany of my constituents upset. Gathering together at the polling place \nis one of the few remaining civic rituals we perform as Americans.\n  I can remember going along with my mother on election day; the \nAmerican flag behind the table where voters signed in and were verified \nas eligible; the sound of the ``thunk'' of the levers on the voting \nmachine. I remember thinking even then that voting was a privilege to \nbe approached seriously.\n  In all too many places these days, the local polling place resembles \nnothing more than a branch of the Mexican consulate or an outpost of \nthe United Nations--signs in two, three, or even more languages; people \nyelling at weary poll workers because a Cantonese speaker was summoned \nto translate for a speaker of Mandarin Chinese.\n  My constituents ask me all the time how people are supposed to cast \nan informed vote if they cannot follow the debates, which are in \nEnglish, and read the campaign literature, also in English. Bilingual \nballots strike many of my constituents as an invitation to all kinds of \nvoting fraud.\n  Of course, when the Government attempts to please everyone by \ntranslating important documents into multiple languages, mistakes are \ninevitable.\n  To mention just one example out of many, in 1993, the Chinese ballot \nin New York City had the Chinese characters for the word ``no'' as a \ntranslation of the English word ``yes.'' One can only imagine the \nconfusion that ensued.\n  Official English is popular, even among Hispanics. As I said before \nduring the debate on my amendment, if you look at some of the recent \npolling data, such as the Zogby poll in 2006, it found 84 percent of \nAmericans, including 77 percent of Hispanics, believed that English \nshould be the national language of government operations. A poll of 91 \npercent of foreign-born Latino immigrants agreed that learning English \nis essential to succeed in the United States, according to a 2002 \nKaiser Family Foundation survey.\n  I wish to conclude by saying that I think it would be a tremendous \ndemonstration of good faith by the White House to support my \nlegislation. America has plenty of language problems already.\n  If the Senate version of the President's immigration proposals should \nbecome law, every guest worker and ever recipient of amnesty would \narrive on our shores as a little bundle of linguistic entitlements. \nLocal government offices and public schools will be simply overwhelmed \nby the costly language mandates each of these individuals and their \nfamilies will trigger.\n  A nation certain of its language and culture can continue to be a \nwelcoming nation to legal immigrants. A nation with uncontrolled \nborders and no convictions about what it expects immigrants to do once \nthey arrive will soon become a nation in name only.\n  Mr. President, my legislation is good for America and good for \neveryone in America. I urge its speedy passage by my colleagues.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 3832. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to establish \ncriteria to transfer title to reclamation facilities, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, since its inception in 1902, the Bureau \nof Reclamation has constructed numerous facilities which have supplied \nmuch of the water and power necessary to populate the Western United \nStates. The National Research Council of the National Academy of \nSciences estimates that Reclamation currently owns 673 facilities that \nare part of 178 major projects. When many of these facilities were \nconstructed, there were few local communities and utilities capable of \nassuming title to the facilities. However, this is no longer the case. \nMany project beneficiaries are both willing and able to receive title \nto Reclamation facilities.\n  The growth of the environmental movement during the 1970s, explosive \npopulation growth in the West, Indian water rights claims, and \nurbanization transformed Reclamation from an agency that plans, \ndesigns, and constructs large projects into one that manages existing \nReclamation facilities and allocates water resources in accordance with \napplicable law. Correspondingly, appropriations for Reclamation have \ndecreased over the past 40 years. As chairman of the Energy and Water \nDevelopment Appropriations Subcommittee, I have become increasingly \nconcerned that Reclamation lacks adequate resources to fulfill its \ncurrent mission, particularly in light of increasing nonreimbursable \nexpenditures required for operations, maintenance, and rehabilitation \nof Reclamation facilities. For this reason, we need to investigate \nopportunities, including title transfers, to make more money available \nto Reclamation.\n  Reclamation project beneficiaries frequently claim that Reclamation \nservices passed on to customers are far more expensive than comparable \nservices in the private sector and that Reclamation ownership of these \nfacilities imposes an unnecessary administrative burden on project \nbeneficiaries. For these reasons, many project beneficiaries who have \nfulfilled their construction repayment obligations would like to pursue \nthe transfer of title to Reclamation facilities and land. In addition \nto benefiting project beneficiaries, transfer of title to Reclamation \nfacilities also divests the Federal Government of the liability, \noperation, maintenance, management, and regulation associated with \nthese facilities. In its framework for transfer of title to Reclamation \nfacilities, Reclamation acknowledged its commitment to a\n\n[[Page S8847]]\n\nFederal Government that ``works better and costs less.'' I believe that \npursuing title transfers on a widespread basis is consistent with this \npolicy.\n  While Reclamation currently has an administrative process for \ndetermining which uncomplicated transfers should be pursued by \nCongress, it is my belief that the process is not as aggressive or \ncomprehensive as it should be. The bill I introduce today would direct \nthe Secretary of the Interior to promulgate criteria for the transfer \nof title to Reclamation facilities and lands, including multipurpose \nand multibeneficiary projects. The bill also directs the Secretary of \nthe Interior to undertake a study to identify which Reclamation \nfacilities may be appropriate for transfer. Consistent with current \npolicy, Congress would evaluate which of these facilities should be \ntransferred.\n  I realize that title transfer may not be appropriate for every \nReclamation facility. However, I believe that there are a great number \nof instances in which title transfer would benefit the United States \nand Reclamation customers.\n  I thank Senator Bingaman, ranking member of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, for being an original cosponsor of this \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was orderd to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3832\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize support for the Armed Forces Support \nFoundation in assisting members of the National Guard and Reserve and \nformer members of the Armed Forces in securing employment in the \nprivate sector, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed \nServices.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Armed Forces \nEmployment Support Act, AFESA, which will help members of our Armed \nForces transition to employment after their military service. My \nlegislation will help the Armed Forces Support Foundation, AFSF, a \nnonprofit organization that helps military veterans and members of the \nNational Guard and Reserve find jobs in the private sector, create new \nprograms that help veterans obtain jobs after their service to the \nNation.\n  This legislation is necessary to address disproportionate \nunemployment rates for young veterans, the cost to the Government to \nprovide unemployment insurance, and skilled labor shortages in key \nindustries. For instance, the unemployment rate for veterans aged 22 to \n26 is three times the national average. The Government has spent $87 \nmillion on unemployment benefits for recently discharged veterans and \nlost an estimated $50 million in tax revenue. Further, a study \nsponsored by the Federal Mediation and Conciliation concluded the \nbiggest problem facing the transportation industry is the shortage of \nskilled labor.\n\n[[Page S8848]]\n\nThe transportation industry will benefit from this legislation given \nthat many veterans have experience in transportation from their \nmilitary service.\n  Specifically, AFESA authorizes $10 million annually through fiscal \nyear 2011 for the National Guard to make grants to AFSF to help it \npursue agreements to hire veterans with businesses in industries \nranging from transportation to domestic security.\n  AFSF is modeled on a successful veterans employment transition \nprogram, Helmets to Hardhats, which has helped more than 150,000 \nveterans find jobs in the construction industry and has referred 40,000 \nveterans into apprenticeship programs. Helmets to Hardhats evaluates \neach veteran it works with to identify that veteran's experiences. It \nthen takes that information and targets various business within the \nconstruction industry that has positions that require similar skills. \nThe agreements it enters into guarantee a long-term partnership that \nbenefit both parties. Helmets to Hardhats has also entered into an \nagreement with the National Guard to assist with recruiting efforts. In \n2005, it helped recruit 396 men and women into the National Guard, \nwhich is estimated to have saved the military $3.7 million in \nrecruiting costs.\n  The success of Helmets to Hardhats has been noted in the media, by \nthe National Guard, the Department of Labor, 17 State Governors, \nsenators, congressmen, and others as an innovative organization that \nhas shown results and truly benefitted the veteran community and the \nconstruction industry. AFSF will build upon the success of Helmets to \nHardhats by facilitating employment in multiple industries with \npositions that are applicable to skills veterans acquired in the \nmilitary.\n  I can think of few causes more important that helping those who have \nrisked their lives defending our country find good jobs and realize the \nAmerican dream. Unfortunately, many veterans of the war in Iraq and \nother theaters are finding it difficult to find a job when they return \nfrom service. For instance, at 15.6 percent, the unemployment rate for \n20- to 24-year-old veterans is nearly twice that of nonveterans. This \nis an unacceptable fact that this legislation will help ameliorate. \nIndeed, I am confident that the success of Helmets to Hardhats in the \nconstruction industry will be replicated many times over by AFSF.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is based on the premise that no one \nwho has served our country in uniform should be left behind when they \nreturn to civilian life. AFSF's mission is a worthwhile and important \ncause that deserves the Government's support. I know that it will help \nour veterans, and I hope my colleagues will support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SESSIONS (for himself and Mrs. Feinstein).\n  S. 3834. A bill to amend the Controlled Substances Act to address \nonline pharmacies; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, after working together with Senator \nFeinstein, I am pleased to introduce the Online Pharmacy Consumer \nProtection Act of 2006. I have worked to take the lead in protecting \nconsumers specifically as it relates to the sale and distribution of \ncontrolled substances and prescription drugs over the Internet and \nholding liable those who do so via unregistered online pharmacies. I \ncommend Senator Feinstein for her leadership on this issue and look \nforward to working with her to pass this important piece of \nlegislation.\n  This bill would prohibit the distribution of controlled substances \nand prescription drugs by means of the Internet without a valid \nprescription and provides for the legitimate online distribution of \nthose drugs in certain circumstances. Two weeks ago, Attorney General \nGonzalez testified that sale and distribution of ``controlled \npharmaceuticals on the Internet is of great concern,'' since it ``gives \ndrug abusers the ability to circumvent the law, as well as sound \nmedical practice.'' This bill would go a long way in addressing the \nconcerns expressed by Attorney General Gonzalez by reigning in a \npractice that has gone unregulated for far too long.\n  Recently, there has been an explosion in the number of online \npharmacies that provide prescription drugs--both controlled and \nnoncontrolled substances--to users without valid prescriptions. Most \nillegal drug abuse involving prescription drugs is associated with \nInternet purchases, where users are given a prescription without ever \nseeing a doctor. The most prominent abuse occurs with regard to \ncontrolled substances such as hydrocodone, Valium, Xanax, OxyContin, \nand Vicodin. A 2002 study reported that nearly 15 million adults \nadmitted to abusing prescription drugs, with 2.4 million new abusers in \n2001 alone. Currently, there is no way to police this illegal activity.\n  The ease with which consumers may purchase controlled substances and \nother prescription drugs from online pharmacies without a prescription \nis shocking. Often consumers can obtain a prescription from physicians \nemployed by the online pharmacy by simply filling out a brief \nquestionnaire on the pharmacy's Web site. Most online pharmacies have \nno way to verify that the consumer ordering the prescription is \nactually who they claim to be or that the medical condition the \nconsumer describes actually exists. Thus, drug addicts and minor \nchildren can easily order controlled substances and prescription drugs \nover the Internet simply by providing false identities or describing \nnonexistent medical conditions.\n  In 2001, Ryan Haight, a California high school honors student and \nathlete, died from an overdose of the painkiller hydrocodone that he \npurchased from an online pharmacy. The doctor prescribing hydrocodone \nhad never met or personally examined Ryan. Ryan simply filled out the \npharmacy's online questionnaire and described himself as a 25-year-old \nmale suffering from chronic back pain. Ryan's death could have been \navoided.\n  I believe that Congress is in the best position to help prevent \nteenagers from purchasing controlled substances and prescription drugs \nfrom online rouge pharmacies. I also believe that Congress has the \nability to help prevent adult prescription drug abuse by making it \nharder to purchase these drugs online without a valid prescription.\n  The Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act would provide criminal \npenalties for those who knowingly or intentionally--unlawfully--\ndispense controlled substances and prescription drugs over the \nInternet; give State attorneys general a civil cause of action against \nanyone who violates the act if they have reason to believe that the \nviolation affects the interests of their State's residents; and allow \nthe Federal Government to take possession of any tangible or intangible \nproperty used illegally by online pharmacies.\n  The Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act would also require online \npharmacies to file an additional registration statement with the \nAttorney General and meet additional registration requirements \npromulgated by him/her; report to the Attorney General any controlled \nsubstances or prescription drugs dispensed over the Internet, and \ncomply with licensing and disclosure requirements.\n  The Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act of 2006 takes a \nsubstantial step toward plugging a loophole in our drug laws by \nregulating the practice of distributing controlled substances and \nprescription drugs via the Internet. By holding unregistered online \npharmacies accountable for their activity, we are ensuring that those \nwho seek to purchase prescription drugs by using the Internet are \nprotected from those engaged in reprehensible business practices.\n  Mr. President, once again I thank Senator Feinstein for her \nleadership in addressing this serious issue. I commend this bill to my \ncolleagues for study, and I urge them to support this important \nlegislation.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator \nSessions to introduce the Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act. Our \nlegislation protects the safety of consumers who wish to purchase \nprescription drugs over the Internet, while holding accountable those \nwho operate unregistered pharmacies.\n  Just a few weeks ago, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales appeared \nbefore the Senate Judiciary Committee for a DOJ Oversight hearing. In \ndiscussing the Department's priorities, he singled out how ``the \npurchase of ... controlled pharmaceuticals on the Internet is of\n\n[[Page S8849]]\n\ngreat concern.'' He noted how the Internet's wide accessibility and \nanonymity ``give drug abusers the ability to circumvent the law, as \nwell as sound medical practice, a[s] they dispense potentially \ndangerous controlled pharmaceuticals.'' With ``no identifying... \ninformation on these Web sites, it is very difficult for law \nenforcement to track any of the individuals behind them.''\n  I believe this bill will address many of these problems that the \nAttorney General has identified.\n  To understand how many of these Internet pharmacy Web sites exist, \njust visit any Internet search engine. Type in the name of any \ncontrolled substance or prescription drug. Several Web sites will \nappear, offering to sell you these drugs without a prescription and \nwithout a medical examination. Some of these Web sites simply ask \npatients to send copies of medical records, with no verification of \ntheir validity.\n  Patients use these pharmacies to obtain addictive drugs, like Vicodin \nand Oxycontin. They can receive prescription medications like Viagra \nwithout a doctor performing a physical exam to ensure that an \nunderlying health condition will not cause a dangerous side effect.\n  At the same time, receiving medications from a legitimate, licensed \nInternet pharmacy is one of the new conveniences ushered in by the \nInternet age. This bill preserves the ability of well-run pharmacies \nand well-intentioned patients to access prescription drugs and \ncontrolled substances by means of the Internet.\n  This legislation imposes basic, commonsense requirements on an \nindustry that presents both promise and peril.\n  First, this bill establishes disclosure standards for Internet \npharmacies.\n  Second, this bill prohibits an Internet pharmacy from dispensing or \nselling a prescription drug or controlled substance without an in-\nperson examination by a physician.\n  Third, it allows a State attorney general to bring a civil action in \nFederal district court to enjoin a pharmacy operating in violation of \nthe law and to enforce compliance with the provisions of this law.\n  The disclosure requirements contained in this bill will allow \npatients to differentiate between shady offshore pharmacies, and \nlegitimate licensed ones. Under this legislation, pharmacies must \nclearly disclose the name and address of the pharmacy, contact \ninformation for the pharmacist-in-charge, and a list of States in which \nthe pharmacy is licensed to operate. They must also clearly post a \nstatement that they comply with the requirements in this legislation.\n  The bill states pharmacies can dispense to patients only if they have \na valid prescription from a practitioner who has performed an in-person \nexamination. This requirement will ensure that doctors can verify the \nhealth status of a patient and ensure that the drug he or she will \nreceive from the pharmacy is medically appropriate.\n\n  This legislation recognizes that in the case of an emergency, a \npatient may not always be able to see his or her typical physician. For \nthat reason, it allows a doctor to designate a covering practitioner to \nwrite a valid prescription if he or she is not available.\n  Finally, this bill contains real penalties to hold accountable those \nwho continue to operate pharmacies in violation of these requirements.\n  First, for Internet sales of prescription drugs and controlled \nsubstances, the bill makes clear that such activities are subject to \nthe current Federal laws against illegal distributions and the same \npenalties applicable to hand-to-hand sales.\n  Second, the bill increases the penalties for illegal distributions of \ncontrolled substances categorized by the DEA as schedule III, IV and V \nsubstances, with new penalties if death or serious bodily injury \nresults and longer periods of supervised release available after \nconvictions.\n  The bill also allows a State's attorney general to file a Federal \nmotion to stop these pharmacies from operating illegally, no matter \nwhere the entity is headquartered. Previously, this type of enforcement \nwould require a filing in every State.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Allen, Mr. Kyl, \n        Mr. Sessions, Mr. Graham, Mr. Inhofe, and Mr. Santorum):\n  S. 3835. A bill to provide adequate penalties for crimes committed \nagainst United States judges and Federal law enforcement officers, to \nprovide appropriate security for judges and law enforcement officers, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of the \nCourt and Law Enforcement Protection Act of 2006. This bill is designed \nto address the critical issue of judicial and law enforcement security.\n  Police officers place their lives on the line every time they put on \ntheir uniforms and report for duty. Likewise, the dedicated men and \nwomen who work in America's courthouses--from the judges to the court \nreporters--preside each day over difficult, contentious and at times \nvery emotional legal disputes. And these public servants, like our \npolice, are placed in hams way by the nature of their jobs. These \nindividuals fulfill essential roles that keep our democracy running \nsmoothly, and I have the greatest respect for them.\n  Unfortunately, violence directed at public servants is on the rise. \nFrom escalating violence against police officers to courthouse \nattacks--including in my home State of Texas--these despicable actions \nthreaten the administration of justice. This Congress has the power--\nand now must exercise it--to ensure that certain and swift punishment \nawaits those who engage in these unconscionable acts of violence.\n  The administration of justice--indeed, the health of American \ndemocracy--depends on our ability to attract dedicated public servants, \nincluding police officers and judges. And so we must do all that we can \nto provide adequate security to these dedicated men and women who are \ntoo often targeted for violence or harassment simply because of the \nposition they hold.\n  As a former State attorney general, I had the responsibility of \ndefending sentences on appeal of certain defendants who had been found \nguilty of violence. So I am acutely aware of the devastating effects \ncriminal acts of violeave have on the victims and their families. And \nbecause I also used to be a judge I am fortunate to have a number of \nclose, personal friends who serve in law enforcement and on the bench. \nI personally know judges and their families who have been victims of \nviolence, and I have grieved with those families. I am outraged that \nthese cowardly and despicable acts continue to occur.\n  Police officers in this Nation are sworn to protect and to serve \ntheir fellow citizens. They selflessly respond to dangerous situations \nand often must diffuse highly emotional circumstances. And judges, for \ntheir part, are impartial umpires of the law. We know that they cannot \nhelp but disappoint people in their line of work because, in \nlitigation, there is normally a winning side and a losing one. But \njudges, witnesses, courthouse personnel and law enforcement must not \nface threats and violence for doing nothing more than simply carrying \nout their duties.\n  The protection of the men and women who compose our judicial system \nand serve the public in law enforcement are essential to the proper \nadministration of justice in our country. This bill takes steps toward \nproviding additional protections to these dedicated public servants.\n  First, it increases the punishments, including providing mandatory \nminimums, against those who retaliate against judges, police officers, \nor their family members, on account of the performance of their duties. \nA high-ranking law enforcement official recently told me that detention \nequals deterrence. What he meant was that those who know that they will \nface significant incarceration think twice about committing criminal \nacts. I agree with him, and we should carry out that idea in this \nlegislation.\n  Importantly, this bill curbs frivolous lawsuits against police \nofficers and streamlines the appellate process for those murderers who \nreceive the death penalty for murdering a judge or a police officer.\n  It is good policy to place reasonable limits on lawsuits involving \npolice officers by limiting claims to actual damages--unless the \ndefendant purposefully inflicted serious bodily injury on\n\n[[Page S8850]]\n\nthe plaintiff, in which case the plaintiff may seek an additional \n$250,000 in damages. And returning the attorney's fees provisions in \nthese cases to the traditional attorney's fees responsibility by \nrequiring each party to bear this burden is likewise good policy.\n  Placing time constraints on habeas corpus petitions, including the \ntime to file the petitions, the time to hold an evidentiary hearing on \nthe petition, and the time to rule on a petition when the murder of a \npolice officer is involved, is also good policy. This will eliminate \nextensive and unnecessary delays for the families of victims that occur \nwhen those who have victimized their loved ones find ways to delay the \nimposition of justice.\n  Finally, this bill makes technical fixes to the law enforcement \nconcealed carry legislation passed in the 108th Congress. Some \ntechnical barriers prevent retired officers from carrying a firearm to \ndefend themselves and their loved ones. These technical corrections \nwill facilitate the full implementation of that provision as Congress \noriginally intended.\n  Mr. President, the Court and Law Enforcement Protection Act of 2006 \nis an important piece of legislation. It targets those people who would \nstand in the way of the proper, fair, and efficient administration of \njustice. The men and women of law enforcement and the judiciary work \nhard to carry out the duties entrusted to them by their State and the \nFederal Constitution, and they deserve our support. This bill is a \nsignificant step In providing them that much needed support. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues on this issue and encourage their \nsupport of this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Stevens, Mr. \n  Jeffords, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \nDodd, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Lott, Mr. Biden, Mrs. Clinton, \nMr. Reid, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Reed, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Conrad, Mrs. Dole, \n                    Mr. Domenici, and Mr. Roberts):\n\n  S. 3837. A bill to authorize the establishment of the Henry Kuualoha \nGiugni Kupuna Memorial Archives at the University of Hawaii; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise with my dear friend, the Senior \nSenator from Hawaii, Dan Inouye, and several of our colleagues from \nboth sides of the aisle, to introduce a bill to pay tribute to one of \nthis body's most loyal servants. The Henry Kuualoha Giugni Kupuna \nMemorial Archives bill honors Henry K. Giugni, our former Sergeant-at-\nArms of the U.S. Senate, through the establishment of a Native Hawaiian \ncultural and historical digital archives. These archives will enable \nthe sharing and perpetuation of the unique culture, collective memory, \nand history of the people Henry K. Giugni so dearly loved.\n  As many of my colleagues are aware, Henry K. Giugni was a man full of \nlife and loyalty who served our country with distinction. He enlisted \nin the U.S. Army at the age of 16 after the attack on Pearl Harbor. \nDuring World War II he served in combat at the battle of Guadalcanal. \nFollowing World War II, he continued to serve the State of Hawaii and \nour nation by working as a police officer and firefighter. After nearly \na decade of service with Senator Inouye in the Hawaii territorial \nlegislature, he came to Washington, DC, as the senior senator's Senior \nExecutive Assistant and then Chief of Staff for more than 20 years. Mr. \nGiugni was appointed Sergeant-at-Arms of the United States Senate in \n1987.\n  Henry K. Giugni also sought to tear down barriers in society. In 1965 \nit was Mr. Giugni who represented Senator Inouye's office, thus the \npeople of Hawaii, in the famous 1965 Selma to Montgomery civil rights \nmarch led by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. As Senator Inouye's Chief of \nStaff, Mr. Giugni served as a vital link between the Senator's office \nand minority groups. In 1987 he was the first person of color and the \nfirst Native Hawaiian to be appointed Sergeant-at-Arms of the United \nStates Senate. In this influential position, he sought out capable \nminorities and women for promotion to ensure that our workforce \nreflects America. He appointed the first minority, an African American, \nto lead the Service Department, and was the first to assign women to \nthe Capitol Police plainclothes unit. Being particularly concerned \nabout people with disabilities, Henry K. Giugni enacted a major \nexpansion of the Special Services Office, which now conducts tours of \nthe U.S. Capitol for the blind, deaf, and wheelchair-bound, and \npublishes Senate maps and documents in Braille.\n  In his capacity as Sergeant-at-Arms, Mr. Giugni was the chief law \nenforcement officer of the U.S. Senate and an able manager of a \nmajority of the Senate's support services. He oversaw a budget of \nnearly $120 million and approximately 2,000 employees. As Sergeant-at-\nArms, Mr. Giugni had the opportunity to preside over the inauguration \nof President George H.W. Bush as well as escort numerous dignitaries, \nincluding Nelson Mandela, Margaret Thatcher, and Vaclav Havel when they \nvisited the U.S. Capitol.\n  Establishing the Henry Kuualoha Giugni Memorial Archives would be a \npoignant and appropriate way to honor our loyal friend, colleague, and \nfellow American. Please allow me to explain. In Henry's passing there \nis a fitting analogy that can be made for the need of establishing \nthese archives. Henry lived a life full of rich experiences and along \nthe way he accumulated a wealth of wisdom. His memory and spirit live \non but it is essential to perpetuate his wisdom and experiences so that \nwhat he learned and accomplished will not be lost to future \ngenerations. This is the primary impetus behind creating these \narchives. For various reasons there is a dearth of physical archives, \nmuseums, or libraries that are devoted to preserving and perpetuating \nthe history, culture, achievements and collective narratives of \nindigenous peoples, including Native Hawaiians. As one generation \npasses, a wealth of traditional knowledge may be lost forever. \nEstablishing these archives to perpetuate the traditional knowledge of \nindigenous peoples such as Henry will ensure that future generations of \npeople have access to that knowledge and, in some sense, are able to \nlearn from the original sources themselves.\n  The development of the Internet in managing knowledge in electronic \nformat has enabled the most pervasive storing and sharing of \ninformation the world has ever seen. An electronic, digital archives \nwould facilitate the sharing, preservation and perpetuation of the \nunique Native Hawaiian culture, language, tradition and history. These \narchives will be a source of enduring knowledge, accessible to all, and \nwill contribute to the cultural, social and economic advancement of \nNative Hawaiians and the State of Hawaii. It will help to ensure that \nthe children of today and tomorrow will not be deprived of the rich \nculture, history and collective knowledge of Native Hawaiians. These \narchives will help to guarantee that the experiences, wisdom and \nknowledge of kupuna, or grandfathers and grandmothers such as Henry K. \nGiugni, will not be lost to future generations.\n  The first section of the Henry Kuualoha Giugni Memorial Archives bill \nauthorizes a grant awarded to the University of Hawaii's Academy for \nCreative Media for the establishment, maintenance and update of the \narchives which are to be located at the University of Hawaii. These \nfunds shall be used to enable a statewide archival effort which will \ninclude the acquisition of a secure, web-accessible repository that \nwill house significant Native Hawaiian historical and cultural \ninformation. This information may include oral histories, collective \nnarratives, photographs, video files, journals, creative works and even \ndocumentation of practices and customs such as hula and music. The \nfunds will enable this important effort by assisting in the purchasing \nof equipment, hiring of personnel, creating space for the collection \nand transfer of media, housing the archives, and creating this in-depth \ndatabase.\n  The second section of this bill authorizes the use of these grant \nfunds for several different educational activities, many of which are \nintended to magnify the effect and resourcefulness of these archives \nand benefit the student populations who will likely access the archives \nthe most. This includes the development of educational materials from \nthe content of the archives that can be used in educating indigenous \nstudents such as Native Hawaiians, Alaska Natives, and Native American \nIndians. These materials are\n\n[[Page S8851]]\n\nmeant to enhance the education of all students, even students from non-\nnative backgrounds. This also includes developing outreach initiatives \nto introduce the archives to elementary and secondary schools as well \nas enabling schools to access the archives through obtaining computer \nequipment.\n  Grant funds can also be used to enable access to a college education \nto students who otherwise cannot independently afford such an education \nthrough scholarship awards. Additionally, funds can be used to address \nthe problem of cultural incongruence in teaching, an issue that impedes \neffective learning in our Nation's classrooms. Such a lack of \ncongruence exists in a wide range of situations, from rural and \nunderserved communities in remote areas to well-populated urban \ncenters, from my state of Hawaii to areas on the Eastern seaboard. The \ndynamic I am describing exists along lines of race and ethnicity, \nsocioeconomic strata, age, and many other vectors, which can muddy the \neffective transmission of knowledge. Many of us, especially those from \nrural, indigenous, or ethnic minority backgrounds including Henry \nGiugni, have experienced this problem as we have worked our way through \nthe education system. This bill also seeks to improve student \nachievement by addressing cultural incongruence between teachers and \nthe student population by providing professional development training \nto teachers to enable them to teach in a culturally congruent way.\n  Finally, as financial illiteracy is a growing problem especially \namong college age youth who are exposed to a variety of financial \nproducts, funds can be used to increase the economic and financial \nliteracy of college students through the propagation of proven best \npractices that have resulted in positive behavioral change in regards \nto improved debt and credit management and economic decision making. \nSuch activities can help to ensure that students stay in school, \ngraduate in a better financial position, and remain disciplined in \neffectively managing their finances throughout their working and \nretirement years.\n  Henry K. Giugni served amongst us with distinction and honor. I am \nvery grateful to have known him. I encourage all of my colleagues to \nperpetuate his memory by supporting the Henry Kuualoha Giugni Memorial \nArchives bill. These archives are the most fitting way we can honor and \nremember our friend and dear public servant, Henry Kuualoha Giugni.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Henry Kuualoha \nGiugni Kupuna Memorial Archives Bill.\n  Henry Giugni was my dear friend. He was an important part of my life \nfor nearly half a century. He tirelessly and proudly served the people \nof Hawaii as my chief of staff. After leaving my office, he eagerly and \nenthusiastically dedicated himself to serving the Senate and the \ncitizens of the United States as the Senate's 30th Sergeant-at-Arms.\n  In the days following his passing on November 3, 2005, I was deeply \ntouched by the hundreds of people who reached out to me, and shared, \nthrough conversations and letters, their memories of Henry. The stories \nwere poignant. They were filled with love and affection for a bear of a \nman who--while he could be gruff and outrageous at times--could never \ncamouflage his gentle soul and his willingness to help others, \nespecially those who were less fortunate or who were just beginning \ntheir careers. The shared memories of Henry revealed that he enriched \nlives, served as an inspiration, and gave hope.\n  Similarly, this bill, which bears Henry's name, will not only honor \nhim, but more importantly will serve the people of Hawaii, especially \nthe descendants of the islands' first settlers. It will also help \nHawaii's unique native traditions and culture to flourish. By \nestablishing a digital memorial archive at the University of Hawaii's \nAcademy for Creative Media, this bill will enrich the lives of the \npeople of Hawaii and those who live beyond Hawaii's shores. The digital \narchive will be a 21st-century way of inspiring and giving hope by \npreserving the invaluable lessons and insights from the collective \nmemory and history of Native Hawaiians.\n  During the years that Henry was a young boy attending school, the \nhistory of Native Hawaiians and Hawaii was rarely--if ever--taught in \nHawaii. It was only relatively recently that Hawaiian history became an \nessential part of the curriculum of Hawaii's schools. Henry was proud \nthat he was part-Hawaiian, and he was proud that someone like him, from \nhumble beginnings, could find success in Washington, in an environment \nvastly different from his roots in Hawaii. While he became an \nacquaintance of presidents and kings, his heart was always with the \nnative people of Hawaii, who are still struggling for their moment in \nthe sun.\n  In addition to creating a digital archive and preserving the \ntraditions and culture of Native Hawaiians, this legislation will \nsupport initiatives to develop Web-based media projects from the \narchive to create educational materials that can be used to enhance the \neducation of indigenous students. It also can serve to inspire higher \neducational achievement by indigenous students by sharing with them the \nstories and histories of accomplished individuals with indigenous \nbackgrounds, such as Henry.\n  So although Henry is no longer with us, his mentoring and sharing \nspirit will live on through the digital archive created by this bill. \nThrough the archive, Henry will always be the embodiment of the \nkupuna--the respected elder who has much wisdom and insight to share.\n  My colleagues, please join me in supporting the Henry Kuualoha Giugni \nKupuna Memorial Archives Bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mrs. Lincoln):\n  S. 3838. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor S corporation reform, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Lincoln, I rise today to introduce the S Corporation \nReform Act of 2006.\n  The bill we are introducing today is a continuation of a bipartisan \neffort that began in the Senate over a decade ago when former Senators \nPryor and Danforth, me and six other Senators, introduced the S \nCorporation Reform Act of 1993. We recognized then, as we do today, \nthat S corporations are a vital and growing part of our economy and \nthat our tax law should reflect the importance of these entities and \nprovide tax rules that allow S corporations to grow and compete with a \nminimum of complexity and a maximum of flexibility.\n  According to the latest figures available from the Small Business \nAdministration, there were approximately 3.1 million S corporations in \nthe United States in 2002 with a total of $3.9 trillion in revenue. \nThere were about a half million S corporations in 1980, so the growth \nof these entities has been striking. Surprisingly, the growth of S \ncorporations has continued even after the advent of the Limited \nLiability Company, LLC, which offers many of the same benefits, but \nmore flexibility, as S corporations. In fact, S corporations now \noutnumber both C corporations and partnerships. These are predominantly \nsmall businesses in the retail and service sectors. In my home State of \nUtah, over half the corporations have elected subchapter S treatment.\n  Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code was enacted in 1958 to help \nremove tax considerations from small business owners' decisions to \nincorporate. This elective tax treatment has been helpful to millions \nof small businesses over the years, particularly to those just starting \nout. Subchapter S provides entrepreneurs the advantage of corporate \nprotection from liability along with the single level of tax enjoyed by \npartnerships and limited liability companies.\n  However, Subchapter S in its current state contains a variety of \nlimitations, restrictions, and pitfalls for the unwary. Even though \nsome very important improvements have been made over the years, \nincluding many first introduced in the 1993 S Corporation Reform Act I \nmentioned earlier, more needs to be done to bring the tax treatment of \nthese important businesses into the 21st century. The two biggest \nconstraints that small businesses face are difficulties in getting \naccess to capital and the tax burden. The bill we are\n\n[[Page S8852]]\n\nintroducing today addresses both of these vital issues.\n  Small businesses create two-thirds of all new jobs in the economy and \naccount for roughly half of the overall employment in the country. \nThroughout the 1990s small businesses accounted for sixty to eighty \npercent of all new jobs. They are especially important in industries \nwhere technological innovation is important. According to the \nCongressional Research Service, small firms account for nearly forty \npercent of all scientists, engineers, and computer specialists working \nin the private sector.\n  During the most recent downturn of 2001-2002, when the state of Utah \nlost jobs, small businesses actually created jobs and helped soften the \nblow for many Utahns. Today, as our economy is booming, small \nbusinesses continue to generate the bulk of new jobs.\n  In rural America, the role of small enterprises is even more \nimportant. Small businesses account for 90 percent of all rural \nestablishments. In 1998, small companies employed 60 percent of rural \nworkers and provided half of rural payrolls.\n  Perhaps the biggest challenge facing many American businesses, but \nespecially smaller ones, is attracting adequate capital. Unfortunately, \nsubchapter S is currently a hindrance, rather than a help, for many \ncorporations facing this challenge. For example, current law allows for \nonly one class of stock for S corporations. Further, S corporations are \nnot currently allowed to issue convertible debt, nor are they allowed \nto have a nonresident alien as a shareholder.\n  Several of the provisions of the S Corporation Reform Act of 2006 are \ndesigned to alleviate these restrictions on S corporations and help \nthem attract capital. With these changes, S corporations will be more \ncompetitive with other small enterprises doing business as partnerships \nor limited liability companies that do not face such barriers.\n  Even though electing subchapter S currently offers significant tax \nrelief to a small corporation by eliminating the corporate level of \ntaxation, S corporations still face some significant tax burdens and a \nmyriad of potential pitfalls and tax traps for the unwary. Some of \nthese impediments exist in the requirements of elective S corporation \nstatus, and others are in the rules governing the day-to-day operations \nof the entities. In either case, these provisions can stifle growth and \nimpede job creation.\n  Most of the provisions in our bill aim to eliminate these barriers \nand make it easier for companies to elect subchapter S and to operate \nin this status once the election is made.\n  The Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 made many important \nchanges to subchapter S. One of the most significant was to allow, for \nthe first time, small banks to elect to be S corporations. This opened \nthe door for many small community banks to become more competitive with \nother financial institutions operating in towns and neighborhoods \nthroughout the country. The availability of Subchapter S has been a \npositive development in increasing the profitability and \ncompetitiveness of many community banks. Some 2,300 banks have chosen \nto be S corporations, representing 25 percent of all banks. However, \nsome of the operating rules under subchapter S remain unduly \ninflexible, complex, and harsh on banks.\n  The bill we introduce today attempts to address many of these \nchallenges by clarifying and relaxing some of the operational rules \nthat apply to S corporations. These changes are designed to make it \nsignificantly easier for community banks to take advantage of the \nbenefits of subchapter S. In my opinion, businesses should be allowed \nto focus on meeting their customers' needs and maximizing their \nshareholders' profits, and not preoccupied with conforming to Byzantine \ngovernment rules.\n  While the corporate structure of an S corporation would not generally \nmake sense for larger companies, the tax structure applied to S \ncorporations is quite sensible and can serve as a model for other \ncompanies. Economists hail the single level of taxation of profits in \nthe S corporation law as a much more efficient approach, and something \nthat would be desirable for all enterprises.\n\n  The S Corporation Reform Act of 2006 enjoys the support of a broad \nrange of associations and trade groups, many of which have worked with \nus in crafting the bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to take a close look at this bill, and to \nsupport it. Thousands of small and growing businesses in every state \nwill benefit from the improvements included in the bill. Its enactment \nwill lead to an increased ability of these enterprises to attract \ncapital and create new jobs.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and section-by-\nsection explanation of the bill be printed in the Record.\n\n                                S. 3838\n\n  There being no objection, the text was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

To assure collection of the appropriate amount \n     of tax, the Act requires the S corporation to withhold and \n     pay a tax on effectively-connected income allocable to its \n     nonresident alien shareholders. The provision enhances an S \n     corporation's ability to expand into international markets \n     and expands an S corporation's access to capital.\n\n\n   section 102. expansion of S corporation eligible shareholders to \n                              include iras\n\n       The Act permits Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) to \n     hold stock in an S corporation. Currently this is permitted \n     only for S corporations that are banks.\n\n TITLE II--QUALIFICATION AND ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS OF S CORPORATIONS\n\n\n           section 201. issuance of preferred stock permitted\n\n       The Act would permit S corporations to issue qualified \n     preferred stock (``QPS''). QPS generally would be stock that \n     (I) is not entitled to vote, (ii) is limited and preferred as \n     to dividends and does not participate in corporate growth to \n     any significant extent, and (iii) has redemption and \n     liquidation rights which do not exceed the issue price of \n     such stock (except for a reasonable redemption or liquidation \n     premium). Stock would not fail to be treated as QPS merely \n     because it is convertible into other stock. This provision \n     increases access to capital from investors who insist on \n     having a preferential return and facilitates family \n     succession by permitting the older generation of shareholders \n     to relinquish control of the corporation but maintain an \n     equity interest.\n\n\n     section 202. safe harbor expanded to include convertible debt\n\n       The Act permits S corporations to issue debt that may be \n     converted into stock of the corporation provided that the \n     terms of the debt are substantially the same as the terms \n     that could have been obtained from an unrelated party. The \n     Act also expands the current law safe-harbor debt provision \n     to permit nonresident alien individuals as creditors. The \n     provision facilitates the raising of investment capital.\n\n\n    section 203. repeal of excessive passive investment income as a \n                           termination event\n\n       The Act would repeal the rule that an S corporation would \n     lose its S corporation status if it has excess passive income \n     for three consecutive years. A corporate-level ``sting'' (or \n     double) tax would still apply, as modified\n\n[[Page S8856]]\n\n     in Sections 204 and 604 below, to excess passive income.\n\n\n           section 204. modifications to passive income rules\n\n       The Act would increase the threshold for taxing excess \n     passive income from 25 percent to 60 percent (consistent with \n     a Joint Tax Committee recommendation on simplification \n     measures). In addition, the Act removes gains from the sales \n     or exchanges of stock or securities from the definition of \n     passive investment income for purposes of the sting tax.\n\n\n  section 205. adjustment to basis of S corporation stock for certain \n                        charitable contributions\n\n       Current rules discourage charitable gifts of appreciated \n     property by S corporations. The Act would remedy this problem \n     by providing for an increase in the basis of shareholders' \n     stock in an amount equal to the excess of the value of the \n     contributed property over the basis of the property \n     contributed. This provision conforms the S corporation rules \n     to those applicable to charitable contributions by \n     partnerships.\n\n           TITLE III--TREATMENT OF S CORPORATION SHAREHOLDERS\n\n\n            section 301. treatment of losses to shareholders\n\n       In the case of a liquidation of an S corporation, current \n     law can result in double taxation because of a mismatch of \n     ordinary income (realized at the corporate level and passed \n     through to the shareholder) and a capital loss (recognized at \n     the shareholder level on the liquidating distribution). \n     Although careful tax planning can avoid this result, many S \n     corporations do not have the benefit of sophisticated tax \n     advice. The Act eliminates this potential trap by providing \n     that any portion of any loss recognized by an S corporation \n     shareholder on amounts received by the shareholder in a \n     distribution in complete liquidation of the S corporation \n     would be treated as an ordinary loss to the extent of the \n     shareholder's basis in the S corporation stock.\n\n\nsection 302. deductibility of interest expense incurred by an electing \n       small business trust (esbt) to acquire s corporation stock\n\n       The Act provides that interest expense incurred by an ESBT \n     to acquire S corporation stock is deductible by the S portion \n     of the trust. Current regulations provide that interest \n     expense incurred by an ESBT to acquire stock in an S \n     corporation is allocable to the S portion of the trust, but \n     is not deductible. This result is contrary to the treatment \n     of other taxpayers, who are entitled to deduct interest \n     incurred to acquire an interest in a pass through entity. \n     Further, Congress never intended to place ESBTs at a \n     disadvantage relative to other taxpayers.\n\n\n            section 303. back-to-back loans as indebtedness\n\n       This provision would remove a significant trap for unwary \n     shareholders of unsophisticated S corporations. The amount of \n     a shareholder's pro rata share of corporate losses that may \n     be taken into account are currently limited to the sum of (1) \n     the basis in the stock, plus (2) the basis of any shareholder \n     loans to the S corporation. The debt must run directly to the \n     shareholder for the shareholder to receive basis for this \n     purpose; the creditor may not be a person related to the \n     shareholder. It is not uncommon for the shareholders of an S \n     corporation to own related entities. Often times, loans are \n     made among these related entities. Under current law, it is \n     extremely difficult for the shareholders of an S corporation \n     to restructure these loans in order to create basis in the S \n     corporation against which losses of the S corporation may be \n     claimed. The ability to create loan basis through the \n     restructuring of related party loans has been the subject of \n     numerous court cases and is an area of much uncertainty. The \n     Act will protect these taxpayers from an unfair and \n     unwarranted fate by providing that true indebtedness from an \n     S corporation to a shareholder (funds for which the \n     shareholder is truly obligated to either repay or for which \n     he/she experiences a true economic outlay) increases \n     shareholder debt basis, irrespective of the original source \n     of the funds to the corporation.\n\n       TITLE IV--EXPANSION OF S CORPORATION ELIGIBILITY FOR BANKS\n\n\n          section 401. treatment of qualifying director shares\n\n       The Act clarifies that qualifying director shares of a bank \n     are not to be treated as a second class of stock. Instead, \n     the qualifying director shares are treated as a liability of \n     the bank and no gain or loss from the S corporation will be \n     allocated to these qualifying director shares. The provision \n     clarifies the law and removes a significant obstacle unique \n     among banks contemplating an S corporation election.\n\n\n              section 402. recapture of bad debt reserves\n\n       The Act permits bank S corporations to recapture up to 100 \n     percent of their bad debt reserves on their first S \n     corporation tax return and/or their last C corporation income \n     tax return prior to the effective date of the S election. \n     Under current law, banks that convert to S corporation status \n     must change from the reserve method of accounting for bad \n     debts to the specific charge-off method. The differential \n     must often be ``recaptured'' into income and is treated as \n     built-in gain subject to tax at both the shareholder and the \n     corporate level. The Act allows banks to accelerate the \n     recapture of bad debt reserves to their last C corporation \n     tax year. The corporate level tax would still be paid on the \n     recapture income, but the recapture would no longer trigger a \n     tax for the bank's shareholders.\n\n              TITLE V--QUALIFIED SUBCHAPTER S SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\n     section 501. treatment of the sale of interest in a qualified \n                     subchapter s subsidiary (qsub)\n\n       The Act treats the disposition of QSub stock as a sale of \n     the undivided interest in the QSub's assets based on the \n     underlying percentage of stock transferred followed by a \n     deemed contribution by the S corporation and the acquiring \n     party in a nontaxable transaction. Under current law, an S \n     corporation may be required to recognize 100 percent of the \n     gain inherent in a QSub's assets if it sells as little as 21 \n     percent of the QSub's stock. IRS regulations suggest this \n     result can be avoided by merging the QSub into a single \n     member LLC prior to the sale, then selling an interest in the \n     LLC (as opposed to stock in the QSub). The Act achieves this \n     result without any unnecessary merger and thus removes a trap \n     for the unwary.\n\n                    TITLE VI--ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS\n\n\n section 601. elimination of all earnings and profits attributable to \n                             pre-1983 years\n\n       The Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 eliminated \n     certain pre-1983 earnings and profits of S corporations that \n     had S corporation status for their first tax year beginning \n     after December 31, 1996. The provision should apply to all S \n     corporations with pre-1983 S earnings and profits without \n     regard to when they elect S status. There seems to be no \n     policy reason why the elimination was restricted to \n     corporations with an S election in effect for their first \n     taxable year beginning after December 31, 1996.\n\n\n           section 602. the repeal of the lifo recapture tax\n\n       Often the most significant hurdle faced by a corporation \n     desiring to elect S corporation status is the LIFO recapture \n     tax. In many cases, this tax makes it cost-prohibitive for a \n     corporation to elect S status. The LIFO recapture tax was \n     enacted in 1987 in response to concerns that a taxpayer using \n     the LIFO method of accounting, upon conversion to S \n     corporation status, could avoid a corporate-level tax on LIFO \n     layers because the S corporation would only be subject to a \n     corporate-level tax on LIFO layers for the first 10 years \n     after conversion instead of indefinitely, as in the case of a \n     C corporation.\n       These concerns are unfounded. Most corporations, whether S \n     or C, hold base LIFO layers far longer than the 10-year \n     recognition period (often holding them indefinitely). There \n     is no data to suggest that S corporations deplete such layers \n     any faster than their C corporation counterparts (for \n     example, in year 11 of the S election). Accordingly, the \n     making of an S election should not be grounds for a tax on \n     base LIFO layers. The Act would repeal this unwarranted \n     government windfall and properly put S corporations on par \n     with C corporations, which rarely pay tax on the old LIFO \n     layers.\n\n\n      section 603. expansion of post-termination transition period\n\n       The Act expands the post-termination transition period \n     (PTTP) to include the filing of an amended return for an S \n     year. The granting of the 120-day PTTP should be based on the \n     recognition that legitimate changes to an original return can \n     be made in several ways including through audit or through \n     the filing of a taxpayer-initiated amended return.\n\n\n    section 604. reduction in tax rate on excess net passive income\n\n       The Act would bring the punitive nature of the tax on \n     excess passive income closer in form and substance to the \n     personal holding company (PHC) rules by reducing the tax rate \n     on passive investment income to 15 percent as was recently \n     done for PHCs by Section 302(e) of the Jobs and Growth Tax \n     Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003.\n\n\n      section 605. increase in cap on qualified small issue bonds\n\n       The act would change the maximum size of a bond issuance \n     that would qualify as a ``small issue'' for S corporation \n     banks to $10 million, and $30 million. It also indexes this \n     number for inflation.\n\n\n       section 606. reduced recognition period for built-in gains\n\n       The effective recognition period for built-in gains of S \n     corporations is reduced from ten years to seven years.\n\n\n               section 607. special rules of application\n\n       If a refund or tax credit resulting from the application of \n     this act is prevented in the first year of its enactment, it \n     may still be taken as long as it is claimed within the year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD:\n  S. 3839.

Res. 548\n\n       Whereas, on June 12, 2000, the Government of Lebanon \n     advised the United Nations that it would consider deploying \n     its armed forces throughout southern Lebanon following \n     confirmation by the United Nations Secretary-General that the \n     Government of Israel had fully withdrawn its armed forces \n     from that country in accordance with United Nations Security \n     Council Resolution 425 (1978);\n       Whereas, on June 16, 2000, the United Nations Security \n     Council endorsed the Secretary-General's conclusion that \n     Israel had withdrawn all of its forces from Lebanon in \n     accordance with United Nations Security Council Resolution \n     425;\n       Whereas, notwithstanding the reservations of both Israel \n     and Lebanon regarding the final line determining what \n     constitutes an Israeli withdrawal in accordance with United \n     Nations Security Council Resolution 425, the governments of \n     both countries confirmed that establishing the identifying \n     line was the sole responsibility of the United Nations, and \n     that they would respect the line that the United Nations \n     identified;\n       Whereas Hezbollah remains an armed terrorist presence in \n     Lebanon and continues to receive material and political \n     support from the Governments of Syria and Iran;\n       Whereas, as affirmed in Public Law 108-175, the Governments \n     of Syria and Iran have significant influence over Hezbollah;\n       Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 1559 \n     (2004) calls for the withdrawal of all foreign forces and the \n     dismantlement of all independent militias in Lebanon;\n       Whereas the international community has provided \n     insufficient encouragement and resources to the Government of \n     Lebanon to enable the Government to comply with the relevant \n     provisions of United Nations Security Council Resolution \n     1559;\n       Whereas Hezbollah launched an unprovoked attack against \n     Israel on July 12, 2006, killing 7 Israeli soldiers and \n     taking 2 soldiers hostage, its fifth provocative act against \n     Israel since the summer of 2005;\n       Whereas the Government of Israel, as reaffirmed in S. Res. \n     534, has the right to defend itself and to take appropriate \n     action to deter aggression by terrorist groups and their \n     state sponsors;\n       Whereas fighting between Israel and Hezbollah to date has \n     caused significant damage to Lebanon's and Israel's \n     infrastructures that will necessitate the expenditure of \n     significant sums to rebuild;\n       Whereas more than 400 citizens of Israel and Lebanon have \n     already lost their lives in the ongoing conflict;\n       Whereas over 14,000 United States citizens have been \n     evacuated from Lebanon at a cost of over $60,000,000;\n       Whereas more than 1,000,000 Israelis living in northern \n     Israel are under threat of Hezbollah rockets;\n       Whereas more than 700,000 Lebanese civilians have been \n     displaced by the fighting, and the United Nations Emergency \n     Relief Coordinator is seeking more than $170,000,000 in \n     donations from international donors to pay for food, \n     medicine, water, and sanitation services over the next 3 \n     months;\n       Whereas the United States Government has pledged \n     $30,000,000 in short-term humanitarian assistance to address \n     the humanitarian crisis in Lebanon;\n       Whereas the fragile democracy of Lebanon is in jeopardy of \n     collapsing without significant international support to \n     address the humanitarian crisis in the country and to \n     strengthen the capacity of the army and security forces of \n     the Government of Lebanon to gain effective control of all \n     territory in Lebanon; and\n       Whereas continued fighting between Hezbollah and Israel is \n     a threat to the peace and security of the peoples of Israel \n     and Lebanon:\n       Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the Governments of Syria and Iran should--\n       (A) end all material and logistical support for Hezbollah, \n     including attempts to replenish Hezbollah's supply of \n     weapons; and\n       (B) use their significant influence over Hexbollah to \n     disarm the group and release all kidnapped prisoners;\n       (2) the United States Government and the international \n     community must work urgently with the Governments of Israel \n     and Lebanon--\n       (A) to attain a cessation in the hostilities between \n     Hezbollah and Israel based on--\n       (i) effectuating the safe return of Israeli soldiers held \n     in Lebanon;\n       (ii) the disarmament of Hezbollah, the removal of all \n     Hezbollah forces from southern Lebanon, and the replacement \n     of those forces with army and security forces of the \n     Government of Lebanon; and\n       (iii) reaching an agreement to fully implement United \n     Nations Security Council Resolution 1559 and to create and \n     deploy an international stabilization force with a clear \n     mandate to enforce a permanent ceasefire;\n       (B) to organize an international donors conference to \n     solicit and ensure the provision of international resources \n     for the reconstruction of roads, bridges, hospitals, \n     electrical and communications systems, and other civilian \n     infrastructure damaged or destroyed in Lebanon during the \n     hostilities;\n       (C) to remain engaged to promote sustainable peace and \n     security for Israel and Lebanon and the greater Middle East; \n     and\n       (D) to assist the Government of Lebanon on its path to \n     democracy by promoting necessary internal political reforms; \n     and\n       (3) the territorial integrity, sovereignty, unity, and \n     political independence of Lebanon should be strongly \n     supported.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I send to the desk a resolution about the \ncurrent outbreak of violence in Israel and Lebanon. I do so for myself, \nSenators Levin, Sununu, Stabenow, Chafee, and Kennedy. I know that all \nof us here want to see a peaceful conclusion to the current situation--\npeace for Israelis and for Lebanese. The tragic deaths of 57 Lebanese \ncivilians--37 of them children--in the village of Qana on Sunday \nhighlight the urgency for doing so.\n  This resolution would express the sense of the Senate that the United\n\n[[Page S8858]]\n\nStates and international community must work urgently with the \nGovernments of Israel and Lebanon to achieve the following six goals: \nattaining a cessation in the hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel; \neffectuating the safe return of Israeli soldiers held in Lebanon; \ndisarming Hezbollah, removing Hezbollah forces from southern Lebanon, \nand replacing those forces with Lebanese army and security forces; \nreaching agreement to create and deploy an international stabilization \nforce with a robust mandate to enforce a permanent ceasefire and to \nfully implement United Nations Security Council Resolution 1559; \norganizing an international donors conference to solicit and ensure the \nprovision of international resources for the reconstruction of Lebanon; \nand ensuring that all parties remain engaged to promote peace and \nsecurity for Israel and Lebanon and the greater Middle East.\n  I believe that it is important to mention a few points up front. As \nmy colleagues know, the current situation began when two Israeli \nsoldiers were kidnapped by Hezbollah, a terrorist organization that is \nbased in Lebanon but supported by Syria and Iran.\n  These soldiers were kidnapped from Israeli soil, and during those \nkidnapping operations, innocent Israelis were killed, and some northern \nIsraeli cities were shelled with rockets.\n  These facts are very important to remember as we consider the current \nsituation because despite any other frustrations that some people might \nhave with the derailed Israeli-Palestinian peace process, it wasn't \nIsraeli actions which started the cycle of the current bloody situation \nin which more than 400 Israelis and Lebanese have died.\n  I would also say unequivocally that I believe that Israel is \ncurrently acting in self-defense as a response to attacks on its soil \nand the kidnapping of its citizens. No country that experienced similar \nattacks would do anything less--certainly not the United States. And I \nsupport fully Israel's right to defend its borders and its citizens.\n  All violent confrontations, however, must eventually come to an end--\nincluding this one. I think what we are all hoping--Americans, \nIsraelis, Lebanese--is that a resolution of this flare-up will come \nquickly and without any additional loss of innocent civilians in \nLebanon or Israel, so that a climate conducive to tackling the many \ncomplex problems confronting the region can exist. Clearly, that \nclimate does not exist at the moment while fighting is ongoing.\n  However, long-term peace necessitates certain actions. First, I \nbelieve that an international stabilization force with real teeth to \nact against Hezbollah militia and any other terrorist elements will \neventually need to be deployed in southern Lebanon. On this point, we \nmust learn from the failures of the current United Nations \nStabilization Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, and give any future force the \nsize and mandate to actually fulfill its mission.\n  Second, long-term peace will require full implementation of U.N. \nSecurity Council Resolution 1559, which calls on the Lebanese Army to \ndeploy to protect the southern border, as well as for the disarmament \nof Hezbollah.\n  Long-term peace will also require Israel to cease its attacks in \nLebanon, consistent with the Lebanese Government and international \ncommunity's ability and willingness to stop terrorist elements from \nlaunching attacks on Israel. I would remind my colleagues that Israel \nwithdrew voluntarily from Lebanon in 2000--a move that was recognized \nby the United Nations Secretary General and Security Council as \nfulfilling completely the terms of U.N. Security Council Resolution \n425. To that end, I doubt very much whether Israel would like to stay \nin Lebanon even one day longer than is absolutely necessary to stop the \nterror and return Israeli citizens to safety.\n  My belief in the need for a quick cessation of hostilities is rooted \nin my concern that the current violence between Israel and Hezbollah is \ngreatly strengthening the hands of Iran and Syria. This is true \nespecially with respect to Iran, which wants to divert international \nattention away from its nuclear program as well as position itself as \nthe leader of the Arab Muslim world.\n  Indeed, as the body counts rise, we are seeing the gulf between \nmoderate Arab regimes and their citizens widen dramatically. At the \nsame time, Iran's position as the main backer of Hezbollah is giving it \na newfound legitimacy in the eyes of many Arabs. It is critical that we \navoid these outcomes because current Iranian nuclear and regional \nambitions pose a threat to Israel, to moderate Arab regimes, to the \nUnited States, and to the international community alike.\n  Moreover, long-term peace will be impossible unless the international \ncommunity gets both Iran and Syria to shut off and cut off Hezbollah \nand other terrorist groups. By ``shut off,'' I mean that Iran and Syria \nmust send a clear signal to Hezbollah to stop its violent terrorist \nattacks against Israel. By ``cut off,'' I mean that these countries \nmust stop financing, supplying, and providing safe haven to terrorist \ngroups and their operatives. The international community must also send \na strong message to Iran and Syria that they need to stop preventing \nLebanon from deploying its army to disarm Hezbollah and protect the \nborder.\n  But the current situation will not begin to wind down unless, first \nand foremost, the Israeli hostages are released unharmed.\n  After that, the short-term goals should be the deployment of an \ninternational stabilization force with real teeth in the south and some \nkind of international monitoring of land, sea, and air crossings to \nensure that Hezbollah will not be rearmed by Syria and Iran.\n  The long-term goals are obviously that U.N. Security Council \nResolution 1559 is fully implemented. Full implementation of that \nresolution means, among other things, that an effective Lebanese Army \nis deployed along that country's southern border and that Hezbollah is \ndisarmed.\n  It is quite apparent that after decades of operational and financial \nsupport from Syria, and especially Iran, Hezbollah's military wing is \ncurrently too strong for the relatively weak Lebanese Government to \ndeal with. So to the extent that Israeli actions weaken Hezbollah's \ncapabilities, they also create the possibility of strengthening the \nLebanese Government's hand to reign in militias and terrorists. But \nthere might be a point of diminishing returns where Hezbollah is \nsomewhat weakened while Iran and Syria are greatly strengthened--an \noutcome that it is essential to avoid. Hopefully, the combination of \nthe current attacks against Hezbollah, a quick cessation of \nhostilities, and the immediate deployment--concurrent with the end of \nhostilities--of an international force with real teeth will make that \nthe case.\n  I realize that there are many voices in the Arab world who accuse the \nU.S. of ignoring the plight of the innocent Lebanese citizens who have \nbeen caught in the crossfire because Hezbollah militants have \nshamefully hidden themselves and their weapons among the civilian \npopulation. I do not believe that this is the case. And I think that \nthe U.S. could help to prove this by organizing an international \ndonors' conference as quickly as possible to assist the Lebanese in \nrebuilding their country.\n  As I said before, I think we in Congress all share a desire to see \npeace in the Middle East. I would hope that once all of the steps I \nhave talked about today come into place that the United States would \ntake a lead role in bringing about that peace because U.S. leadership, \nand our active and high-level engagement, have always been an essential \npart of the Middle East peace process.\n  I believe that this resolution will send a strong signal that the \nworld needs to support the Lebanese people, respect Israel's right to \ndefend itself, and be tough with Hezbollah, Iran, and Syria. These are \nthe necessary signals that we need to send in order for there to truly \nbe hope at the end of this tunnel. I urge my colleagues to support this \nresolution, and I ask that the text of the resolution be printed in the \nRecord following my remarks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/08/03/senate-section/article/S8858-1", "month": "08", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8858-S8859]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 549--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING \n                           MODERN-DAY SLAVERY\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM (for himself, Mr. Pryor, and Mrs. Dole) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n[[Page S8859]]\n\n                              S.

Res. 550\n\n       Whereas the cost of retirement continues to rise, in part, \n     because people in the United States are living longer than \n     ever before, the number of employers providing retiree health \n     coverage continues to decline, and retiree health care costs \n     continue to increase at a rapid pace;\n       Whereas Social Security remains the bedrock of retirement \n     income for the great majority of the people of the United \n     States, but was never intended by Congress to be the sole \n     source of retirement income for families;\n       Whereas recent data from the Employee Benefit Research \n     Institute indicates that, in the United States, less than \\2/\n     3\\ of workers or their spouses are currently saving for \n     retirement and that the actual amount of retirement savings \n     of workers lags far behind the amount that is realistically \n     needed to adequately fund retirement;\n       Whereas many employees have available to them through their \n     employers access to defined benefit or defined contribution \n     plans to assist them in preparing for retirement;\n       Whereas many employees may not be aware of their retirement \n     savings options and may not have focused on the importance of \n     and need for saving for their own retirement;\n       Whereas many employees may not be taking advantage of \n     workplace defined contribution plans at all or to the full \n     extent allowed by the plans or under Federal law; and\n       Whereas all workers, including public- and private-sector \n     employees, employees of tax-exempt organizations, and self-\n     employed individuals, can benefit from increased awareness of \n     the need to save for retirement and the availability of tax-\n     advantaged retirement savings vehicles to assist them in \n     saving for retirement: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates October 22 through October 28, 2006, as \n     ``National Save for Retirement Week'';\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of National Save for \n     Retirement Week, including raising public awareness about the \n     importance of adequate retirement savings and the \n     availability of employer-sponsored retirement plans; and\n       (3) calls on the Federal Government, States, localities, \n     schools, nonprofit organizations, businesses, other entities, \n     and the people of the United States to observe the week with \n     appropriate programs and activities with the goal of \n     increasing the retirement savings of all the people of the \n     United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/08/03/senate-section/article/S8859-2", "month": "08", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8859]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 551--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT ILLEGAL \n IMMIGRANTS SHOULD NOT RECEIVE SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS AND THAT THIS \n                PROHIBITION SHOULD BE STRICTLY ENFORCED\n\n  Mr. REID (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Pryor, Mrs. \nClinton, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Bingaman, Ms. Landrieu, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. \nWyden, and Mr. Johnson) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Finance:\n\n                              S.

Res. 552\n\n       Whereas countless families in the United States have a \n     family member that suffers from prostate cancer;\n       Whereas 1 in 6 men in the United States is diagnosed with \n     prostate cancer;\n       Whereas throughout the past decade, prostate cancer has \n     been the most commonly diagnosed type of cancer other than \n     skin cancer and the second most common cause of cancer-\n     related deaths among men in the United States;\n       Whereas, in 2006, more than 234,460 men in the United \n     States will be diagnosed with prostate cancer and 27,350 men \n     in the United States will die of prostate cancer according to \n     estimates from the American Cancer Society;\n       Whereas 30 percent of the new diagnoses of prostate cancer \n     occur in men under the age of 65;\n       Whereas a man in the United States turns 50 years old about \n     every 14 seconds, increasing his odds of being diagnosed with \n     prostate cancer;\n       Whereas African American males suffer from prostate cancer \n     at an incidence rate up to 65 percent higher than white males \n     and at a mortality rate double that of white males;\n       Whereas obesity is a significant predictor of the severity \n     of prostate cancer and the chance that the disease will lead \n     to death;\n\n[[Page S8860]]\n\n       Whereas if a man in the United States has 1 family member \n     diagnosed with prostate cancer, he has double the risk of \n     prostate cancer, if he has 2 family members with such \n     diagnosis, he has 5 times the risk, and if he has 3 family \n     members with such diagnosis, he has a 97 percent risk of \n     prostate cancer;\n       Whereas screening by both a digital rectal examination \n     (DRE) and a prostate specific antigen blood test (PSA) can \n     detect prostate cancer in earlier and more treatable stages \n     and reduce the rate of mortality due to the disease;\n       Whereas ongoing research promises further improvements in \n     prostate cancer prevention, early detection, and treatments; \n     and\n       Whereas educating people in the United States, including \n     health care providers, about prostate cancer and early \n     detection strategies is crucial to saving the lives of men \n     and preserving and protecting our families: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 2006 as ``National Prostate Cancer \n     Awareness Month'';\n       (2) declares that it is critical--\n       (A) to raise awareness about the importance of screening \n     methods and the treatment of prostate cancer;\n       (B) to increase research funding to be proportionate with \n     the burden of prostate cancer so that the causes of the \n     disease, improved screening and treatments, and ultimately a \n     cure may be discovered; and\n       (C) to continue to consider methods to improve both access \n     to and the quality of health care services for detecting and \n     treating prostate cancer; and\n       (3) calls on the people of the United States, interested \n     groups, and affected persons--\n       (A) to promote awareness of prostate cancer;\n       (B) to take an active role in the fight to end the \n     devastating effects of prostate cancer on individuals, their \n     families, and the economy; and\n       (C) to observe National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month \n     with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/08/03/senate-section/article/S8860-1", "month": "08", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 553--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \n CITIZENS' STAMP ADVISORY COMMITTEE SHOULD RECOMMEND TO THE POSTMASTER \nGENERAL THAT A COMMEMORATIVE POSTAGE STAMP BE ISSUED IN HONOR OF VARIAN \n                                  FRY\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs:\n\n                              S. Res. 553\n\n       Whereas Varian Mackey Fry, of Ridgewood, New Jersey, \n     embodied the spirit of heroism and demonstrated personal \n     bravery of the highest order during the Holocaust;\n       Whereas, while serving as a representative of the Emergency \n     Refugee Committee in German-occupied Vichy, France, between \n     1940 and 1941, Varian Fry helped save the lives of \n     approximately 1,500 Jews and hundreds of other anti-Nazi \n     refugees;\n       Whereas Varian Fry established a legal French relief \n     organization, the Centre Americain de Secou, as a cover for \n     his heroic but sometimes unlawful actions on behalf of the \n     refugees, including--\n       (1) securing false visas;\n       (2) planning daring escape routes through the mountains of \n     Southern France;\n       (3) illegally chartering ships to transport refugees out of \n     France; and\n       (4) exchanging funding for these operations on the black \n     market;\n       Whereas, in order to save thousands of Jews and refugees \n     who were threatened by the Nazis, Varian Fry risked his \n     personal safety, forfeited his employment as a writer with \n     the Foreign Policy Association, and was ultimately expelled \n     from France because his actions contravened the policies of \n     the Vichy French government;\n       Whereas the efforts of Varian Fry resulted in the rescue of \n     approximately 2,000 persons, including such distinguished \n     artists and intellectuals as Marc Chagall, Max Ernst, Hannah \n     Arendt, Franz Werfel, Jacques Lipchitz, Lion Feuchtwanger, \n     and Heinrich Mann;\n       Whereas, in 1967, for his heroic actions, Varian Fry \n     received the Croix de Chevalier of the French Legion of \n     Honor, 1 of the highest civilian honors of France; and\n       Whereas, in 1996, Varian Fry was named ``Righteous Among \n     the Nations'' by Yad Vashem, the Holocaust Heroes and Martyrs \n     Remembrance Authority in Jerusalem, making him the first \n     citizen of the United States to receive the highest honor \n     bestowed by Israel to individuals who worked as rescuers \n     during the Holocaust: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee should recommend to the \n     Postmaster General that a commemorative postage stamp be \n     issued in honor of Varian Fry.\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution that \nwould honor an unsung hero who saved thousands of people from death \nduring the Holocaust. The world knows the names of Oskar Schindler and \nRaoul Wallenberg, but few know the work of an American man named Varian \nFry. During the Nazi takeover of Europe in World War II, Varian Fry, a \nresident of my home State of New Jersey, selflessly risked his life to \nsave the lives of some 2,000 Jews and anti-Nazi refugees in Vichy, \nFrance. Although not Jewish himself, Fry understood the threat the \nNazis posed. Over the course of 13 months, Fry's rescue operation saved \nsome of Europe's most accomplished artists, writers, and intellectuals, \nsuch as Marc Chagall, Max Ernst, Jacques Lipschitz, Arthur Koestler, \nHannah Arendt, Franz Werfel, Lion Feuchtwanger, and Heinrich Mann.\n  Few of us can imagine the dangers that Fry encountered and the \ncourage and savvy that he needed to elude the Nazis and transport \nthousands of refugees from France to safe havens abroad. We remember \nthat Varian Fry sacrificed his job and his personal safety to help \nothers and to stand up for what was right. His work to aid both Jews \nand anti-Nazis during this perilous time in history makes him a hero \nfor people of all religions and all nations.\n  Tragically, this man whose bravery and resourcefulness changed the \nlives of so many died in relative obscurity. It was not until 1991, 24 \nyears after Fry's death, that the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council \nbecame the first American agency to officially recognize his work. It \nis now time that the country recognize his humanitarian efforts. Fry's \nhometown of Ridgewood, NJ, has honored him and dedicated a street in \nhis name, but we must do more. Sixty-six years after Varian Fry began \nhis lifesaving work in France, it is time that he earns proper \nrecognition for his noble mission. One measure we can take is to allow \nFry to join the ranks of other humanitarians and leaders who have been \nhonored with a commemorative stamp in their name. The U.S. Postal \nService has already issued a stamp honoring former U.S. Vice-Consul \nHorace Bingaman, who aided Fry in his rescue campaign. It is only \nfitting that Fry be honored with a stamp, as well.\n  Varian Fry has been honored by France and was the first American to \nbe named Righteous Among the Nations, Yad Vashem's highest honor for \nthose who helped rescue people during the Holocaust. Though Fry passed \naway many years ago, let us now show his relatives and the world that \nthis Nation--his Nation--also appreciates his sacrifice and commitment \nto saving lives at a time when the world was turning a blind eye to the \nevil of the Nazis. I thank my House colleague, Steve Rothman, for his \nwork on the companion bill to this resolution which he has already \nintroduced in the House of Representatives, and I ask that my fellow \nSenators join me in supporting this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/08/03/senate-section/article/S8860-2", "month": "08", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 554--AUTHORIZING THE PRINTING WITH ILLUSTRATIONS OF A \nDOCUMENT ENTITLED ``COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET, UNITED STATES SENATE, 32ND \n                        ANNIVERSARY, 1974-2006''\n\n  Mr. GREGG (for himself and Mr. Conrad) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, after a few more moments of gathering \npapers, in 10 or 15 minutes, we will likely be closing. We are working \non some of the final nominations and the nomination process.\n  Before we leave for the August recess, I will take a moment to \nreflect on the Senate's tremendous productivity over the last month. We \ncan all be very proud of the progress we made in this Senate over the \nlast 4 weeks. We have had several agenda items.\n  First, we worked hard to secure our homeland, to secure America's \nhomeland. Specifically, we passed, this month, both the Homeland \nSecurity appropriations bill, the spending bill, as well as the Foreign \nInvestment and National Security Act of 2006 which strengthens the \nCommittee on Foreign Investment in the United States, the so-called \nCFIUS.\n  Over the past 3 days, we made substantial progress on the Department \nof Defense appropriations bill. We were unable to finish it today, but \nwe have a glidepath to finish it within 2 days after we return from the \nrecess.\n  The Senate's productivity this past month goes way beyond securing \nAmerica's homeland. We have taken action to ensure that the homeland we \nsecure is a homeland we value that is worth securing. We have taken \naction to secure America's prosperity by passing an important bill, the \nWater Resources Development Act, an act which focuses on building that \ninfrastructure along the waterways, and by passing the Gulf of Mexico \nEnergy Security\n\n[[Page S8878]]\n\nAct, an act we passed just a couple of days ago that addresses opening \nup an area to deep sea exploration that will have more than a billion \nbarrels of oil and more than 5.5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas--a \nhuge amount of natural gas to increase our supply, enough to supply 6 \nmillion homes for 15 years.\n  In securing America's prosperity, just a few moments ago we passed \nthe pensions bill which will affect millions of Americans. In America, \nwe have a rich history of working hard, of setting ambitious goals, \nsetting that ambitious vision, and doggedly pursuing that vision, \npursuing that goal. That tradition of hard work has brought us the \nprosperity we know today.\n  In the Senate, we have the responsibility to protect that prosperity. \nWe have the responsibility to ensure that hard work is rewarded just as \nrichly tomorrow as it was yesterday or is rewarded today. Securing \nAmerica's prosperity is a noble goal toward which we made considerable \nprogress this month.\n  To enjoy that prosperity, we also have to secure America's health. \nAgain, as we look over the last 4 weeks, just this month we engaged in \na thorough debate, a thoughtful debate on the future of stem cell \nresearch, a tough issue for many.

Mr. President, after a few more moments of gathering \npapers, in 10 or 15 minutes, we will likely be closing. We are working \non some of the final nominations and the nomination process.\n  Before we leave for the August recess, I will take a moment to \nreflect on the Senate's tremendous productivity over the last month. We \ncan all be very proud of the progress we made in this Senate over the \nlast 4 weeks. We have had several agenda items.\n  First, we worked hard to secure our homeland, to secure America's \nhomeland. Specifically, we passed, this month, both the Homeland \nSecurity appropriations bill, the spending bill, as well as the Foreign \nInvestment and National Security Act of 2006 which strengthens the \nCommittee on Foreign Investment in the United States, the so-called \nCFIUS.\n  Over the past 3 days, we made substantial progress on the Department \nof Defense appropriations bill. We were unable to finish it today, but \nwe have a glidepath to finish it within 2 days after we return from the \nrecess.\n  The Senate's productivity this past month goes way beyond securing \nAmerica's homeland. We have taken action to ensure that the homeland we \nsecure is a homeland we value that is worth securing. We have taken \naction to secure America's prosperity by passing an important bill, the \nWater Resources Development Act, an act which focuses on building that \ninfrastructure along the waterways, and by passing the Gulf of Mexico \nEnergy Security\n\n[[Page S8878]]\n\nAct, an act we passed just a couple of days ago that addresses opening \nup an area to deep sea exploration that will have more than a billion \nbarrels of oil and more than 5.5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas--a \nhuge amount of natural gas to increase our supply, enough to supply 6 \nmillion homes for 15 years.\n  In securing America's prosperity, just a few moments ago we passed \nthe pensions bill which will affect millions of Americans. In America, \nwe have a rich history of working hard, of setting ambitious goals, \nsetting that ambitious vision, and doggedly pursuing that vision, \npursuing that goal. That tradition of hard work has brought us the \nprosperity we know today.\n  In the Senate, we have the responsibility to protect that prosperity. \nWe have the responsibility to ensure that hard work is rewarded just as \nrichly tomorrow as it was yesterday or is rewarded today. Securing \nAmerica's prosperity is a noble goal toward which we made considerable \nprogress this month.\n  To enjoy that prosperity, we also have to secure America's health. \nAgain, as we look over the last 4 weeks, just this month we engaged in \na thorough debate, a thoughtful debate on the future of stem cell \nresearch, a tough issue for many. We have adult stem cells, we have \nembryonic stem cells; we had to examine and struggle with that nexus of \nadvancing science and ethics and morality--a topic that is comfortable \nto many, but it is an issue all of us need to be very comfortable with \nbecause we will see that topic and topics like that which involve \nethics, medicine, and advances in science increasingly over the years \nahead.\n  At the end of that debate, we passed the Stem Cell Therapies \nEnhancement Act which supports the alternative ways of developing these \npowerful so-called pluripotential stem cells that give us so much hope \nfor the future.

Res. 548\n\n       Whereas, on June 12, 2000, the Government of Lebanon \n     advised the United Nations that it would consider deploying \n     its armed forces throughout southern Lebanon following \n     confirmation by the United Nations Secretary-General that the \n     Government of Israel had fully withdrawn its armed forces \n     from that country in accordance with United Nations Security \n     Council Resolution 425 (1978);\n       Whereas, on June 16, 2000, the United Nations Security \n     Council endorsed the Secretary-General's conclusion that \n     Israel had withdrawn all of its forces from Lebanon in \n     accordance with United Nations Security Council Resolution \n     425;\n       Whereas, notwithstanding the reservations of both Israel \n     and Lebanon regarding the final line determining what \n     constitutes an Israeli withdrawal in accordance with United \n     Nations Security Council Resolution 425, the governments of \n     both countries confirmed that establishing the identifying \n     line was the sole responsibility of the United Nations, and \n     that they would respect the line that the United Nations \n     identified;\n       Whereas Hezbollah remains an armed terrorist presence in \n     Lebanon and continues to receive material and political \n     support from the Governments of Syria and Iran;\n       Whereas, as affirmed in Public Law 108-175, the Governments \n     of Syria and Iran have significant influence over Hezbollah;\n       Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 1559 \n     (2004) calls for the withdrawal of all foreign forces and the \n     dismantlement of all independent militias in Lebanon;\n\n[[Page S8879]]\n\n       Whereas the international community has provided \n     insufficient encouragement and resources to the Government of \n     Lebanon to enable the Government to comply with the relevant \n     provisions of United Nations Security Council Resolution \n     1559;\n       Whereas Hezbollah launched an unprovoked attack against \n     Israel on July 12, 2006, killing 7 Israeli soldiers and \n     taking 2 soldiers hostage, its fifth provocative act against \n     Israel since the summer of 2005;\n       Whereas the Government of Israel, as reaffirmed in S.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of the passage of \nthe YouthBuild Transfer Act, S. 3534, as amended. I am pleased at the \nwidespread support that this bill has received and want to especially \nthank Senator Kennedy, the ranking member of the Health, Education, \nLabor and Pensions Committee, and Senators DeWine, Kerry and Murray.\n  This bill transfers the Youth Build program from the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development to the Department of Labor, as an \namendment to the Workforce Investment Act, WIA. YouthBuild was enacted \nin 1992. It provides programs for young adults aged 16 to 24 to build \nor rehabilitate housing for homeless or low-income individuals in their \ncommunities while they study to earn their high school diploma or GED. \nThese youth gain occupational and technical skills while building their \nknowledge to help them become and remain productive participants in the \nworkplace.\n  By transferring YouthBuild to DOL, the program will be more closely \naligned with and benefit from collaboration with the larger workforce \nsystem at the State and local levels. It will continue to serve those \nyoung adults most in need of these services, and enable them to serve \ntheir communities by building affordable housing, and assist them in \ntransforming their own lives and roles in society.\n  YouthBuild assists young adults not currently enrolled in school gain \nneeded education, skills and knowledge. The skill and literacy \nrequirements of today's and tomorrow's workplace cannot be met if we do \nnot provide everyone access to lifelong education, training and \nretraining.\n  I am hopeful that this bill will be signed into law quickly so that \nthe YouthBuild program can continue to successfully help young adults \nacross the country acquire the knowledge and skills they need in the \n21st century global economy.\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on \ncomprehensive, bipartisan legislation reported from the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs and now awaiting full Senate approval. S. 2694, the \nVeterans' Choice of Representation and Benefits Enhancement Act of \n2006, contains 28 provisions representing the collective\n\n[[Page S8892]]\n\nwork of 44 Senators who either sponsored or cosponsored bills that were \nincorporated into this important legislation.\n  S. 2694 includes provisions that would improve educational assistance \nbenefits for veterans and their survivors; reauthorize and enhance \nvarious programs of assistance for homeless veterans; reduce nursing \nhome and prescription medication costs for service-disabled veterans \nresiding in State veterans' nursing homes; enhance memorial affairs \nbenefits and preserve the character of Arlington National Cemetery as a \nshrine for our honored dead; and, as the bill's title suggests, provide \nveterans with the freedom to hire attorneys to represent them during \nthe VA claims process. I will take a few minutes to describe the \nsections of the bill that I sponsored, none I am more proud of than the \nchoice of representation provision. For a full accounting of all of S. \n2694's provisions, I ask my colleagues to read Senate Report 109-297.\n  Currently, veterans and other claimants seeking veterans' benefits \nmay not hire an attorney until the VA administrative proceedings have \nbeen completed a process that often takes several years. That law flows \nfrom a Civil War era policy intended to protect veterans from \nunscrupulous attorneys. That policy arose at a time--unlike today--when \nattending law school was not required to become a lawyer and there was \nno effective professional oversight of lawyers.\n  In recent months, it has become abundantly clear that many veterans \nand their survivors want the option of hiring an attorney to help them \nnavigate the increasingly complex VA system. In fact, the prohibition \nagainst veterans hiring attorneys is considered to be unfair and \noutdated by a broad spectrum of individuals and organizations, \nincluding veterans' organizations, veterans' advocates, judges, law \nprofessors, and bar associations.\n  For these reasons, I joined with Senator Lindsey Graham in \nintroducing legislation to end the outdated, paternalistic restriction \non the freedoms of veterans. Section 101 of S. 2694 would repeal the \nexisting prohibition against veterans hiring attorneys to help them \nobtain benefits from VA. I am delighted that we are closer to doing \naway with this outdated law and allowing veterans like all other adults \nin this Nation--to have the assistance of counsel if they so choose.\n  Title V of S. 2694 represents the first effort in 5 years to enact \ncomprehensive homeless veterans' assistance legislation. Five years \nago, Congress set an ambitious goal to end homelessness among veterans \nby 2011. I am not one who sets goals lightly, especially one so \nimportant. Therefore, I joined with Senators Akaka, Burr and Obama to \ncraft the provisions in title V which will both improve services for \nhomeless veterans, and help prevent chronic homelessness among our \nservicemen and women returning from the war on terror. Among other \nthings, this measure would extend the authorization of appropriations \nfor comprehensive services for homeless veterans, reauthorize a grant \nprogram for homeless veterans with special needs, and extend the \nauthority of the Advisory Committee on Homeless Veterans. It would also \nextend the authority of VA to transfer properties it obtains after \nforeclosures on homes financed with VA-guaranteed loans to \norganizations which assist homeless veterans and their families in \nacquiring shelter. Finally, the bill would authorize appropriations for \na program designed to prevent homelessness by providing financial \nassistance to eligible entities to provide and coordinate the provision \nof supportive services for very low-income veteran families occupying \npermanent housing.\n  I want to be clear, however, that I will be monitoring whether these \nprograms are having the effect we expect them to. In March, I held a \nhearing on the needs of homeless veterans, at which VA, its Federal \npartners, and community-based service providers to the homeless \ntestified about what is working, what isn't, what duplication might be \neliminated, and where deficiencies exist that must be addressed. We \nlearned that more than a half dozen Federal agencies will devote over \n$2 billion to homelessness. VA alone will spend upward of $221 million \non grants, housing and treatment of underlying conditions. In fact, the \nfiscal year 2007 budget for VA will support a record level of funding \nfor the sixth straight year for targeted programs for homeless \nveterans. Plainly stated, we cannot afford to waste any money. We must \nensure that our resources are invested carefully so that homeless \nveterans can resume their self-sufficiency and independence.\n  Section 402 of S. 2694 is derived from legislation I introduced that \nwould remove the four-year limit on the terms for the positions of \nUnder Secretary for Health and Under Secretary for Benefits at VA. When \nthe term limits were originally created, I think we all hoped that they \nwould allow the two officials to serve four consecutive years without \nany political considerations, regardless of whether the service was in \ndifferent administrations or under different VA leadership. History, \nhowever, has shown us that new administrations or even new VA \nleadership within the same administration often bring new people at all \nlevels of government, including the two Under Secretary positions. In \nfact, the last three Under Secretaries for Health and the previous \nUnder Secretary for Benefits did not complete a full 4-year term. \nTherefore, this provision would eliminate what are, in effect, limits \non terms that serve no useful purpose.\n  The last of the provisions I sponsored touches on a subject that most \nof my colleagues likely remember. Last summer, we learned that the \nremains of a brutal murderer--Russell Wayne Wagner--were placed in the \nNation's preeminent military cemetery, Arlington National Cemetery. I \nwas appalled to discover that the law enacted in 1997 to deny capital \noffenders from burial in national cemeteries did not apply to Wagner. \nWhile we moved swiftly to close the loophole that permitted Wagner's \nburial in the first place, the question remained: should his remains \ncontinue to be included among the scores of honored dead in Arlington? \nFor me and Senator Mikulski, the answer was ``no.'' That is why we \nsponsored legislation now contained in section 202 of S. 2694 which \nwould direct the Secretary of the Army to remove Wagner's remains from \nArlington. As I stated last summer, we must not dishonor the sacrifices \nmade by those memorialized at our Nation's military cemeteries by \nincluding among them individuals who, through their own heinous acts, \nhave grievously dishonored themselves.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank all of the members of the committee \nand other Senators who worked so diligently on this bill. In \nparticular, I commend the committee's anking member, Senator Akaka. I \nhave said it before and I'll repeat it today, Hawaii's veterans are \nfortunate to have Senator Akaka as their advocate. It is been a \npleasure working with him.\n  In closing, I ask for the support of the Senate in adopting S. 2694. \nIt is an important, historic piece of legislation that will respect the \nfreedoms won by our veterans on the battlefield, and will improve \nbenefits available to them when they return home from it.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, as ranking member of the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, I am pleased that the Senate on S. 2694, an omnibus \nveterans bill. This timely piece of legislation includes a number of \nimportant provisions that will improve the health care and benefits \nthat our Nation's veterans deserve. I will highlight a few sections in \nwhich I have a particular interest.\n  This legislation specifically seeks to improve the way VA responds to \nthe present and future demand for long-term care. As the veteran \npopulation ages, the demand for long-term care continues to rise, a \ntrend that will only continue as Vietnam-era veterans get older.\n  With the goal of encouraging and supporting alternatives to \ninstitutional long-term care, the pending legislation includes \nprovisions derived from S. 2753, a bill I introduced that was designed \nto promote assistance to those who look after veterans, especially in \nnoninstitutional, home-based settings. The provision in the bill as it \ncomes before the Senate today would authorize VA to carry out a pilot \nprogram to improve assistance services to these caregivers. Caregivers, \nparticularly those who live in rural and geographically remote areas, \nwould receive a helping hand through services such as adult-day care \nand respite care.\n  The pending measure also seeks to ensure more appropriate payment for \nthe cost of longterm care provided to\n\n[[Page S8893]]\n\ncertain seriously disabled veterans who are receiving care in State \nveterans' homes. Earlier this year, the Committee held field hearings \nin my home state of Hawaii. Tom Driskill, the President and CEO of \nHawaii Health Systems Corporation, testified about the soon-to-be-built \nState home in Hilo. He said, ``The synergy of a combined Federal and \nState funding of the home has been the catalyst for making this dream a \nreality.'' The adjustments this legislation would make to the current \ncost-sharing arrangement between VA and the States, which are derived \nfrom S. 2762, legislation I introduced, may help ensure a high quality \nof care in State homes not only in Hawaii, but across the entire \nNation.\n  Currently, care is provided at no cost to the veteran when VA \nprovides institutional, long-term care services to those with service-\nconnected disabilities rated 70 percent or higher in a VA nursing home \nor a private nursing care facility with which VA contracts. However, \nwhen the care is provided in a State veterans' home, VA pays only a per \ndiem to the State, which then may bill the veteran for the remaining \ncosts. I believe this to be unfair, and this legislation would provide \nfor the same payment to State veterans' homes that is provided to \ncommunity nursing homes which are furnishing care to these seriously \ndisabled veterans.\n  I am gratified that this legislation includes extensive provisions to \nreauthorize, improve and enhance services for homeless veterans. I \ncommend Senators Obama and Burr, both members of the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee, for their dedication to ensuring that comprehensive services \nare provided to homeless veterans. I fully support these efforts and \nstand with my colleagues in the battle to end homelessness among \nveterans.\n  This bill also includes a provision from a bill I introduced, S. \n1537, that would authorize VA to designate at least two Multiple \nSclerosis Centers of Excellence and six Parkinson's Disease Research, \nEducation and Clinical Centers. VA centers of excellence have been the \nmodel of innovation in the delivery of highly specialized healthcare \nand research for chronic disease in the veteran population. Providing a \nstatutory basis for these centers will ensure continued research and \ndevelopment of progressive treatments to help reduce symptoms and \nimprove the quality of life for veterans battling with these \nneurological diseases.\n  The bill also includes a provision that would allow VA to extend \neligibility of VA's State Cemetery Grants Program to tribal \norganizations. This change, derived from my bill, S. 2659, would allow \nfor the establishment, expansion, and improvement of veterans' \ncemeteries on trust lands. If enacted, it will enable veterans living \non trust lands to have an option for burial much closer to their family \nmembers and other loved ones.\n  This bill also includes a $10,000 increase in the amount of \nsupplemental insurance available to totally disabled veterans through \nthe Service-Disabled Veterans' Insurance program. Totally disabled \nveterans would benefit greatly from the availability of higher \nsupplemental coverage amounts because the current aggregate S-DVI \ncoverage, $30,000, is insufficient to meet disabled veterans' life \ninsurance needs. This provision, which I authored, would increase the \nfinancial security of disabled veterans and. their families.\n  In conclusion, I thank the Coalition to Salute America's Heroes, the \nNational Multiple Sclerosis Society, the Parkinson's Action Network, \nand the National Association of State Veterans Homes for their hard \nwork and support of provisions in this legislation.\n  I am pleased that our committee continues its tradition of \nbipartisanship. The effort that produced the final version of this \nlegislation, vital to the continued provision of quality health care \nand benefits to our Nation's veterans, is just the latest example of \nthat spirit.\n  I thank my colleagues in the Senate for their support of this \nmeasure.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent that the committee-reported \namendment be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a third time and \npassed, the title amendment be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and any statements relating to the bill be printed \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Today has been a long day. I thank my colleagues for their \ncooperation. I also wish everyone a safe and restful break. We had a \nlot of highlights over the course of the day. We had a lot of passion \nand some emotion on the floor.\n  I thank all of the people who are here tonight, the clerks, the pages \nwho are here always until very late at night, the security personnel \nthroughout whom we will say goodbye to as we leave the Capitol tonight. \nWhen you are here at 12:42 in the morning, having been here all day, \nyou have a little appreciation for what it takes to make the Capitol \nclick, the infrastructure, the people, the dedication. As Senators come \nand go over the course of the day, there are a lot of people here who \ndedicate themselves and sacrifice a lot of their own personal lives to \nmake things happen. We appreciate that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/08/03/senate-section/article/S8906-2", "month": "08", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 AUTISM\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I had a bill I had worked on for about 6 \nyears, the autism bill that was passed tonight. A lot of us made \nstatements earlier in the night, but it is a real pleasure, in part as \na physician who is at least sensitive to the real challenges we have in \nterms of addressing issues such as autism, which has had a rapid \nincrease in incidence over the last two decades.\n  We have no idea why. It makes you very humble to realize our lack of \nunderstanding. But what is exciting is that by pulling together the \nvery best of the public and private sectors, physicians, doctors, \nfamilies, parents, and communities all gathering together, we can make \nsome real headway in figuring out the etiology of autism and \nmanifestations, about understanding that and improving treatment and \nultimately a cure.\n  I am very proud of this body and especially Senator Santorum for his \ntremendous leadership in that regard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/08/03/senate-section/article/S8906-3", "month": "08", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        ADJOURNMENT UNTIL TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 5, 2006, AT 11 A.M.\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
