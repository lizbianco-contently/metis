Mr. President, I rise today to address the valiant efforts \nof our men and women serving overseas in Iraq. Their service for our \ncountry is very close to my heart because I, like thousands of other \nAmerican parents across the United States, have a son who is fighting \nfor the cause of freedom in Iraq.\n  Like every American, and especially for those of us with loved ones \nwho are fighting overseas, I have carefully considered our actions in \nIraq, and I am as committed to staying the course today as I was when I \nvoted to authorize hostile action less than 3 years ago.\n  Today, we see the wreckage of roadside bombs plastered across our \nmedia screens. We are constantly bombarded by a daily media barrage of \nevery hint of bad news in Iraq. The old adage, ``If it bleeds, it \nleads,'' seems to be in full effect.\n  What about the good that is happening as a result of our efforts? I \ncan tell you this is the greatest concern our men and women in Iraq \nhave. They are doing good work, they are making progress, but they \ndon't hear any of the good things that are going on. This is \ndisheartening, as are some of the comments made by a few in the United\n\n[[Page S12464]]\n\nStates who say they are not doing a good job, who denigrate their \nefforts. We owe them better than that. I could cite for you letters I \nhave seen written to newspapers in my State by men who have served in \nIraq saying precisely this.\n  Has there been any progress made toward democracy this year? The \nIraqis themselves answered yes, resoundingly, when last month, on \nOctober 15, an overwhelming majority of Iraqis voted peacefully to lay \nthe foundation for their country with a national constitution. Ten days \nlater, on October 25, the Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq \nannounced the approval of a constitution and stated that it had found \nno evidence of significant voter fraud, as some had alleged.\n\n  The United Nations also participated in the referendum process and \nconcurred with the Commission's conclusions. On the day of the vote, \nSunni protests were minimal, with no violence reported. Not only did \nthe referendum pass with 15 of 18 provinces providing a majority \n``yes'' vote, but all governorates recorded a high voter turnout, the \nlikes of which would put many of our voter districts in America to \nshame. I can tell you from personal reports that in Sunni areas, Sunnis \nwere going out in record numbers to register. They were registering at \nregistration places protected solely by Iraqi security forces without \nany violence against them.\n  When we look at the election results, the Kurds in Dahuk posted an \n86-percent turnout, while the Shi'a in Karbala and Najaf posted a 57-\npercent turnout. But let's consider the Sunni areas where critics say \nwe are making so little progress toward democracy.\n  Let's compare the percentage of voter turnout from last January's \nelections to the October referendum last month. In Anbar, voter turnout \nrose from 2 percent to 40 percent; in Diyala, from 33 percent to 67 \npercent; in Nayniwah, from 17 percent to 54 percent; and in Salahaldin, \nfrom 29 percent to 91 percent.\n  Only two of those governorates voted overwhelmingly against the \nreferendum, and all of them saw record numbers of citizens exercising \ntheir voices at the polls.\n  This, Mr. President, is progress toward democracy. Have we forgotten \nthat under Saddam, the Iraqi people had no vote, no opportunity to \nexpress themselves?\n  I am not discouraged, as the critics say we should be, that there was \nnot near universal agreement on the referendum in Iraq. We have had a \nhard enough time in our own country, the world's model for democracy, \nin achieving overwhelming agreement on anything. And certainly this \nbody with its recent record of activity shows that democracies often \ngenerate strong disagreements. The only time a national vote purports \nto show universal agreement is when the election is held under the \ntight control and dictation of a dictator such as Saddam Hussein.\n  So how do the critics explain this massive increase in voter turnout \nand still maintain that democracy is dead in the water in Iraq, when \nthe people of Iraq for the first time in centuries now have a voice and \na common marketplace of ideas in which to express themselves? And why \nisn't more attention given to the progress in Iraq for which our sons \nand daughters overseas are fighting?\n  As for the media, it is my belief that the greatest threat to our \nefforts in Iraq today is the enemy's ability to manipulate press \ncoverage of the conflict in order to influence U.S. public opinion to \nforce a premature withdrawal of our forces.\n  Last month, I spoke on the floor of the Senate about the acquisition \nof a letter written by Osama bin Laden's principal deputy, Ayman al-\nZawahiri, to al-Qaida's foremost lieutenant on the ground in Iraq, Abu \nMus'ab al-Zarqawi. The letter underscored that al-Qaida will not relent \nin pursuing its Sunni Islamo-fascist, extremist agenda, and it revealed \nal-Qaida views its jihad in Iraq as the focal point in its effort to \nestablish a worldwide neofascist global caliphate. Zawahiri's recipe \nfor creating this Sunni extremist state is in this order: evict the \nAmericans from Iraq, create an Islamic extremist state in Iraq, swallow \nup Iraq's neighbors and then destroy Israel, and from there go on to \nbigger and better things. And how did Zawahiri advise Zarqawi to \nachieve these goals? By augmenting his terror campaign with political \nwarfare and by manipulating the media. Zawahiri urged Zarqawi to tone \ndown egregious actions, such as beheadings, because they do not play \nwell on television screens. He approved of the violence but cautioned \nhim to execute Americans with a bullet to the head instead. Isn't that \nnice of him?\n  The Zawahiri letter so clearly unveils the insidious nature of this \nclever enemy we are up against. Therefore, I urge every American with \naccess to the Internet to read the letter. Go to the Web site \nwww.dni.gov, and look under ``News Releases.'' But Americans shouldn't \nhave to go to a Web site to discover its content. It should have been \ndissected in painstaking detail on the nightly news or at least given a \nfraction of the time allotted to the critical coverage of the war.\n  It amazes me how there is such a blinding skepticism about anything \nthat supports our effort in Iraq today. Last week, my staff spoke to a \nrespected scholar in London about what he thought about the Zawahiri \nletter. He said it must have been a fabrication. When asked what \nevidence he had for that assertion, he responded: None, but it just \nmakes Bush's case, so the letter can't be genuine.\n  As a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, I can \ntell you that we have absolutely no indication at all this letter was a \nfabrication. So I ask again, why isn't the media delving into this?\n  We ought to take a brief look at the nature of the enemy we are \nfighting in Iraq. I believe President Bush said it well last week \nduring his speech in Norfolk when he called their evil form of Islamic \nradicalism Islamo-fascism.\n  We are fighting a radical ideology that has crept up over the past \nfew decades that is taking hold in countries around the world. We see \nit in Palestine, in Indonesia, the Philippines and, yes, now even in \nEurope. For the past week, we have seen the signs of it with riots \noutside Paris. Rioters burned areas of the country for over a week, \nlashing out against the Western society in which they live. Arab \nexperts explain the violence as an identity problem among young Arabs \nwho see themselves first as Muslims looking for a country of their own, \nrather than French, English, or American citizens.\n  Al-Qaida preys on such youth, encourages their unjustified acts of \nviolence, and is now telling them that their new home will be in Iraq. \nThis is why in Iraq today we see so many foreign fighters flocking to a \nradical cause. An insurgent fights within his country's borders to \ndefend it from occupation or to oust a government with which he does \nnot agree. This is the definition of an insurgent. A terrorist is one \nwho travels outside his country to wage politically motivated violence \nelsewhere.\n  While there remain many Sunni Baathist insurgents who would like to \nbring back Saddam, there is an ever growing and a proportionally lethal \nnumber of terrorists flooding into Iraq to fight what they see as the \nultimate jihad, identified as their extremist neofascist interpretation \nof Islam.\n  These are the terrorists who are fueling simmering insurgencies. \nThese are truly the Islamofascists. Iraq has become the epic battle \nwith the West that al-Qaida has been looking for and we must win it. We \ncannot afford to lose. This enemy cannot be negotiated with and will \nnever reform its ways or be deterred from its path of violence. The \nonly option we have with such an enemy who wants to slaughter American \nmen, women, and children is to eliminate them.\n  Last week former President Jimmy Carter appeared on ``Larry King \nLive'' and criticized President Bush for his policy of preemption in \nthe war on terror. He claimed this policy was a break in U.S. national \npolicy from all previous Presidents and administrations. Therefore, he \ndeclared our actions in Iraq radical.\n  It is radical precisely because we find ourselves in dire \ncircumstances. It is a break from the past because in the past we were \nnot facing organized, ruthless bands of terrorists with declared \nintentions to annihilate Americans, whose acquisition of weapons of \nmass destruction was a distinct possibility.\n  Every student of national security understands that threat equals \ncapability plus intent. The intent of the\n\n[[Page S12465]]\n\nterrorists to annihilate us is indisputable, as is their stated \nintention to acquire weapons of mass destruction to do so. Their power \nis only limited by their current capability.\n  As David Kay said, in the Iraqi Survey Report which we discussed in \nthe Intelligence Committee and has now been released, Iraq, despite our \ninadequate intelligence, was a far more dangerous place even than we \nknew because radical terrorists were running loose in an unorganized \ncountry that had the potential to produce weapons of mass destruction \nfor them.\n  We must erode the capability of those terrorists for if we sit back \nand allow it to grow, we will face threats to the future such as we \nhave never seen before. Long-distance runners say there comes a time in \nthe race when their bodies yearn to succumb to the temptation to give \nup the fight but they must press on. That is when they remind \nthemselves of the reasons for their struggle and when they remind \nthemselves why they run; they find strength to press on. Only those who \nare resolute and full of conviction win the race. Let us hold to our \nconviction that democracy is better than tyranny, achieving peace is \nworth our struggle, and those who are counting on us in Iraq have a \nreason to hope.\n  We must maintain the course and be ready to fight neofascists and \nIslamo-fascism, wherever it exists. Right now it is Iraq, but there are \nother theaters as well. Southeast Asia could become one added to the \nlist. Let us press on, for only if we do so will we one day win this \nlong distance race. It is not a short one, but it is one we cannot \nafford to lose if we want to ensure that we have no more 9/11s or we at \nleast reduce the likelihood we will have such tragedy on our shore.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nIllinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask for the indulgence of the Chair to notify me when I \nhave 3 minutes remaining on my statement.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Very well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/08/senate-section/article/S12465-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12465-S12466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     MOTION TO CLOSE SENATE SESSION\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it was a week ago today when the \nDemocratic leader in the Senate, Harry Reid, made a motion that the \nSenate move into closed session under rule XXI. It is a rule that is \nrarely used, but I was glad it was used that day because the purpose \nwas absolutely essential for America to learn the truth about what \nhappened before the invasion of Iraq.\n  Senator Reid made that motion in order to make certain that the \nSenate Intelligence Committee keeps its word to the American people. \nSome 20 months ago, the Senate Intelligence Committee promised they \nwould have a thorough professional investigation of several major \nelements relative to intelligence. One of the most important is whether \nany elected official or member of this administration in any way used \nintelligence or made statements that were not substantiated. In other \nwords, were we misled, purposely or deliberately, by any elected \nofficial or member of the administration before the invasion of Iraq. \nIt is an absolutely critical question.\n  I am glad the Senate Intelligence Committee made a commitment to \ninitiate this investigation. We found, after waiting 20 months, little \nor nothing was happening. Fifteen months ago, the chairman of the \nSenate Intelligence Committee, Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas, called \nthis phase II investigation a top priority. Yet, on March 11 of this \nyear, speaking to the Woodrow Wilson Center, Senator Roberts said this \ninvestigation was ``on the back burner.''\n  Then a few days later on March 31, Senator Roberts issued a press \nrelease, after we had the report of a commission relative to this \nintelligence, in which he said all prewar intelligence--it would be a \nmonumental waste of time to replow the ground.\n\n  It was very unclear whether the commitment was still there from \nSenator Roberts and the Intelligence Committee to keep their word to \nthe American people to investigate this critical question.\n  Yesterday, the junior Senator from Texas came to the floor arguing, I \nbelieve, that it was unnecessary to go forward with this investigation. \nI think he is wrong. He argued that if we find any member of the \nadministration misled the American people into believing a war in Iraq \nand an invasion were necessary, somehow this would discredit the \nbravery and heroism of America's troops. I cannot follow his logic.\n  The men and women in uniform are doing their country proud every day. \nThey are risking their lives for America. They stand up for values that \nare essential, such as family, faith, and truth. Why would this Senate \nbe reluctant to tell the American people the truth?\n  This is not just a test of the Intelligence Committee; this is a test \nof the Senate. It is a test of our constitutional responsibility, the \nresponsibility of Congress, to protect the American people from an \nabuse of power by the executive or any elected official. It is a matter \nof the gravest importance. If an elected official deliberately or \nrecklessly misled the American people into believing there was cause \nfor the invasion of Iraq, that is a serious abuse of power.\n  We know Senator Roberts promised this investigation almost 2 years \nago. Because of our motion to go into closed session, a bipartisan \nagreement was reached, and under that agreement, in 6 days, Senator \nRoberts and two of his designees will announce with three Democratic \ndesignees the schedule for completing this important investigation.\n  When we closed the Senate, we accomplished more in 2 hours than we \nhad accomplished in 2 years in moving this investigation forward. When \nthe junior Senator from Texas came to the floor and said this \ninvestigation was unnecessary because an earlier group had investigated \nit, he referred specifically to the Silberman-Robb Commission. What he \ndid not put into the record should be included, and I quote from the \ncommission:\n\n       [W]e were not authorized to investigate how policymakers \n     used the intelligence assessments they received from the \n     Intelligence Community. Accordingly, while we interviewed a \n     host of current and former policymakers during the course of \n     our investigation, the purpose of those interviews was to \n     learn about how the Intelligence Community reached and \n     communicated its judgments about Iraq's weapons programs--not \n     to review how policymakers subsequently used that \n     information.\n\n  That is the question. That is the issue. For the Senator from Texas \nto say the Silberman-Robb Commission has dealt with that issue is not \nfactual and it is not accurate, based on the words of that commission.\n  He went further to say that the phase I investigation of the \nIntelligence Committee about the failings of the intelligence agencies \nto understand the threat in Iraq also took care of the question before \nus. It did not. I served on the Intelligence Committee. We purposely \ndivided this into two investigations: First, any failings or \nshortcomings of intelligence agencies; second, any misuse of this \nintelligence information by policymakers and elected officials. That is \nthe responsibility we have to go forward.\n  It is not clear when the Senate Intelligence Committee would have \nfinished its work had we not filed this motion to have a closed session \nin the Senate. Now the promise has been made not just to fellow \ncolleagues, not just to the Congress, but to the American people. I \nthink we need to know the truth. If a policymaker in this \nadministration deliberately misled the American people, we should know \nthat. If we find from the evidence it did not occur, we should also \nknow that.\n  Let us pursue the truth. Let us make sure the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee keeps its promise to the American people.\n  We know there are many areas of statements made by the President, by \nthe Vice President, the Secretary of State, and the Secretary of \nDefense that were just plain wrong. There were no weapons of mass \ndestruction. When it came to the aluminum tubes, there was a serious \ndisagreement within the administration, between the CIA and the \nDepartment of Energy, as to whether those aluminum tubes were evidence \nof a buildup of nuclear weapons. We also know that statements by the \nadministration about a connection between Saddam Hussein and 9/11 were \nfalse. There was no evidence to back it up. We know now about the \nnotorious statements in the President's State of\n\n[[Page S12466]]\n\nthe Union Address about whether Iraq obtained yellowcake from Niger to \ndevelop nuclear weapons turned out to be totally false and bogus.\n  The obvious question that has to be asked is whether this \nadministration and its spokespersons knew ahead of time the information \nthey were giving to the American people was not accurate. That is the \nessential inquiry that must take place.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 3 minutes remaining.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/08/senate-section/article/S12466-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 STATUS OF AHMAD CHALABI INVESTIGATION\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I note that something curious is happening \nin Washington today. There is a man by the name of Ahmad Chalabi, an \nIraqi Deputy Prime Minister, who is visiting Washington. Yesterday in \nthe Wall Street Journal, FBI spokesman John Miller noted that Mr. \nChalabi is ``under active investigation.'' For what? He is under \ninvestigation for the charge that he leaked intelligence, including the \nfact that the United States had broken a crucial Iranian code and that \nMr. Chalabi turned that information over to the Baghdad station chief \nof Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security.\n  Of course, if that happened, Mr. Chalabi endangered American troops \nand American security. As a result of this charge against Mr. Chalabi \non May 20 of last year, his residence was searched by the Iraqis, with \nthe cooperation of American forces in Iraq, to see if evidence could be \nfound.\n  That is a serious charge that we would somehow jeopardize the \nsecurity of America's troops and our national security and whether this \nman leaked sensitive information. The fact that he is under active \ninvestigation by the FBI is proof positive that we are taking this \nseriously.\n  So where can we find Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Chalabi this week? \nWell, we will find him in Washington. He has an appointment to sit down \nand break bread with Treasury Secretary Snow and Secretary of State \nCondoleezza Rice. Then a little later this week he is going to give a \nspeech to the American Enterprise Institute.\n  Does this sound like a man under active investigation or a man who is \nbeing actively lauded by this administration? I do not understand this.\n  While the Department of Justice is actively investigating this man \nfor wrongdoing that could have endangered American troops and American \nlives, the Department of State and the Department of the Treasury are \nhosting him as though he were some dignitary. So do not be surprised if \nthe Chalabi motorcade speeds up when they pass the Department of \nJustice. I guess they are concerned whether an FBI agent will come out \nand pursue this so-called active investigation.\n  It is very difficult to track how this man, who gave us such \nmisleading information before the invasion of Iraq, now under active \ninvestigation for endangering American troops, is now the toast of the \ntown at the Department of Treasury and the Department of State. I do \nnot follow their logic, and I certainly do not follow the pursuit of \njustice if they do not have an active investigation concluded so that \nwe know whether Mr. Chalabi has endangered American lives.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator's time has expired. \nWho yields time?\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/08/senate-section/article/S12466-2", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12466-S12468]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       A NEW DAY AND TIME IN IRAQ\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, we are now less than a month removed from \nthe successful Iraqi referendum that was approved by more than 75 \npercent of Iraqis. This vote marked a new dawn in the Arab world, a \ndemocratically created constitution written by Iraqis and approved by \nthe general electorate made up of Sunnis, Shiites, and Kurds. This is \nquite a change from the decades in which a militant dictator ruled over \nIraq, with the threat of death hanging over the people for any harsh \nword directed toward their central government. It is truly a new day in \nIraq and a new time.\n  Of course, some would rather ignore the strides that the Iraqi people \nhave taken. They would rather focus on grim milestones that neither \nreflect the true sacrifice that has been made nor give a clear \nindication of how far the Iraqis have come to independence. The men and \nwomen of our Armed Forces have created an environment in Iraq that has \ngiven Iraqis a chance for democracy.\n  This chance is born from the blood, sweat, and tears of our \nservicemen and women. They deserve our gratitude and honor.\n  Friday marks Veterans Day and it is fitting that every year we take \ntime to pause and reflect on those who have served in the military to \nprotect our way of life and advance freedom around the globe. While we \ncelebrate this year, we do so with heavy hearts knowing that there are \nmany future war veterans who are currently serving in the theater \nabroad. As they have done in the past, our armed forces have taken up \nthe challenge yet again to defend our freedoms from violent extremists \nto ensure that future generations of Americans can continue to prosper. \nMany of these war veterans have already served previous tours in Iraq, \nand my thoughts and prayers go out for another safe return home.\n  Many thousands of troops who are engaged in Iraq are Coloradoans. For \nexample, the 10th Combat Support Hospital that left Fort Carson for \nIraq in October. This medical unit is being deployed not only to treat \nour injured servicemen and women, but also any civilian that is brought \nin to their trauma unit regardless of affiliation. I want to take a \nminute to pause and reflect on that. Our trained medical doctors and \ntechnicians will be using their skills to save the lives of not only \nCoalition Forces, but anyone who is brought in--including insurgents. \nThey might be saving the very lives of those that would do great harm \nto our soldiers. These are the types of actions that show what kind of \nmen and women serve in the armed forces. These are the types of actions \nthat show what freedom and democracy can bring to a region long devoid \nof it.\n  The individuals in our armed forces continue to shine throughout the \ncountry with remarkable levels of service. Individuals like Col. James \nWest of Palisade, CO. Colonel West recently received a Bronze Star \nafter distinguishing himself during two consecutive tours of duty in \nIraq. He served as a Senior Program Manager in the Project and \nContracting Office in Baghdad, Iraq from December 2004 to September of \nthis year. Because of the critical nature of his position and the need \nto maintain the lines of communication and trust he developed with the \nIraqi Oil Ministry and the primary Iraqi owned operating companies, \nColonel West volunteered himself for two consecutive tours of duty.\n\n  During this time, his leadership in the field provided the foundation \nnecessary to achieve the goal of rebuilding the Iraqi Oil production \ncapacity to pre-war levels. The Department of Defense and the Air Force \nbelieve that his professionalism and devotion to duty merit special \nrecognition. I honor him for his service to our country and \ncongratulate him on his well-deserved Bronze Star.\n  More than just being engaged in fighting the radical insurgents who \nhave polluted the country, our men and women like Colonel West are \nrisking their lives to reach out to the Iraqi people to show them the \nheart that is behind the uniform. From the Army engineers throughout \nthe country helping to rebuild the infrastructure, to ordinance \ndisposal units helping to cleanse farmland from explosives left from \ndecades of neglect, our troops continue to make a positive difference \nin the lives of Iraqis.\n  It is important to put our military's efforts into the proper \nperspective. The enormous progress that has been made in Iraq is the \nreal story.\n  It was only 2 \\1/2\\ years ago that the Hussein regime was in power \nterrorizing large portions of the Iraqi population. And now just 9 \nmonths after they elected their own leaders for the first time, the \nIraqi people have approved a historical referendum by an overwhelming \nmajority. These are the milestones we should be celebrating--the ones \nthat could only be achieved through the sacrifices of our soldiers, \nsailors, airmen, and marines.\n  This Friday marks Veterans Day. Let us not forget our future war \nveterans who are gallantly serving the cause of freedom abroad. And let \nus remember those who have made the ultimate sacrifice to help bring \ndemocracy to Iraq.\n\n[[Page S12467]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the progress America is \nmaking in the global war on terrorism and in particular on the progress \nbeing made in Iraq.\n  Recently we passed a solemn benchmark. Two thousand of our servicemen \nand women have paid the ultimate price in defense of freedom. A vocal \nminority contend that these casualties were in vain. They claim we are \nin Iraq for all the wrong reasons. Further, they say that since there \nhave been no weapons of mass destruction uncovered in Iraq that the \nadministration obviously lied to get Americans behind the initial war \neffort. I think it is important that we take a few minutes to recall \nthe world in which we lived prior to taking military action against \nSaddam Hussein in 2003.\n  The previous administration was quite clear in their belief that Iraq \npossessed weapons of mass destruction. Then-President Clinton said:\n\n       Saddam rejects peace and we have to use force, our purpose \n     is clear. We want to seriously diminish the threat posed by \n     Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program.\n\n  Clinton's National Security Advisor, Sandy Berger, said of Hussein:\n\n       He will use those weapons of mass destruction again, as he \n     has ten times since 1993.\n\n  Even after he left office, Al Gore stated:\n\n       We know that [Hussein] has stored secret supplies of \n     biological and chemical weapons throughout the country.\n\n  Madeline Albright said:\n\n       The risks that the leaders of a rogue state will use \n     nuclear, chemical or biological weapons against us or our \n     allies is the greatest security threat we face.\n\n  Let us all remember, Iraq had been in blatant violation of 17 \nseparate United Nations resolutions dating back to the first Persian \nGulf War--resolutions which required Iraq to reveal prohibited WMD and \nmissile programs to U.N. inspectors. American and British warplanes \nwere continually fired upon while enforcing U.N.-mandated ``no fly \nzones'' in Iraq.\n  In 1993, terrorists detonated a bomb in the garage of the World Trade \nCenter in an attempt to topple this symbol of capitalism.\n  In 1996, the Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia, housing an Air Force \nFighter Wing, were attacked by terrorists. Nineteen U.S. servicemembers \nlost their lives. Hundreds were wounded.\n  In 1998, the U.S. Embassies in Tanzania and Kenya were bombed by \nterrorists. Hundreds lost their lives.\n  In October of 2000, the USS Cole was attacked by terrorists while \nrefueling in Yemen. Seventeen sailors lost their lives. Many more were \ninjured. And, of course, we all remember the day the Pentagon was \nattacked and the World Trade Center was leveled by terrorists crashing \ncommercial airliners into both structures on 9/11, resulting in more \nthan 3,000 of our fellow citizens being killed and America finally \nwaking up to the reality that is terrorism.\n  The terrorists had no reason to believe that we would respond to 9/11 \nbecause we had not responded in the past. At that time, every country \nin the free world believed that Iraq possessed weapons of mass \ndestruction. Saddam Hussein did nothing to dispel those beliefs. He had \nactually used chemical weapons on Iranians and on his own citizens.\n  President Bush could not risk America's future on the hope that a \ndictator like Hussein, with a track record that included grotesque \nhuman rights abuses, aggression against his neighbors, and the \nharboring and funding of terrorists, could be reformed or indefinitely \ncontained.\n  In fact, the Senate chose not to risk America's future either. This \nbody voted 77-23 in favor of the resolution allowing President Bush to \nuse force in Iraq. Those voting in the affirmative included the then-\nDemocratic Leader of the Senate, the ranking member of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, the ranking member of the Intelligence Committee \nand the Democratic nominee for President in the 2004 election.\n  I have a few quotes I would like to read.\n  Senator Jay Rockefeller, Congressional Record, October 2002:\n\n       There is unmistakable evidence that Saddam Hussein is \n     working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will \n     likely have nuclear weapons within the next five years . . . \n     We also should remember we have always underestimated the \n     progress Saddam has made in development of weapons of mass \n     destruction.\n\n  He obviously had access to the intelligence that the President had.\n  Senator John Kerry, Congressional Record, October 2002:\n\n       When I vote to give the President of the United States the \n     authority to use force, if necessary, to disarm Saddam \n     Hussein [it is] because I believe that a deadly arsenal of \n     weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a real and grave \n     threat to our security. . . .\n\n  Senator Hillary Clinton, Congressional Record, October 2002:\n\n       In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence \n     reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his \n     chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery \n     capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, \n     comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including al-Qaeda \n     members . . . It is clear, however, that if left unchecked, \n     Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage \n     biological and chemical warfare, and will keep trying to \n     develop nuclear weapons.\n\n  Senator Carl Levin, Senate Armed Services Committee Hearing, \nSeptember 2002:\n\n       We begin with the common belief that Saddam Hussein is a \n     tyrant and a threat to the peace and stability of the region. \n     He has ignored the mandate of the United Nations and is \n     building weapons of mass destruction and the means of \n     delivering them.\n\n  I could go on. We have lots of quotes, but let's stop for now.\n  On March 19, 2003, 2 days after our President's televised ultimatum, \na 35-nation coalition launched operations to disarm Iraq.\n  In a matter of weeks, Hussein's decades-old regime had been removed, \nliberating 25 million Iraqis from one of the world's most brutal \ntyrannies.\n  That was 2\\1/2\\ years ago. Now, because things aren't quite as \nantiseptic as some would like, there are calls for American troop \nwithdrawal. Again, I think it is important for us to review just how \nfar we've come over the last 2\\1/2\\ years.\n  As far as security is concerned, the initial 35-nation coalition that \nliberated Iraq has increased to include 72 countries.\n  Iraqi Security Forces are continuing to take a more prominent role in \ndefending their country. One hundred sixteen Iraqi battalions are \ncurrently conducting military operations. That's 22 more battalions on \nline than there were just 3 months ago.\n  As President Bush has stated numerous times:\n\n       Our task is to make the Iraqi units fully capable and \n     independent. We're building up Iraqi security forces as \n     quickly as possible, so they can assume the lead in defeating \n     the terrorists and insurgents. Our strategy can be summed up \n     this way: As the Iraqis stand up, we will stand down.\n\n  Our assistance to the people of Iraq is not limited to the military. \nThere have been infrastructure improvements as well, including almost \n3,500 schools.\n  Also, there were no commercial TV stations in Iraq before the war; \ntoday there are 44.\n  There were no independent newspapers or magazines in Iraq before the \nwar. Today there are more than 100.\n  In January of this year, 8 million Iraqi citizens, in the face of \nviolent threats, voted to establish a parliament. Last month, the \nIraqis again returned to the polls in large numbers, and almost 10 \nmillion this time--more than 60 percent of the registered voters--voted \nto approve their constitution. This coming December, they will return \nto the polls to elect a fully constitutional government.\n  Because of America's leadership, compassion, and sacrifice, the world \nhas witnessed the end of Saddam Hussein's regime and the beginnings of \nan energetic democracy in Iraq. This fledgling democracy has the \nability to transform a region that has been a breeding ground for \nterrorists.\n  The world is a safer place because Qadhafi saw the fate of Saddam \nHussein and decided Libya was better off with its weapons of mass \ndestruction program under lock and key.\n  We are safer because the AQ Kahn network has been shut down and is no \nlonger supplying materiel support to Iran and North Korea's nuclear \nefforts.\n  We are safer because terrorists and the countries that harbor them \nknow if they threaten the United States, they could be the next ones to \nfeel the force of the U.S. military.\n  Our word means something now because the President laid a marker down \nin the sand and stood behind that marker when it was time--when Saddam \nHussein did not come forward and\n\n[[Page S12468]]\n\nagree to the resolutions that the United Nations had passed.\n  I believe the more than 2,000 members of our military who have died \nin service for our Nation in Iraq--and others will surely follow them--\nhave made our country safer.\n  I believe history will show in the fullness of time that America was \ninvolved in a noble effort that transformed a region and indeed the \nworld.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. First of all, I want to associate myself entirely with \nthe remarks of the Senator from Nevada. I wanted to rise for the same \npurpose--to talk for a minute about our men and women in Iraq, the \nsuccesses that have taken place there, and how proud I am of it.\n  But I can't help but, at the outset of my remarks, for a second, \nrespond to the remarks of the Senator from Illinois a few minutes ago. \nI had a flashback as I listened to that speech--a flashback to my \ngeneration's war in the 1960s in Vietnam, a flashback that reminded me \nof what happened when American politicians began to slowly but surely \nquestion America's intentions in a war while our people were deployed, \nwhich slowly resulted in the end of withdrawal of a military that never \nquite had the support anymore that it deserved while in harm's way.\n  I would like for a moment to talk about what we do know. We have had \nlots of questions raised about what we don't know, what we should have \ndone, what somebody may or may not have done. Let us talk for a second \nabout what we do know.\n  Senator Ensign has done a great job talking about what we knew \nleading up to going into Iraq. I would like to remind us of a few other \nthings.\n  We know that war was declared on America in the 1990s by Osama bin \nLaden, and we were attacked seven times without responding. It was \nfinally with the attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon that \nthis President changed America's policy to one of preemption, committed \nhimself to going after terrorism wherever it existed, and doing \neverything we could to liberate the world from the tyranny of \nterrorism.\n  We must remember that today we are not in a war like past wars. We \nare in the ultimate war between good and evil. The terrorists don't \nwant to beat us, they want us to lose our resolve so they can rule the \nworld through intimidation. Terrorists don't want what America has. \nThey do not want America to have what it has: the first amendment, \nfreedom of speech, the right to worship as we see fit, the right to \nbear arms--all the things that stand in the way of the tyranny they \nwould like to employ around the world, and have employed in a couple of \nplaces very successfully, in Afghanistan that we liberated and now in \nthe nation of Iraq.\n  There are those who would have you believe, by their speeches, that \nwe are fighting the Iraqi people. We are fighting terrorism in Iraq. \nThis war is about Iraq, the United States of America, our soldiers, the \nfuture of our generation, and our way of life as we have known it.\n  I commend and respect anyone who would raise a question or a doubt \nand seek an answer. But we must not forget that the truths that we know \nare compelling, that we are fighting the right war in the right place \nat the right time for the right reason.\n  For those who say we never found a weapon of mass destruction, I \nwould submit to you that Saddam Hussein himself was a weapon of mass \ndestruction. In 1990, when he went into Kuwait and we went in and \nliberated, it was Saddam Hussein who rained missiles upon Israel that \nwasn't even in the fight. It is Saddam Hussein who gassed his own \nKurds. It is Saddam Hussein who systematically ordered the deaths of \ntens of thousands of Iraqi people and buried them in mass graves.\n  It is no coincidence that al-Qaida operates today as the head of the \ninsurgency that fights our troops in Iraq because this is their war--\ntheir war against what America stands for, and what the future of the \nworld can be if we are successful. We have some tough days ahead, but \nwe must stay the course.\n  In one year, we have caused the Iraqi people to have an interim \nresolution, to draft a constitution, ratified, and to seek a permanent \nelection to elect permanent representatives, something that would have \nbeen unthinkable just 2 or 3 years ago.\n  But we did it because of the resolve of these men--the American \nsoldiers and the Iraqi soldiers fighting shoulder to shoulder with them \ntoday in the final stages in Iraq.\n  Yes, we have battles to fight. Yes, there will be more terrorist \nattacks. And, yes, there will be tragic losses that all of us grieve. \nBut we cannot, as a nation, lose our resolve, or have politicians \nquibble on the edges while our men and women are standing in harm's \nway.\n  I commend our troops and our soldiers. I commend our country. I \ncommend our citizens to look to the future and appreciate that \neverything we enjoy and have today is because of those who have \nsacrificed in the field of battle, those who have led in this Congress \nand in this Nation's Government in the past to defeat dictators and \ntyranny wherever it existed.\n  We are in the ultimate battle between good and evil. Compromise and \nquitting is unacceptable. Seeing it through to its course is essential \nfor our men and women in harm's way and for the children of the United \nStates of America and the children of the world because, you see, \nunlike history under Saddam Hussein in Iraq, the children of Iraq now \nunderstand that there is a future, that there is the potential for a \nbright future, and success and good times with no fear. They do so \nbecause this brave Nation, when attacked by the tyranny and the evil of \nterrorism, decided it would follow it wherever it took us and we would \npreempt it so it could not stand and it could not exist.\n\n  On behalf of our men and women in harm's way, the children they \nprotect, the dreams and aspirations of Americans for a bright future, \nas bright as our past, I commend our men and women in harm's way. I \nstay the course as a Member of this Senate to support them in the war \non terrorism, and I ask all of us to be careful when we raise questions \nthat must be raised to never raise them in such a way that would \ncompromise this effort or compromise the commitment and dedication of \nthese brave men and women.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, what is the pending order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in a period of morning business. \nAll time held by the majority has expired. The time remaining on the \nminority side is approximately 9 minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to \npresent a second-degree amendment to the Harkin amendment number 2438 \nfor the purpose of debate only.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this is a little bit of a complex \nsituation. We are anxious to get started on the bill. We want to honor \nthe 9 minutes on the other side of the aisle. I am wondering if the \nSenator from Oklahoma could proceed as in morning business until such \ntime as there is recognition sought on the other side to utilize the \nremaining 9 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I would be happy to accommodate that. \nHowever, our time has expired so it would take unanimous consent. I ask \nunanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized as in morning business.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/08/senate-section/article/S12468-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12468-S12471]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ARMED FORCES RADIO\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we have heard some discussions, some \ndebate by the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin, on his amendment No. 2438. \nI oppose this\n\n[[Page S12469]]\n\namendment, and I have prepared and have filed a second-degree amendment \nthat I will offer after all time by Senator Harkin has expired.\n  I guess I would ask the question as to why should the Senate mandate \nwhat programming our troops can listen to or deny their opportunity to \nchoose. Currently, under this system, our troops communicate with their \nlocal radio stations by offering feedback that shapes the local \nprogramming.\n  Simply put, if the troops do not like what they are hearing, they \ncall the radio station and ask that the programing be changed. It seems \nto be fair to me. It is called the market. If there is no market for \nit, why should we be doing it?\n  Now, as Senator Harkin himself has stated, fair and balanced \nprogramming options are offered to all 33 radio stations worldwide. It \nis the individual radio stations that establish the programming based \non its audience's preferences. The stations decide what programming is \nin the greatest demand.\n  Worldwide, the second-largest audience request is to play all 3 hours \nof Rush Limbaugh. Only 1 hour is currently made available through the \nAFRTS. However, some stations choose not to carry his program at all, \neven for the 1 hour of availability. That is their choice to make based \non the troop feedback.\n  You might say at this point, if the troop feedback is that they want \nall 3 hours, and some stations do not play any, and the most that any \nstations play is 1 hour, then if any change should be made in terms of \ncomplying with the market, it should be that.\n  Now, Senator Harkin and his charts would have you believe the only \nprogram on the radio is Rush Limbaugh. But what about the 24 hours of \nNational Public Radio or DOD's commitment to begin airing liberal talk \nshows by Al Franken and Ed Schultz? Furthermore, Rush Limbaugh \ncurrently represents only 3 percent of the weekly scheduled \nprogramming. That is 3 percent. I don't know why they are so worried \nabout 3 percent.\n  Now, the liberal talk radio--this is important as to having a \nbenchmark of 1 million listeners. It is important to know there is a \nreason why they choose programming. One is, they do not choose any at \nall unless it has 1 million listeners.\n\n  Let's put that chart up. It is kind of hard to read, but I will \nexplain it in a minute. Prior to this fall, no liberal talk shows had \nover 1 million listeners. Rush Limbaugh has approximately 15 million \nlisteners weekly. AFRTS's policy is to ``provide a cross-section of \npopular programming.'' To this point, there have been no significant \naudience demands to rationalize adding progressive programming or \nliberal programming.\n  For the record, Limbaugh was added to the programming menu after \ntroop listener demand had been heavy and sustained for many years. At \nthe time, Limbaugh's audience had grown so large that failure to \ninclude his show would have violated AFRTS's policy of providing a \nslice of domestic talk radio.\n  There is no truth to the minority's assertion that liberal talk radio \nhas been kept off of AFRTS for political purposes. That is a pure \nfabrication. The truth is, as this chart shows, the minimal market \ndemand that exists for liberal talk shows did not meet the listenership \nrequirement for programs to be played on AFRTS.\n  The AFRTS standard is a ``national syndication and one million \nlisteners per week.'' It has to be a nationally syndicated program, and \nit has to have a million listeners per week. That goes for all \nprogramming, as this chart clearly shows.\n  Now, two liberal talk shows have achieved 1 million listeners in \n2005. If we look at this carefully, we will see that in 2004 there were \nno liberal talk shows on AFRTS because none of them had an audience of \n1 million listeners. There is a change between 2004 and 2005 and that \nis Ed Schultz and Al Franken both were able to get a million listeners. \nTherefore, we changed the programming. We are responding to the demand \nout there. If there are a million people who want to listen to them, we \nwill give our troops a chance to do the same thing.\n  As it turns out, right now, the AFRTS stations will have access to \nthe two top conservative and the two top liberal shows. The \nconservative ones are Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity. And the liberal \nones are Al Franken and Ed Schultz.\n  Still, Senator Harkin is not satisfied. Senator Harkin claims \nconservatives are propagandizing AFRTS's programming. Well, I only ask, \nwhich sounds more like propaganda, programming which is freely chosen \nby listening troops or programming mandated by the Government? \nFurthermore, if there are significant numbers of letters from troops \ndecrying the current AFRTS programs, I know my office has not received \none.\n  In my travels visiting troops, I have not heard of one. In fact, I \nknow I have been, by count, to Iraq, into those areas where we have our \ntroops stationed, more times than any other member of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee. When I am over there, I have yet to have one person \ncome up to me or have one letter in our office saying they are \ndissatisfied with the programming and that they demand more liberal \nprograms.\n  All I see here are Senators trying to subsidize liberal talk radio \nbecause they do not have anyone to compete with popular conservative \nradio talk shows.\n  Now, the amendment also calls for an ombudsman, as if the amendment \nis not bad enough in trying to dictate what our troops should listen to \nagainst their will. The Harkin amendment would establish an ombudsman \nof the American Forces Network who would be appointed by the Secretary \nof Defense.\n  The amendment is based on the premise that the programming decisions \nof the American Forces Radio and Television Service have improperly \nexcluded liberal political radio programming and would give the \nombudsman the duty of identifying circumstances under which the AFN \n``has not adhered to the standards and practices of the Network in its \nprogramming, including circumstances in which the programming of the \nNetwork lacked integrity, fairness, or balance.'' I am quoting now from \nhis legislation. The ombudsman would be required to submit an annual \nreport.\n  Now, what this ombudsman provision does is it allows Members of \nCongress the opportunity to obstruct an already fair and functioning \nprocess by getting in between the troops and what they choose to listen \nto. Listed as one of the ombudsman's duties in this amendment is to \ninitiate and conduct, upon the request of Congress, reviews of the \nprogramming of the network, AFRTS.\n  The creation of an ombudsman is another example of wasteful \nGovernment redundancy. But, moreover, the creation of this post would \nempower Members of the Senate to choose what entertainment our troops \nlisten to. This is an attempt by the minority to impose unpopular \nmessage-driven content on AFRTS to a captive audience. The requirement \nfor a report, et cetera, is to intimidate the 33 stations that \nare trying to serve our service men and women into serving special \ninterests in Congress.\n\n  We do not need a political officer to make sure our troops get the \ndaily dose of a certain media personality. Today, these decisions are \nbased on the input from the servicemember and their ratings by the \nAmerican people. Our troops deserve the right to choose what they \nlisten to on the radio. What they do not deserve is their Senators \ntaking away the right. Who are we to do this? How arrogant it is we are \nputting ourselves in a position where we claim to know more than the \ntroops as to what is in their best interests. I do not believe that \nshould be the case.\n  Finally, preserving the programming integrity of AFRTS must be \nparamount. There is another reason totally unrelated to what we talked \nabout so far. AFRTS is a vital link between military command and troops \nand their families throughout the world. What we are saying is, if we \nhave commanders in the field who are trying to communicate messages to \nour troops--they currently can do this. And they can do this under the \nHarkin amendment. However, there would be much fewer people listening \nin the market by adjusting the market, and these messages would not get \nout.\n  Important messages are broadcast on this network, and if the \nprogramming becomes a political football and is no longer based on what \nthe troops want\n\n[[Page S12470]]\n\nbut what Congress wants, then listenership would certainly dwindle. \nMaintaining popular programming ensures that AFRTS remains a reliable \ncommunications link to our troops in the field. We cannot afford to \nplay politics with such an important asset.\n  Now, I have a second-degree amendment, and I will be offering this at \nthe expiration of the time of the Senator from Iowa. The second-degree \namendment to the Harkin amendment describes how programs are selected \nfor the American Forces Network, including reliance on ratings and \npopularity, as demonstrated by the numbers of listeners, and notes that \nreliance is placed on 33 local programming managers at military \ncommunities around the globe.\n  It would express the sense of the Senate that:\n\n       (1) the men and women of the American Forces Radio and \n     Television Service and the Armed Forces Network should be \n     commended for providing a vital service to the military \n     community worldwide; and\n       (2) the programming mission, themes, and practices of the \n     Department of Defense with respect to its television and \n     radio programming have fairly and responsively fulfilled \n     their mission of providing ``a touch of home'' to members of \n     the Armed Services and their families around the world and \n     have contributed immeasurably to high morale and quality of \n     life in the Armed Forces.\n\n  Finally, the language in my second-degree amendment provides that the \nSecretary of Defense may--may; it does not say he has to, that he must \nhave an ombudsman but he may appoint an ombudsman at AFRTS to serve \nas--this is the way we have it in the second-degree amendment--``an \nintermediary between the staff of the American Forces Network and the \nDepartment of Defense, military commanders, and listeners to the \nprogramming of the American Forces Network.'' You will find that this \nconforms to the description used to define the ombudsman at Stars and \nStripes, our military print media. It is very similar to Stars and \nStripes.\n  I find, when I am making my trips over there, they will tell me they \nhave two ways of communicating with the outside world other than their \ncommunications with their family; one is through Stars and Stripes, and \none is through the radio programming on these 33 stations.\n  Now, I would want to, at the appropriate time, go ahead and offer \nthis amendment. It is my understanding the Senator from Iowa will be \nreturning momentarily. But for a minute, I might say to the \ndistinguished chairman, let me give an observation.\n  The other day I was in the elevator coming up to the floor to cast a \nvote. I was with two of our Democratic colleagues whom I respect very \nmuch, two very liberal Democratic Senators. They were complaining about \nthe fact that all the talk shows are conservative and they don't have \nsuccessful liberal talk shows. And they said--these were their words in \nthe elevator--there ought to be a legislative fix to this. I said: What \nyou guys don't understand is, this is market driven, and there is no \nmarket for your liberal trite. And for that reason, it is much more of \nthe conservative talk shows. It is called the market, and that is what \nmakes America work.\n  I yield the floor at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to be supportive of this amendment \nof my colleague from Oklahoma. But at the same time, I do believe the \namendment by Senator Harkin is deserving of consideration. I say to my \ncolleague, my concern, is--and I wish to have the record reflect this--\nis it your understanding, having carefully examined how this is done by \nthe Armed Forces Network, that in no way are they directly or \nindirectly trying to impose any censorship?\n  Mr. INHOFE. No.\n  Mr. WARNER. That we simply cannot have.\n  Mr. INHOFE. No, we cannot have--well, actually, the Harkin amendment \nwould impose a censorship to a degree; that is, it would change the \ncriteria that, No. 1, it has to be a syndicated network, and, No. 2, it \nhas to have 1 million listeners.\n  We have shown clearly that they have lived up to that. When the two \nliberal talk shows, Ed Schultz and Al Franken, reached a million, they \nstarted including them. They are including them just as they are the \nconservative talk shows. If you impose upon them that you are going to \nhave somebody out there watching and making sure that Congress tells \nthem what is best for them, yes, that does impose a restriction on what \nour troops in the field are able to hear.\n  Mr. WARNER. I say to the distinguished Senator, let me read section 2 \nof his proposed amendment: The American Forces Radio and Television \nAmerican Forces Network provide a ``touch of home'' to members of the \narmed forces, civilian employees of the Department of Defense and their \nfamilies stationed in bases, embassies, and consulates in more than 179 \ncountries, as well as the Navy, Coast Guard, and Military Sealift \nCommand ships at sea.\n  So it reaches an entire family, and it is a very important function. \nThis Senator wants to make sure that audience, irrespective of whether \nthey are conservatives or liberals, whatever the case may be--I am not \nsure that is the right criteria we should be using--does get a touch of \nhome, which is a very wonderful expression that you have included here, \nby providing the same type--reading on--and quality of radio and \ntelevision programming, including news, information, sports, and \nentertainment, that would be available in the continental United \nStates.\n  To me, if you impose a certain market criteria, even though they may \nnot hit a certain number of listeners, you are not getting the full \nspectrum that this amendment calls for. In other words, I would prefer \nto have just this amendment that you have here be the decision by the \nSenate and then leave it up to the 33 stations to ensure that is done. \nMaybe we shouldn't condone a marketing policy that just cuts off a \nwhole lot of programs at the bottom because they don't have enough \nlisteners.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I respond to the distinguished chairman of the committee \nthat I am prepared to have it market driven.\n  Mr. WARNER. You would prefer what.\n  Mr. INHOFE. To have it purely market driven so that these kids who \nare out there, our troops risking their lives, would be able to \ndetermine what they wanted to listen to rather than having something \nimposed upon them. Ideally that is what I would prefer in a second-\ndegree amendment. But in trying to accommodate a system that has worked \npretty well, that criteria is acceptable to me. Let's don't talk about \nliberal and conservative. Let's talk about just programming. Forget \nabout what is liberal and what is conservative. If a concept is popular \nenough that it has 1 million listeners, then that should qualify for \nconsideration for our troops to listen to. That is my point.\n  Mr. WARNER. Well, I don't see anything in the language you use here \nbecause you are very explicit. By providing the same type and quality \nof radio and television programming, including news, information, \nsports, and entertainment, that would be available in the continental \nUnited States--that is what we should follow.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I agree.\n  Mr. WARNER. I don't know that we condone a marketing tool by which a \ncertain category--and it so happens that category perhaps has the \npreponderance of things which people would consider liberal. I am not \nsure we can escape totally the use of that word. It is better that we \nlet the 33 stations themselves decide what it is.\n  If a program hasn't hit a million, well, there may be some audience \nwithin the family of people you discuss here, all of the various \nlisteners and families and embassies and consulates, maybe they would \nlike to hear something even though it hasn't hit the 1 million mark.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I would respond to the Senator from Virginia that the \nonly reason I used these two charts, the accusation was made that there \nsomehow is a mechanism here that would exclude that more liberal \nphilosophy in terms of programming. This demonstrates clearly that it \ndoesn't because once they have reached that criteria, they are able to \nbe heard.\n  Mr. WARNER. It is that operative phrase of ``reach that criteria.'' \nIt seems that reaching that criteria has the effect of excluding a lot \nof programming, albeit they don't have quite the audience that others \ndo, but nevertheless, there may be some individuals\n\n[[Page S12471]]\n\nwithin this family that is set forth in the amendment that would like \nto hear it.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I think that is right. I believe that is the case. The 33 \nstations have program directors. Their goal is to maximize their \naudience. If they hear that something is in demand that might not be \nconsistent with what is in demand throughout the United States, I can \nassure you, under the current system, they will have that program.\n  Mr. WARNER. That assurance to me is important. So what you are saying \nis it would not be any indirect censorship of any particular \nphilosophical category of programming under your proposal?\n  Mr. INHOFE. That is exactly right.\n  Mr. WARNER. So your proposal does not bind them to this market \ncriteria.\n  Mr. INHOFE. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. I find that helpful. I think you have dispelled any \nthought that this amendment would impose any censorship.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. And the variety of news services--again, there are \nobviously certain news services that have a proclivity to go to a more \nconservative side and some to the liberal side, but again, are news \nservices given an equal opportunity to be heard?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes, they are.\n  Mr. WARNER. For example, I happen to like NPR, and I like to hear FOX \nNews. I like to have the juxtaposition of the different viewpoints.\n  Mr. INHOFE. In my statement, I commented that it is a very \ndisordinate amount that has been historically given to NPR in terms of \nlistening audience because they have that on for 24 hours. So certainly \nthat is already there, and that is more than the market would justify \nif we were going by the justification that the market dictates.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I might ask the Senator one last \nquestion. He makes reference to the ombudsman. How does your coverage \nof the subject of an ombudsman differ from the amendment offered by the \nSenator from Iowa?\n  Mr. INHOFE. It merely makes it optional. If the Secretary of Defense \nwants to pursue the ombudsman as a practice, then he may do it. It \ndoesn't say he shall. It says he may. It is not mandated. It is just \noptional at the discretion of the Secretary of Defense.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine. So that clarifies the sole technical distinction, \nwhich is an important one, between your second degree and the \nunderlying first degree. Therefore, it is up to the Secretary, but once \nan ombudsman is selected, assuming the Secretary opts to do so, in no \nway is that individual chartered or directed to do his work or her work \ndifferent than what the Senator from Iowa desires?\n  Mr. INHOFE. That is correct. The only difference is, it is optional.\n  Mr. WARNER. I think that is important. So could that ombudsman be \namong the existing people in the Department of Defense, have it as an \nadditional duty, or should that person be brought in from the outside \nand have the sole responsibility of ombudsman work?\n  Mr. INHOFE. It is my understanding that under the underlying \namendment by the Senator from Iowa, it is very prescribed as to how \nthis person is going to be chosen. In my amendment, it leaves it up to \nthe discretion of the Secretary of Defense. It could be someone who is \nalready existing within that Department or another department.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think that is an important flexibility. \nI am certain that within the Department, there is an individual or an \nindividual with objectivity and a background that could perform this \nwork.\n  Mr. INHOFE. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 9 minutes remaining in \nmorning business.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I would like to be recognized as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in morning business, and the \nminority has 8\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/08/senate-section/article/S12471-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12471-S12472]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 OIL COMPANY WINDFALL PROFIT TAX OFFSET\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, recently Senator Collins and I introduced an \namendment to the proposed budget reconciliation bill to fund a $2.9 \nbillion increase in the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program by \nplacing a temporary 1-year windfall profit tax on big oil companies. I \nfiled this amendment to the budget reconciliation bill to begin the \ndialog, and I intend to call for a vote on my amendment when the Senate \ndebates the tax reconciliation bill in the next few days.\n  Last week, oil companies reported record profits for the third \nquarter on surging oil prices. Chevron posted profits of $3.6 billion. \nBP's profits rose to $6.5 billion. Royal Dutch/Shell profits grew to $9 \nbillion. And ExxonMobil profits gushed up 75 percent to nearly $10 \nbillion. According to BusinessWeek, that equals $150 million in profit \nfor every working day in the past 3 months.\n  This year has been an exceptionally lucrative one for the oil \nindustry and an exceptionally impoverishing one for American families \nand seniors. Profits going to big oil are money coming out of wallets \nof working families and seniors and wealth draining out of our \ncommunities.\n  Fully funding LIHEAP is a vital imperative. I believe the big oil \ncompanies should help shoulder the cost. Rising energy prices could \nfinancially wipe out working-class families and seniors this winter. \nAmericans are experiencing extraordinarily high runups in energy prices \nthat jeopardize the ability of many families to keep their homes warm \nduring this coming winter season. Energy costs to the average family \nusing heating oil are estimated to hit $1,500 this winter, an increase \nof almost $325 over last winter's heating season. For families using \nnatural gas, prices could hit $1,000, an increase of $300.\n  For a family using propane, prices are projected to hit $1,300, an \nincrease of $230. For families living in poverty, energy bills are now \nover 20 percent of their income, compared to 5 percent for other \nhouseholds. People who are living in poverty, many of whom are working, \nare paying 20 percent of their income for heating bills. That is \ncompared to 5 percent for the rest of America's families.\n  Let me tell you what this amendment means. If we are successful, it \nwould add $2.9 billion to the LIHEAP program to bring total funding to \n$5.1 billion this winter. With $5.1 billion, the National Energy \nAssistance Directors Association estimates that LIHEAP could serve 12 \nmillion families this year. This is double the number of families \nserved last year but still only one-third of those eligible. Even with \nthis increased funding, we would not reach all the families who \nqualify, but we would reach those families who are most in need, \nparticularly in this very difficult winter heating season.\n  States could also increase the level of benefits to help these rising \ncosts, in addition to enrolling more personnel in the program.\n  This amendment means that seniors will not have to choose between \nbuying lifesaving medication and paying their natural gas bills. \nWorking families will not have to decide between putting food on the \ntable or putting heating oil in their tanks. And what is the cost of \nthis amendment to big oil? It is about 10 percent of their profits from \none quarter of 1 year, or in the case of ExxonMobil my amendment would \nrepresent just one-third of their profits for one quarter. This is a \nsmall price to pay to keep American families safe and warm this winter.\n  Two weeks ago, I wrote an open letter to the oil industry asking that \nthey act as good corporate citizens and take this step voluntarily. I \nwas pleased to hear that Senator Grassley, the distinguished chairman \nof the Finance Committee, reiterated my plea recently, and I hope that \nwe will be able to work together on this effort. I also hope that \nSenator Gregg, the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, will \njoin Senator Collins and me in our efforts to increase LIHEAP funding \nthrough this temporary windfall profits tax. I also hope the \nadministration will join our bipartisan effort to help American \nfamilies. Unfortunately, to date, the administration only appears able \nto say no to American families and seniors and yes to the oil industry.\n  Last month, Secretary Bodman said no, the administration would not \nseek\n\n[[Page S12472]]\n\nadditional funding for LIHEAP this winter. The supplemental \nappropriations request the administration sent to Congress last week \ndid not include funding.\n  Recently, Secretary Bodman, answering questions on whether the \nadministration would support oil companies voluntarily donating profits \nto LIHEAP, said, ``No, sir. I wouldn't support it. It is similar to a \ntax.''\n  In 1980, Congress enacted the Crude Oil Windfall Profits Tax Act. \nThis legislation established LIHEAP. Twenty-five years later, with \nenergy prices overwhelming workers' salaries and seniors' Social \nSecurity checks, it is time for Congress again to take action and tax \nwindfall profits to aid in energy assistance.\n  I also want to mention it is my intention that when we consider the \ntax reconciliation bill this month, I will offer an amendment to \nprovide a tax credit to working American families to help them pay for \ntheir energy bills this winter. Our Nation's priorities must be to help \nthese families, and I hope working together with my colleagues we can \nprovide that help and assistance.\n  Mr. President, I inquire how much time is remaining in morning \nbusiness on the Democratic side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes.\n  Mr. REED. I yield the remainder of the time to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, is that the extent of the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REED. In morning business.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I may clarify what the situation is, 2 \nminutes in morning business is left, and that is being allocated to the \nSenator from Massachusetts, fine, no problem there. But as I \nunderstand, the Senator from Massachusetts also wishes to address the \nLevin amendment; am I correct?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. At which time is the expiration of the 2 minutes. Then \nthe time is charged to the Levin amendment; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At the conclusion of morning business, the \nSenate will proceed to consideration of S. 1042, and the Senator then \nmay seek recognition.\n  Mr. WARNER. I hate to interrupt the Senator from Massachusetts, but \nif you have to do it, you have to do it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I intend to speak probably 7 minutes. I \nwill use the 2 minutes now and request time on the Levin amendment.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 2430\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, a year and a half ago, Americans were \nstunned by the revolting images of men and women wearing the uniform of \nour Nation torturing and abusing prisoners at Abu Ghraib.\n  At the time, we had hoped those photos pictured an isolated instance, \nbut we have learned since that our own leaders at the highest levels of \nour Government, in the White House, in the Pentagon, and in the Central \nIntelligence Agency, have allowed a wide pattern of abuse to occur. Abu \nGhraib, it seems, was only the tip of the iceberg.\n  American officials abused prisoners in Iraq, Afghanistan, and \nGuantanamo, and now we learn the CIA maintains secret prisoners in \nEastern Europe where Vice President Cheney arrogantly and \nunapologetically hopes to permit torture as a permanent part of \nAmerican policy.\n  These actions deeply offend American honor and ideals. They invite \nretribution on our own troops by those who treat them as we treat their \nprisoners, and they harm America's image around the world and make the \nwar on terror that much harder to win.\n  These abuses should not be swept under the rug and forgotten. The \nAmerican people deserve to know what their government is doing. Those \nwho have violated our norms and values under the color of the American \nflag should be held accountable.\n  That is why I strongly support the Levin amendment to create a \ncommission with responsibility for learning the truth. Its findings not \nonly would bring much needed accountability of those responsible for \nthese abuses but also would guide our handling of the detention and \ninterrogation of detainees in the future.\n  From what we have learned to date, it is clear that our political \nleaders made deliberate decisions to throw out the well-established \nlegal framework that has long made America the gold standard for human \nrights throughout the world. The Administration left our soldiers, case \nofficers, and intelligence agents in a fog of ambiguity. They were told \nto ``take the gloves off'' without knowing what the limits were. Top \nofficials in the Administration endorsed and defended practices that \nwe've condemned in other countries. And the consequences were \nforeseeable.\n  In rewriting our human rights laws, the Administration consistently \noverruled the objections of experienced military personnel and those \nwho represent American interests abroad. As Secretary of State Colin \nPowell warned the White House, ``it will reverse over a century of US \npolicy and practice in supporting the Geneva Conventions and undermine \nthe protections of the law of war for our troops.'' Senior Defense \nofficials were warned that changing the rules would lead to so-called \n``force drift,'' and without clearer guidance, the level of force \napplied to an uncooperative detainee might well result in torture.\n  But these wise words fell on deaf ears. Officials at the highest \nlevels of the administration somehow viewed the rule as inconvenient \nand quaint. As Lawrence Wilkerson, former Chief of Staff to Secretary \nPowell, said:\n\n       I don't think in our history we've ever had a presidential \n     involvement, a secretarial involvement, a vice-presidential \n     involvement, an Attorney General involvement in telling our \n     troops essentially carte blanche is the way you should feel.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank the Presiding Officer for advising \nthat the bill is now up and the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts will continue his framework remarks on behalf of Senator \nLevin, whatever time the Senator desires.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the chairman of the Armed Services Committee for \nhis typical courtesies and consideration.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2430\n\n  Mr. President, we have created legal and literal black holes where \nindividuals have been placed without hope of receiving due process or \nfair and humane treatment, and that is nothing short of a travesty.\n\n[[Page S12473]]\n\n  The warnings are all there.\n  The military's judge advocate generals--people who have dedicated \ntheir lives to the defense of the country--warned that undoing the \nrules against abuse would undermine protections for our troops.\n  The FBI warned the abuses at Guantanamo may violate longstanding \nAmerican practices and policies.\n  The International Red Cross warned that our actions violate and \nundermine international agreements that serve to protect our own troops \nwhen they are captured.\n  But the Bush White House still is doing everything it can to avoid \naccountability. Only yesterday, President Bush said that the United \nStates does not torture. Yet his own Vice President is lobbying \nCongress to allow the CIA to use these abusive techniques.\n  There is little doubt that many of those detained are cold-blooded \nkillers intent on harming Americans. They should be charged for their \ncrimes and locked away. But we do not win the war on terror by stooping \nto their level. We do not win by desecrating the very ideals that our \nsoldiers are fighting for. We win by setting an example, by doing unto \nothers as we would have them do unto us.\n  We know now that the prisoner abuse scandal is not merely the \nresponsibility of a few bad apples as the administration initially \nclaimed. We cannot simply blame a few low-ranking soldiers without \nlooking at the role of William Haynes, David Addington, Jay Bybee, John \nYoo, Timothy Flanigan, Alberto Gonzalez, and the Vice President in \ncrafting these policies that led to these abuses.\n  Mr. President, there have been 11 investigations into the treatment \nof detainees, 11, but not one has fully examined the extent to which \nofficials at the top levels of the administration are responsible for \nthese abuses, and not one has looked beyond the Pentagon to the CIA, \nthe Justice Department, and the White House itself--not the Schlesinger \nreport, not the 10 military investigations that have taken place. We \ncan no longer let the White House off the hook.\n  By refusing to act like the truth is important, the administration is \nonly making the crisis worse, further embarrassing the Nation in the \neyes of the world, and casting greater doubt on its commitment to the \nrule of law. We will not be able to move past the scandal as a nation \nuntil there is a full independent investigation of all that has gone \nwrong in our detention and interrogation policy and all the persons \nfound responsible for these policies are held accountable. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment.\n  I thank again the chairman of the committee for his indulgence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to reply to my distinguished \ncolleague from Massachusetts. It is a very strong belief within the \nSenate that simply this is not the time nor is there the need to \nestablish another 9/11 type commission. First, it would duplicate the \nthorough investigation into the matter that has already taken place by \na number of committees of the Senate. And as stated by my distinguished \nranking member yesterday, he acknowledged that our committee has had a \nvery major role in the matters and has conducted a number of hearings.\n  The Department of Defense on its own initiative has conducted 12 \nprobes of detainee operations in the last 18 months. I wish to draw the \nattention of the Senate to one of those probes because it was conducted \nby individuals who in my judgment--and I say this with no restriction \nwhatsoever--have just about as high a credibility that I know of any \npublic or former public servant; that is, James Schlesinger, former \nSecretary of Defense; Harold Brown, former Secretary of Defense; \nGeneral Hoerner, four star general of the U.S. Air Force who conducted \nthe air operations during the first gulf war, a man whom I have known \nvery well; and our distinguished and much beloved late Member of the \nCongress of the United States, Tillie Fowler. I would like to, for the \nbenefit of my colleagues, quote directly from their report. On page 5, \nthey find as follows:\n\n       There is no evidence of a policy of abuse promulgated by \n     senior officials or military authorities.\n\n  On page 66:\n\n       Despite the number of visits and intensity of interest in \n     actionable intelligence, however, the panel found no undue \n     pressure exerted by senior officials.\n\n  Mr. President, the McCain amendment, which has been adopted now twice \nby this body, is the subject of a conference now with the \nappropriations conferees. It is also on our bill, the first amendment \naccepted. This was a bipartisan call to the best instincts of our \nAmerican character. I call on the Senate to use that powerful statement \nof American values, not another commission, as our instrument of \nchange.\n  Mr. President, I would like to ask at this time the time remaining on \nthe Levin amendment----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator respond to a question?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, I would be happy to do so.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. First of all, I thank the chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee for pursuing this issue, and I am grateful for his \ninitiatives and those of Senator Levin.\n  We had the opportunity in the Judiciary Committee to also pursue this \nissue during the nomination hearings of the Attorney General, Mr. \nGonzalez, who had been the White House Counsel when the initial torture \nmemorandum was prepared. There was no question that someone in the \nCentral Intelligence Agency spoke to Mr. Gonzalez and he asked the \nOffice of Legal Counsel in the Justice Department for advice about how \nto define the parameters of torture--of torture. And they received back \na very detailed note from the Office of Legal Counsel. In that \nparticular memorandum, known as the Bybee memorandum, was the legal \nguidance for the DOD. It effectively indicated that using any kinds of \ntechniques on any individuals were permitted, as long as the intention \nwas to get information and not to torture.\n  Mr. Gonzalez was asked extensively about that memo. We asked about \nthe author of that memo. And we then received--during the hearing--a \nrevision of that torture memo by the Defense Department. For 2 years, \nthe Bybee memo had been out there. That memorandum effectively absolved \nany members of the armed services that were involved in torture because \nthey were doing the work of the Commander in Chief. Under that \nparticular memorandum, if you were working under the Commander in \nChief, you were effectively protected against any kind of prosecution \nin the future.\n  That memorandum was withdrawn by the Justice Department and the \nDepartment of Defense. But it was in effect for 2 years. We don't know \nwhat the background was. We never found out in the Judiciary Committee \nwho in the Central Intelligence Agency asked for that memorandum. We \nnever found out what the contacts were between the agency and the \nOffice of Legal Counsel. We never found that out. We never have found \nout whether it was repudiated by the Central Intelligence Agency.\n  Those questions are still unanswered, I say to the Senator from \nVirginia. This enormous collection of studies that was done primarily \nfor the Armed Services Committee is virtually free of any discussion, \nknowledge, or accountability of the Bybee memorandum, which is the \nbasis for the policy of torture within the Defense Department. That is \njust one illustration of what took place. The American people are \npermitted, I think, to understand who was making judgments and \ndecisions so that this memorandum was put in place, which basically \npermitted torture to take place. We are talking about waterboarding, \nand we are talking about being the target of military dogs. That was \nall out there.\n  If the Senator can give me the authority for that kind of activity, \nfor that kind of guidance, we would be much more interested in \nlistening to the argument that we have had all of these studies, we \nknow everything that needs to be known, when I don't believe that is \nthe case.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will answer and charge my time to my \nside. The time of the Senator from Massachusetts will be charged to the \nLevin amendment on his side. That is my understanding; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n[[Page S12474]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I should like to reply. If I can get \nclarification, I am not sure I understood one word that I think is \nimportant. Did the Senator mean ``absolved'' or ``absorbed''?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Absolved. This is the Bybee memorandum that was the \nbasis for much of the torture activity that took place. A substantial \npart of it was included in the military working document which was \nreleased to the members of the military in all parts of the world.\n  I haven't had a chance to mention this particular item, and there are \nmany different items in the whole torture issue, but if the Senator \nwanted to respond later on, I would certainly welcome it. One of the \nmost troublesome aspects of the whole issue on torture is that we still \nhave no way of knowing who put this in, who guided this, who got in \ntouch with the Office of Legal Counsel, what were those phone calls, \nwho was asking for this, and why it was put into effect for 2 years.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, do I understand this document is in the \narchives of the Judiciary Committee; is that correct?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes, it is called the Bybee memorandum.\n  Mr. WARNER. Is it a matter that is subject to classification?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. No, it is in the record of the consideration of Mr. \nGonzales for Attorney General.\n  Mr. WARNER. So, Mr. President, the document speaks for itself?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. I simply say, I don't have firsthand knowledge of all of \nthe important oversight that was conducted by the Judiciary Committee. \nThe Senator does raise fundamental questions about this policy, but I \nwill only say, as recently as in the past few days, our President has \nreassured our Nation that we do not tolerate or permit torture. I would \nhave to believe that is a consistency of the policy of the \nadministration. Not having examined this document, I would hope there \nwould be a continuity of that throughout the administration.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I know time is running short, but the \npoint is, during this period of time, those same assurances were given. \nAnd what was being done at that particular time was also described as \nnot meeting the criteria of torture. That was the troublesome aspect. \nAlthough when asked during the course of the hearing about the \nwaterboarding and assault by dogs and other activities, I think the \nresponse of the military officials who were asked about it was that \ncould fall within the definition of torture.\n\n  Given the history of how the word ``torture'' has been used and \nlooking at the Bybee memorandum which was the guidance for DOD, I think \nthere are some very legitimate questions which we are very hopeful that \nan independent commission can resolve.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I hope my colleague will concur that the \nMcCain amendment, which has been adopted by this Chamber on two \noccasions, would be dispositive of any confliction as to the \ndefinitions as to the future; would I not be correct on that \nassumption?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Certainly it would, as far as I am concerned. I think \nwith this commission we are trying to avoid these circumstances in the \nfuture, given the facts we have seen in the past.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to my colleague and distinguished \nmember of the Armed Services Committee, to avoid it in the future, that \nis precisely the objective of the McCain amendment, to prevent any \nrecurrence. I am not suggesting I corroborate that there have been \ndeviations; I simply say that is a landmark piece of legislation with \nregard to the future. And it would be, as I said in my remarks a few \nminutes ago, the guidepost for the future to resolve this issue.\n  Our military has had a great history of correcting through its \nlessons learned the procedures for the future. The Department of \nDefense has already implemented substantial reforms in response to its \ninteractions with Congress on these investigations. The areas of \nconcern involving the intelligence community, ghost detainees, and \nrenditions are more appropriately addressed, of course, in the Select \nCommittee on Intelligence.\n  Mr. President, I simply ask that all Senators be informed as to the \ntime remaining on the Levin amendment on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 10 minutes in opposition and 3 \nminutes under Senator Levin's control.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I indicate to my colleagues that I would \nbe prepared to, at a future time, to yield back our time so we can move \nto a vote on the Levin amendment as early as possible. So there is 3 \nminutes remaining, as I understand, under the control of the Senator \nfrom Michigan?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent on behalf of \nSenator Inhofe to modify his proposed second-degree amendment. It is at \nthe desk and being filed in relation to Senator Harkin's amendment. \nThis is a technical change.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Consent is not required. The Senator's \namendment is not pending.\n  Mr. WARNER. I realize that, but can we at this time substitute a \nrevised document for the one that is being held at the desk? The \nParliamentarian brought it to the attention of Senator Inhofe, and it \nis my understanding he followed the guidance of the Parliamentarian on \nthis technical modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The changes will be made.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Presiding Officer and the Parliamentarian and \nother staff who facilitated this.\n  Mr. President, we are anxious to continue to work on this bill. I \nwonder if the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island can indicate what \nhopefully will occur this afternoon from his side of the aisle? One of \nhis distinguished staff members handed us a sheet.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, the intention this afternoon, awaiting \nSenator Levin's return, is we will discuss further the Dorgan amendment \non a Truman Commission approach and then a Byrd amendment with respect \nto a second Deputy Secretary of Defense for Management, I believe, and \nthen Senator Nelson and others in regard to the SPD offset amendment. \nSo we are prepared to return at 2:15 p.m. and continue to work on the \nbill.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, also, the distinguished Senator from Rhode \nIsland has an amendment with regard to missile defense. Might I inquire \nas to the remainder of time on each side on that issue?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island has 19 minutes. \nThe Senator from Virginia has 13 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Presiding Officer. It is our intention that \nthe distinguished Senator from Alaska, Mr. Stevens, will utilize \nlargely the remainder of the time on this side, and then I hope we can \nbring that important amendment to a vote.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I look forward to Senator Stevens' comments \nand reserve time for myself and others to make additional comments and \nthen move to a vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I hope to be joined by my colleague from \nMichigan this afternoon. We will do our very best to keep the Senate \nmoving without quorum calls to conclude the amendments, each side \nhaving 12, and also the managers approving a number of reconciled \namendments on both sides. I anticipate a vigorous procedure this \nafternoon on behalf of this bill, moving toward third reading at the \nearliest possible date, which is the decision that the majority and \nDemocratic leaders will eventually make.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to use 6 minutes \nof the time that is allocated to Senator Harkin on the amendment that \nis pending, if in fact the Harkin amendment is now pending. I believe \nit is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. It is the pending \namendment. The Senator is recognized.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2438\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Harkin amendment is a very simple\n\n[[Page S12475]]\n\namendment. Let me describe it. We have something called Armed Forces \nRadio and Television Service, AFRTS, a worldwide radio and television \nbroadcast. It serves a million American service men and women and their \nfamilies stationed at bases and American diplomatic posts in 179 \ncountries around the world.\n  Armed Forces Radio and Television is paid for with taxpayers' \ndollars. It is a wonderful service to our troops and the families who \nare stationed overseas and at diplomatic posts. One of the questions \nthat we raised recently was the question of programming on Armed Forces \nRadio and Television, not that anyone would want to censor any \nprogramming, far from it, but the question of whether there is balance \nand diversity on the programming that is on these stations.\n  I visited with a woman named Allison Barber, who is apparently in \ncharge of some of this. She actually came to my office and we visited. \nAnd we spoke on the phone earlier this year. I have since tried to \nreach her again, unsuccessfully, with I think three or four telephone \ncalls. First, she was traveling in Europe. She is back but not \nreturning her telephone calls at this point.\n  I talked to Allison Barber because I felt they were doing the troops \na service by providing a certain kind of programming. They have \nconservative talk shows on Armed Forces Radio and Television, Armed \nForces Radio specifically, which is fine. Some of them are enormously \nsuccessful, entertaining, have a wide listener audience, and that makes \na great deal of sense that they would offer that to the troops abroad. \nThe question I asked Allison Barber is, If you are going to offer \nconservative talk shows, do you not think that you would want to offer \na counterbalance so that the troops abroad would have both sides of \nissues?\n  The reason I asked that is when I began to look at what the 33 local \nstations in Armed Forces Radio broadcast, it was this: Of the \nprogramming that is essentially political programming or defined as \nconservative programming, there was 100 percent on the conservative \nside and nothing on the progressive side.\n  I said: Well, I would never suggest that conservative programming be \ntaken off. I think it is probably there because it is entertaining, \ninteresting, well done, and the troops want to hear it. Do you not \nthink, since our country is split very close to 50-50 in terms of \npolitical preference, the other side might well be represented? In \nfact, are not your rules such that they say--I am talking about the \ndirectives now that the Department of Defense refers to--the political \nprogramming shall be characterized by its fairness and balance? How \nwould one characterize this as fairness and balance? One cannot.\n  The amendment offered by Senator Harkin does not suggest anybody ever \nbe taken off the air. Continue to air all of these things but provide \nboth sides of political dialogue, which is not the case today. That is \nwhat my colleague says should be done. I agree with him.\n  Our colleague from Oklahoma comes to the Senate floor and talks about \na second-degree amendment. He says, I kind of like what is going on \nnow. Boy, I would guess he would. He belongs to a political party that \nis heavily supported by the programming on Armed Forces Radio. I can \nwell understand why he would enjoy that sort of decision.\n  I believe Allison Barber, the Department of Defense, and all of those \ninvolved in selecting programming should do both things. They ought to \nprovide this kind of programming, conservative talk shows and the rest, \nto the troops in the field and their families, and they ought to \nprovide what their directive requires, fairness and balance, so that \nthe other side has the same opportunity to be heard by those troops and \ntheir families. That is not now the case. That case does not now exist. \nMy colleague from Iowa has offered an amendment that would begin to \nremedy this.\n  I know this debate will be characterized by the talk shows on the far \nright as trying to take them off the air. Nothing could be further from \nthe truth. I do not recommend that for a moment. I simply believe that \nAllison Barber and the others involved in these decisions have a \nresponsibility. The responsibility is to provide balance in the \npolitical programming on the Armed Forces Radio system that is paid for \nby the American taxpayer, so that all of those who have access to that \nradio signal have access to balanced programming, both sides being \nheard.\n  The other thing is--I assume it is a joke. I assume it is a joke, but \nI cannot be sure because I have heard it more than once. My colleague \nfrom Oklahoma says: Well, Rush Limbaugh is balanced by National Public \nRadio. How one could actually make that assertion without openly \nlaughing is hard for me to understand. That surely must be a joke. \nNational Public Radio does not counterbalance rightwing talk. National \nPublic Radio, if there is something in this country that is fair and \nbalanced--National Public Radio is not about political programming on \nthe right or the left.\n  We hear a lot of excuses. The question is, Will the Armed Forces \nRadio system do what is required of them in their directive? The answer \napparently is no. So what my colleague from Iowa would do would be to \ncodify in law what the directive now requires them to do, but what they \nnow fail to do.\n  So that is the amendment. It is simple and fair. I do not see how \nanyone could possibly oppose that amendment. I would hope that we will \nhave a successful vote on it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator yield for a question? Could he put the \nchart back up?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia will suspend. The \nSenator from North Dakota is out of time. Would the Senator from \nVirginia like to be recognized on his time?\n  Mr. WARNER. I will be recognized and would hope that the reply of the \nSenator could be brief.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has 23 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. The zero on the chart, I want to make very clear my \nposition. I do not want any censorship imposed by the Department of \nDefense in utilizing taxpayer dollars to promulgate this programming, \nwhich is so important. The Inhofe second-degree amendment sets forth \nthe wide range of recipients. It is uniformed people. It is their \nfamilies. It is embassy people. It is their families. It is consulates. \nQuite a spectrum is served by this important outlet.\n  If the Senator can point to where there is any censorship, I would \nlike to address it. I have engaged my distinguished colleague in this \ncolloquy as well. Does anyone make an assertion that there is \ncensorship taking place?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Well, if the Senator would allow me to respond, let me \npropose an idea which I have proposed to Armed Forces Radio. I said, \nWhat about putting someone on from this side with a progressive talk \nshow that would counterbalance this? The answer apparently is, no. So \nwould that not suggest that they are censoring this side of the aisle, \ncensoring this side of the political debate? Is that not censorship?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think the Senator is endeavoring to \nanswer while it may not be direct and overt, indirectly there could be \nfactual situations that would constitute some sort of censorship. For \nexample, I happen to listen to a wide spectrum--I am sure each of us in \nthis body does. I enjoy programs from Rush Limbaugh to NPR, but NPR has \nalways been associated with, should we say, a bit of the left side.\n  I understand NPR is broadcast on AFR, and yet the zero percent would \nindicate that program is not considered to be somewhat counterbalancing \nof the others.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if I might respond.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is an unbelievable assertion. I have great respect \nfor the Senator from Virginia, but it is unbelievable. I, too, drive \ndown the road, and on my radio, for example, would listen to Rush \nLimbaugh, very entertaining, very smart. It is a program a lot of \npeople listen to. What he does is, he relentlessly kicks the living \ndaylights out of the opposite party. Is that found on NPR?\n  The implication and the suggestion on the Senate floor and elsewhere \nthat\n\n[[Page S12476]]\n\nNPR is some sort of leftwing political show is absolute rubbish. I am \nsorry. It is absolute nonsense. I am so tired of hearing it.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I did not mean to engender the ire of my \ngood friend. I am simply stating factually, to me, NPR is a very \nbalanced--I have often been on it myself and they have this sort of a \nformat, the modulation of the voices is always quite subdued on NPR. \nNow, Rush Limbaugh, indeed--occasionally, I listen to him and it is \ncertainly not a modulated voice. He is very forceful in getting his \npoints across, but it is not for the Senate to arbitrate the voice \nintonation between the different programs. I am simply talking about \ncontent, putting aside the means by which it is delivered.\n  It seems to me it is a question of content, and it seems to me NPR is \na very--I would use the words ``reasonably balanced'' but a little bit \non the left side of the equation more than on the right side of the \nequation. I find it somewhat misleading that the Senator puts a zero up \nthere, which applies to the NPR.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I do not know if the Senator is willing to \nlend me more time, I would just say this to the Senator: There is one \nperson in public service who tried to demonstrate what the Senator just \nsaid, and that is that National Public Radio is inherently biased. He \njust resigned last week. His name is Kenneth Tomlinson. Why did he \nresign? Because the Inspector General took a look at what he did. He \nhired some nut case from Indiana to do an evaluation of programming on \nNPR. The guy was so unprofessional--by the way, he was sending his \nreports from the fax of a Hallmark shop in Indiana, paid Federal money \nfor it, Federal funds for it, inappropriately, a guy who had no \nexperience and a guy who was a rightwinger who came up with the \nconcoction that somehow NPR was not balanced. It is unbelievable that \nwe keep hearing this nonsense.\n  Look, Rush Limbaugh has a fine radio program. A lot of people listen \nto it. I admire his capabilities. I just believe that our troops ought \nto be able to hear both sides of this debate on radio, and that is not \nnow the case. That is the only point I make. The Senator should not \nsuggest that National Public Radio somehow leans to the left or jumps \nto the left, or because it has a modulated voice is leftwing. It is \nnot. It is the only fair and balanced radio program out there, in my \njudgment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it seems to me that I have engendered a \nspirited debate that I had no intention of doing. So I would drop the \nissue. I do not intend to be an expert on the political content. \nClearly, Rush Limbaugh does have a strong preference for the more \nconservative issues, but I cannot believe that there are not some \nprograms that have a strong bent for issues which are other than \nconservative, call them what one wishes. It seems to me that zero \npercent is something that is indefensible, and we will leave it at \nthat.\n\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Iowa on the floor.\n  It is his amendment. I yield the floor at this time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 7 minutes 46 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will yield 1 minute 46 seconds more to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me say to my colleague from Virginia, \nI do not mean to be irritated about this at all. My only point is this. \nI believe there are wonderful, talented people on the political right \nwho are on the radio. They are very successful. Good for them. I \nbelieve there are talented people on the other side of the political \nspectrum who are on the radio dial. Good for them. Both ought to have \nan equal opportunity to be heard with respect to Armed Forces Radio \nprogramming. That is the point of it.\n  They are not now. Those on the progressive side are prevented from \ngetting on that dial. We believe that is wrong with respect to a \ntaxpayer-funded radio network. We believe it is inappropriate for the \ntroops not to have access to both sides. The amendment of Senator \nHarkin, the one I cosponsored, is very simple. It says keep all these \nfolks on, the conservative side, good for them; but put on the other \nside as well, be fair to them, so the troops have a chance to hear both \nsides. My friend from Virginia is a good friend, and I didn't mean at \nall to be irritated, but the NPR allegation does sort of spark my \ninterest from time to time. We will talk about that at some point \nlater.\n  My hope is we can fill in this gap and have our soldiers have a \ngenerous discussion on both sides of the political system with radio \nprogramming from the right and the left. That does not now happen, and \nI believe it should on a radio program that is funded by the American \ntaxpayer.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 6 minutes 18 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield myself a couple of minutes because I want to save \nsome time.\n  A little history is in order here. In 1993, then-Representative \nRobert Dornan of California, along with 69 other Republican House \nMembers, sent a letter to Secretary of Defense Les Aspin demanding that \nLimbaugh's radio show and his television show be broadcast to the \nmilitary.\n  The Pentagon at that time pointed to an internal survey they had done \nof 50,000 military listeners. They found that only 4 percent requested \nmore talk shows. The overwhelming number of respondents requested \ncontinuous music, as you might expect from our people in uniform. \nHowever, the issue kept getting pressed.\n  On November 29, 1993, the American Armed Forces Radio issued this \nstatement. This is their statement.\n\n       The Rush Limbaugh show makes no pretense that his show is \n     balanced. If AFRTS scheduled a program of personal commentary \n     without balancing it with another viewpoint, we would be open \n     to broad criticism that we are supporting a particular point \n     of view.\n\n  They went ahead and put Rush Limbaugh on the air. But the point is, \nthat is all right, but they have done nothing to balance it in the \nintervening time.\n  There is an amendment that I believe is going to be offered by \nSenator Inhofe--at least he was talking about it earlier. We will talk \nabout more later if, indeed, he does offer it. But getting back to this \npoint on the National Public Radio, I don't think you will ever hear \nNPR in its commentary say that the Abu Ghraib prison abuse was a \nfraternity prank or the humiliation of the inmates there `` . . . was a \nbrilliant maneuver, no different than what happens at the Skull and \nBones initiation at Yale.'' I don't think you will ever hear NPR in its \ncommentary describe images of torture as ``pictures of homo-eroticism \nthat looks like standard, good old American pornography.'' This is all \nthat Rush Limbaugh said. You won't hear that on NPR.\n  Last, a group called Fairness and Accuracy In Reporting analyzed the \npolitical affiliation of guests appearing last summer on NPR's most \npopular news shows. Republicans outnumbered Democrats on NPR by 61 \npercent to 38 percent. So I rest my case that NPR is nothing like the \nRush Limbaugh show.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the parliamentary situation is--how much \ntime remains in opposition?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 17 minutes that remain in opposition.\n  Mr. WARNER. And the Senator from Iowa?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 3 minutes 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. WARNER. Senator Inhofe was on the floor earlier today. It was his \nintention to offer a second-degree amendment. I wonder if I can make a \nunanimous consent request that I now raise that second-degree \namendment, put it on your underlying amendment, and then 30 minutes is \nnow allocated, 15 to the distinguished Senator and 15 more to this \nside. That would enable you to have more time within which to debate. \nSo you would not lose the minutes that you have.\n  I now make a unanimous consent request. I offer the Inhofe amendment \nin the second degree at this time with the understanding the time \nremaining on both sides would be added to the 30 minutes additional \ntime.\n\n[[Page S12477]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object, if I could say to my \nfriend from Virginia, for a point of clarification, there was some \ndiscussion about this amendment and the fact that, since there are two \napproaches here, one is a sense of the Senate and one is my approach, \nperhaps it would be better if we could have side-by-side votes; that \nMr. Inhofe would go first and I would go second. Does the chairman \nenvision that?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I want to follow the regular parliamentary \nprocedure. The unanimous consent--we have a perfect right to put the \nsecond-degree on, but I am trying to keep the continuity of the debate \ngoing rather than you extinguishing your 3 minutes. I prefer we \ncontinue with the amendment at this time, being the pending amendment, \nwith the understanding that the 3 minutes remaining on Senator Harkin's \ntime be added to his 15, giving him 18; our 17 be added to the 15 that \nwe have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2439 to Amendment No. 2438\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the second-degree \namendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], for Mr. Inhofe, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2439.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. __. AMERICAN FORCES NETWORK.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The mission of the American Forces Radio and Television \n     Service (AFRTS) and its American Forces Network (AFN), a \n     worldwide radio and television broadcast network, is to \n     deliver command information by providing United States \n     military commanders overseas and at sea with a broadcast \n     media that effectively communicates information to personnel \n     under their commands, including information from the \n     Department of Defense, information from the Armed Forces, and \n     information unique to the theater and localities in which \n     such personnel are stationed or deployed.\n       (2) The American Forces Radio and Television Service and \n     the American Forces Network provide a ``touch of home'' to \n     members of the Armed Forces, civilian employees of the \n     Department of Defense, and their families stationed at bases \n     and at embassies and consulates in more than 179 countries, \n     as well as Navy, Coast Guard, and Military Sealift Command \n     ships at sea, by providing the same type and quality of radio \n     and television programming (including news, information, \n     sports, and entertainment) that would be available in the \n     continental United States. Additionally, the American Forces \n     Network plays an important role in enabling military \n     commanders to disseminate official information to members of \n     the Armed Forces and their families, thus making popularity \n     and acceptance key factors in ensuring effective \n     communication.\n       (3) It is American Forces Radio and Television Service and \n     American Forces Network policy that, except for the Pentagon \n     Channel service, programming is acquired from distributors of \n     the most popular television program airing in the continental \n     United States. Much of the programming is provided at no cost \n     to the United States Government. The remainder of the \n     programming is provided at less-than-market rates to cover \n     distributors' costs and obligations. Depending on the \n     audience segment or demographic targeted, programs that \n     perform well are acquired and scheduled to maximize audiences \n     for internal and command information exposure.\n       (4) American Forces Radio and Television Service and \n     American Forces Network select programming that represents a \n     cross-section of popular American radio and television, \n     tailored toward the worldwide audience of the American Forces \n     Radio and Television Service and the American Forces Network. \n     Schedules emulate programming practices in the United States, \n     and programs are aired in accordance with network broadcast \n     standards. Specifically, policy on programming seeks--\n       (A) to provide balance and diversity;\n       (B) to deliver a cross-section of popular programming;\n       (C) to target appropriate demographics; and\n       (D) to maintain network broadcast standards.\n       (5) The ``Voice Channel'', or radio programming, of the \n     American Forces Radio and Television Service and American \n     Forces Network is chosen to address requirements specified by \n     the military broadcasting services and the detachment \n     commanders of their affiliate radio stations. American Forces \n     Network Radio makes a best faith effort to obtain the top-\n     rated program of its sort at the time of selection, at no \n     cost to the United States Government. American Forces Network \n     Radio usually retains a scheduled program until it is no \n     longer produced, too few American Forces Network affiliates \n     choose to schedule the program locally, or a similar program \n     so thoroughly dominates its audience in the United States \n     that the American Forces Radio and Television Service \n     switches to this program to offer the higher rated show to \n     the overseas audience.\n       (6) American Forces Network Radio personnel review the \n     major trade publications to monitor announcements of new \n     programs, follow the ratings of established programs, and \n     keep aware of programming trends. When a program addressing a \n     need identified by a Military Broadcasting Service or an \n     American Forces Network affiliate becomes available to the \n     American Forces Network, or a program seems especially worthy \n     of consideration, American Forces Network Radio informs the \n     affiliates and supplies samples to gauge affiliate interest. \n     If affiliates commit to broadcasting the new show, American \n     Forces Network Radio seeks to schedule it.\n       (7) The managers of the American Forces Radio and \n     Television Service continually update their programming \n     options and, in November 2005, decided to include additional \n     programs that meet the criteria that American Forces Radio \n     and Television Service managers apply to such decisions, and \n     that, consistent with American Forces Radio and Television \n     Service and American Forces Network procedures, local \n     programmers at 33 locations around the globe decide which \n     programs actually are broadcast. American Forces Radio and \n     Television Service have consistently sought to provide a \n     broad, high quality range of choices for local station \n     managers.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the men and women of the American Forces Radio and \n     Television Service and the Armed Forces Network should be \n     commended for providing a vital service to the military \n     community worldwide; and\n       (2) the programming mission, themes, and practices of the \n     Department of Defense with respect to its television and \n     radio programming have fairly and responsively fulfilled \n     their mission of providing a ``touch of home'' to members of \n     the Armed Forces and their families around the world and have \n     contributed immeasurably to high morale and quality of life \n     in the Armed Forces.\n       (c) Authority To Appoint Ombudsman as Intermediary.--The \n     Secretary of Defense may appoint an individual to serve as \n     ombudsman of the American Forces Network. Any ombudsman so \n     appointed shall act as an intermediary between the staff of \n     the American Forces Network and the Department of Defense, \n     military commanders, and listeners to the programming of the \n     American Forces Network.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I might ask my distinguished colleague, \nwe debated the Inhofe amendment at some length this morning. Could the \nSenator, for purposes of helping Senators who are following this \ndebate, describe exactly what the difference is? There is one rather \nsignificant and technical difference, and that is the sense-of-the-\nSenate amendment by the Senator from Oklahoma would allow the ombudsman \nto be at the discretion of the Secretary of Defense, as opposed to your \namendment, which would make it mandatory. Am I correct in that?\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Putting aside the procedure on which the ombudsman is put \nin place, is there any distinction between what the duties of the \nombudsman would be under the Inhofe second-degree and the underlying \nfirst-degree?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I think I have a copy of the Inhofe amendment in front of \nme.\n  Mr. WARNER. Let's make certain the Senator does have a copy.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If I have the correct one?\n  Mr. WARNER. It was simply a technical correction to an earlier \namendment, I say to the Senator.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would say to my friend--if the chairman will yield so I \ncan respond?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. As I read the Inhofe amendment, all it says is that:\n\n       The Secretary of Defense may appoint an individual to serve \n     as ombudsman . . . to act as an intermediary between the \n     staff of the American Forces Network and the Department of \n     Defense, military commanders, and listeners to the \n     programming of the American Forces Network.\n\n  That is all it says. It doesn't say what his duties are.\n  My amendment specifically says that the ombudsman will do these \nthings:\n\n       Appointed by the Secretary of Defense for a term of 5 \n     years; not engage in any prebroadcast censorship; conduct \n     regular reviews of the integrity, balance and fairness; \n     respond to program issues raised by the audience regarding \n     the network's programming; refer complaints to AFR \n     management; make suggestions regarding ways to correct \n     imbalances; and prepare an annual report both to the SECDEF \n     and Congress.\n\n  So my amendment spells out what the ombudsman should do. The Inhofe \namendment does not.\n\n[[Page S12478]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Does your amendment permit the Secretary to select the \nombudsman within the current personnel structure of the Department of \nDefense or must he go outside the Department to get that individual?\n  Mr. HARKIN. The way the amendment is written, the Secretary has full \ndiscretion. He can go outside or stay inside.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator. One last question. I am still \ntroubled by the chart you put up showing zero. My understanding is that \nthe Department of Defense has added the following three programs to the \nbody of programs that each of the 33 individual stations can select \nfrom. I am not that familiar with the details of each. Perhaps the \nSenator from Iowa can help me. The ``Ed Shultz Show,'' that is new this \nmonth; the ``Al Franken Show,'' which is new this month; and the ``Sean \nHannity Show,'' which is new this month, where would they fall in the \ncontext of the zero which is on this chart which you have shown to the \nSenate?\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator would yield, I will respond. I am familiar \nwith the first two. Who is the third one?\n  Mr. WARNER. Sean Hannity.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am told he's the second most popular conservative talk \nshow. I don't know where that falls in. The first two are Shultz and \nFranken. They are more on the progressive side, no doubt about that. \nThe third one you mention is on the conservative side, I guess. I don't \nknow that so I cannot speak authoritatively on that. I don't know how \nthat balance works out after that. I don't know.\n  I know my information--and it is really secondhand; I can't say this \nfirsthand--is that the ``Ed Shultz Show'' was contacted to be on. Then \nhe was recontacted saying that he was not to be on. And it is sort of \nin kind of a state of limbo now. I don't understand what that is all \nabout.\n  Mr. WARNER. In the interests of moving forward on the floor, Senator \nInhofe will be available following the recess we are going to take for \npurposes of the respective caucuses. I wonder if we, given that there \nis significant time remaining now on the Inhofe amendment, might go to \nanother matter in such a way that we could engage Senator Inhofe more \ndirectly, on behalf of his amendment, with the distinguished Senator \nfrom Iowa?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the chairman. The chairman is a leader and is \nvery fair himself. I have no objection to moving to something else.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator. I see the distinguished Senator from \nAlaska at this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2427\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I strongly oppose the Levin amendment, \nwhich would eliminate all funding for long-lead items for the ground-\nbased interceptors Nos. 31 through 40, and funding for the silos for \nthose missiles.\n  Realigning funding from this program would have significant impact, \nsignificant consequences for our national missile defense system.\n  In addition to breaking the production line for these interceptors, \nit would add an additional $270 million to the cost of the program. \nFurther, it would delay emplacement of the additional interceptors by \nat least 1 year. I do not believe we can afford that delay in our \nnational missile defense system.\n  Reducing interceptor quantities places second and third tier \nindustrial-based suppliers at a substantial risk of exiting the \nmanufacturing of components for the interceptors. They are currently \nmanufacturing these. If there is a delay, those small businesses would \nhave to leave that system. It will increase the probability of \ncomponent quality problems because new suppliers would have to be \nfound. We should not interrupt this system. This amendment would break \nthis production line and affect the subcontractors all along the line. \nMy great concern is that quality and process improvement efforts that \nwere initiated by the Missile Defense Agency would be significantly \nimpacted if this amendment were agreed to.\n  Replacing and recertifying component suppliers would further increase \ninterceptor costs by millions of dollars and take a minimum of 1 year \nto accomplish. That would delay the fielding of the additional \ncapabilities for these warfighters.\n  This amendment realigns funding from missile defense to the \nCooperative Threat Reduction Program, which is called CTR. That has \nbeen fully funded at the administration's request and at the \nadministration's amount. There remains a large unobligated balance \nwithin the CTR account and a very large undisbursed balance. It is \nalmost $1 billion. I cannot justify adding additional funding to the \nprogram at the expense of the Missile Defense Program which has \nessential requirements when there is already a surplus in that account. \nThe threat is real and imminent, as General Cartwright has testified. \nGeneral Cartwright is the commander of the U.S. Strategic Command. The \nCIA and the DIA assess that North Korea is ready to flight test an ICBM \nthat could reach the United States. That is of critical importance to \nthose who live in Alaska. We are closer than any other State to that \nthreat. Iran may have such capability by the middle of the next decade, \naccording to DIA.\n  Despite recent test failures, the technology is mature enough to \nproceed with fielding even while we continue to test and improve \nreliability. That is the genius of this system. We have fielded it and, \nif necessary, we can use it. We are perfecting it as we go. The \nfailures were the result of quality control issues and they do not \nundermine our confidence that the hit-to-kill technology works. It \nshould be in place.\n  An independent review team has recently concluded that the ground-\nbased midcourse system's design is sound and is capable of providing a \ndefense against long-range ballistic missiles such as the one I \ndescribed we think is being tested in North Korea.\n  In a hearing before our Senate Committee on Appropriations, General \nCartwright described the missile defense system as a ``thin line \nsystem.'' Additional interceptors will help the warfighters better \ndefend against ballistic missile attack. According to the warfighters, \na primary system limitation is there are too few interceptors. This \namendment will delay the ones that should be in place during this \nfiscal year.\n  I urge the Senate to defeat this amendment. We should not reduce \nfunding for the Missile Defense Program at this critical juncture. We \nneed to test the program, improve it, and continue testing. We should \nnot stop production by realigning funding from the missile defense \nsystem, particularly putting it into account when there is almost $1 \nbillion surplus already.\n  The Missile Defense Program, in my judgment, is vital to the security \nof this country. We should not cause further delay. I strongly urge the \nSenate to vote against this amendment and reject this reduction in \ntransfer to an account that does not need the money.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \n2006 National Defense Authorization Act. Let me begin my comments by \npaying tribute to the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Armed \nServices and the able ranking minority Member. They have worked very \nhard with all who are privileged to serve under their leadership to \ncraft this important bill.\n  In the interests of time, I will focus my remarks today on three \nparticular provisions. First, those providing $9.1 billion for an \nessential shipbuilding priorities; second, the provisions offered by \nSenator McCain, which I am proud to cosponsor, to provide standards for \nthe treatment of detainees; and third, the amendment I am pleased to \njoin my colleague, the senior Senator from Maine, in offering having to \ndeal with conveyances of closed bases.\n  This bill authorized $9.1 billion for shipbuilding. It also includes \na provision to prohibit the use of funds by the Navy to conduct a one-\nshipyard acquisition strategy to procure the next generation DD(X) \ndestroyers. Not only does this bill fully fund the President's budget \nrequest for the DD(X) program, but it also provides, at my request, an \nadditional $50 million for advance procurement of the second ship in \nthe DD(X) class at Bath Iron Works in my home State of Maine. I am \nunderstandably very proud of the skilled workers at Bath Iron Works and \ntheir contribution to our Nation's defense.\n\n[[Page S12479]]\n\n  This authorization for DD(X) funding aligns the Senate-passed \nappropriations bill, and our bill parallels the appropriations bill \nwith this funding.\n  The high priority placed on shipbuilding in the Senate's version of \nthe Defense authorization legislation stands in stark contrast to the \nHouse Defense authorization bill which actually rescinds $84 billion in \nfunds designated for Bath Iron Works, the detailed design work on the \nDD(X) I secured as part of the Defense legislation signed into law \nlast year. The House version also slashes funding for the DD(X) program \ncontrary to what was proposed in the President's budget.\n\n  These misplaced priorities remain even when the former Chief of Naval \nOperations, Admiral Clark, has testified repeatedly that the Navy's \nrequirements for the next generation destroyer are clear. I look \nforward to working with the other Members of the Senate Committee on \nArmed Services to resolve this important issue in our conference.\n  I now turn to the issue of the treatment of detainees. The vast \nmajority of our troops carry out their dangerous and difficult missions \nwith fairness, compassion, and courage. To them, the actions of those \nwho have been accused of torture against detainees are demoralizing and \nmake the difficult task they have been assigned immeasurably more \ndifficult. Critics of abuse at detention facilities operated by the \nU.S. military have attributed this abuse not only to the criminal \nactions of individual military personnel--and, again, that is not the \nvast majority of our troops--but also to the lack of clear guidance \nacross the U.S. Government for the treatment of detainees. Senator \nMcCain's amendment provides that clear guidance. I am proud to be a \ncosponsor.\n  Finally, let me comment very briefly on the amendment offered by my \ncolleague from Maine. It only adds insult to injury to require a \ncommunity to have to pay for the property involved in a base closure. \nSurely we can work with our communities in a more cooperative way to \nenable them to pursue the economic development that is necessary to \nmake a closed military installation a productive part of the community \nonce again. It is the least we owe these communities struggling with \nbase closures throughout the United States. I hope we can work out \nsomething on that amendment.\n  The bill before the Senate is a good one. I salute the chairman and \nthe ranking member for their hard work.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank our distinguished colleague and \nmember of the committee, the Senator from Maine. The Senator has fought \nhard on behalf of her interests in that State. Indeed, the BRAC \nprocess, in some respects due to your efforts, was modified in the end \nto the interests of the State.\n  While I am not going to be able to support the Snowe-Collins \namendment, nevertheless, in other areas the Senator made some progress. \nI thank the Senator for her work on the committee given her work on the \nGovernment Operations Committee. Nevertheless, the Senator finds time \nto attend our meetings and be an active participant. I thank my \ncolleague.\n  I ask unanimous consent at the hour of 2:45 the Senate proceed to a \nvote in relation to the Inhofe amendment No. 2439, followed by a vote \nin relation to the Harkin amendment numbered 2438. I further ask that \nthe Inhofe amendment be modified so it is a first-degree amendment, and \nthat no second-degree amendments to the amendments be in order prior to \nthe votes; provided further that the time from 2:15 to 2:45 be equally \ndivided between Senators Inhofe and Harkin. I further ask on an \nunrelated matter that Senator Stevens be recognized for up to 10 \nminutes of morning business following the two votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/08/senate-section/article/S12479-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12479]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nstand in recess until the hour of 2:15 p.m.\n  Thereupon, the Senate, at 12:41 p.m., recessed until 2:17 p.m. and \nreassembled when called to order by the Presiding Officer (Mr. \nVoinovich).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/08/senate-section/article/S12479-2", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12479-S12516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2006--Continued\n\n\n                     Amendments Nos. 2438 and 2439\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 30 minutes of debate equally \ndivided between Senator Inhofe and Senator Harkin.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, under the previous order, the time between \n2:15 and 2:45 is equally divided between the Senator from Oklahoma and \nthe Senator from Iowa for the purposes of discussing the underlying \namendment by the Senator from Iowa and a second degree that I put on on \nbehalf of Senator Inhofe. My understanding is that Senator Inhofe will \nbe here momentarily. But under the order, the Senate is now in session \nand open to hear comments on this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, what we have coming up here are two votes, \none at 2:45 on the Inhofe sense-of-the-Senate amendment, to be followed \nby a vote on my amendment.\n  Now, you might say: What harm is it in voting for the Inhofe sense-\nof-the-Senate amendment? Well, I thought I might even vote for it \nmyself, until I read it. Because if you look at the sense-of-the-Senate \namendment by the Senator from Oklahoma, in its findings--in its \nfindings--it says:\n\n       The American Forces Radio and Television Service and the \n     American Forces Network provide a ``touch of home'' to \n     members of the Armed Forces [et cetera] by providing the same \n     type and quality of radio and television programming . . . \n     that would be available in the continental United States.\n\n  Well, when AFRTS provides for 100 percent, under 33 local stations \naround the world, of Rush Limbaugh and Dr. Laura and James Dobson and \nzero percent on the progressive side, that is hardly ``the same type \nand quality'' ``available in the continental United States.'' So right \naway, that is a wrong finding.\n  Another finding is that the:\n\n       American Forces Radio and Television Service . . . select \n     programming that represents a cross-section of popular \n     American radio and television.\n\n  Well, again, if 100 percent is on one side and zero is on the other, \nthat also cannot be so.\n  And then in their sense-of-the-Senate amendment it says, it is the \nsense of the Senate--according to the Senator from Oklahoma--that:\n\n       [T]he programming mission, themes, and practices of the \n     Department of Defense with respect to its television and \n     radio programming have fairly and responsively fulfilled \n     their mission of providing a ``touch of home'' to members of \n     the Armed Forces. . . .\n\n  Well, they have fairly and responsively fulfilled their mission when \nit is 100 percent to nothing? I do not think so.\n  Lastly, the Inhofe amendment says the Secretary of Defense may \nappoint an ombudsman--``may''--but it does not say what the ombudsman \nis supposed to do.\n  Now, to be clear, again, what our amendment does is it simply takes \nthe DOD directive--which says they shall provide a free flow of \npolitical programming, that there should be the same equal opportunity \nfor balance, and that they should provide them with fairness--and \ncodifies it. We take that directive and codify it. That is all. We do \nnot change it, we codify it. Then we set up an ombudsman and spell out \nwhat that ombudsman should do. And we spell that out in my amendment. \nSo there is quite a bit of difference.\n  Again, I remind my fellow Senators that a year and a half ago, I \noffered a sense-of-the-Senate resolution because I thought if we gently \nprodded them and showed them what they were doing, they would follow \ntheir directive. That was 16 months ago. Now, 16 months later, it is \n100 percent to nothing. There is zero programing on the progressive \nside.\n  Again, I want to make it clear we are not trying to restrict or in \nany way say what they have to carry, but as long as they are carrying \nthis talk radio, it ought to at least be balanced. Some people say: \nWell, Rush Limbaugh has a big audience. He does. I don't deny that. But \nthey are carrying Dr. Laura, they are carrying a Mark Merrill, whom I \nhave never heard of. Why don't they carry Howard Stern? Howard Stern \nhas 8 million listeners. Well, in that case, they said they do not like \nthe content.\n\n[[Page S12480]]\n\n  So it is not just ratings, it is also content. They are keeping the \nArmed Forces personnel from listening to Howard Stern. So it is not \njust ratings. Don't fall for that line. It is not because Limbaugh and \nthese people have high ratings. Howard Stern has high ratings, but they \nwon't let him on.\n  So I hope Senators will oppose the Inhofe amendment and support our \namendment to codify it and to set up an ombudsman who would report to \nthe Secretary of Defense and report to us every year on how they are \nmeeting their requirements of fair and balanced programming.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor, suggest the absence of a \nquorum, and I ask unanimous consent that the time be run on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in consultation with the ranking member, I \nsay that there are three amendments in which, speaking for the \nmajority, I would yield back time in our possession in the hopes we \ncould move to the amendments for voting purposes.\n  The first one, of course, would be the amendment, as I just discussed \nwith the distinguished Senator from Michigan, regarding the desire to \nhave a Presidential commission regarding the detainee issues. I ask the \nChair to inform the Senate as to the amount of time that is under the \ncontrol of the majority and minority on that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 2427?\n  Mr. WARNER. A little louder, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 2427?\n  Mr. WARNER. Amendment No. 2430.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, how much time is there on each side, if we \ncould inquire of the Chair.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is the question before the Chair on amendment No. \n2430.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The opposition has 10 minutes. Senator Levin \nhas 3 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine. Then we would like to move to the amendment by the \nSenator from Rhode Island, Mr. Reed, regarding missile defense. Again, \nI would inquire as to how much time is remaining on the amendment, \nwhich is amendment No. 2427.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The opposition has 8 minutes. Senator Reed has \n19 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Well, I am prepared to yield back time on that if we can \nget some indication from Senator Reed as to his desire. I am hopeful we \nwill have that vote up.\n  Then there is an amendment by the distinguished Senator from Maine, \nMs. Snowe, amendment No. 2436. Will the Chair advise the Senate as to \nthe time remaining on that amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Snowe has 3 minutes, and the \nopposition has 13 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Well, with regard to the time in opposition, I am opposed \nto the amendment, but I am prepared to yield back the time on that \namendment. This, hopefully, alerts Senators that any one and hopefully \nall three of those amendments could be up for votes very shortly.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am wondering if we have the time on the Nelson of \nFlorida amendment. I do not have the number.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, 2424 is the number on that amendment.\n  If the Senator will withhold for a minute.\n  The inquiry is in to the desk as to the time left on the Nelson \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Nelson has 16 minutes, and the \nopposition has 30 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I inquire as to the regular order and the \ntime remaining on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has 10\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. On both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 9 minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. All right, then. And the second-degree amendment No. 2439 \nto amendment No. 2438 is the order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is now a first-degree amendment, and it is \nthe pending amendment.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Amendment No. 2439?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes. That is correct.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I had an opportunity prior to the break to \ntalk a little bit about my amendment to the Harkin amendment. There is \ncriteria that has been used, and used successfully, for a long period \nof time. There are two criteria. One is, it must be a syndicated type \nof a program. The program has to be syndicated. No. 2, it has to have \nat least a million listeners by the ratings.\n  Now, there are some other exceptions, when they are extreme things. \nObviously, there are some things that anyone making any evaluation \nwould not want to have our people subjected to. But by and large that \nis the way it has worked.\n  Now, for a long period of time it just happens that the conservative \nprograms have been asked for by our troops over there, so they have \nreceived them. However, if I were to stand here and say I am happy with \nthe programming as it has been, I would not be.\n  Right now I guess the name you hear more often than anybody else is \nRush Limbaugh. His is the second most highly requested program. They \nwant all 3 hours, although only some of the 33 stations give him 1 \nhour. No one gives him more than 1 hour. So that is not as much as I \nwould like to have them go and as much as I think the market demands.\n  I think it has worked well. I would think it would be very bad policy \nfor us to believe we should sit here in this august body of the Senate \nand make the determination as to what we think--what we think--our \ntroops should be watching and listening to.\n  I believe this is true: I have been to Iraq more than any other \nMember. I have gone just about every month. I have yet to hear the \nfirst complaint over the programming as it has been, nor have I ever \nreceived a communication in any of our offices either in Washington or \nin the State.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Oklahoma \ncould advise this Senator as to where in the directive--perhaps there \nis someplace I haven't found--it says that radio programs that are \ncarried by American Forces Radio around the world have to be syndicated \nand have a million listeners.\n  Mr. INHOFE. That is the policy they have been using. It is not \nmandated. It is a policy they have stated has been their policy, and \nthe programming has reflected that that is the case.\n  Mr. HARKIN. With all due respect, I asked the Senator, can he show me \nanywhere where that is written down?\n  Mr. INHOFE. No. This has been the policy. By the way, I remind the \nPresiding Officer, this is on the time of Senator Harkin.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, what we have is a policy that is not \nwritten down--we can find it nowhere, and today is the first time I \never heard of it--that somehow before American Forces Radio airs a \nprogram, No. 1, it has to be syndicated and, No. 2, it has to have a \nmillion listeners. I never heard of this before. All of a sudden, it \nhas come up.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Since I am on my time, the Senator can get his own time \nto respond.\n  That is why we need to codify it. I think the Senator has put his \nfinger on it. That is why our amendment is necessary. It takes the DOD \ndirective, what is in writing, and codifies it and makes it law. That \nway there won't be any confusion. That way we will know whether they \nare living up to their own words. Secondly, putting in an ombudsman--\nnot ``may,'' what the Senator says in his amendment--will do the \nfollowing: That person will be appointed by the Secretary of Defense; \nnot engage in any censorship; conduct reviews of integrity, balance, \nand fairness; respond to program issues raised\n\n[[Page S12481]]\n\nby the audience; make suggestions regarding ways to correct imbalances; \nand, most importantly, prepare and present an annual report to the \nSecretary of Defense and Congress on whether American Forces Radio is \nsatisfying its mandate to provide fair and balanced political \nprogramming.\n  The Senator, by his own words, shows why this is necessary. All of a \nsudden we hear there is a policy. It is not written down. We have never \nheard of it before. Yet we know what is happening.\n  I repeat for emphasis: On the 33 stations around the world, we have \n100 percent Rush Limbaugh and Dr. Laura and James Dobson, and zero \npercent of any kind of progressive radio. I don't care how you cut it, \nslice it, dice it, or excuse it, this is unfair. This is censorship. \nThis is propagandizing our troops. They deserve better than that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I believe this policy has been adhered \nto--on his own time, if the Senator from Iowa knows of any time it has \nnot been adhered to, I would be glad to listen--the criteria of having \nto be syndicated and, No. 2, at least 1 million listeners, which has \nbeen the policy all along. If he questions that this should be the \npolicy or believes it should be in the future, I would be glad to \nchange my amendment just to say that it should be based on those two \ncriteria. That is not a problem at all. It is not necessary because it \nhas used that criteria in the past.\n  To clearly demonstrate that 1 million listeners is one of the \ncriteria, when the time came that Franken and Ed Schultz reached 1 \nmillion, all of a sudden they were programmed. It further demonstrates \nit is something that has worked in the past for liberal or conservative \nmessages.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this is very interesting, I say to my \nfriend from Oklahoma. The Senator from Virginia got up earlier before \nour lunch break and said something about Ed Schultz and Al Franken \nbeing on American Forces Radio. I just checked with them. I had my \noffice call both of their programmers. Neither Mr. Franken nor Mr. \nSchultz has been notified, as of 2 hours ago, that they are ever going \nto be on American Forces Radio. They have never been notified. So now \nwe hear today that somehow all of a sudden they are going to be on. \nMaybe the Senator has some inside knowledge of how they operate. As of \n2 hours ago, neither Mr. Schultz nor Mr. Franken has been notified when \nthey are going to be on, how often, or how long.\n  The second thing I say to my friend from Oklahoma, he says they have \nthis policy of syndication and 1 million listeners and even though it \nis not written down anywhere they have followed it. I say to my friend \nfrom Oklahoma, if that is the case, then why don't they carry Howard \nStern? Howard Stern has over 8 million listeners. He is syndicated. Yet \nAmerican Forces Radio will not carry Howard Stern. So I say to my \nfriend from Oklahoma, there must be some other criteria other than \nsyndication and a million listeners or else they certainly would have \nHoward Stern.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we are trying to find out something \nspecific that Howard Stern has said or promoted on his programs. The \nproblem is, there is nothing I can say on the Senate floor because it \nis so basically lewd. It is the type of thing that if the Muslim world \nwere to listen to, it would be something very bad. There is not a \nSenator on this floor who would want that type of language used, \nprofanity. I said this in my opening remarks. There are some cases \nwhere programming could be so extreme, whether it is liberal or \nconservative, it would not be acceptable.\n  As far as Al Franken and Ed Schultz, the liberal programming, it was \npublished on the Web site of American Forces that states which ones \nmeet the two criteria. It was not on their Web site in 2004. It is on \ntheir Web site currently.\n  I can't spoon-feed them and go up and say: Are you aware? You need to \nread the Web site. They should have been aware of that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have no case to make for Howard Stern. \nThe Senator said it is syndication and numbers in the millions. I \npointed out that Howard Stern has 8 million. The Senator responds that \nHoward Stern is lewd and too much--I didn't hear all the words he used. \nBut there are other criteria that have to do with content.\n  Whether one agrees with whatever Howard Stern says, I might object \nstrenuously--and I think a lot of Americans would object--to someone \nwho said that what is good for al-Qaida is good for the Democratic \nParty in this country today. Rush Limbaugh said that. That went to all \nof our troops in Iraq. I think that is lewd. I think that is obscene. I \nwill bet you there are a lot of people who think that is obscene. I \ndon't mean just Democrats, anybody would think that is obscene. Or \nsaying that what happened at Abu Ghraib was like a fraternity prank, or \nsaying that the pictures of homoeroticism look like standard, good-old \nAmerican pornography. Rush Limbaugh said that. It was broadcast to our \ntroops in Iraq.\n  We voted last week 90 to 9 on the McCain amendment to say: No. What \nhappened at Abu Ghraib does not represent good-old American \npornography, as Rush Limbaugh says.\n  If the Senator objects to Howard Stern, fine. I think a lot of people \nobject to the obscenities of Rush Limbaugh, also.\n  What we are talking about is not taking somebody off the air. We are \ntalking about ideas and discussion and debate. It seems to me that what \nwe want are more ideas and more discussion and more debate. I think our \ndebate is pretty darn good, as a matter of fact. Why don't they have \nthat on American Forces Radio rather than this one-sided type of thing? \nThey need this kind of debate, this kind of discussion. More ideas, \nmore discussion, more debate is much better than less. That is what I \nbelieve our amendment would provide.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I would like to inquire as to the time \nremaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has 3\\1/2\\ minutes. \nThe Senator from Iowa has 20 seconds.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Let me say that I think with any program, in the case you \nmentioned of Rush Limbaugh, you mentioned two things you found to be \noffensive and you questioned whether they were appropriate. The service \npeople requested all 3 hours every day. They ended up with some \nstations giving them 1 hour, nobody giving them more than 1 hour. So if \nyou take 1 hour for some of these stations every day and you can find \ntwo instances of something that in, your interpretation, is lewd, and \nyou compare that to Howard Stern whose programming is based on this \ntype of thing--the profanity and the things that we find offensive and \nwould not want to be throughout the world, the Arab world, or the rest \nof the world--then I think that is a real stretch.\n  The bottom line is, we have an opportunity. Right now it is working \nwell. As I say, I don't know how many times the Senator from Iowa has \nbeen to Iraq. In his last 20 seconds, he might mention how many times \nhe has been there. I have been there almost every month. I carry on a \ndialog with these people. I know they tell me the type of programming \nthey want, the complaints they have. We have yet to receive any \ncomplaints saying they think the current system of programming is wrong \nin any way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the time remaining on behalf of the \ndistinguished Senator from Oklahoma is?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is 1 minute 20 seconds, and the time \nremaining for the Senator from Iowa is 20 seconds.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator from Iowa talked about the two \nprograms which I discussed earlier, Ed Schultz and Al Franken. He \nmentioned that his check indicated they\n\n[[Page S12482]]\n\nhaven't been contacted. I immediately went back and checked with the \nDepartment of Defense. The Department of Defense, I assure the Senator \nfrom Iowa, is taking steps to implement the inclusion of those \nprograms. The Department is dealing with the agents who presumably \ncontrol the time. Therefore, the proffer that I made earlier about \nthese two programs being included, it may be just a question of the \ntense of the verb, but I am assured by the Department that they are now \ntaking steps to implement the inclusion or option to include these two \nprograms throughout the American Forces Network.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I just respond by saying they said that 16 months ago. \nThey said it 16 months ago, and nothing has happened.\n  Mr. WARNER. Well, I am not in a position to rebut that.\n  All I can say is----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority's time has expired.\n  Mr. WARNER. Within the past 15 minutes, I received the assurance.\n  Has all time expired, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 20 seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I think again what this boils down to is do you want to \nhave our troops have more debate, more discussion, more ideas, or do \nyou want them to be limited? I say to my friends on the Republican \nside, maybe you will be inclined to just vote for Limbaugh and Dr. \nLaura and stuff, but I ask for your thoughts on fairness and equity. \nSomeday the shoe may be on the other foot. I don't want them to hear \none side of the story. I want them to hear both sides of the story.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I beg you, let's have some fairness. That is what this \namendment will do, not the sense-of-the-Senate resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. WARNER. I so make that request for both amendments, Mr. \nPresident.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The yeas \nand nays may be requested on both amendments.\n  Mr. WARNER. And I so make that request, the underlying amendment and \nthe Inhofe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, further I hope, working in consultation \nwith the distinguished ranking member, to have more votes. There is an \noutstanding Reed amendment and there is an outstanding amendment by the \nSenator from Michigan, Mr. Levin. I hope those votes will be addressed \nby the Senate not too long after the conclusion of this series of \nvotes.\n  Mr. President, under the order of the Senate that I asked for \nearlier, the Senator from Alaska is to be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Stevens and Ms. Murkowski are printed in today's \nRecord under ``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. What is the business before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Snowe amendment is pending.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Snowe amendment to what?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. To the Department of Defense authorization.\n\n[[Page S12483]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if the Senator would yield, we have \nalready scheduled Senator Byrd's amendment at this point in time, so it \nis quite in order and timely.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2442\n\n       (Purpose: To establish the position of Deputy Secretary of \n     Defense for Management.)\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia, a man for whom I have great respect.\n  In 1787, during the drafting of the Constitution, the Founding \nFathers struggled with the question of how to create a government that \nwould simultaneously govern and yet remain accountable to the people. \nThe Framers developed a number of principles with which every \nschoolchild should be familiar: Direct and indirect representation, \nchecks and balances, separation of powers.\n  In addition to these great principles, the Framers were also \ninsightfully pragmatic. For example, in article I, section 9, the \nConstitution gives the Congress--us, the Senate and the House, the \nCongress--the power of the purse. As Cicero said, there is no fortress \nso strong that money cannot buy it. Money cannot take it.\n  That section also requires accountability for how the people's tax \nmoney is to be used. Here is what it says:\n\n     . . . a regular statement and account of the receipts and \n     expenditures of all public money shall be published from time \n     to time.\n\n  The Founding Fathers, among whom were the Framers, the Framers \nunderstood the importance of informing the American people about how \ntheir taxes are spent. However, this constitutional requirement has \nfrequently clashed with the realities of the modern day bureaucracy. In \nno other Government agency, is this clash more evident than in the \nlargest department, the Department of Defense, with its budget that is \napproaching half a trillion every year. How long would it take to count \n$1 trillion at the rate of one dollar per second? That is pretty fast \ncounting, one dollar per second. How long would it take to count $1 \ntrillion at the rate of one dollar per second? Guess. What is the \nguess? Thirty-two thousand years. That would be quite a while. I \nwouldn't be around to hear the counting of $1 trillion at the rate of \none dollar per second.\n  The Department of Defense, with a budget that is approaching half a \ntrillion dollars per year--that takes 16,000 years to count--is unable \nto adequately account for the funds that are appropriated to it.\n  What a shame. Are you astounded? It is amazing, isn't it? That is \nastonishing.\n  Despite decades of congressional scrutiny, multibillion dollar reform \nefforts and promises for progress, the Pentagon is unable to pass an \naudit of its books. How about that? The Pentagon is unable to pass an \naudit of its books. I have been saying this now for how many years, \npretty close to 5 years that I have been saying this. Secretary \nRumsfeld admitted it. He said he was going to do something about it.\n  Dr. David Walker, the Comptroller of the United States and the head \nof the Government Accountability Office, has stated:\n\n       Numerous management problems, inefficiencies, and wasted \n     resources continue to trouble DOD's business operations, \n     resulting in billions of wasted resources annually at a time \n     when our nation is facing an increasing fiscal imbalance.\n\n  We ought to listen to that. That ought to get everyone on their feet. \nStand up and take notice. He is talking about billions of dollars of \nthe people's money. That is your money; your money; yes, your money; \nand your money. Turn to the four corners of the Earth, the proverbial \nfour winds. It is your money that goes down the tubes each year, down \nthe tubes.\n  These billions are not being spent on training our troops. These \nbillions are not being spent on providing health care for the families \nof our troops. We are talking about billions of dollars in spending \nthat neither improves our national security nor returns value to the \ntaxpayers. It is as if this huge amount of money vanishes into thin \nair.\n  In this time of tight budgets, in this time of huge deficits, this is \nexactly the sort of Government waste the Congress needs to eliminate. \nThe taxpayers cry out, even the rocks cry out.\n  When Secretary Rumsfeld came before the Committee on Armed Services \nin January of 2001, I asked Secretary Rumsfeld what he was going to do \nabout this. That was in 2001. What are you going to do about it? So I \nasked him what he was going to do about this. This what? This $2.3 \ntrillion in unsupported accounting entries that appeared in the \nPentagon's ledgers in fiscal year 1999.\n  Mr. President, $2.3 trillion is a lot of money, isn't it? I believe \nour national budget exceeded $1 trillion--when was it, may I say to the \ndistinguished Senator from Virginia, when did our Government budget \nfirst exceed $1 trillion? I believe that was 1987; am I correct? Now, \nhere we were in 1999, when I noted that there was in the Pentagon's \nledgers, this number $2.3 trillion in unsupported accounting. Secretary \nRumsfeld said that the accounting mess was, to use his words, \n``monumental.'' He used the word ``terrifying.'' And he said it would \ntake ``a period of years,'' it would take ``a period of years to sort \nit out.'' So I said: Well, let's get started. It is past time.\n\n  Since January 2001, the Department of Defense has made progress in \nsome areas. For example, the Pentagon has been successful in reducing \nthe abuse of Government-issued credit cards. But the toughest work \nremains ahead, and there are serious doubts that the Pentagon is up to \nthe task of tackling these difficult problems.\n  The previous Defense Department Comptroller, Dov Zakheim, set a goal \nto have the Pentagon pass its first audit by fiscal year 2007. However, \nthis deadline is increasingly looking like a pipedream. Dr. Walker of \nthe General Accounting Office said, earlier this year, in a hearing \nbefore the Armed Services Committee's Readiness Subcommittee:\n\n       The goal for 2007 is totally unrealistic. It's not credible \n     on its face.\n\n  How about that? That is quite astonishing. In fact, for the first \ntime, the GAO listed the Defense Department's business transformation \nproject on its annual list of ``high risk'' Government programs.\n  Now, this should lead the Congress to question whether the Defense \nDepartment is moving forward in its efforts to straighten out its books \nor if it is heading into even greater financial chaos.\n  Mr. President, I cry out for the American people. Oh, how they cry \nout because of the burden, the never-ending, the increasingly heavy, \nthe increasingly unbearable burden. They simply can no longer afford \nthe billions of wasted dollars through the Pentagon's broken accounting \nsystems. That is why I offer an amendment on behalf of myself and \nSenator Akaka and Senator Lautenberg, to put the Defense Department on \nthe right track to fix its broken accounting and financial management \nsystem. It is broken, so it needs fixing. Yes, it needs fixing. Why? \nBecause it is broken.\n  This amendment, which is similar to bipartisan legislation introduced \nearlier this year, would create a Deputy Secretary of Defense for \nManagement to bring order to the Pentagon's bloated bureaucracy--the \nPentagon's bloated bureaucracy. The Deputy Secretary for Management \nwould be directly responsible--directly responsible--for overseeing \nreform in the areas of accounting, human resources, information \ntechnology, acquisition, and logistics, among others. These are the key \nareas identified by the Government Accountability Office as being most \nin need of stronger oversight. Getting these programs on the right \ntrack could save taxpayers billions of dollars per year by eliminating \nwaste, inefficiency, and duplication--duplication, redundancy.\n  Based upon the recommendations of the GAO, the Byrd-Akaka amendment \nwould create a 7-year term for the Deputy Secretary of Defense for \nManagement. This fixed term of service is required to ensure that the \nPentagon lays out a single plan for reform and sticks to it--lays out a \nsingle program for reform and sticks to that single program for reform. \nAbove all else, the Defense Department needs this sustained, high-level \nleadership if it is ever going to fix its accounting problems.\n  Well, there are some critics who might argue that the Department of \nDefense already has high-level leadership concerned about financial \nmanagement and accounting practices. Well, that is probably true. So \nwhat. It\n\n[[Page S12484]]\n\nis, indeed, true that Secretary Rumsfeld and his Acting Deputy \nSecretary, Gordon England, both have spoken often about the importance \nof straightening out the Pentagon's books.\n  But this amendment is not about the Secretary, not about the Deputy \nSecretary of Defense. If experience shows us anything, it is that \nSecretaries and Deputy Secretaries come and go, but the Pentagon's \naccounting problems remain. The Secretaries and Deputy Secretaries come \nand go, but the Pentagon's accounting problems do not go away. They do \nnot go away. They remain.\n  In the 15 years since the Congress passed the Chief Financial \nOfficers Act of 1990, which requires every Government agency to pass a \nfinancial audit, the Pentagon has seen five--F-I-V-E--Secretaries of \nDefense, eight--E-I-G-H-T--Deputy Secretaries of Defense, and five--F-\nI-V-E--Comptrollers. How about that. How can any major reform plan hope \nto succeed if the Department's leadership is in such a constant \nturnover, such a constant state of change?\n  Plans for accounting reform have been written, written, written, and \nrewritten more times than anyone can count. Billions of taxpayer \ndollars have been spent in the vain attempt to implement a never-ending \nseries of reform proposals, each one of which claims to be the plan \nthat will finally straighten out the Pentagon's books. But do you know \nwhat. These proposals, plans, and programs just are not getting the job \ndone. They do not amount to a hill of beans. They are not doing the \nwork.\n  In fact, just a few short weeks ago, the Department of Defense \nfinished creating another revised plan to fix its accounting systems \nand inaugurated another new agency to implement the new plan. Well, \nwhile some may argue that this means the Pentagon is finally getting \nserious about its efforts to balance its books, I see history repeating \nitself--yes, more new plans, more new plans, more new plans, but little \nhope for success.\n  Mr. President, the time has come and passed for a real shakeup of the \nDepartment of Defense. That giant bureaucracy needs to be tamed--needs \nto be tamed. While the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of Defense have a \nmultitude of competing priorities, including their responsibility to \noversee the military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Pentagon \nneeds a single official to focus on the day-to-day management of the \nDepartment of Defense. The Byrd-Akaka amendment creates a Deputy \nSecretary of Defense for Management to do that.\n  Too much of the American people's hard-earned tax dollars are lost \nthrough the waste and inefficiency of the Defense Department's \nbureaucratic morass. It is time for reform. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Byrd-Akaka amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, one of the great pleasures of those of us \nwho serve on the Armed Services Committee is to have the opportunity to \nwork with Senator Byrd, an individual for whom I have the greatest \nrespect and whose corporate knowledge of the institutions of \nGovernment, most particularly the institution of the U.S. Senate, is \nsecond to none.\n  I have listened carefully to this presentation by our distinguished \ncolleague from West Virginia, and I think he cites, with relative \naccuracy, points that should be taken into consideration. But I would \nlike to say to my friend, I wonder if you might consider an alternative \napproach.\n  We stop to think that the Department of Defense was envisioned by the \nKey West Conference in 1947, when Harry Truman--I might say one of my \nfavorite Presidents--saw the need to bring together the Departments of \nthe Navy and the Army and the emerging Air Force from the glorious days \nof the Army Air Corps and put them all together, unify them, and \neliminate, thereby, certain frictions, and so forth, that normally \nexist between the military Departments. The Department of Defense as we \nknow it today was born, and James Forrestal was our first Secretary.\n  This Department has served this Nation very well in the ensuing years \nsince 1947. And yet, as Mr. Byrd has said very eloquently, he has \npointed out problems associated with the enormity of the growth of \nresponsibilities, the enormity of the growth of appearances required by \nthe senior members of the Department before the Congress and the like.\n  I think he also has in mind the British system, for which all of us \nwho have dealt with that system through the years have a certain degree \nof admiration. They have a civil service sort of permanent under \nsecretary structure, so as there is turnover in the top positions \nthrough the years, there is someone to come in and say: Well, I was \nhere under the previous two secretaries and, indeed, the facts are such \nand so. It has its virtue. But I think the complexity of the problems \nyou raise requires some careful study.\n  Now, a subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee, under the \ndistinguished chairmanship of Senator Ensign, has looked at this \nquestion. He will succeed me here momentarily to give his thoughts.\n  I come down to this point, I say to my good friend from West \nVirginia. You start with the proposition there is no other Government \nagency or Department of our Federal system, other than the FAA--and I \ndid not know that until I was prompted by your amendment to do the \nresearch--which has the two Deputy Secretaries or Under Secretaries, as \nthe case may be. That, to me, indicates that throughout the formation \nof our Government, whether it has been under Democrat control or \nRepublican control, it is a concept that has not been tried. But it \nmerits careful study.\n  I am wondering if the Senator from West Virginia would think of \nconverting his amendment to provide for a study. Now, I do not mean to \nkick the can down the road for a year and let it disappear as a \nconcept. Let's have a tight study of 90 or 120 days. Let's have it done \nby one of the Federal research centers, not the GAO because the GAO, \nfrankly, has an opinion, maybe have it done by two of them, require two \nof them to do it, and report back to the Congress early next year, say \nin the February-March timeframe, such that we could hold a hearing in \nthe Armed Services Committee and perhaps the Government Operations \nCommittee, which has sort of plenary jurisdiction over Government \nagencies and Departments, and take a look at it. It might take root, \nand as such we would put it in as a part of next year's authorization \nbill. We could then go to our colleagues in the Senate and our \ncolleagues in the other body and say: Look, we have carefully analyzed \nand studied, and this is our conclusion. I say to my good friend--not \nthat I could teach him anything--knowing where the votes are, I am \ninclined to think there is probably a sufficient structure of votes \nhere not to carry your amendment, and I would hate to see it lost, to \nbe honest. And should it pass here, there is nothing in the House. And \nas you well know from more experience than I, that conference produces \nunpredictable results.\n  This is a good idea. This idea merits very careful attention and \nstudy. I would be the first to cosponsor with you if you were so \ndesiring of amending your pending amendment to provide for a framework \nby which this concept is studied step by step before the Congress is \ncalled upon to render its judgment.\n  I say that with the greatest respect.\n  At this point, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the proposal coming, as it does, from the \ndistinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee, gives me pause.\n  First, I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd], for himself, Mr. \n     Akaka, and Mr. Lautenberg, proposes an amendment numbered \n     2442.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. BYRD. Continuing, the Department of Defense has served our \ncountry well. But from time to time Congress\n\n[[Page S12485]]\n\nhas needed to make changes, such as the Goldwater-Nichols Act, to fix \nproblems that have arisen. We know what the problem is. The Department \nneeds someone to dive in and fix these accounting problems. The GAO has \ntold the Congress what is needed to fix these problems. My amendment \ndoes just that. One more year means more money spent. One might ask the \nrhetorical question, how many more years does Congress need to wait \nbefore it acts? I don't slough off the proposal nonchalantly or \n``chalantly.'' I would like to think about that. Let me do just that. \nWhile the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Ensign, speaks, let me converse with \nthe Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my dear colleague. I suggest, \nindeed, as Senator Ensign has looked into this, the Senate would \nbenefit from his perspective. I suggest we make this the pending \namendment, lay it aside such that the Senate can proceed to the votes \non the other two amendments. I don't know that there is any urgency. As \nlong as it is the pending amendment, it can be brought up at any time \nthe Senator from West Virginia so desires, either to be amended or \nvoted in its present framework. I would be happy to yield the floor for \nthe purposes of the distinguished Senator from Nevada addressing the \nSenate on this important subject and confer with the Senator from West \nVirginia briefly. I have an appointment with the British Minister of \nDefense. He is in my office. I would like to keep that for a brief \nperiod and then return to the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Fine, if we could set this amendment aside until after the \ntwo votes. In the meantime, let the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Ensign, \nspeak, and then have the amendment set aside until after the two votes. \nMeanwhile we can confer.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent then that the \nSenator from Nevada be recognized for such time as he wishes to take on \nthe Byrd amendment in its present configuration at the desk and then, \nat the conclusion of the remarks of the Senator from Nevada, we proceed \nto the scheduled votes under a previous order. Then immediately \nfollowing the last vote, this becomes the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, Senator Byrd has offered an amendment \nvirtually identical to a piece of legislation that I brought forward \nbecause he has the same concerns I have. When I took over the \nchairmanship of the Readiness Subcommittee, the staff briefed me on \nvarious hearings that they do traditionally during the year. One of the \nhearings, the information that we got at the hearing, this piece of \nlegislation was trying to address. It was the reason I drafted it, \nbecause I had literally the identical concerns Senator Byrd has raised \ntoday. Nothing he has said have I disagreed with. This happened last \nyear. We used to have one of these hearings a year. I have actually \nstepped them up to every 6 months. We have a hearing tomorrow in the \nReadiness Subcommittee on this very issue, as well as others on the \nbusiness transformation for the military.\n  The military is a huge bureaucracy that none of us have our arms \naround. The military doesn't have its arms around its own bureaucracy. \nThere are incredible inefficiencies. The problem is, you get one person \nin; they are there for a year, maybe two. They say they are going to be \nmaking changes. They have been promising to make changes for years. And \nthen nothing happens.\n  Last year, I was ready to proceed with my legislation. I met with \nSecretary England, and he asked me for 1 year. He said: Give me a year. \nI am new in this position. Give me a year. If you are not satisfied at \nthe end of that year, if we haven't made significant progress, then go \nforward with your legislation.\n  I reluctantly said: OK. You are new. I liked some of the ideas he was \nlaying out. He was going in the right direction. I said, reluctantly: I \nwill give you the year.\n  Tomorrow we are having a hearing to see at least what progress they \nhave made in the last 6 to 8 months. Depending on what happens at that \nhearing--from some of the preliminary results we have received, there \nis some progress being made--we are going to delve into it much more \ndeeply tomorrow, plus what we see over the next several months. If we \nare not satisfied, I will be the first person to join the Senator from \nWest Virginia on this legislation next year to create this position.\n  The reason I thought this was good, that it was a good idea to make \nthis change, was because to have somebody focused on the business \ngoings on at the Department of Defense made good common sense to me. I \ndidn't want to see another layer of bureaucracy created. But with the \nDeputy Secretary of Defense, I didn't see them focused on the business \nactivities. I saw them focused on warfighting activities--all well and \ngood. We want them focused on that. But these other duties seem to be \nneglected at the same time.\n  I commit to the Senator from West Virginia that I am absolutely \nwilling to work with him on this, with the same goals in mind; that is, \nto reform our Defense Department to make it more efficient, more \naccountable, more transparent in the way that it actually performs \nbusiness. It is never going to operate like a business, but we have to \nget it to operate more like a business than it does today.\n  I think the spirit of this amendment is absolutely right. I would ask \nthat we would either go the direction of what Senator Warner has \nsuggested or at least wait until next spring, when we go for \nreauthorizing the Defense Department again next year, to address this \nissue, simply because I made that personal commitment to Acting Deputy \nSecretary Gordon England.\n  I would be more than happy to yield back or engage in a colloquy or \nwhatever the Senator from West Virginia would like at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I have great \nrespect for the Senator. I am interested in what he said. Let us confer \na little bit and think a little bit about this during the two votes \nthat are about to take place. Perhaps we can find out what the Senator \nfrom Nevada and the Senator from Virginia have in mind. Perhaps we can \nwork out something that will be in the best interest of the country. I \nwould like to think about that. I thank the Senator. Let's just hold it \nin abeyance for a little while until after the votes, and then we will \ncome back to it.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I thank the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: If I yield the floor, we go \ndirectly to the votes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes evenly divided preceding \nthe votes.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I defer to my distinguished \nchairman.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2424\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, may I suggest the Senator go first, and \nthen I would seek the opportunity for recognition to indicate that it \nis acceptable on this side. But if the Senator from Florida desires, I \nthink there is good reason to have a rollcall vote as opposed to a \nvoice vote.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, this amendment is all about the \npainful offsets of the Department of Defense survivor benefit plan \nagainst the Veterans' Affairs Department's dependency and indemnity \ncompensation. This offset that we have in current law mistreats the \nsurvivors of our military who die on active duty and also mistreats our \n100-percent disabled military retirees who purchase this benefit at the \nend of their career. It is wrong, we know it, and we are going to fix \nit. Taking care of widows and orphans is a cost of war. It is our \nsolemn duty to take care of the widows and orphans.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that\n\n[[Page S12486]]\n\nthere be printed in the Record a number of letters from military and \nveterans groups around the country.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 Military Officers\n\n\n                                       Association of America,\n\n                                 Alexandria, VA, November 7, 2005.\n     Hon. Bill Nelson,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nelson: I am writing on behalf of the 368,000 \n     members of the Military Officers Association of America \n     (MOAA) to pledge our support for your amendment, SA 2424, to \n     the FY2006 Defense Authorization Bill. Your amendment would \n     correct two major military Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) \n     inequities by (1) ending the unfair deduction of VA survivor \n     benefits from military SBP annuities when military service \n     causes an active duty or retired member's death and (2) \n     moving up the effective date of 30-year, paid-up SBP coverage \n     from October 1, 2008 to October 1, 2005.\n       MOM opposes Sen. John Warner's 2d degree amendment that \n     would simply require a study of the SBP annuity deduction and \n     drops the paid-up SBP initiative entirely.\n       MOM believes another study is not required to do what's \n     right. We feel strongly that, when military service causes \n     the member's death, the VA's payment of Dependency and \n     Indemnity Compensation (DIC) should be considered just that--\n     an additional indemnity for the service's role in the \n     member's untimely death. It should be added to SBP, not \n     substituted for it. Fewer than 3,500 of the 55,000 widows \n     affected by the DIC offset are eligible for the new lump sum \n     death benefit improvements leaving large numbers of survivors \n     with an annuity of only $993 per month. Only survivors \n     widowed after November 24, 2003 can transfer SBP eligibility \n     to their children--this does nothing to help older survivors \n     or those without children. Further, survivors who are \n     financially compelled to take advantage of this temporary \n     relief will be left at an even greater long-term disadvantage \n     because they must forfeit all SBP eligibility when their \n     children reach age 18. We should not be treating our \n     survivors in this manner.\n       Similarly, older retirees need and deserve relief from the \n     current 2008 effective date of paid-up SBP. The delayed \n     effective date means that thousands of ``Greatest \n     Generation'' retirees who have been paying into SBP since \n     1972 will have to pay up to 36 years of premiums, and will \n     end up paying one-third more premiums than members who \n     retired after 1978.\n       The time for action on your amendment is now. Failure to do \n     so would do a disservice to the thousands of survivors and \n     retirees who have waited years for relief from these two SBP \n     inequities.\n       MOM is urging your colleagues, via a separate letters, to \n     vote for your SBP amendment and oppose any effort to dilute \n     or defer action on these long-overdue fixes for military \n     widows and ``Greatest Generation'' retirees.\n           Sincerely,\n     Norbert R. Ryan, Jr.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             The Retired Enlisted Association,\n\n                           Alexandria, Virginia, November 7, 2005.\n     Re: SA 2424 ending the SBP/DIC offset.\n\n     Hon. Bill Nelson,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington DC.\n       Dear Senator Nelson: The Retired Enlisted Association \n     (TREA) is writing to strongly support your efforts to include \n     amendment SA 2424 in the NDAA. Your amendment would finally \n     correct the SBP's programs remaining deficiencies. It would \n     end the unfair dollar-for-dollar DBP/DIC Offset and it would \n     move up the paid up provisions of SBP to October 1, 2005. \n     These are improvements that have been long in coming.\n       TREA is a nationwide VSO whose members served a career in \n     the enlisted ranks and their spouses and survivors. Both \n     provisions of your Amendment would greatly improve the \n     situation of numerous of our members.\n       TREA knows how hard you and your staff have worked on this \n     issue. And now that success seems close at hand the ``DOD's \n     opposition paper'' is presented to the Senate. It is \n     incorrect. TREA is, of course, well aware of both the \n     mentioned substantial improvements in death benefits and the \n     improvements in the basic SBP plan that were adopted last \n     year. And we were very grateful for both actions. However \n     these improvements do not help the vast majority of military \n     widows who suffer under this offset.\n       Most of these widows' military spouses were seriously \n     disabled in the service of their country. When they retired \n     they enrolled in SBP (commercial plans not being an option \n     for them due to their disabilities.) They now pay 6\\1/2\\ \n     percent of their retired pay to protect their loved ones from \n     being left penniless if they died of a non service connected \n     disability.\n       But when they died of their service connected disability \n     their survivors suffer a dollar for dollar offset on their \n     SBP for their DIC. All their planning and financial sacrifice \n     is ineffective due to the offset. The improvements in the SBP \n     payments made last year do not help them. The active duty \n     death improvements do not help them. These ladies are not \n     helped by any of the changes Congress has made in the last \n     few years. They should not be forgotten.\n       Many of TREA's members' survivors are harmed by this \n     offset. They, like their Service member spouse dedicated \n     their lives to the service of their country. They then \n     dedicated their lives to caring for their disabled spouses. \n     Their service should be acknowledged.\n       Your Amendment would also move up the paid up provisions to \n     the beginning of this fiscal year. This would help elderly \n     military retirees who have been paying into SBP for at least \n     30 years and who are at least 70 years old. In 2008 the paid \n     up provisions will kick in but many will be paying 6 more \n     years than intended. They have surely paid in a great deal \n     more into SBP than their spouses will ever receive and your \n     change can allow these dedicated men and women to live with a \n     bit more comfort the next few years.\n       Again, TREA wishes to thank you and your staff for your \n     dedicated work to support the men and women who dedicated \n     their lives to the service of America's Military. We strongly \n     support your efforts to have SA 2424 included in this year's \n     NDAA.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                 Deirdre Parke Holleman, Esq.,\n\n                                    National Legislative Director,\n     The Retired Enlisted Association.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          National Military Family\n\n\n                                                  Association,\n\n                                 Alexandria, VA, November 7, 2005.\n     Hon. Bill Nelson,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nelson: On behalf of the National Military \n     Family Association (NMFA) and the military families it \n     serves, I thank you for introducing Senate Amendment 2424 to \n     S. 1042, the FY 2006 National Defense Authorization Act. This \n     amendment provides for certain fixes to the Survivor Benefit \n     Plan (SBP). The survivors of servicemembers killed on active \n     duty and those of military retirees, who died of service-\n     connected injuries or illnesses, deserve the financial \n     stability that would be provided through the provision to end \n     the Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) offset to \n     SBP. In addition elderly retirees, who have paid into SBP for \n     more than thirty years, deserve relief now instead of paying \n     additional premiums until 2008.\n       As we have stated in Congressional testimony this year, \n     NMFA believes that ending the DIC offset to SBP is essential \n     in protecting both the long and short-term financial security \n     of military survivors, especially those of career \n     servicemembers. Many of these survivors find their monthly \n     family income decreases substantially following the \n     servicemember's death, due in large part to the DIC offset to \n     SBP. Widows of retirees, who die of service-connected \n     illnesses or injuries, also experience a decrease in their \n     benefit income following the retiree's death. In recent \n     years, Congress has ended the VA disability pay offset of \n     military retired pay for retirees with a VA disability rating \n     of 50 percent and higher and provided for the phase-out of \n     the age-62 offset to SBP. Full receipt of both SBP and DIC is \n     just as important to survivors as full concurrent receipt of \n     VA disability pay and military retired pay has been to \n     retired servicemembers. The DIC offset to SBP affects the \n     most vulnerable members of our military community: the \n     surviving spouses of those who have given their lives for our \n     country. While surviving spouses of active duty deaths, who \n     are affected by the offset, have the option of choosing \n     child-only SBP, they do so knowing their DoD SBP benefits \n     will end as soon as their child reaches adulthood. Child-only \n     SBP payments do not compensate for the lost income caused by \n     the DIC offset.\n       We thank you for your efforts to protect the financial \n     security of military families by sponsoring this legislation \n     to eliminate the DIC offset of SBP. Military families today \n     are called upon to make extraordinary sacrifices. Survivors \n     have made the ultimate sacrifices. Thank you for your work to \n     ensure our Nation provides the full benefits due them in \n     recognition of that sacrifice.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Candace A.

Bill Nelson,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nelson: On behalf of the nearly 200,000 \n     members and supporters of the National Association for \n     Unifonned Service (NAUS), I would like to offer our full \n     support for your amendment to S. 1042, the fiscal year 2006 \n     National Defense Authorization Act, that would correct two \n     important inequities faced by our military widows and our \n     military retirees.\n       Your amendment would 1.) end the unfair dollar-for-dollar \n     deduction of the Defense Department's Survivor Benefit Plan \n     against the Veterans Department's Dependency and Indemnity \n     Compensation; and 2.) accelerate the effective date of paid-\n     up SBP coverage to October 1, 2005 from October 1, 2008.\n       Many military members and retirees have paid for SBP and \n     have the most obvious of expectations to receive what was \n     paid for. Surprisingly, that's not what happens. Under \n     current law, SBP is reduced one dollar for each dollar \n     received under DIC. In some cases survivors of retirees, upon \n     eligibility for DIC, lose a majority--or all too often--the \n     entire amount of their monthly SBP annuity.\n\n[[Page S12487]]\n\n       NAUS also strongly opposes any effort to postpone an up-or-\n     down vote on your amendment. In this regard, we oppose Sen. \n     John Warner's 2nd degree amendment that would send the SBP \n     issue to the Veterans Disability Benefits Commission for \n     further study. Frankly, we are deeply disappointed in efforts \n     to postpone doing what is right for military widows and \n     orphans and older veterans who have paid SBP premiums in some \n     cases for well over 30 years.\n       NAUS believes this matter already has been studied, \n     restudied, examined and re-examined. No further study is \n     required. Now is the time to act. And we urge you and your \n     colleagues to do the right thing.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Rick Jones,\n     NAUS Legislative Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                            Association of the United States Army,\n                                  Arlington, VA, November 7, 2005.\n     Hon.

AUSA strongly opposes any effort to \n     dilute or delay action on the fixes it proposes to the \n     military SBP.\n       We understand that Senator Warner plans to introduce a \n     ``second-degree'' amendment on Monday, 7 November, that would \n     nullify your initiative to (1) end the unfair deduction of VA \n     benefits for service-connected deaths from military \n     survivors' SBP annuities and (2) accelerate the 2008 \n     effective date for 30-year paid-up SBP coverage that now \n     makes ``Greatest Generation'' retirees pay one-third more SBP \n     premiums than similar servicemembers who retired since 1978.\n       The Warner amendment would drop any reference to the paid-\n     up SBP fix and merely call for a study of the survivors' \n     issue. Action on the two inequities in SA#762 is already long \n     overdue, and military retirees and survivors need action to \n     fix them now, rather than more delays, studies, and \n     deferrals.\n       AUSA stands firm in support of your SBP amendment and \n     opposes any and all efforts to dilute, defer, or nullify it.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Gordon R.

These spouses of military \n     members also served their nation, facing the rigors of that \n     lifestyle, constantly being aware that their military spouse \n     has agreed to the ultimate sacrifice. It is important to keep \n     our Nation's promises to those who have served and sacrificed \n     for our freedoms. That includes taking care of their \n     survivors.\n       We are especially pleased that your amendment would \n     accelerate the implementation date of the ``age 70, 30 years \n     paid up'' provision from October 1, 2008, to October 1, 2005. \n     This group of elderly retirees has been paying into SBP for \n     more than thirty years. Without question, they deserve the \n     immediate relief your amendment would provide.\n       During times of war it is importaut that a nation \n     communicate its sincerity to take care of its service \n     members. AFSA appreciates your leadership on this issue. \n     Please let us know what we can do to help you advance this \n     important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             James E.

In the case of service members \n     killed on active duty, a surviving spouse with children can \n     avoid the dollar-for-dollar offset only by assigning SBP to \n     her children. For retired members, we support your view that \n     if military service causes a retired member's death, the \n     Dependency Indemnity Compensation (DIC) the VA pays the \n     survivor should be added to the SBP benefits the retiree \n     bought and paid for, not substituted for them.\n       The Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the \n     United States strongly supports your amendment to address \n     these concerns. If I can be of further assistance, please \n     don't hesitate to contact us.\n       Working for America's Best!\n                                      MSG (Ret.) Michael P.

Please pardon the lack of formal addressing as this is \n     being faxed to all 100 of you United States Senators.\n       Today, I learned that Sen. John Warner, Chairman of the \n     Senate Armed Services Committee, will offer an amendment to \n     the FY2006 Defense Authorization Sill that would defer action \n     on two top USDR legislative goals for 2005--fixing two \n     significant inequities concerning the military Survivor \n     Benefit Plan (SBP).\n       Current law reduces SBP for survivors of members whose \n     death was caused by military service. In those cases, the \n     survivor is entitled to an annuity from the VA (currently \n     $993 a month for a spouse), and the SBP payment is reduced by \n     that amount. In other words, this is a ``widow's tax'' \n     because it wipes out the SBP annuity. USDR believes that, if \n     military service causes the member's death, the VA indemnity \n     payment should be added to SBP, not substituted for it.\n       The other SBP inequity affects older retirees already \n     enrolled in SBP. Congress passed a law in 1998 authorizing \n     paid-up SBP coverage for retirees who have attained age 70 \n     and paid SBP premiums for 30 years (360 payments). This would \n     allow such retirees to stop paying premiums while retaining \n     coverage for their spouses. But Congress delayed the \n     effective date of that law until October 1, 2008, which \n     thousands of retirees who enrolled in SBP in 1972 will have \n     to pay premiums for 36 years--and end up paying about one-\n     third more SSP premiums than similar members who retired \n     after 1978.\n       Sen. Warner's amendment would negate an amendment proposed \n     by Sen. Bill Nelson (D-FL) to end these two major SSP \n     inequities as of October 1, 2005. The Warner amendment would \n     cancel Sen. Nelson's proposals entirely and substitute \n     language calling for a study of the VA/SBP issue. Dare say I \n     that this is so much Equine Scatology?\n       These issues have been studied ad nauseum. There is no \n     further need for more impotent studies. There is need for \n     affirmative action.\n       Please vote NO on any amendments to study, delay, or cancel \n     Sen. Nelson's proposed amendments to correct this gross \n     inequity heaped upon our widows.\n                                                 Charles D.

Bill Nelson,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nelson: I am writing to support your SBP \n     amendment (SA #762) to the 2006 Defense Authorization Bill. \n     The Commissioned Officers Association of the U.S. Public \n     Health Service most strongly opposes any effort to dilute or \n     delay action on the fixes it proposes to the military \n     Survivor Benefit Plan.\n       This Association is firmly opposed to Senator Warner's \n     plans to introduce a ``second-degree'' amendment on Monday, 7 \n     November, that would nullify your initiative to (1) end the \n     unfair deduction of VA benefits for service-connected deaths \n     from military survivors' SBP annuities and (2) accelerate the \n     2008 effective date for 30-year paid-up SBP coverage that now \n     makes ``Greatest Generation'' retirees pay one-third more SBP \n     premiums than similar servicemembers who retired since 1978.\n       Action on these two inequities is already long overdue and \n     uniformed service retirees and survivors need action to fix \n     them now, rather than more delays, studies, and deferrals.\n       COA and the entire Military Coalition urge you to stand \n     firm with your SBP amendment and oppose any and all efforts \n     to dilute, defer, or nullify it\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Gerard M. Farrell,\n                    Captain, U.S. Navy (Ret.), Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I wish to express my support of Senator \nBill Nelson's amendment to improve benefits for the survivors of \nAmerica's servicemembers. This is a very important amendment that \ndeserves the Senate's support.\n  Under current law, annuity payments received under the survivor \nbenefit plan are reduced, dollar for dollar, by benefits received from \nthe VA's dependency and indemnity compensation program.\n  This is not fair. Servicemembers pay into the survivor benefit plan \nand they expect that their surviving spouse and children will receive \nthese benefits upon their death. But if the servicemember's surviving \nspouse is also entitled to dependency and indemnity compensation, then \nthe benefits of the survivor benefit plan are significantly reduced.\n  Families who have lost a servicemember often face a very difficult \nfuture. Military death benefits are a significant help but often fall \nfar short of providing for a secure future for a family. To further \nreduce a family's income by offsetting survivor benefit\n\n[[Page S12488]]\n\nplan benefits seems cruel. This amendment would end this offset. It is \nimperative that we do so now.\n  Enactment of this amendment would also correct another injustice. \nCongress has authorized military retirees who reach 70 years of age and \nwho have paid survivor benefit plan premiums for at least 30 years to \nretain coverage while ceasing any further premium payments. \nUnfortunately, the effective date of this provision has been pushed out \nto October 1, 2008. This forces retirees to continue paying these \npremiums, even though, in some instances, they have been paying \npremiums for 36 years. This amendment would remove this unfair \nrequirement and allow military retirees who have paid great amounts \ninto their annuity plan to cease their payments after 30 years, just as \nCongress intended.\n  Passage of this amendment is urgent. The families of deceased \nservicemembers are dealing with a great deal of stress. They need the \nfinancial benefit provided by this amendment. Military retirees, \nlikewise, deserve the relief now that Congress intended to give them.\n  It has been suggested that we postpone action on this matter until \nafter the Commission on Veterans' Disability Compensation can study the \nlarger issue of disability compensation. While the work of the \nCommission is very important, it is clear to me that the benefits \nprovided by this amendment are of paramount importance and should not \nwait for the conclusion of a more exhaustive study of the disability \ncompensation system. We must stand four-square behind those who have \ngiven their life for their country and behind those who have served \ntheir country for their entire career.\n  I urge my colleagues' support for the Nelson amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may proceed \nfor 2 minutes in support of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair.\n  I commend the Senator from Florida. He has been a passionate \nsupporter of this cause for so long. He has had some success but not \nthe full success which he deserves and which the widows and orphans in \nthis country deserve and which the survivors and our disabled people in \nthis country deserve, people who have given so much. So I want to add \nmy voice in support. I think a strong vote will make the Senate more \nable to maintain this position in conference with the House.\n  I congratulate and thank the Senator from Florida, Mr. Nelson, for \nhis tenacity on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I again join my colleague from Michigan \nand our distinguished colleague, a member of the committee. As the \nSenator says, it is all about veterans, and this is a most deserving \nclass. This is the group that has done a minimum of 20 years, and a \nloyal spouse that has gone through all of the challenges that face \nfamilies in career military service.\n  This is something that has been studied in the Congress for a very \nlong time. It is the subject of a study now. As a matter of fact, it is \ngoing to be the centerpiece of a study. As you know, Mr. President, we \nhave the commission on the future of the Guard and Reserve and \nretirees, and so forth, constituted by the Congress, which has now had \nits first meeting.\n  So I urge colleagues on this side of the aisle to follow my lead and \nsupport the amendment of the Senator from Florida.\n  There was a time in which I thought I would try to work on a second-\ndegree amendment. In consultation with a wide range of my colleagues \nwho have expressed strong support, as I have, we decided not to do \nthat. And then there was the thought about, you know, it is a technical \nthing under the Budget Act. But I don't think it is appropriate to go \nthrough that exercise.\n  So I suggest to all Members of the Senate to give a ringing \nendorsement to this amendment, and I will be among those to cast the \nfirst ``yea'' vote.\n  Again, I congratulate my colleague.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, under regular order, if the yeas and nays \nhave not been ordered, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, do we have two votes now scheduled?\n  Mr. WARNER. We do.\n  I think perhaps we should ask for the yeas and nays on the Snowe \namendment at this time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will that be a 10-minute vote?\n  Mr. WARNER. That will be a 10-minute vote on that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is in order to request \nthe yeas and nays on the amendment at this time.\n  Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient \nsecond.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Under the original order, we were to have the Byrd \namendment which would experience the full length of time for an \namendment. This was subject to 10 minutes. I think we had better \nreconstitute that UC to say that this amendment will be given the full \n15 minutes, the Snowe amendment to have the 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, and I will not, of course, \nhas the Byrd amendment either been adopted--\n  Mr. WARNER. It is laid aside temporarily to come up at the conclusion \nof the Snowe amendment. And then, of course, prior to the Senate \naddressing a vote on the Snowe amendment, there will be 2 minutes for \neach side to address that amendment. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide that veterans with service-connected disabilities \n  rated as total by virtue of unemployability shall be covered by the \n termination of the phase-in of concurrent receipt of retired pay and \n        veterans disability compensation for military retirees)\n\n       At the appropriate place in title VI, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. INCLUSION OF VETERANS WITH SERVICE-CONNECTED \n                   DISABILITIES RATED AS TOTAL BY REASON OF \n                   UNEMPLOYABILITY UNDER TERMINATION OF PHASE-IN \n                   OF CONCURRENT RECEIPT OF RETIRED PAY AND \n                   VETERANS' DISABILITY COMPENSATION.\n\n       (a) Inclusion of Veterans.--Section 1414(a)(1) of title 10, \n     United States Code, is amended by inserting ``or a qualified \n     retiree receiving veterans' disability compensation for a \n     disability rated as total (within the meaning of subsection \n     (e)(3)(B))'' after ``rated as 100 percent''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall take effect on December 31, 2004.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of our Nation's \nveterans to once again discuss the unfair, outdated policy of \n``concurrent receipt.'' It is an issue I have talked about on this \nfloor many times.\n  Concurrent receipt is a policy which prevents veterans from receiving \nthe full pay and benefits they have earned. Many Senators have joined \nme in fighting this policy over the years, and we have made some \nprogress on behalf of our veterans.\n  In 2003, the Congress passed legislation which allowed disabled \nretired veterans with at least a 50 percent disability rating to become \neligible for full concurrent receipt benefits over a 10-year period. \nThis was a significant victory that put hundreds of thousands of \nveterans on the road to receiving both their retirement and disability \nbenefits.\n  Last year, we made a little more progress. I joined with Senator \nLevin and others, and we were able to eliminate the 10-year phase in \nperiod for the most severely disabled veterans, those with a 100 \npercent disability rating.\n  As we noted at that time, the 10-year waiting period is particularly \nharsh for these veterans, some of whom would not live to see their full \nbenefits restored over the 10-year period, and others who could not \nwork a second job and were in fact considered ``unemployable.'' So we \npassed legislation to end the waiting period and provide some relief to \nthese deserving, totally disabled veterans.\n  Unfortunately, as I noted on this floor a few months ago, the \nadministration has failed to implement our legislation. Instead of \neliminating the waiting period for veterans who are 100 percent \ndisabled, they have eliminated it only for some.\n  They have created two categories of disabled veterans. If you are \nrated as ``totally disabled,'' you do not have to wait. You get 100 \npercent of your benefits today. But if you are rated as \n``unemployable,'' you still have to wait.\n  This is not what we intended when we passed legislation last year. \nAnd earlier in this session, a number of Senators and I sought to \ncorrect this disparity.\n  We passed a sense of the Senate resolution that clearly expressed our \nintentions: all completely disabled veterans should have their benefits \nrestored immediately. This was not an attempt to make law, but merely \nto express what my colleagues on both sides of the isle intended when \nwe passed legislation last year.\n  Unfortunately, the majority-controlled conference committee removed \nthis resolution. So today, veterans rated as ``unemployable'' continue \nto face this delay.\n  This is not a partisan issue. These veterans do not have 10 years to \nwait for the full phase in of their benefits. It is time for the \nadministration to stop playing games and start honoring these veterans \nservice.\n  For all other purposes, both the VA and the Defense Department treat \n``unemployables'' exactly the same as those with a ``totally disabled'' \nratings.\n  In fact, these unemployables must meet a criterion that not even the \n100 percent-rated disability retirees have to meet. They are certified \nas unable to work because of their service-connected disability. The \nadministration pays equal combat-related special compensation to both \ncategories.\n  Yet, the administration is discriminating unemployables and 100 \npercent disabled retirees with non-combat disabilities in flagrant \ndisregard for the letter of the law as interpreted its own legal \ncounsel.\n  So once again, I rise on these veterans' behalf. Today I introduce \namendment No. 2441, legislation which explicitly ends the 10-year \nwaiting period for the most disabled veterans.\n  The time to act is now.\n  I hope my Republican colleagues will join me in supporting this bill. \nThese veterans have faced arbitrary discrimination long enough. We must \npass this legislation, so that these veterans can get the benefits they \ndeserve.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If all time is yielded back, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2441) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2436\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we will now return to the vote on the \nSnowe amendment, am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. There are 2 minutes \nevenly divided.\n  Mr. WARNER. Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, they have.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2436, as Modified\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to modify my \namendment with the changes at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment will be so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2436), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 5, after line 16, insert the following:\n       (e) No Effect on Certain Property Interests.--Nothing in \n     this section or the amendments made by this section shall be \n     construed to affect any reversionary interest, remainder \n     interest, executory interest, right of entry, or possibility \n     of reverter held in real or personal property at a military \n     installation closed or realigned under the Defense Base \n     Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 (part A of title XXIX of \n     Public Law 101-510; 10 U.S.C. 2687 note).\n\n  Mr. SNOWE. Mr. President, the amendment that I and Senator Collins \nhave offered, which is cosponsored by Senators Wyden, Corzine, and \nLandrieu, would require that, when making determinations concerning the \ntransfer of property at installations to be closed or realigned under \nthe current BRAC round, the Secretary of Defense must first offer that \nproperty to the affected communities--and if they accept the offer--\ntransfer it to those communities free of cost.\n  It is a perverse situation when communities that have already \ncontributed toward the more than $200 billion spent on the war in \nIraq--$28.5 billion of which was spent on redevelopment efforts in that \ncountry--and now face base realignments or closures--are being told \nthat, if they want property for economic recovery, they will have to \nbuy it at fair market value.\n  Our communities should be in the driver seat concerning their \neconomic development, but that is not what current statute allows--\ninstead, putting these irrevocable decisions in the hands of the \nDepartment of Defense. Our amendment puts the priority where it \nbelongs--with our towns and cities, not a Federal bureaucracy.\n  Now, some have argued the amendment would change a time-tested \nframework of laws that dictate how properties should be transferred \nfollowing a base closure or realignment and that ensure that all base \nrounds are treated consistently. I say Defense Base Closure and \nRealignment Act is not sacrosanct--it has changed many times in the \npast--and will again. In fact, for the first time ever, the Secretary \nof Defense is mandated to seek fair market value, in the case of an \neconomic development conveyance to a community for redevelopment \npurpose.\n\n[[Page S12490]]\n\nNow that's a change that should engender concern!\n  Opponents also expressed concerns that the amendment would in some \nway affect existing reversionary interests in deeds, which provide that \nupon a closure or realignment, installation property would revert back \nto a community interest. We have modified it today, clarifying that \nnothing in the amendment shall be construed to affect any reversionary \ninterest in property at the installation.\n  As for protecting the pre-existing rights of Native Americans my \nfriend and colleague, Senator Warner, was correct in noting that my \namendment contains a provision explicitly retaining those rights.\n  Additionally, the amendment would not inhibit various military or \nFederal agency uses of this property--or impede public benefit \ntransfers for schools or parks. Communities would retain the ability to \nproceed with such opportunities, if they deem them beneficial. \nConversely, if there is a use that a community drastically opposes, \nlike an oil refinery prison--it should have the ability to oppose it . \n. . which the amendment allows. Still, the amendment does contain an \nexception providing the Secretary of Defense the authority to make \ntransfers in the national security interest of the United States.\n  Finally, to suggestions that base property is owned by the entire \nnation, and that it is not necessarily fair to provide it to affected \ncommunities, I could not disagree more.\n  According to the Government Accountability Office, the DoD has saved \nas a result of BRAC closures--about $28.9 billion in net savings \nthrough fiscal year 2003 from the prior four closure rounds, and is \nprojected to save $7 billion annually thereafter. While the entire \nNation can financially benefit from these savings associated with BRAC \nclosures, it is crucial to note that the negative impacts of base \nclosures are disproportionately and unfairly borne by the communities \nwhere bases have closed. That is why it is a responsible course of \naction for the government to provide these communities with the tools \nand resources, such as required no-cost economic development \nconveyances, needed to recover from a closure.\n  The modification to the amendment that I offered yesterday would \naddress the concerns raised about whether my amendment would have \nchanged reversionary interests in deeds, which would provide that upon \nclosure and realignment, installation property would revert back to a \ncommunity interest. We have modified it today, clarifying that nothing \nin the amendment shall be construed to affect any reversionary interest \nin property at the installation, and that was to address some of the \nconcerns raised with respect to my amendment.\n  To remind Members, the amendment I am offering today, on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Collins, Senator Lott, Senator Landrieu, Senator Wyden, \nand Senator Corzine, would allow for the free transfer of closed \nmilitary bases to communities directly affected rather than allowing \nthe Secretary of Defense to demand fair market value.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator's time has \nexpired.\n  Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I speak in strong opposition to this \namendment. I thank the Senator from Maine for accepting a number of the \nproblems that I described yesterday, but there still exists an enormous \nnumber of problems associated with this amendment.\n  For 16 years and five BRAC rounds, we have tried, in an equitable \nway, to work with the communities and return these properties. On \noccasion, they have been sold and funds given to the Department of \nDefense, put in an escrow account in the Treasury for expenditure of \ncleanup of other sites and associated costs connected with the transfer \nof properties and the conclusion and implementation of the BRAC \ndecisions. This would wipe out that whole framework of legislation that \nhas been passed by this body and has effectively worked for the \ncommunities for all of these years. We simply cannot, at this point in \ntime, accept this type of change in our statutory framework as a matter \nof equity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I too object to the amendment. It is \ninflexible. It provides no possibility that no matter how valuable----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senator was necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Arizona (Mr. McCain).\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Corzine) \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announcd--yeas 36, nays 62, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 308 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--36\n\n     Bayh\n     Bond\n     Cantwell\n     Clinton\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Roberts\n     Schumer\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--62\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Byrd\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Dayton\n     DeMint\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Hatch\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kyl\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Corzine\n     McCain\n       \n  The amendment (No. 2436), as modified, was rejected.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I understand we will now proceed to a \nbrief colloquy between colleagues on both sides of the aisle with \nregard to the Levin amendment. That colloquy should, in total, not \nexceed about 10 or 11 minutes, and then we will proceed to a rollcall \nvote. At this time, shall we ask for the yeas and nays on the Levin \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I talked to the manager, the chairman of \nthe committee, about this. I ask unanimous consent there be 6 minutes \nallotted on our side in support of the amendment and that 3 minutes be \nallotted to the Senator from Virginia and that we then vote by no later \nthan 25 to 6.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, may I remind colleagues we will try to \nmaintain this as a 15-minute vote because thereafter we have a vote on \nthe amendment of the Senator from Rhode Island and we want not to \ninconvenience several Members who have very legitimate reasons to not \nbe present after these two votes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I was hoping we would have a vote on the \namendment which I had offered earlier, or in relation thereto, a \nrollcall vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. On our side, we would be happy to accommodate that vote \nfollowing the vote on the amendment of the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is it my understanding the Senator from West Virginia \nwould accept a voice vote?\n  Mr. BYRD. No.\n  Mr. WARNER. I want to make it known now that the Senator from West \nVirginia has substantially revised his amendment in accordance with \nrecommendations, if I may say with a\n\n[[Page S12491]]\n\nsense of humility, that I made. He fully adopted those. I am going to \nsupport the amendment strongly, so it should be a very swift vote. No \nfurther debate would be required except for maybe a minute for you and \na minute for me.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will that occur this day?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \n10-minute vote on the matter raised by the Senator from Rhode Island \nthat we proceed to a third vote of 10 minutes on the amendment of the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, I wonder if the Senator \nfrom West Virginia would modify that so that the vote on the Byrd \namendment would come immediately after the vote on my amendment and \nthen we would proceed to the vote on the Reed-Levin amendment?\n  Mr. WARNER. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2430\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that Senators Lautenberg, \nFeinstein, Biden, and Akaka be added as cosponsors of amendment No. \n2430.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this is an amendment that would create an \nindependent commission that would look into allegations of detainee \nabuses. I yield myself 2 minutes and then I will yield 2 minutes to the \nSenator from Delaware and then 2 minutes to the Senator from Illinois, \nif he is here.\n  There are major gaps in the investigation which has taken place so \nfar. We have heard a lot about the number of hearings that have been \nheld. We have heard that 12 major investigations have taken place, 30 \nopen hearings, 40 closed hearings, and so forth. None of the hearings, \nnone of the investigations, have gotten to five areas. These are huge \ngaps, and we cannot sweep these gaps under the rug.\n  No. 1, none has looked at the role of the intelligence community, the \nCIA role, secret prisons, ghost detainees. It is a huge area which \nneeds to be focused on.\n  No. 2, the Government policy on renditions, there has been no review \nof this.\n  No. 3, the role of contractors, there has been no investigation of \nthe role of contractors.\n  No. 4, the legality of interrogation techniques, there has been no \nassessment of the legality of interrogation techniques.\n  There are two memos we have not been able to obtain that an \nindependent commission with subpoena power could obtain, the second so-\ncalled Bybee memo and the March 3 memo from Mr. Yoo to the Department \nof Defense. They set forth what is allowed in terms of interrogation \ntechniques. We cannot get those memos. An independent commission, a \nbipartisan commission based on the 9/11 model, could get those memos. \nThey are critically important. And there are additional outstanding \ndocument requests which have been ignored.\n  This matter cannot be swept under the rug. No matter how many \nhearings have been held, there are major gaps that exist in reviewing \nthis matter. We owe it to our troops, the men and women who wear the \nuniform for the United States, that we get the full picture and get it \nbehind us. That is what is essential to restore the credibility of this \nNation as well as to support the men and women who someday may be \ncaptured by our enemy, and we sure don't want any enemy of ours to ever \ncite that we ignored the violations that apparently have existed.\n  I now yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Illinois and then 2 minutes \nto the Senator from Delaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I rise in strong support of this amendment, and I am \nhonored to be an original cosponsor.\n  We owe this to our troops. Anyone who came to the Chamber and heard \nthe speech given by Senator John McCain about an amendment which he \noffered to the Defense appropriations bill will understand it was a \nhistoric statement. Senator McCain, a prisoner of war in Vietnam and a \nperson who was the victim of torture, said it was imperative that we \nmake it clear to our troops what the standard of conduct would be.\n  What Senator Levin has done is to call together an inquiry as to \nwhether we have violated this standard in the past and what the \nstandard will be for the future. When we receive correspondence from \nour troops, who are risking their lives for America today, begging us \nto not only stand up for American values but to do it with clarity, we \nowe them that responsibility.\n  When the President announces in South America that we are opposed to \ntorture while the Vice President is carving out exceptions for torture \nin legislation before Congress, there is no clarity.\n  Senator Levin and his leadership will bring us to clarity and to \nhonesty, consistent with the American values which our troops are \nfighting to defend.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, back in January I used a similar amendment \nfor the first bill I introduced this year. There is a simple reason for \nit: It is more clear it is needed now. We have to take this out of \npolitics. As long as we are involved, we will argue this about \nDemocrat-Republican. It is not about Democrat-Republican. The world has \nchanged. It has changed utterly.\n  The fact is we need a clear-eyed assessment of where we are in this \nchanged world. This is a lot less about them--that is, the prisoners \nand the terrorists. It is much more about us and our troops. I wonder \nwhat happens the first time an American troop is captured anywhere in \nthis or a future war and turned over to the secret police of that \ncountry, taken to a spot that no one knows, one that is clandestine. I \nwonder what happens then.\n  It is all about where we stand as a nation, about our values. We are \nin, as everyone says in this Senate, a battle for the hearts and minds \nof 1.2 billion people who share a different religion and maybe a \ndifferent point of view. We are hurting, not helping, our troops. We \nare hurting, not helping, our cause. We have to have a clear-eyed \nresolution of it. The clearest way to do this is through a commission.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I stand in opposition to the amendment for many reasons \nwhich I have stated on three previous occasions, including early this \nmorning addressing this amendment.\n  The distinguished Senator from Delaware talked about looking forward \nto our troops. I draw the attention of colleagues to Defense Department \ndirective No. 3115.09 issued on the 3rd of November of this year in \nwhich they set forth the new regulations and rules with regard to \ntreatment of prisoners. The directive provides overarching policy to \nthe Department. It codifies existing departmental studies, including \nthe requirement for humane treatment of captured or detained persons \nduring intelligence interrogation and questioning, assigns \nresponsibilities for interrogation planning and training, and \nestablishes requirements for reporting violations of the policy \nregarding humane treatment.\n  Section 3443 is a directive addressing some specific abuse detailed \nin past investigations. The directive specifically requires the Central \nIntelligence Agency interrogation must follow Pentagon guidelines when \nquestioning military prisoners and that a DOD representative be \npresent. Further, this release should be followed by the revision of \nthe Department of the Army Field Manual which is the subject of the \nMcCain amendment, which I strongly support, on interrogations which \nthis Senate overwhelmingly directed become the U.S. standard as part of \nthe amendment proposed by Senator McCain.\n  Our Government collectively is moving in the right direction to \ncorrect the problems of the past, clearly, such that the whole world \nknows how our Nation stands against this type of abuse that occurred in \nthe past. I strongly urge our colleagues not to start up another \ncommission in the middle of our war in Iraq and Afghanistan, and for \nthe next year or 18 months begin to go over the material which this \nSenate time and time again has addressed in debates, on which our \nCommittees on Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, and Armed Services have \nreviewed this question with some dozen investigations conducted by our\n\n[[Page S12492]]\n\nGovernment, largely the Department of Defense.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  I have an agreement regarding future votes so Senators can make their \nplans. I ask consent following debate on the Levin amendment, which is \nnow concluded, Senator Reed be recognized to speak for not more than 5 \nminutes in relation to his amendment; further, that following the \nstatement, the Senate proceed to a series of stacked votes in relation \nto the following amendments: Levin amendment 2430; Byrd amendment 2442, \nas modified; and the Reed amendment 2427.\n  There is no time here for Senator Byrd. I amend this to allow 2 \nminutes by Senator Byrd and a minute by the Senator from Virginia who \nintends to support Senator Byrd.\n  Further, provided that no second degrees be in order to the \namendments prior to the votes. Finally, there be 2 minutes equally \ndivided between the votes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. There is an objection.\n  We reversed the order, No. 1, and there needs to be time for debate \nbefore one of those amendments. I urge there be a unanimous consent \nagreement entered into now that after this vote we proceed immediately \nto a vote on the Byrd amendment, and between this vote and the vote on \nthe Byrd amendment, we work out an agreeable unanimous consent.\n  Mr. WARNER. We will now proceed to the debate on your amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The vote on my amendment immediately as we agreed upon, \nand then we go immediately to the Byrd amendment. Between the vote here \non my amendment and the Byrd amendment, we work on a unanimous consent \nrelative to the other amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. In no event would we lose the opportunity to have the \nvotes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I hope not, but we have not agreed with that yet. We have \nto clear that with our leader.\n  Mr. REED. There was initially a 5-minute opportunity for me to speak \non my amendment. Will that take place immediately or be postponed until \nafter the vote on the Levin amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I will restate the unanimous consent request in the hopes \nit can be agreed to.\n  I ask consent that following debate on the Levin amendment--that \ndebate has taken place--we go to the Byrd amendment. That would require \n2 minutes by the Senator from West Virginia, 1 minute by the Senator \nfrom Virginia, following the vote on the Levin amendment, and then we \nproceed to the Reed amendment with 5 minutes on both sides with regard \nto debate prior to the vote on the Reed of Rhode Island amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the Levin amendment.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Then that is a 10-minute vote.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2442, as Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWest Virginia has 2 minutes, and the Senator from Virginia has 1 \nminute.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Pentagon continues to have massive \nmanagement problems. The GAO believes that billions of taxpayer dollars \ncould be saved each year, if these problems can be straightened out. \nThis modification to my amendment would require an expedited study on \nwhether there should be a Deputy Secretary of Defense for Management to \ntake charge of fixing the Pentagon's accounting problems. I thank the \ncosponsors of my modified amendment: Chairman Warner, Senator Ensign, \nSenator Akaka, and Senator Lautenberg. I am encouraged by Chairman \nWarner's intention to hold further hearings in the Armed Services \nCommittee once these reports are submitted to Congress.\n  Fixing the pervasive--I mean pervasive--accounting problems at the \nDepartment of Defense will require more hearings, more oversight, and \nmore accountability. I took note of this some years ago when Secretary \nRumsfeld first appeared before the Armed Services Committee. He \nadmitted there was a problem, a very difficult problem. He indicated he \nwas going to do something about it. I think he needs help.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the coming months to \nset the Pentagon on an accelerated track for reform.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I strongly urge colleagues to support the \nByrd-Warner amendment. I am the principal cosponsor. I commend my \ndistinguished colleague from West Virginia. The Department of Defense \nwas established in 1947, over a half century ago. It has served the \nNation well, but there have been many changes. This will give the Armed \nServices Committee, the Government Operations Committee, perhaps other \ncommittees of Congress, a chance to take a good look at that Department \nand how best, if necessary, to restructure it to meet the future \nchallenges before us.\n  I thank the Senator from West Virginia. I urge all Senators to vote \nin favor of the amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that I be added as a cosponsor to \nthe Byrd amendment, and I congratulate him on trying to address a \nproblem which is endemic. It seems perpetual. I believe it is going to \ntake all the energy of this body and the other body to force them to \nmake the kind of changes this could lead to. I congratulate the \nSenator.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished senior Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator seek to modify the pending \namendment?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, the modification is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification? \nWithout objection, the amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n       At the end of subtitle A of title IX, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

Mr. President, under the regular order, the Senate will \nnow proceed with the Reed of Rhode Island vote, with 5 minutes for the \nSenator from Rhode Island and 3 to 4 minutes for the Senator from \nVirginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. There is 10 minutes \nequally divided on amendment No. 2427. The Senator from Rhode Island is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, this amendment would transfer $50 million \nfrom the Missile Defense Program to the Cooperative Threat Reduction \nProgram which is designed to secure nuclear materials and nuclear \nweapons in countries around the globe, principally the former Soviet \nUnion.\n  A few facts I think are in order.\n  First, with respect to missile defense funding, in the emergency \nsupplemental appropriations bill for the global war on terror, there \nwas an additional $50 million appropriated that was not required or \nasked for by the Agency. With this money, even with this amendment, the \nAgency still would have sufficient money to carry out its programmed \noperations for this year. Again, we are just transferring $50 million \nfrom this rather expensive program overall.\n  Let me briefly recap where we are with respect to the program.\n  The administration has already requested and Congress has provided \nfunds for 30 interceptors. There are nine already in the ground. There \nare others being constructed. There are 21 that are in some aspect of \nconstruction. Yet in the fiscal year 2006 budget, there is a request \nfor 10 additional operational interceptors, plus 8 test interceptors, \nfor 18 in all. Again, these are in addition to the 30 interceptors that \nare already planned for.\n  In addition to that, I must point out that the production rate \ncapacity for these interceptors is 12 per year. So we are asking for \nmore missiles than can be produced in 1 year. So there are ample funds \nwith respect to missile defense. We are asking for more missiles than \ncan be produced in 1 year--many more missiles than can be produced. \nThis is a situation that I believe calls for readjustment of funds, \nmoving it to another compelling need.\n  One of the compelling needs I urge on my colleagues is to fund the \nCooperative Threat Reduction Program. President Bush and President \nPutin met in Bratislava months ago and created a unique opportunity for \nadditional funding of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program. This \nmeeting took place after preparation of the budget. So moving $50 \nmillion from missile defense to the Cooperative Threat Reduction \nProgram will allow this country to carry out the pledge President Bush \nmade to President Putin to more aggressively secure 15 additional \nsites.\n  There is one final point I would like to make. There is often the \nargument, well, we shouldn't fund the Cooperative Threat Reduction \nProgram because there are so many unobligated funds; they can't use the \nmoney. In August of this year, the Missile Defense Program had $844 \nmillion in unobligated funds. If the Missile Defense Agency has $844 \nmillion in unobligated funds, I don't think anyone would stand up \nimmediately and say they can't use it, don't need it, et cetera. The \nsame goes for the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program. We have needs \nout there. The greatest threat to face this country, in my view, is the \ncombination of terrorists and nuclear materials. We are going after the \nterrorists. We have to also aggressively go after nuclear materials. We \ncan do this.\n  This is a very modest transfer of funds for a program that is vitally \nimportant to fulfill the pledge that the President made with President \nPutin, and it will not in any way impair the funding available for \nmissile defense.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in opposition to the amendment, I bring to \nthe attention of our colleagues that the CTR Program, of which our \ndistinguished colleague from Indiana, Mr. Lugar, was the principal \nauthor and sponsor, is fully funded at the budget request of $415.5 \nmillion. There still remains an unobligated balance of $107 million \nfrom the 2005 funds. So this category of our important work is fully \nfunded and moving ahead on its schedule of expenditures.\n  In contrast, the Missile Defense Program this year took a $1 billion \ncut as part of the internal DOD budget deliberations, and missile \ndefense is also reduced by $5 billion over the period 2006 to 2011. By \nadopting the Reed amendment, we would have a fracture in the long-lead \nfunding, resulting in a production break which, on the assumption it \nwould be restarted, would cost the taxpayers another $270 billion.\n  Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, I have a sheet here that shows \nhow three consecutive times this\n\n[[Page S12494]]\n\nChamber has voted basically on this amendment and defeated it. A $500 \nmillion cut by Senator Levin was defeated in June of 2004 by 56 votes, \nfollowed by a Boxer amendment limiting deployment of ground-based \ninterceptors, defeated by 57 votes, and a Reed amendment again defeated \nby 53 votes--incidentally, all of those having some measure of \nbipartisan support. So we are revisiting the same issue.\n  I strongly recommend to my colleagues that this amendment not be \nadopted.\n  Have the yeas and nays been ordered, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not been ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I so request the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, we have spent quite a bit of time talking \nabout this amendment. This does amend sections 1201 and 1204 of title \nXII, to provide our Government with new authorities to fight the global \nwar on terror. We have initially had some concerns, both from the other \nside and from a couple of the other committees. We have worked out the \ncompromise, and that is what this modification is.\n  In an effort to accommodate my colleagues on the Foreign Relations \nCommittee and my colleagues across the aisle, we have made some \nmodifications to our original amendment. These modifications provide a \nsunset for this authority on September 30, 2007. They provide for some \nlimitation of DOD authority in section 1201, subject to existing law in \nthe foreign relations and foreign appropriations act.\n  With these modifications, I think that it is going to be a great help \nto the administration.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Lugar be added as a cosponsor of \nmy amendment.\n\n[[Page S12495]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to thank Senator Inhofe for the \nexcellent work he has done on this amendment and his generous efforts \nto accommodate my previous concerns. In my view, his original amendment \nmay have had some unintended foreign policy consequences. In \nparticular, it might have produced some far-reaching changes to the way \nthat our country makes foreign assistance decisions.\n  The amendment as now written leaves the authority for deciding which \ncountries, and when, how, and why foreign assistance should be \nprovided, in the hands of the Secretary of State. The amendment does \nnot provide statutory authority to the Secretary of Defense to \nestablish a new foreign aid program outside the purview of the \nSecretary of State. It does authorize the Secretary of Defense to \nprovide funding to the State Department for a new train and equip \nforeign assistance program, as well as to address overseas emergencies \nwhere the two Departments need to join forces to meet the crisis \nsuccessfully.\n  I support the $750 million train and equip program and the $200 \nmillion emergency funding. Both programs can be successfully carried \nout under the Secretary of State's existing authorities. The Secretary \nof State should retain full authority over decisions as to which \ncountries should receive assistance, the timing of its provision, and \nthe way in which it should be provided. The Department of Defense \nshould continue implementing train and equip programs under the purview \nof the Secretary of State.\n  I understand that there have been frustrations with the current \nsituation. The Defense Department has apparently found State Department \noversight of these kinds of programs cumbersome and slow. These \nobstacles need to be overcome. State Department procedures should be \nstreamlined and the two Departments should develop plans to push these \nimportant programs forward efficiently and quickly.\n  But all foreign assistance programs need to take place within a \nforeign policy context, with consideration of the traditional \nconcerns--the recipient country's treatment of its own people, \npotential reactions from neighboring states in the region, and the \noverall bilateral relationship with the recipient country, including \nits assistance in the war against terrorism.\n  It is the Secretary of State's job to weigh such foreign policy \nissues and make recommendations to the President that strike the right \nbalance for American interests. The amendment as now written meets the \nconcerns I had and I would request that I be listed as a co-sponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I strongly recommend to colleagues the \nacceptance of this amendment. It has been carefully thought through. It \nis a policy that has been joined in jointly by the Secretaries of State \nand Defense. It is the expectation that to the extent we are successful \nwith these programs, it likely will go to the deployment of our troops \nabroad in various situations we deem necessary to protect our own \nnational interests.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. First, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for his \namendment, for working to modify that amendment. We think it is a \nprudent and useful amendment and that it addresses a very significant \nissue which is how do we obtain more support from other countries to be \neffective in our effort against terrorism. So we want to thank the \nSenator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the ranking member and the chairman for those \ncomments.\n  Mr. WARNER. I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2432), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Subject to the concurrence of the ranking member, I ask \nthe Senate to turn its attention to the Senator from Nevada, who has an \namendment which I personally strongly endorse and so recommend to other \ncolleagues. It could well be the subject of a rollcall vote sometime \ntomorrow. I thank him for his consideration of laying down the \namendment tonight such that colleagues have the time within which to \nstudy it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2443\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Ensign] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2443.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To restate United States policy on the use of riot control \n     agents by members of the Armed Forces, and for other purposes)\n\n       On page 286, between lines 7 and 8, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1073. RIOT CONTROL AGENTS.\n\n       (a) Restatement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United \n     States that riot control agents are not chemical weapons and \n     that the president may authorize their use as legitimate, \n     legal, and non-lethal alternatives to the use of force that, \n     as provided in Executive Order 11850 (40 Fed. Reg. 16187) and \n     consistent with the resolution of ratification of the \n     Chemical Weapons convention, may be employed by members of \n     the Armed Forces in war in defensive military modes to save \n     lives, including the illustrative purposes cited in Executive \n     Order 11850.\n       (b) Report Required.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the President shall submit to \n     Congress a report on the use of riot control agents by \n     members of the Armed Forces.\n       (2) Content.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall \n     include--\n       (A) a description of all regulations, doctrines, training \n     materials, and any other information related to the use of \n     riot control agents by members of the Armed Forces;\n       (B) a description of the doctrinal publications, training, \n     and other resources provided or available to members of the \n     Armed Forces on an annual basis with regard to the tactical \n     employment of riot control agents;\n       (C) a description of how the material described in \n     subparagraphs (A) and (B) is consistent with United States \n     policy on the use of riot control agents;\n       (D) a description of the availability of riot control \n     agents, and the means to employ them, to members of the Armed \n     Forces deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan;\n       (E) a description of the frequency of use of riot control \n     agents since January 1, 1992, and a summary of views held by \n     military commanders about the utility of the employing riot \n     control agents by members of the Armed Forces;\n       (F) a general description of steps taken or to be taken by \n     the Department of Defense to clarify the circumstances under \n     which riot control agents may be used by members of the Armed \n     Forces; and\n       (G) an assessment of the legality of Executive Order 11850, \n     including an explanation why Executive Order 11850 remains \n     valid under United States law.\n       (3) Form.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall be \n     submitted in unclassified form, but may include a classified \n     annex.\n       (c) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Chemical weapons convention.--The term ``Chemical \n     Weapons Convention'' means the Convention on the Prohibitions \n     of Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical \n     Weapons and on Their Destruction, with annexes, done at \n     Paris, January 13, 1993, and entered into force April 29, \n     1997 (T. Doc. 103-21).\n       (2) Resolution of ratification of the chemical weapons \n     convention.--The term ``resolution of ratification of the \n     Chemical Weapons Convention'' means S. Res. 75, 105th \n     Congress, agreed to April 24, 1997, advising and consenting \n     to the ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, before I make my full statement, I want my \ncolleagues to know that the amendment that I have sent to the desk is \nsomething that we have been working with the administration on for \nalmost 8 months now. I believe we have come up with a compromise that \nmost people in the administration support. It is a very important \namendment as far as the foreign policy and the military policy of our \ncountry is concerned.\n  This amendment will allow our soldiers and marines to more \neffectively carry out their mission on the ground in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, while saving both military and civilian lives.\n\n[[Page S12496]]\n\n  Riot control agents, more commonly referred to as tear gas, can be a \nmore effective alternative to the use of lethal weapons in combat. It \nis shocking and unacceptable that under current policy our military is \nbanned from using tear gas on the battlefield. Let me restate that. \nUnder current policy, our military is banned from using tear gas on the \nbattlefield.\n  Police officers in any city in America can use tear gas to avoid the \nloss of life, but our men and women carrying out the global war on \nterror cannot. This is not right and it must change.\n  This restriction on the use of tear gas is the direct result of the \nbureaucracy's faulty interpretation of the 1997 Chemical Weapons \nConvention, an interpretation made by arms control advocates in \nBrussels and The Hague and regrettably at our own State Department. \nUnder this faulty interpretation, tear gas is considered a chemical \nweapon. In those isolated cases where it can be used, it requires \nPresidential authorization. This is wrong. The use of riot control \nagents in combat for defensive purposes to save lives is wholly \nconsistent with the U.S. obligations under the laws of land warfare and \nof our treaty obligations.\n  Retaining this capability was so important to our military leaders \nthat the Senate included a condition in the 1997 Chemical Weapons \nConvention that preserved our right to use tear gas in conflict. Many \nMembers today were in the Senate when this matter was debated. All \nconcurred with the arguments put forward by then-chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, Colin Powell, that giving up this capability is not \neven worth getting the treaty. Here is what he said:\n\n       Nonlethal riot control agents provide a morally correct \n     option to achieve defensive military objectives without \n     having to resort to the unnecessary loss of innocent lives. \n     Sacrificing such an option would be an unacceptable price to \n     pay for a CW [chemical weapons] treaty.\n\n  Senators Lugar, Biden, and others spoke eloquently on this point in a \nbipartisan manner. Senators knew then, and many do know now, that the \nuse of nonlethal weapons, such as tear gas, is demonstrated routinely \nto be effective by law enforcement agencies all over the world. It is a \nmoral alternative to the use of lethal force.\n  In towns and streets throughout Iraq and Afghanistan, marines and \nsoldiers are going house to house in an attempt to flush out hiding \nterrorists. In carrying out this vital mission, structures are damaged \nand innocent people are killed. Some of that death and destruction \ncould be avoided if we allowed our military to use tear gas instead of \nbullets. In other cases, we know of situations where the insurgents \nhave mixed in with innocent civilians, using them as human shields, \nforcing our fighting men and women to either retreat or fire into a \ncrowd, which is a choice they should not have to make.\n  I am reminded of a New York Times article, dated June 28 of this \nyear. It chronicled marines clearing a town in Iraq. The article \nreferenced one particular incident where three civilians, a mother and \ntwo children, were killed as marines battled an insurgent who had taken \nthe family hostage. Perhaps the use of tear gas would have saved their \nlives; perhaps not. We will never know that. What we do know is that \nthose marines were not provided every tool with which to carry out this \nglobal war on terrorism.\n  Certainly our image has been tarnished as a nation, and our public \ndiplomacy has suffered every time we use lethal force to clear a room, \nempty a building or take other actions that wound or kill innocent \npeople. This is unconscionable when nonlethal alternatives are \navailable. Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, in testimony before the House \nArmed Services Committee, described the restriction on the use of riot \ncontrol agents as a straitjacket. Here is what he said:\n\n       We are doing our best to live within the straitjacket that \n     has been imposed on us on this subject. We are trying to find \n     ways that non-lethal agents could be used within the law.\n\n  He went on to point out that our soldiers and marines are authorized \nto shoot and to kill people in situations where tear gas is prohibited. \nThis is a lethal lapse in legal judgment. It seems as if some would put \nthe concerns of the global arms control theocracy above the lives of \nour military personnel. If anybody is watching or listening and they \nare scratching their head wondering where is the common sense, that is \nexactly what I thought and what led me to offer this amendment.\n  In fact, our military has been so spooked about this issue they don't \nknow how to train themselves on Riot Control Agent use on the \nbattlefield. The Tactical Employment of Nonlethal Weapons training \nmanual, dated January 2003, is applicable to all military branches. It \nspecifically reminds all that ``. . . using Riot Control Agents in an \narmed conflict requires Presidential approval.''\n  Additionally, the Department of Defense's Joint Doctrine \nEncyclopedia, dated July 1997, advises that ``Commanders must consider \nthe international ramifications . . . before recommending the use of \nherbicides or Riot Control Agents.''\n  Now, there are those who erroneously claim my amendment seeks to \nchange long standing policy on the use of riot control agents in combat \nand runs counter to U.S. treaty commitments.\n  In fact, my amendment seeks merely to reaffirm the policy of the \nUnited States since 1975, and the Senate's view on this issue from \n1997, by stating that it is the policy of the United States that Riot \nControl Agents are not chemical weapons but are legitimate, legal, and \nnon-lethal alternatives to the use of lethal force. It adds that these \ntools may be employed by members of the Armed Forces in defensive \nmilitary modes to save lives.\n  My amendment further requires the President to submit a one-time \nreport to Congress on the availability and use of Riot Control Agents \nby our fighting men and women. It includes reporting language that \nprods the State Department to speak about and advocate the U.S. view on \nthis important life-saving tool in multilateral forums. Finally, my \namendment presses the Pentagon to develop this capability, which has \nlanguished in our training regimens, our doctrine, and our tactics \nthrough lack of use.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to reaffirm this policy, to reaffirm what \nthe Senate said in 1997, and to send a strong message to our men and \nwomen in uniform that the Senate puts their welfare above misguided \ninterpretations of arcane international agreements, that the Senate \nwants to give them a full range of tools to help them accomplish their \nmission in Iraq and Afghanistan, and that we want to do so in a manner \nthat doesn't jeopardize their lives or those of innocent civilians.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I want very much to support my colleague \nfrom Nevada, but I would like to have some clarification. I tried to \nlisten very carefully to what the Senator said. I want to see if my \ninterpretation of the amendment is correct.\n  I begin by saying the question of whether and how the use of riot \ncontrol agents would be limited by the Chemical Weapons Convention \nbecame a major issue when the treaty was considered by the Senate for \nratification in 1997. The resolution of ratification for the CWC \ncontains a condition requiring the President to certify that the United \nStates is not restricted by the CWC in its use of riot control agents \nin certain specified circumstances. The condition also required the \nPresident not to eliminate or alter Executive Order 11850--which I have \nbefore me; it was signed by President Ford on April 8, 1975--which \nprohibits the use of riot control agents in war except in defensive \nmilitary modes to save lives.\n  Now, I turn to the Executive Order 11850 and specifically ask the \nSenator, is his interpretation of his amendment consistent with the \nobjectives as stated in Executive Order 11850, signed by President Ford \nApril 8, 1975?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Virginia that he \nhas stated it exactly right. We are trying to restate the position that \nthe Senate took in 1997, in the Executive Order 11850. It has been the \npolicy of the United States, based on this Executive order, based on \nwhat the Senate did with the Chemical Weapons Treaty in 1997. But the \nproblem is there have been lawyers down at the State Department who \nhave interpreted it differently and therefore have put the military in \na very difficult position,\n\n[[Page S12497]]\n\nthat if they used it consistent with former U.S. policy, they could be \naccused of violating the Chemical Weapons Treaty and be subject to \nprosecution as individual soldiers.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague. If I could further propound a \nclarification, reading from the preamble to 11850, the Executive order, \nit says:\n\n       The United States renounces, as a matter of national \n     policy, first use of herbicides in war except use, under \n     regulations applicable to their domestic use, for control of \n     vegetation within U.S. bases and installations or around \n     their immediate defensive perimeters, and first use of riot \n     control agents in war except in defensive military modes to \n     save lives such as--\n\nand these are the examples--\n\n       (a) Use of riot control agents in riot control situations \n     in areas under direct and distinct U.S. military control, to \n     include controlling rioting prisoners of war.\n       (b) Use of riot control agents in situations in which \n     civilians are used to mask or screen attacks and civilian \n     casualties can be reduced or avoided.\n       (c) Use of riot control agents in rescue missions in \n     remotely isolated areas, of downed aircrews and passengers, \n     and escaping prisoners.\n       (d) Use of riot control agents in rear echelon areas \n     outside the zone of immediate combat to protect convoys from \n     civil disturbances, terrorists and paramilitary \n     organizations.\n\n  Regarding the ground operations as we are reading about daily in the \nAnbar Province, in Fallujah--I visited up in Fallujah several weeks \nago. How would they, under your amendment, be deployed, assuming this \namendment is adopted, in a manner differently than what they are doing \ntoday?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I would say to the chairman of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee, frankly, they are not being used today by our \nmilitary and that is the problem. Therein lies the problem.\n  We just saw President Bush down in the Summit of the Americas, and \nthey had riots down there and they used these very agents to control \nthe crowds. Even when they had problems at Abu Ghraib prison, these \nriot control agents were not allowed to be used because people were \nafraid to use them.\n  Can you imagine, if you are a first lieutenant or you are a sergeant \nand you are out there and you know that these things have been allowed \nin the past, but now the State Department and the military are putting \nstuff out and there are questions, you are not going to use the thing \nthat may be the most effective at saving lives of the personnel around \nyou, as well as the civilians, because you could be accused potentially \nof violating the Chemical Weapons Treaty. We are handcuffing the very \npersonnel that this Senate is supposed to be trying to protect.\n  That is why I believe, as the Senator has correctly pointed out, that \nthis amendment is consistent with the very examples that you pointed \nout that are in the Executive Order No. 11850 that was signed back in \n1975.\n  Mr. WARNER. I want to make clear I presume the amendment of the \nSenator clarifies some ambiguity, which ambiguity acts as a deterrent \non our forces today from using it. Once the ambiguities are set aside, \nthen we can proceed to utilize these agents, provided it is consistent \nwith the Executive Order 11850? Have I correctly stated that?\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I think what the Senator has stated is \nvery concise. That is exactly the intent of the amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my distinguished colleague. We will have, \nperhaps, opportunity in the morning to further debate this amendment. I \ndo want to posture myself so I can support your amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wish to clarify a question the chairman \nof the committee asked. I think I heard the answer, but I was not 100 \npercent sure.\n  Is the amendment intended to state the current policy of the United \nStates? When it says on line 1 of page 1, ``It is the policy of the \nUnited States,'' is that intended to reflect the current policy of the \nUnited States?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I would say to the Senator from Michigan \nthat the current policy is exactly what our amendment is trying to \nreinforce. It is the interpretation of that current policy that is \nhappening down at the State Department that we are trying to clarify. \nWe think they are misinterpreting the current policy which has existed \nfor some time now in the United States. We now need to clarify it so \nthat our warriors know exactly that they can use riot control agents \nunder specific uses, as the examples that the chairman of the Committee \non Armed Services has pointed out.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is it the intention of the amendment, then, to state the \npolicy of the United States as reflected in Executive Order 11850?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. That is correct, Mr. President.\n  Mr. LEVIN. So there is no effort, no intent in the statement of \npolicy on line 4 on page 1 through line 6 on page 2, to in any way \nmodify the policy set forth in that Executive Order 11850?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. So this restatement of policy is not intended to modify \nthis in any way. But as I understand it, what the good Senator from \nNevada is saying is that some people in the Government have interpreted \nExecutive Order 11850 differently from the way the policy is stated in \nsection 1073?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I think the policy is very clear in this Executive order, \nas well as what the Senate stated. But it appears that certain people \ndown at the State Department have interpreted it a different way and \nbelieve there is a higher threshold that our warriors must come under \nbefore they can use these riot control agents out on the battlefield; \nthat they must seek Presidential authority. That is what we are trying \nto clarify here, is to get back to what this Executive order said, as \nwell as what the Senate stated in 1997.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend from Nevada.\n  Mr. President, we will reserve the time. We are not necessarily at \nall in opposition, but we would like to review this overnight. We thank \nthe Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, subject to the order by the majority and \nDemocratic leader as to the sequence of events tomorrow, the Ensign \namendment would remain the pending business at such time as the \nleadership directs the Senate return to this bill; am I correct in \nthat?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct, the Ensign amendment is \npending.\n  Mr. WARNER. At this time, I ask unanimous consent the Ensign \namendment be laid aside for the purpose of the distinguished Senator \nfrom Michigan and I clearing some amendments.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\nAmendments Nos. 1334, as modified; 1341, as modified; 1355, 1356, 1358, \nas modified; 1362, as modified; 1367, 1387, 1388, as modified; 1404, as \nmodified; 1407, 1424, 1428, as modified; 1434, 1445, 1448, as modified; \n 1451, as modified; 1453, as modified; 1463, as modified; 1473, 1478, \n   1481, 1495, 1502, 1514, as modified; 1515, as modified; 1519, as \n  modified; 1526, as modified; 1548, as modified; 1555, as modified; \n 1563, as modified; 1568, 1574, as modified; 1578, as modified; 2446, \n2447, 2448, 2449, 2450, 2451, 2452, 2453, 2454, 2455, 2456, 2457, 2458, \n2459, 2460, 2461, 2462, 2463, 2464, 2465, 2466, 2467, 2468, 2469, 2470, \n                             2471, en bloc.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, there are four packages of amendments at \nthe desk being held subject to action by the Senate. I ask the Senate \nconsider those amendments en bloc, the amendments be agreed to, the \nmotions to reconsider be laid upon the table, and I ask any statements \nrelating to these individual amendments be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is it the intention that the packages be adopted one \npackage at time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. All four. And the Chair has acted.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am sure we can work it out whether the action has been \ntaken. Have not the four packages been acted upon and approved en bloc?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator from Michigan is reserving the \nright to object, he has that ability.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am trying to understand what the unanimous consent \nrequest was. Was it the amendments be considered en bloc and agreed to \nen bloc?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the understanding.\n  Mr. LEVIN. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments were agreed to en bloc, as follows:\n\n[[Page S12498]]\n\n                    AMENDMENT NO. 1334, AS MODIFIED\n\n (Purpose: To provide for outreach to members of the Armed Forces and \n        their dependents on the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act)\n\n       At the end of subtitle E of title VI, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 653.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague from Michigan for working together \nwith colleagues on both sides of the aisle. We achieved a substantial \namount of work. Tomorrow we will return, and my rough calculation with \nregard to the amendments is of the 12 on the majority side, we have the \nChambliss amendment, which might be subject to a second degree; we have \nthe Ensign amendment, which is now the pending amendment; there is an \namendment by Senator Talent, Senator Graham, Senator Inhofe that \ninvolves prayer at the service academies; Senator Frist in recognition \nof our troops and others participating in the war against terrorism; \nand consent to Brownback which is an amendment regarding personal \nnotification relating to the men and women of the Armed Forces in cases \nwhere he deems parental consent is appropriate. And the Senator from \nVirginia, Senator Warner, has an amendment.\n  I have the list of the Senator from Michigan. Six of the 12 \namendments have been acted upon by the Senate. To the extent the \nSenator can advise the Senate of the remaining amendments, it would be \nhelpful.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Virginia. We \nhave on our side disposed of six amendments. We are trying to boil down \nthe balance of the amendments. We have to boil down to six. We have not \nyet done that. I don't want to identify which ones other than to say we \nknow there will be a Dorgan amendment on the Truman Commission which we \nhope will come immediately after lunch tomorrow. There is still a \nsurplus of amendments we have to work out.\n  Mr. WARNER. I bring to the attention of my good friend and colleague, \nwe have provided the Senator with copies of the amendments by Senator \nChambliss, Senator Ensign, Senator Talent. The amendment by Senator \nGraham is still under work. Senator Inhofe, you have that amendment. \nSenator Frist's amendment we have not as yet distributed. The Brownback \namendment will be provided to you tonight. And we have not as yet \nprovided you with the one of the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. LEVIN. To be more helpful, the Dorgan amendment has been filed.\n\n[[Page S12514]]\n\nThere is a likelihood there will be a Durbin amendment on Guard and \nReserve which also has been filed. I don't want to lock that in as one \nbecause we are still juggling. That has been filed. It is likely that \nwill be one of the six.\n  Mr. WARNER. That would not be the proposed second degree to the \nChambliss amendment? The Chambliss amendment is Guard and Reserve, too.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I don't think it is, but I am not certain.\n  Mr. WARNER. This is helpful to colleagues as they are doing their \nwork tonight in support of what we are trying to achieve with final \npassage tomorrow.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2423\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I would like to briefly discuss an amendment \nthat was offered to the Defense Authorization bill yesterday by the \nSenators from Colorado. I voted against this measure, and I did so with \nsome reservation.\n  If approved by this body, this amendment would have provided \nretirement benefits to government contract workers, who, by no fault of \ntheir own, now find themselves denied of pension and lifetime medical \nbenefits that they were expecting to receive. In fact, the tragedy of \ntheir situation is that because of these workers' efficiency, they are \nactually being denied pensions and health insurance--in this case, they \nare clearly victims of their own success.\n  As the Senators from Colorado explained, the Federal Government had \ngiven employees of Kaiser Hill Company until December 15, 2006 to \ncomplete their work decontaminating and demolishing the former nuclear \nweapons facility at Rocky Flats. However, because Kaiser Hill's workers \nfinished their work a year ahead of schedule, they are being penalized \nunder the terms of their contract.\n  Like countless other Federal contracts, the arrangement for Rocky \nFlats workers used a numerical formula for determining who would \nreceive lifetime benefits after the work's completion--if the sum of an \nemployee's age and years of employment at the nuclear weapons plant \nadded up to 70, the worker would be fully eligible for these benefits. \nBut with Kaiser Hill declaring the job complete 14 months before their \ndeadline, over 70 workers who would have qualified for these benefits \ncould not.\n  I commend the Senators from Colorado for offering their amendment. \nThey have every right to be troubled by the way workers in their State \nhave been affected by this contract. And I share their deep concern \nthat rather than be rewarded for their good work, the workers of Rocky \nFlats are actually unable to obtain the benefits that they had \nexpected. Under terms of such a contract there is absolutely no \nincentive for workers to perform as effectively as these fine Kaiser-\nHill employees did. I cannot disagree with that notion at all.\n  Nonetheless, yesterday, I felt compelled to vote against the \namendment--not because it was offered without the best of intentions. I \nbelieve that the workers of Kaiser-Hill deserve to be commended for \ntheir quick and thorough work. However, I am afraid that if we are to \nsingle out these workers' contract, Congress would be creating an \nunfair standard that would help one segment of the Nation's Federal \ncontracting workforce while leaving the rest without any similar \nsupport.\n  If this amendment had been approved, I would be concerned about \nbenefiting some to the exclusion of others who might be deserving of \nsimilar consideration. I believe that we ought to revisit the issues \nfacing these workers in the context of other Federal contract employees \nwho might be in a similar situation. I stand ready to work with my \ncolleagues from Colorado as well as others from other States who share \nmy concern about these workers, who have been penalized due to no fault \nof their own. I believe that the Senators from Colorado have identified \na critically important problem with formulas being used to regulate \nbenefit disbursements in Federal contracts. And I hope these issues \nwill be revisited to ensure that we are rewarding good and efficient \nperformance and providing American workers the benefits that they \ndeserve.\n\n\n                            vote explanation\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I was necessarily absent from the vote on \namendment No. 2423, Senator Allard's amendment, during consideration of \nthe Fiscal Year 2006 Defense Authorization bill. As my constituents \nknow, with my wife Elaine, I was hosting the 21st Annual Utah Women's \nConference. Mr. President, this is an important event, in which the \nwomen of the State of Utah can directly inform our State's leaders \nabout the issues that affect them and their families.\n  Had I been present to vote on Senator Allard's amendment, I would \nhave voted against the proposal.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1514\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \namendment to the FY06 National Defense Authorization Act that \nauthorizes the Navy to convey approximately 230 acres of open space \nland along the eastern boundary of Marine Corps Air Station Miramar to \nthe County of San Diego in order to provide access to the historic \nStowe Trail.\n  The Stowe Trail at one time functioned as the primary road leading to \nthe historic town of Stowe, and now links the Goodan Ranch and Sycamore \nCanyon Preserves in the north with the Mission Trails Regional Park and \nSantee Lakes Regional Recreation Area further south.\n  According to county records, up until the 1930s when access to this \nportion became restricted for military use, the Stowe Trail had served \nfor some 80 years as the principle thoroughfare between the towns of \nSantee and Poway.\n  The 230 acres of land that would be conveyed by the Navy under this \nprovision include diverse plant and animal life and environmentally-\nsensitive habitats and would provide a natural wildlife corridor \nbetween the two preserves, as well as with the Santee Lakes Recreation \nArea.\n  Under the control of the County of San Diego, this land will become \npart of an extensive open space trail system that will not only \nincrease recreational opportunities in the region, but will also \nprovide buffer zone that will mitigate against potential encroachment \nthat could impact the essential military missions at Marine Corps Air \nStation Miramar.\n  It is important to point out that this proposed land conveyance is \nthe fruition of a process set in motion jointly by the San Diego County \nBoard of Supervisors and Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in 2002.\n  Both sides have worked together closely since that time to ensure \nthat the result will be a win-win situation for both the County and the \nMarines.\n  For example, as part of the land conveyance process, the County of \nSan Diego has fully committed to compensate the Navy by paying the full \nfair market value for this property.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2424\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, for the last 4 years I have \nbeen talking about the unfair and painful offset of the Defense \nDepartment's Survivors Benefits Plan against Veteran's Affairs \nDependency and Indemnity Compensation, or DIC.\n  This offset mistreats the survivors of our service members who die on \nactive duty now and our 100 percent disabled military retirees who \npurchased this benefit at the end of their careers. It is wrong, we \nknow it, and we have got to fix it.\n  Taking care of widows and orphans is a cost of war.\n  I have reminded the Senate of the Good Book's words, that in God's \neyes the true measure of our faith is how we look after orphans and \nwidows in their distress. And they are in distress. We are in a violent \nstruggle around the world with brutal and vicious enemies. Sadly, \nAmerican troops are lost every day.\n  We must never forget that the loved ones left behind by our \ncourageous men and women in uniform bear the greatest pain. Their lives \nare forever altered; their futures left unclear. They suffer the \nenduring cost of the ultimate sacrifice, and the Nation that asked for \nthat sacrifice must honor it.\n  The Department of Defense has provided the Senate several objections \nto our amendment. For the benefit of my colleagues, I would like to \nanswer each objection.\n  First, just because the Pentagon objects to the amendment does not \nmean we should not act. The Pentagon's objections have not stopped \nCongress from correcting military benefit inequities before. They \nshould not stop us now.\n\n[[Page S12515]]\n\n  The Pentagon objected to TRICARE For Life. And the Congress supported \nit anyway.\n  The Pentagon objected to concurrent receipt for disabled military \nretirees. And the Congress supported it anyway.\n  Last year, the Pentagon objected to eliminating the age-62 SBP \nbenefit reduction. And Congress fixed that inequity anyway.\n  I remind my colleagues that it is Congress' responsibility to ensure \nour widows and retirees are treated fairly. We are the ones who must \nrecognize that the Nation has an obligation to those who give their \nlives for our country.\n  The Defense Department argues that a VA Disability Benefits \nCommission is studying this, so we should not take any action. There is \nno indication whatsoever that the commission is actively looking at \neither of the issues addressed in my amendment. We understand that they \nare about to ask for a 1 year extension. The fact is that nothing will \ncome out of that commission until at least fiscal year 2009. That is \ntoo late to help the World War II and Korean era retirees who should \nalready be ``paid up'' in their SBP. We don't need to study these \nissues for several more years. The inequities are clear.\n  The Defense Department argues that SBP and DIC are fully funded and \nthat the offset is consistent with other Government programs. They are \nnot fully funded from the beneficiaries' perspective, because one \noffsets the other. The fact that other Government programs have offsets \nis irrelevant when you consider the sacrifices of military members and \nwidows for the rest of the country.\n  This same argument was used to argue against concurrent receipt of \nretired pay and disability compensation, but the Congress rejected it 2 \nyears ago. When military duty causes the disability or death of a \nservicemember, all comparisons with other Government programs seem \nhollow.\n  The Defense Department argues that they refund the premiums for the \nSBP that is not paid to the widows of our 100 percent disable retirees. \nI know a thing or two about insurance. When someone buys an insurance \npolicy and then dies, no insurance company in America could get away \nwith saying, ``sorry, we're not going to pay; here's a refund of your \npremiums.''\n  Not only that, but the Government does not even pay interest on the \nrefunded premiums. However, let a widow get an overpayment from the \nGovernment, and the Government insists on collecting interest from her. \nThese widows are rightly saying ``keep your premium refund; give me the \nbenefit we purchased.''\n  The Department of Defense argues that the law lets widows assign the \nSBP benefit to their children and, in fact, draw both their VA and SBP \nbenefits. This is not true for the vast majority. It applies only to \nwidows who have children and only to those whose husbands were killed \nsince November 24, 2003. It does absolutely nothing for more than 90 \npercent of widows affected by this inequity.\n  Even for those widows with kids, who do have the option, it poses a \nterrible choice. If they assign the benefit to their children, they \nlose it completely after their children reach age 18, or 22 if they go \nto college. One Army Sergeant Major's widow in this situation had two \nchildren in college. She made the choice to assign the SBP to them to \nhelp them stay in school. But the price of that decision is she will \nlose her annuity as soon as they graduate, and will have to live on \n$993 a month. We shouldn't put widows in a position of sacrificing \ntheir long-term financial health for the immediate needs of their \nfamilies.\n  As usual, the Defense Department says fixing this inequity would cost \nmoney. We all acknowledge that this will cost money. Everything we do \ncosts money. But when something is the right thing to do, then we do \nit. Sometimes we compromise to pay the cost over time. But we find a \nway to do it. And that is what we should do now.\n  The Defense Department argues that we shouldn't fix the SBP/DIC \noffset or the ``Greatest Generation'' SBP tax because we raised the \nage-62 SBP benefit last year. Not true. For the vast majority of the \npeople affected by my amendment, last year's SBP fix did nothing. Many \nwidows affected by the SBP/DIC offset still have their entire SBP \nannuity eliminated by the DIC offset. They get zero benefit from last \nyear's change to SBP.\n  One big reason for that is most servicemembers being killed on active \nduty today are junior--not 62 years old--and they don't have a very \nlarge SBP benefit. Their benefit would be much less than the $993 a \nmonth in VA DIC their survivors will receive. But that doesn't mean \ntheir loved ones aren't entitled to that small benefit.\n  Also, last year's law did nothing for the World War II and Korean-era \nretirees who already have paid almost 20 percent more SBP premiums than \nlater retirees, and who will end up paying one-third more if we don't \nchange the law this year. These benefit changes affect different \npopulations. Just because we brought fairness to one part of the \nretiree population last year doesn't mean that the others don't deserve \nfairness too.\n  The Department of Defense argues that this change isn't needed \nbecause we raised the death gratuity to $100,000 and raised \nServicemembers' Group Life Insurance, SGLI, to $400,000 earlier this \nyear. It is correct that Congress made those changes, but the idea that \nfixing the SBP-DIC offset is now unnecessary couldn't be further from \nthe truth.\n  I am proud to have supported those changes to the death gratuity and \nSGLI, but they did nothing to help the vast majority of DIC widows and \nthey certainly didn't help our ``Greatest Generation'' retirees. They \nonly help the survivors of those killed in combat since 2001. Thousands \nof servicemembers gave their lives and their health for their country \nin hot and cold wars before that date. Their survivors have had no \nrelief and most are living on $993 a month. That is just wrong.\n  We have gone around and around on this issue over the years. We are \nin a dangerous and long term war with an evil and intractable enemy. We \nowe those who go in harm's way the assurance that the loved ones they \nleave behind will get all the care a grateful Nation can provide. It is \nthe right thing to do, and now is the time to do it.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, these are certainly challenging times for \nour Nation--particularly as we confront an ever-emboldened terrorist \nnetwork that seeks to threaten civilized societies and destroy our way \nof life. The threats are very real and the stakes are very high. Thank \nGod we have men and women who are answering the call of duty by proudly \nwearing the uniform of the United States and defending our homeland \nhere and abroad. It is imperative that we continually show them and \ntheir families just how much we appreciate and honor their service and \ntheir sacrifice.\n  This Defense authorization bill certainly provides for much needed \nprograms that will increase readiness and quality of life for our \nmilitary personnel, and I applaud our distinguished Armed Services \nchairman, John Warner, and Majority Leader Frist for moving this bill \nforward. I represent a strong military constituency in North Carolina, \nand I am delighted that this bill includes several of my proposals \naddressing critical areas of need. I will briefly highlight a few of \nthem.\n  One of my amendments makes mental health counseling more accessible \nfor service members and their families. It allows certified and \nlicensed mental health counselors to directly bill TRICARE without a \nphysician's referral, in Under Served Areas--those areas where there is \nan insufficient availability of mental health care providers.\n  It is estimated that over half of U.S. counties have no practicing \npsychiatrists, psychologists, or social workers. Mental health \ncounselors can certainly help fill the void. The Department of Health \nand Human Services already has in place a loan repayment program to \nencourage mental health counselors to work in underserved areas. My \namendment removes barriers for those counselors to serve our military \nmembers--especially the reservists and guardsmen who often live in \nrural areas.\n  There is no question that when our military men and women are \ndeployed and separated from their families, the emotional stress and \ntrauma can be unimaginable. It is absolutely imperative that they have \naccess to mental health services not only to mitigate potential long \nterm affects like depression, violence or divorce--but also to ease the\n\n[[Page S12516]]\n\nreintegration into their family, and society, following long \ndeployments. Caring for our servicemembers' mental as well as physical \nhealth is critical in retaining quality forces for our nation's \ndefense.\n  In last year's Defense authorization bill, my effort to have marriage \nand family therapists added to the list of mental health care providers \navailable under TRICARE was successful. But with the ongoing war on \nterror, the reality is that more needs to be done.\n  Another area we must all be concerned about is the blatant targeting \nof servicemembers by predatory lenders. It is an egregious practice \nthat must be stopped. Not only can these practices lead to a cycle of \nfinancial and professional suffering for individual servicemembers and \ntheir families, but they can also have serious ramifications for our \nmilitary's operational readiness. Military conduct codes stress \nfinancial solvency, and a member with bad credit and mounting debt can \nface potentially career-ending disciplinary measures.\n  Many young troops--like many young people across the country--do not \nhave a cushion of savings to use in an emergency, and most are not \neducated in financial management. In this time of more frequent and \nextended deployments, servicemembers are faced with extra expenses due \nto preparing for deployments and family emergencies that can force them \nor their spouses to look to predatory lenders for short-term relief.\n  My amendment on predatory lending practices has two components. \nFirst, it places the Senate on record acknowledging predatory lending \npractices. Second, it requires the Defense Department, in consultation \nwith Treasury, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and representatives of \nmilitary charity and consumer organizations, to report to Congress \nwithin 90 days on several matters: their current and planned programs \nto assess the prevalence of predatory lending and to educate \nservicemembers and their families; and second, their recommendations \nfor specific legislative and administrative actions to prevent or \neliminate predatory lending.\n  The Army has identified personal financial issues as one of the most \ndifficult problems facing military families. I couldn't agree more. \nThis Defense authorization bill will get the ball rolling on some much-\nneeded action, and I am very pleased to have the support of groups such \nas the Consumer Federation of America, the Center for Responsible \nLending, the Military Coalition, and the Fleet Reserve Association.\n  Finally, another of my amendments directs that acquisition personnel \nreceive training on the requirements and application of the Berry \namendment. Implemented in 1941, the Berry amendment requires the \nDefense Department to give preference in procurement to domestically \nproduced, manufactured, or home grown products. In my view, this is \nessential to supporting the businesses that supply our troops with the \nequipment they need to carry out their duties.\n  I am pleased that each of these amendments has been included in this \nauthorization bill. I believe they reaffirm the commitment of this \nCongress to our military personnel, to their families, and to our \nentire Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/08/senate-section/article/S12516-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, I rise to comment on the reconciliation \ntax relief bill that will most likely come before the Senate next week. \nI felt it necessary to come and speak on this topic because I am \nthinking of not only our generation but of the generations of our \nchildren and grandchildren and the legacy we leave them.\n  How do the decisions we make in the Senate today affect their lives \nafter we have long left this body? That is a question I will be asking \nshould the Senate, as I expect it will, begin debate on reconciliation \nfor tax cuts.\n  Last week, Alan Greenspan testified before the Joint Economic \nCommittee and told Congress:\n\n       We should not be cutting taxes by borrowing. We do not have \n     the capability of having both productive tax cuts and large \n     expenditure increases, and presume that the deficit doesn't \n     matter.\n\n  I do not know how anyone can say with a straight face that when we \nvoted to cut spending last week to help achieve deficit reductions we \ncan now then turn around 2 weeks later to provide tax cuts that exceed \nthe reductions that we made in spending. It just does not make any \nsense, and I think it does not make any sense to the American people.\n  Well, I for one am taking Chairman Greenspan's warning seriously. \nLast week, I voted to cut spending. And should tax cuts come to the \nfloor next week, I will vote against them. I believe it is the only \nresponsible course of action.\n  There are three reasons we should oppose tax cuts at this time: No. \n1, we cannot afford these tax cuts; No. 2, we do not need these tax \ncuts; and, No. 3, we should be working on tax reform rather than tax \ncuts.\n  In case anyone has forgotten, the deficit for fiscal year 2005 was \n$317 billion. That was the third largest deficit in our Nation's \nhistory. The first and second largest deficits occurred in 2004 and in \n2003.\n  On October 20, the gross Federal debt climbed past $8 trillion. \nLooking at this chart, you can see what is happening. This is the \ncombined debt, the public and the Government debt. It climbed to over \n$8 trillion. And according to the Congressional Budget Office, in \nfiscal year 2005, interest on the public debt grew more rapidly than \nany other major spending category, rising 14 percent above the fiscal \nyear 2004 level.\n  So we can see that this debt is escalating rapidly, and it is \nsomething about which we should all be very concerned.\n  Let me put this in perspective. Just the interest payments on the \npublic debt are more than $1,600 for each tax-paying American--more \nthan $1,600 for each tax-paying American. If we could wave a magic wand \nand stop adding to the deficit today--which we won't--the Federal debt \nwould still be about $28,000 for every person in the United States, and \nclose to $1 million each if it is left to those who are under 20 years \nof age.\n  And even if we were to start running surpluses as large as last \nyear's deficit, it would still take us 14 years to pay off just the \ndebt held by the public.\n  It is time to recognize a simple fact of life. Contrary to what some \nof my colleagues seem to believe, tax cuts do not pay for themselves.\n  We have heard about the impact of the previous tax cuts, how in the \npast few months revenues have exceeded expectations, and how economic \ngrowth would pay for all the tax cuts Congress enacted in 2003. But as \nthis chart shows, exceeding expectations does not mean there was no \nrevenue lost as a result of the tax cuts.\n  As shown on this chart, the red bar indicates what our revenues would \nhave been had we not had the tax cuts. The blue bar shows what the \nprojected revenue was as a result of the tax cuts. The green bar shows \nwhat we actually received as a result of the tax cuts. Now, we can see \nthere is a difference between if we had not had the tax cuts and having \nthe tax cuts.\n  Now, let's go to 2004. Shown in red is what we would have expected in \nrevenues in 2004 had we not had the tax cuts. We had the tax cuts, and \nshown in blue is what was expected as a result of them. The good news \nis, we did receive more money than we anticipated from the tax cuts, as \nshown in the green.\n  Now, let's go to 2005. Again, the red bar shows what the projection \nwas of what we would have had without the tax cuts. The blue bar shows \nwhat the projection was of the revenues we would have because we had \nthe tax cuts. And the green bar shows actually what the revenues were \nthat came in.\n  The fact is, tax cuts are never free. All during this time, we were \nadding to the national debt.\n  Now, I voted for tax cuts in 2001, 2002, and 2003 because the country \nneeded stimulative medicine, and it worked. But like any other \nmedicine, an overdose of tax cuts can, and in my opinion will, do more \nharm than the original disease.\n  In 2003, I said that $350 billion in tax cuts would be enough to get \nthe economy moving, and now I am saying that\n\n[[Page S12517]]\n\nany more would be an overdose. It is time to put the tax cut medicine \nback on the shelf, particularly in light of the war in Iraq, our \nspending on homeland security, and Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.\n  Just today, the Senate increased mandatory spending over the next 10 \nyears by $9.5 billion.\n  The second reason to put the tax cut medicine back on the shelf is \nthat most of the provisions included in the reconciliation package do \nnot have to be extended now. In fact, most of the tax cut provisions \nincluded in the reconciliation package, including the reduced rates on \ndividends and capital gains, do not expire until 2008--over 2 years \nfrom now.\n  So here are the provisions of the economic growth plan that we worked \non during the last several years. You can see that one of the \nprovisions of the proposal for next week is ``reduced rate on dividends \nand capital gains.'' This is not going to expire until 2008. Another \none is ``section 179 expensing,'' which many of us supported in the \nbill we passed last year, the JOBS bill. That is not going to expire \nuntil 2007.\n  So the point I am making is, there really is not any need for us to \npass these tax cuts next week because most of them are not going to \nexpire until years in the future.\n  As my colleagues can see, most of the core provisions of the \nPresident's tax reform plan, as I mentioned, do not expire until 2010. \nA handful expire in 2007 or 2008, and only one expires next year.\n  When Alan Greenspan testified before the Joint Economic Committee \nlast week--I think this is really telling testimony on the part of \nChairman Greenspan--a member of the committee asked if he supported \nextending the 15-percent tax rate for capital gains and dividends. \nChairman Greenspan replied that he could only support extending these \ntax cuts if they were paid for.\n  According to Chairman Greenspan, large budget deficits will drive up \ninterest rates over time, raising the Government's debt service costs.\n  I think, as we watch what is happening to interest rates, they are \nstarting to creep up. What we forget is, as they creep up, interest \ncosts are going to take a larger and larger percent of our Federal \nbudget.\n  I quote Alan Greenspan again:\n\n       Unless the situation is reversed, at some point these \n     budget trends will cause serious economic disruptions.\n\n  I will repeat it again. Alan Greenspan:\n\n       Unless the situation is reversed, at some point these \n     budget trends will cause serious economic disruptions.\n\n  The fact is, if these tax cuts are so important, we should pay for \nthem, which is why I supported the pay-go amendment to the budget \nresolution in March, and supported it again last week.\n  My third reason for opposing piecemeal tax cuts at this time is that \nthe President's Advisory Panel on Tax Reform just released its final \nreport. All of us have heard from families and businesses in our \nrespective States lamenting the complexity and frustration with the \ncurrent Tax Code.\n  Well, thanks to our former colleagues, Connie Mack and John Breaux, \nit seems to me we have a chance to finally do something about it.\n  Why extend tax deductions piecemeal when we should be considering \nfundamental tax reform? Our tax structure should be simple, fair, and \nhonest. Our current Tax Code achieves none of these objectives.\n  I used to prepare my own tax returns and made out tax returns for my \nclients. I would not touch my tax return today with a 10-foot pole \nbecause of the complexities.\n  I am with the 55 percent of other Americans who have to hire \nprofessional help to make out our tax returns. Last year, it is \nestimated that Americans spent more than 3.5 billion hours doing their \ntaxes, the equivalent of hiring almost 2 million new IRS employees, \nmore than 20 times the agency's current workforce. If the money spent \nevery year on tax preparation and compliance was collected, about $140 \nbillion each year or over $1,000 per family, it could fund a \nsubstantial part of the Federal Government, including the Department of \nHomeland Security, the Department of State, NASA, the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development, the Environmental Protection Agency, the \nDepartment of Transportation, the U.S. Congress, our Federal courts, \nand all the Federal Government's foreign aid.\n  Individuals, businesses, and nonprofits must pay these compliance \ncosts, but the Federal Government cannot use them for any useful \npurpose. Individuals and businesses lose money that they could \notherwise save, invest, and spend on their children's education, buy a \nhome, or simply enjoy an extra evening out with the family. But the \nFederal Government gets nothing. That is the equivalent of stacking \nmoney in a pile and lighting a match to it.\n  We all recognize the need for a simple, fair, and honest Tax Code. \nThis is a win-win goal for everyone. Simply cutting tax compliance \ncosts in half from 20 percent to 10 percent would have the same impact \nas a major tax cut. Just cutting the compliance costs would be the \nequivalent of a major tax cut for most Americans, but it would be a tax \ncut that does not reduce Federal revenues but would guarantee that \npeople are paying their fair share and bring more money into the \nFederal Treasury.\n  We all know that fundamental tax reform is critical and that \nPresident Bush will be sending us his recommendations in February. I \nsimply cannot understand why some of my colleagues want to make so many \nprovisions of the current Tax Code permanent or add new tax cuts, when \nnext year we very well may be eliminating the same provisions as part \nof fundamental tax reform. Why do it now when we are expecting the \nPresident to come back with a fair and simple, honest tax reform \npackage? Again, this is not the time for piecemeal tinkering. No \nhomeowner would remodel their kitchen and bathroom the year before \ntearing down the house to build a newer and better one. That is, in \neffect, what we would be doing next week if we vote for these cuts.\n  In closing, I reiterate the three reasons we should oppose tax cuts \nat this time. No. 1, we cannot afford them because of our soaring \ndeficit and national debt. Putting our spending on the credit card of \nour kids is unconscionable, particularly because they will have to work \nharder and smarter to compete in the global marketplace to maintain our \ncurrent standard of living and quality of life.\n  Two, we do not need these tax cuts at this time. If this body \nbelieves we must have them, we should follow Alan Greenspan's advice \nand pay for them. If these tax cuts are so important to the economy, \nthen let's pay for them.\n  And third, from a public policy point of view, these tax cuts are \npremature because in the very near future, we may well change them as \npart of fundamental tax reform and simplification.\n  I thank my colleagues for their attention and urge them to vote \nagainst the tax cuts proposed next week. I reaffirm a Republican \nprinciple we have held dear over the years and one that I adhered to as \nmayor of the city of Cleveland and Governor of Ohio; that is, balance \nbudgets and reduce deficits.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/08/senate-section/article/S12517-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12517-S12519]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ALASKA CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, today marks the 50th anniversary of the \nAlaska Constitutional Convention. I speak to pay tribute to those who \ncontributed to this milestone in our State's history.\n  When the Constitutional Convention began on November 8, 1955, Alaska \nwas a territory foundering under the weight of discriminatory Federal \nlegislation.\n  Alaskans were denied control and management of our fisheries. We were \ndenied our share of Federal highway funds. We were denied the ability \nto expand our economy because of unfair land laws. We were denied the \nright to vote for our President and Vice President. And we were denied \nfull representation in Congress.\n\n[[Page S12518]]\n\n  Our economy had been damaged by article 27 of the Jones Act, which \nCongress passed in 1920. This act specifically excluded Alaska from the \nUnited States' ship and rail system. It required all goods and services \nbe diverted through Seattle, which drove up prices and pushed many \nAlaskans out of business.\n  As former territorial governor Ernest Gruening told the convention \ndelegates in 1955, Alaska was ``no less a colony than were those \nthirteen colonies along the Atlantic seaboard in 1775.'' Governor \nGruening then quoted the United States Declaration of Independence and \ntold the delegates it was time for Alaska to ``let facts be submitted \nto a candid world.''\n  Fifty-five men and women were chosen to serve as convention \ndelegates. The number 55 was selected to reflect the Philadelphia \nConvention of 1787, which produced the Constitution of the United \nStates.\n  On November 8, 1955, the delegates met at the University of Alaska in \nFairbanks. They worked for 75 days, and their efforts produced a \nprecedent-setting constitution, which formed the basis for \nCongressional approval of statehood.\n  Thanks to the dedication of George Lehleitner of Louisiana and C.W. \nBill Snedden, publisher of the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner, our \nconstitution included Alaska's version of the ``Tennessee plan,'' which \nhad been used successfully by Tennessee, Michigan, California, Oregon, \nKansas, and Iowa to gain admission to this Union. Under this plan, our \nterritory elected a Congressional delegation without waiting for \nCongressional approval.\n  When they began their deliberations 50 years ago today, no one could \nhave predicted how successful our convention delegates would be. They \nconsidered the needs of Alaskans who lived in the territory and the \nneeds of those who would later live in our State. Their foresight gave \nus the document that has stood the test of time and been hailed as a \nmodel of state constitutions. And their efforts set in motion the \nseries of events that led to statehood.\n  Before the Constitutional Convention, there were many who questioned \nwhether Alaskans could be entrusted with statehood. They thought we \nwere too far-removed from the lower 48, too different. Those who \nparticipated in the drafting of our constitution changed this. Our \nconstitution affirmed our commitment to the democratic ideals upon \nwhich this Union was founded.\n  The 55 convention delegates were devoted public servants who became \nAlaska's founding mothers and fathers. Today, five of those delegates \nare meeting in Anchorage. They are:\n  George Sundborg, Sr., a newspaperman who served as chair of the \nconvention's committee on style and drafting. George later served as \nSenator Ernest Gruening's top aide in Washington, DC.\n  Dr. Victor Fischer, who served as chair of the convention's committee \non the Executive Branch. Vic was later elected to the territorial House \nof Representatives and served the State he helped create in the Alaska \nState Senate.\n  John ``Jack'' Coghill, who was chair of the convention's committee on \nadministration. Jack was a member of the territorial House of \nRepresentatives and later served as mayor of Nenana, State Senator, and \nAlaska's Lieutenant Governor.\n  Seaborn Buckalew, a member of the territorial House of \nRepresentatives who later served as a State Senator, Assistant Adjutant \nGeneral of the Alaska National Guard, and U.S. District Attorney and \nSuperior Court Judge for the 3rd Judicial District.\n  Burke Riley, who served as chair of the convention's committee on \nrules. Burke was a special assistant to Governor Gruening and the \nSecretary of Alaska from 1952 through 1953, a position similar to \ntoday's lieutenant governor. He also served in the territorial House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Today, these delegates are joined by:\n  Thomas Stewart, who served in the territorial legislature and chaired \nits Joint Committee on Statehood and Federal Legislation, which drafted \nthe Convention Enabling Act. Tom served as secretary of the convention \nand later became an Alaska Superior Court Judge. He played a key role \nin establishing our State's court system.\n  Katherine Hurley, who was the long-time executive secretary to \nterritorial Governor Ernest Gruening and secretary of the territorial \nsenate. Ms. Hurley served as chief clerk of the convention.\n  Doris Ann Bartlett, the daughter of my predecessor, Senator Bob \nBartlett. Doris served as librarian of the convention.\n  Also in Anchorage today are three consultants who advised the \nconvention delegates:\n  Dr. George Rogers, who served as temporary secretary and economics \nconsultant,\n  Dr. Vincent Ostrum of the University of Indiana, and\n  Dr. Earnest Bartley of the University of Florida.\n  On behalf of all Alaskans, Senator Lisa Murkowski and I have come to \nthe floor today to thank these men and women whose hard work laid the \nfoundation for the 49th State.\n  In his speech closing the proceedings, Bill Egan, the president of \nthe Constitutional Convention who later served three terms as Alaska's \nGovernor, said:\n\n       I say to each and every Alaskan: If it had been your good \n     fortune, as it has been mine, to have witnessed the \n     abilities, the diligence, the devotion to duty, of these \n     delegates . . . you would say of their labors, ``well done!''\n\n  Bill Egan's words endure today. Well done, thank you, and God bless \neach of you!\n  I yield the remainder of my time to Senator Murkowski.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and I, too, thank \nthe Senator from Virginia for allowing us to speak today on the 50th \nanniversary of the convening of the Alaska Constitutional Convention.\n  Although it has not quite been 50 years since Alaska's statehood, it \nwas half a century ago today that 55 delegates from around the State \nmet to debate what would become the Alaska Constitution.\n  Prior to the Constitutional Convention, the Convention's secretary, \nThomas Stewart, traveled around the country for 6 months looking at \nother States' constitutions and how their provisions may work in \nAlaska. Later, 55 delegates were elected from every region in Alaska, \nand on November 8, 1955, the delegates met in Fairbanks at the \nUniversity of Alaska. As the country was shrouded in the Cold War, \nAlaska's Territorial Governor Ernest Gruening stood to address the \nConstitutional Convention, and said:\n\n       Alaska has a great, great destiny. We are here situated by \n     geography and by history in the farthest north and our \n     farthest west in a unique position to achieve that destiny. \n     We were formerly part of a country which today, under changed \n     government, represents the antithesis of everything that we \n     believe in and of everything we hold dear. We have a \n     geographic juxtaposition to that area. We can see it from our \n     mainland with the naked eye. What a challenge then to create \n     in these far northern latitudes a shining and eternal example \n     of what we want to call the American way of life, to make \n     Alaska not merely a bulwark defense for the whole hemisphere, \n     for the free world, but a spiritual citadel of the American \n     idea. It can only be done by the application to Alaska of \n     basic American principles, the most basic of which is \n     government by consent of the governed. So you have here a \n     thrilling opportunity, and I know you will live up to it.\n\n  Those were the words of Governor Gruening.\n  Alaska did. The Alaska Constitution was the result of the hard work \nof the pioneers of the last frontier. Five of those delegates to the \nconstitutional convention are still alive today, as Senator Stevens \nmentioned. I take a brief moment to recognize the accomplishments of \nthese outstanding Alaskans.\n  First, Victor Fisher was a member of the Alaska Territorial House of \nRepresentatives and the Alaska State Senate. Mr. Fisher was born in \nGermany, with an American father and Russian mother. Mr. Fisher has \nalso worked at the University of Alaska, primarily as the director of \nthe Institute of Social and Economic Research.\n  George Sundborg, Sr., began his life as a newspaper journalist, an \neditor, a publisher, and owner. After the constitutional convention, \nMr. Sundborg continued his service to Alaska as a staff member to the \nterritorial Governor.\n  John B. ``Jack'' Coghill was a representative in the Alaska \nTerritorial House of Representatives. After the convention, Mr. Coghill \ncontinued to\n\n[[Page S12519]]\n\nserve the State as president of the Alaska School Board Association and \nthen as our State's Lieutenant Governor.\n  Mr. Burke Riley served as the Territorial Secretary of Alaska and \nserved two terms in the Alaska Territorial Legislature. As a delegate \nto the Alaska constitutional convention, Mr. Riley served as the Rules \nCommittee chairman. Mr. Riley also served as a chief of staff to \nGovernor Egan and assisted in setting up the government of the State of \nAlaska during Governor Egan's extended illness.\n  And Seaborn Buckalew served in the Territorial House. After the \nconvention, Mr. Buckalew was appointed to the superior court where he \nserved many years. He was also an Active National Guard member.\n  The result of the hard work of these delegates was a constitution \nthat the National Municipal League said was ``one of the best if not \nthe best State constitution ever written.'' The Alaska constitutional \nconvention would not have been a success without the assistance of \nstaff and consultants. I mentioned the contribution of Thomas Stewart. \nThere was also that from Katherine Hurley, Dr. George Rogers, and Doris \nAnn Bartlett. I also thank the two surviving consultants, Dr. Vincent \nOstrum and Dr. Earnest Bartley, for their service to Alaska.\n  I was not yet born at the time that Alaska's Constitution was \ncreated, but that document continues to serve Alaska's leaders as a \nroadmap to our State's future. Alaska's constitutional convention \ndidn't just set the wheels in motion toward statehood, it has guided my \ngeneration and my children's generation and will be a guide to future \ngenerations of Alaskans forward.\n  As Governor Gruening put it, ``a shining and eternal example of what \nwe want to call the American way of life.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/08/senate-section/article/S12519-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12519-S12520]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                  Death of Army Specialist Darren Howe\n\n  Mr. HAGEL.

Mr. President, methamphetamine abuse has increased \nexponentially in recent years, expanding geographically to reach all \ncorners of the United States. In recent years, the problem has made its \nway to Vermont. I am concerned about escalating methamphetamine abuse \nand have worked with other interested Senators to find ways to combat \nthis growing problem.\n  With Senator Feinstein taking the lead, on July 28, 2005, the Senate \nJudiciary Committee unanimously reported out the Combat Meth Act, S. \n103, with a committee amendment. I worked with Senator Feinstein and \nthe other members of the committee to reach this result.\n  In September, I worked with Chairman Shelby and Senator Mikulski to \ntake the unusual action of including the Combat Meth Act as an \namendment to the Commerce Justice Science appropriations bill. I did \nthis to accommodate Senator Feinstein's request and to try to make \nprogress on this measure. By that action the Senate approved the Combat \nMeth Act, S. 103, as reported by the Judiciary Committee, as an \namendment and then in passage of the bill. House conferees would not \nagree to the Senate bill. Without agreement on such an authorization, \nit was not retained in the appropriations conference report.\n  Last Thursday, I honored the request of Senator Feinstein and worked \nto clear the Combat Meth Act, S. 103, as reported by the Judiciary \nCommittee, for passage by the Senate as a freestanding bill. It is \nclear on the Democratic side. It has been clear for days. All Senate \nDemocrats are ready to pass that measure. It is being prevented from \npassage by an anonymous objection from the Republican side of the \naisle.\n  The Senate's bipartisan bill focuses directly on providing law \nenforcement and prosecutors the tools they told us they needed. These \ninclude putting precursor chemicals behind the pharmacy counters, \nmonitoring and regulating the quantities that can be bought in a 30-day \nperiod, and making it harder to smuggle such ingredients into the \nUnited States. The Senate bill focuses on prevention, regulation, \nmonitoring, and treatment. Our bill would make it harder for people to \nenter the nightmarish world of methamphetamine use and abuse, harder \nfor other countries and companies to profit from methamphetamine \nmisery, and easier for law enforcement to combat this problem on the \nground.\n  I know that Senator Feinstein has been working tirelessly for years \nto do something about this important issue. She has been tenacious and \ndedicated, and I respect her leadership in this area. She and Senator \nTalent know that I have tried to accommodate them and to facilitate \npassage of this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/08/senate-section/article/S12520-2", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12520-S12521]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ABUSE OF FOREIGN DETAINEES\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President. The Bush administration has steadfastly \nrefused to address the black mark on our Nation caused by its \ninterrogation policies and practices and the resulting abuse of \ndetainees. Some of us in Congress strongly believe that oversight and \naccountability are paramount to restoring America's reputation as a \nhuman rights leader. We have been stymied in our efforts to learn the \ntruth about how this administration's policies trickled down from \noffices in Washington to cellblocks in Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo, and \nAfghanistan.\n  The administration's effort, led by Vice President Cheney, to block \nany legislation that would regulate the treatment of detainees is \nwrong. Also wrong is the Bush administration's refusal to consider an \nindependent commission to investigate the abuses. It would rather rely \non internal, piecemeal investigations conducted within the Defense \nDepartment, none of which address the significant role of the Central \nIntelligence Agency in interrogations.\n  Given the failure of the Republican-controlled Congress to conduct \neffective oversight, I support the Levin amendment to the Defense \nauthorization bill to establish an independent commission on the \ntreatment of detainees in U.S. custody. I have spoken many times about \nthe need for a comprehensive, independent investigation into the abuse \nof detainees. Such an investigation may not be without painful, but \naccountability is a necessary step if we are to recover from all that \nhas transpired during this administration's watch.\n  I am not alone in calling for an independent commission. Several \norganizations, including the American Bar Association, Human Rights \nFirst, Amnesty International, and Human Rights Watch, have urged the \ncreation of an independent, bipartisan commission to investigate the \nprisoner abuses. A letter from eight retired generals and admirals to \nPresident Bush asked him to appoint a prisoner abuse commission modeled \non the 9/11 Commission. In that letter, the flag officers stated, \n``internal investigations by their nature suffer from a critical lack \nof independence. Americans have never thought it wise or fair for one \nbranch of government to police itself.''\n  The 9/11 Commission provides more than a structural model for a new \ncommission; it also provides a lesson in how perseverance can overcome \nthe Bush administration's inclination to secrecy and to refuse to \nacknowledge the facts. The Bush administration initially opposed the \nformation of the 9/11 Commission, just as it now opposes a prisoner \nabuse commission. The administration used the same argument against \nboth commissions. It asserts that its own internal investigations are \nsufficient.\n  Ironically, Dr. James Schlesinger, the head of a panel established by \nSecretary Rumsfeld to investigate the prisoner abuses, addressed this \nissue in his testimony to the Senate Government Affairs Committee in \nFebruary 2002, as it debated the need for the 9/11 Commission. He \nargued for the creation of the 9/11 Commission because ``to this point \nmany questions have been addressed piecemeal or not at all. The purpose \nof the National Commission would be systematically and comprehensively \nto address such questions and to give a complete accounting of the \nevents leading up to 9/11. In my judgment, such a Commission would \nserve a high, indeed indispensable, national purpose.'' This is exactly \nthe same reason we need an independent commission to investigate the \nprisoner abuse scandals.\n  Ignoring the problem will not make it go away. Delaying the \naccounting will not solve the problems. Each week brings new \nallegations that reveal how much we still do not know. Human rights \ngroups and journalists are doing what they can to bring the truth to \nlight. It is past time for Congress to hold a thorough, oversight \ninvestigation. The least Congress should finally do is establish an \nindependent commission to investigate these matters. Rather than wait \nto read about the latest discovery of abuse in tomorrow's paper, let us \nat least do that.\n  After months of delay from the Republican Senate leadership, the \nSenate finally had an opportunity last month to vote on clear guidance \nfor treatment of detainees in U.S. custody. When we did, the Senate \nvoted overwhelmingly, 90 to 9, in favor of Senator McCain's amendment \nto the Defense appropriations bill, which I was glad to cosponsor along \nwith Senator Durbin and others.\n  That same amendment was adopted a second time to the Defense \nAuthorization bill and I, again, cosponsored it.\n  Our credibility and reputation as a world leader in human rights has \nsuffered greatly during the last few years. The scandals have put our \nown troops at risk and undermined their efforts in Afghanistan and \nIraq.\n  Many of us have been working on these issues for years. I first wrote \nto Condoleezza Rice in 2003, after reports of deaths of detainees were \nreported from the Bagram base in Afghanistan in late 2002. Like so much \nwe have learned, those first reports came from the press and human \nrights groups, not the Bush administration.\n  The Bush administration has threatened to veto any legislation that \nwould regulate the treatment of detainees. Vice President Cheney is \nreported to be personally lobbying on this matter.\n  A group of 28 senior military officers, including GEN John \nShalikashvili, recently wrote to Senator McCain in support of his \namendments addressing detainee treatment. That letter states:\n\n       The abuse of prisoners hurts America's cause in the war on \n     terror, endangers U.S. service members who might be captured \n     by the enemy, and is anathema to the values\n\n[[Page S12521]]\n\n     Americans have held dear for generations. . . . Our service \n     members were denied clear guidance, and left to take the \nblame when things went wrong. They deserve better than that.\n\n  I hope the President will consider these words before he vetoes a \nbill that contains our amendment.\n  Prisoner abuse by U.S. personnel is deeply troubling. It is one \naspect of a broader problem. While we must ensure that prisoners are \ntreated humanely by our own personnel, we must also prohibit the use of \nso-called extraordinary renditions to send people to other countries \nwhere they will be subject to torture.\n  The Bush administration says that it does not condone torture, but \ntransferring detainees to other countries where they will be tortured \ndoes not absolve our Government of responsibility. By outsourcing \ntorture to these countries, we diminish our own values as a nation and \nlose our credibility as an advocate of human rights around the world.\n  We have addressed this issue before. Congress implemented article 3 \nof the Convention Against Torture in the Foreign Affairs Reform and \nRestructuring Act of 1998, but this administration has exploited \nloopholes in that law to transfer detainees to countries where they are \nsubjected to torture. Attorney General Gonzales recently said that U.S. \npolicy is not to send detainees ``to countries where we believe or we \nknow that they're going to be tortured,'' but he acknowledged that we \n``can't fully control'' what other nations do, and added that he does \nnot know whether countries have always complied with their promises. In \nfact, they have not.\n  I introduced legislation in March to close the loophole and to \nprevent extraordinary renditions. Now that Congress is finally willing \nto regulate the treatment of detainees--a power that is expressly \ngranted in the Constitution--I hope that the Senate will support my \nlegislation to prohibit renditions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/08/senate-section/article/S12521-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12521-S12522]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE SECOND CHANCE ACT\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of the \nSecond Chance Act, a bill to strengthen community safety by improving \nthe reintegration of people returning from prison. I am pleased to work \nwith Senators Specter, Biden, and Brownback and to be an original \ncosponsor of this bill.\n  This year, approximately 650,000 prisoners will be released into \ncommunities across America communities in which all of us live. They \nwill have paid their debt to society and will now return to their homes \nand neighborhoods, to their families, and back to their lives. Their \ncommunities are our communities; their success is an important part of \nour success as a larger community and a nation.\n  The problem is that for most of these men--and more than 9 out of 10 \nof them are men--their families, neighborhoods, and prior lives often \nlack what it takes to ensure successful reintegration. If we punish \ncrime, as we should, then we must also recognize that when punishment \nis concluded, there are lives that must be resumed constructively. We \nonly hurt ourselves and our own communities if we fail.\n  That is why the Second Chance Act is so important. It is the leading \nedge of a smart community response to the challenges we all face from \nthis inevitable feature of our justice system.\n  In the best of cases, incarcerated individuals maintain contact with \ntheir families and receive rehabilitation services while in prison; \nthey are released to a network of law-abiding peers and quickly find a \nrewarding job that provides the skills and career development for long-\nterm opportunity. Released prisoners can help support their families, \nbecome active in their churches and other community organizations, stay \noff drugs, away from trouble, on track, and out of jail.\n  Unfortunately, that rarely happens. Up to two-thirds of all released \nprisoners nationwide end up back in prison within just 3 years. That \nmeans that of the 1,800 people released from prisons every single day \nin this country, almost 1,200 fail to make a successful transition into \nthe world of work and responsibility. They do not manage to find and \nkeep effective jobs and to care for themselves and their families. Many \nbecome a drain on their families and a drain on the system. They are \nmore likely to resort to criminal activity and to perpetuate poverty \nand family dysfunction.\n  And their failure is our failure since we all share the high cost and \nother burdens of unemployment, crime, community failure, and cycles of \nrecidivism.\n  The Illinois Department of Corrections released almost 40,000 people \nin 2004. A recent Chicago study found that only 30 percent of former \nprisoners were employed when interviewed 4 to 8 months after release, \nand of those who succeeded in finding at least some form of legal \nemployment, the average cumulative length of employment was 13 weeks. \nThe same study found that 81 percent of former prisoners were \nuninsured, and only 29 percent of those working full time had health \ninsurance. Of the people released by the Illinois Department of \nCorrections three years ago, almost 55 percent of adults and 47 percent \nof juveniles have already returned to custody. This is a revolving door \nof failure that must stop.\n  Fortunately, smart people in hundreds of communities and community \norganizations all across the country have figured out ways to improve \nthis performance and create constructive places for former prisoners in \nsociety. It is in the best interest of all of us and the communities we \nlive in to provide the resources to take these effective strategies to \nscale. That is what the Second Chance Act does.\n  In Illinois, dozens of organizations are involved in safely \nreintegrating former prisoners into their communities, and many have \nbeen funded by the Illinois Department of Corrections through grants \nfrom the U.S. Department of Justice. As one example, the Safer \nFoundation has managed to cut the State's recidivism rate by almost 50 \npercent for the people who receive Safer's supportive employment \nservices. And Safer has further demonstrated that ex-prisoners who are \nstill employed after 12 months of supportive services have a recidivism \nrate of lower than 10 percent. One of Safer's program models, funded by \nthe U.S. Department of Labor, provides participants with job placement \nand support services, and matches them with mentors from the \nneighborhoods where the participants reside. Only 2 percent of the \nparticipants in this community and faith-based program have recidivated \nover a 2-year period.\n  One of the most effective strategies that Safer, the Heartland \nAlliance for Human Needs and Human Rights, and other nonprofit \norganizations have devised is transitional jobs, a strategy that worked \nfor welfare to work, and is now working for prison returnees. In a \ntransitional jobs program, former prisoners with employment challenges \nare hired and paid a wage for legitimate employment in a time-limited, \nsubsidized job. The program not only offers real work, income, skill \ndevelopment, and a letter of reference and experience to add to their \nresume, it also offers coaching and support services to help \nparticipants overcome substantial barriers to employment, such as \nsubstance abuse or mental health issues. The program focuses heavily on \nplacement into unsubsidized work at the earliest possible time and job \nretention services after placement. Studies of successful transitional \njobs programs have found that transitional jobs result in a 33 percent \nincrease in employment when compared to other types of employment \npreparation programs, and that 81 percent to 94 percent of transitional \njob graduates go on to unsubsidized employment at wages between $7 and \n$10 per hour.\n  The participants gain an immediate source of legitimate income upon \nrelease. They also gain paid work experience, access to professional \ncounseling and training services, and a clear path to unsubsidized \nemployment in the community. Employers gain access to a pipeline of \nsupported workers who have demonstrated an ability to do the job and \nremain employable. Most of all, our communities gain by creating a \nproductive place for ex-prisoners, where they contribute positively to \nfamily, neighborhood, and the larger environment rather than the \nopposite.\n  The ex-prisoner population is a challenging one to serve. It is \nestimated that 95 percent of unskilled jobs in this country require a \nhigh school diploma or some work experience. But 40 percent of released \nprisoners lack a high school diploma or GED--more than\n\n[[Page S12522]]\n\ntwice the rate for the general population over 18. And 38 percent of \nprisoners without high school degrees were unemployed just prior to \nbeing incarcerated, compared to 25 percent for those with high school \ndiplomas.\n\n  In prison, only about one-third of inmates receive vocational \ntraining or work experience designed to improve their ability to obtain \nlegitimate employment once released. And very few former incarcerated \nindividuals receive job counseling and placement services after their \nrelease.\n  Because of the low pay, lack of benefits, and lack of advancement \npotential of many formal work activities, informal and illegal \nactivities may be tempting. Especially considering that an estimated 70 \npercent of State prison inmates have a history of regular drug use, and \nvery few receive formal treatment in prison.\n  Most communities where prisoners go upon release already struggle \nwith high poverty, unemployment, fragile families, and a dearth of \njobs. In Illinois, for example, 54 percent of those released from \nprison return to just seven communities around Chicago. These \ncommunities are among the poorest in Chicago and are ill prepared for \nthe additional burden of reintegrating young men with criminal records, \nspotty employment histories, low skills and education.\n  Former prisoners also face employer resistance to hiring people with \ncriminal backgrounds. One study found that applicants with criminal \nrecords experienced a 50 percent reduction in job offers for entry \nlevel jobs, compared to those without records. This was compounded by \nracial bias as black former inmates experienced at 64 percent reduction \nin offers.\n  Other barriers include one documented by a recent study in Illinois \nin which only 22 percent percent of the prisoners had a photo \nidentification card at the time of release. And most prisoners have \nfinancial and other obligations, including child support and the \nconditions of their release, that require immediate attention.\n  Notwithstanding the barriers to successful reentry, however, faith \nbased and community based organizations have been achieving positive \nresults with the released prisoner population for years. The Second \nChance Act celebrates the potential of nonprofit community \norganizations working with State and local authorities and corrections \ndepartments to promote responsible parenting and sustainable \nemployment, and to reduce recidivism.\n  This bill will make funding available to the Attorney General to \nsupport and evaluate the efforts of innovative communities and local \nservice providers. Grants can be used to expand access to transitional \njobs programs and to transitional and permanent housing, to support \nhealth services, to support the children of incarcerated parents and \nthe maintenance of healthy parent-child relationships, to address \nliteracy and educational needs, and to ensure that appropriate job \ntraining, placement, and retention services are available.\n  Priority under the Second Chance Act will be given to projects that \nserve geographic areas with large ex-prisoner populations, to projects \nthat include partnerships with nonprofit organizations, and to projects \nthat provide consultations between victims and ex-prisoners. Priority \nwill also be given to projects that consider appropriate reforms of \nsanctions for technical post-release violations, and to projects that \nestablish pre-release procedures to connect participants to the State \nand Federal benefits and referrals to social and health services for \nwhich they are eligible.\n  And by maintaining a strict focus on measurable results and data \ncollection, the Second Chance Act will help us learn what works and \nwhat does not work.\n  Too many people are caught up in the criminal justice system. \nEspecially within the African American community where 32 percent of \nblack males will enter State or Federal prison sometime during their \nlifetime. Communities are protected and strengthened when people who \nbreak the law are punished appropriately. But communities--all \ncommunities, including yours and mine are weakened if we neglect the \nchallenges of rehabilitation and reentry.\n  To improve the integration of former prisoners and to reduce \nrecidivism is in all of our best interests. A well-designed reentry \nsystem can enhance public safety, reduce recidivism, reduce costs, and \nhelp prisoners achieve long-term integration. Former prisoners who are \nengaged in lawful work after they have returned to the community are \nless likely to commit new crimes and are more likely to be involved in \ntheir children's lives.\n  The Second Chance Act is an important effort to strengthen America's \ncommunities. The bill is supported by a wide range of organizations, \nand I urge my colleagues to join us in passing this important \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/08/senate-section/article/S12522-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12522]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On August 08, 2005, in New York, NY, an unidentified gay man was \nbeaten by two men in what police are calling a hate crime. The man was \nwalking with a companion when two others approached screaming anti-gay \nslurs before attacking the victim; the attacker hit the victim \nrepeatedly. Following the attack, the victim was taken to a near by \nManhattan Hospital for head injuries.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/08/senate-section/article/S12522-2", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12522-S12523]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET ACT COMPLIANCE\n\n  Mr. GREGG.

Mr. President, I would like to set aside a moment \nto reflect on the life of Clifford Brown. He would have celebrated his \n75th birthday this past October 30. Clifford was a man who made a \nremarkable contribution toward the world of music by his soulful \nplaying of the trumpet. He was a truly talented man who dedicated his \nlife to music and his family.\n  Clifford was born on October 30, 1930, in Wilmington, DE. His father \nwas a self-taught musician who kept several instruments around the \nhouse, including a bugle which young Clifford began playing at only 5 \nyears old. He soon discovered the trumpet, which would change his life \nand the texture of jazz for all of eternity.\n  At the age of 12, Clifford's father arranged for him to study with \nesteemed local music teacher Robert Lowery, also from Wilmington. Under \nRobert's tutelage, Clifford began to display the promise of his ability \nand develop his own style of playing.\n  After studying with Mr. Lowery for 3 years, during which Clifford \nplayed in his teacher's dance band, Clifford moved his music education \nto Howard High School where he met Harry Andrews, the school's band and \nchoral director. Mr. Andrews taught Clifford how to blend the free-\nflowing harmonies of jazz with the classical lines of more traditional \nmusic. This experience allowed Clifford to develop his own sound, which \nwould be the starting point for his journey to greatness within the \njazz community. His tutelage at Howard High School culminated with \nClifford playing ``The Carnival of Venice'' as his graduation solo, \nwhich would be remembered by all who attended the ceremony.\n  After graduation, Clifford obtained a music scholarship to study \nmathematics at the University of Delaware, which, at the time, did not \nhave a music department. He later attended Maryland State College, \nwhere Clifford played and composed music for the college band. It was \nduring this time that Clifford was to meet the other love of his life, \nLaRue Anderson.\n\n[[Page S12524]]\n\n  At the time, Ms. Anderson was doing a study on the psychology of \nmusic and had caught the eye of two future jazz greats, Charlie Parker \nand Max Roach, who were also acquaintances of Clifford Brown. Mr. \nParker and Mr. Roach decided that Ms. Anderson and Clifford would make \nexcellent companions, so they arranged for the two of them to meet. \nThey met, fell in love, and later married.\n  After recovering from severe injuries due to a traffic accident, \nClifford traveled to Europe in 1953 with Lionel Hampton and his big \nband. Despite contractual obligations, Clifford used his free time to \nrecord various solo and group projects, which would propel him to the \nnext level of musical recognition. In 1954, Clifford teamed up with \nfellow jazz great Max Roach to form the Clifford Brown--Max Roach \nQuintet which was quickly recognized as one of the most formidable \ncollections of contemporary jazz talent.\n  While touring the Nation with his quintet, Clifford Brown, who was \nonly 25 years old at the time, died in a traffic accident on June 26, \n1956. While the tragedy of his passing weighs heavy in our hearts, we \nare truly blessed that Clifford's musical genius survives in the sounds \nof modern jazz trumpeters everywhere. His widow LaRue Brown Watson \npassed away October 2, 2005.\n  It is difficult to refute that Clifford's rare combination of musical \nintelligence and immense emotional range changed the landscape of \nmodern jazz forever. Fortunately for music lovers everywhere, \nClifford's work has been immortalized on numerous recordings, almost \nany of which can be safely recommended as superior examples of what the \njazz trumpet was meant to sound like. I rise today to commemorate \nClifford Brown, his life, and his outstanding musical legacy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/08/senate-section/article/S12524-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12524]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DR. JACK GEIGER\n\n Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to recognize an outstanding leader from New York who has \nspent his entire career championing improved health for minorities. Dr. \nJack Geiger has been a pioneer in medical care for underserved \npopulations through his dedicated work as a human rights advocate, \nscholar, educator, and physician. In commemoration of his 80th birthday \nthis month, I would like to congratulate him on the extraordinary \naccomplishments he has achieved during his career that have impacted so \nmany people in our Nation and in other countries.\n  For more than 60 years, Dr. Geiger has promoted human rights in the \nhealth field. In fact, he was one of the earliest leaders to advance \nthe idea of health care as a civil right. He helped pioneer the \nAmerican health centers movement by creating the first health centers \nin rural Mississippi and inner-city Boston, which then burgeoned into a \nnetwork of more than 900 urban, rural, and migrant centers serving \nmillions of low-income patients today.\n  It is difficult to cover all of Dr. Geiger's work in addressing human \nrights violations in the health sector because his contributions are so \nnumerous. In the 1940s and 1950s, he led campaigns to end racial \ndiscrimination in hospitals and medical schools. In the 1960s, he \nhelped provide medical care to civil rights workers. Later, he helped \nfound and head the Physicians for Human Rights, a national organization \nof health professionals that investigates human rights abuses and war \ncrimes and provides medical aid to victims of oppression. This \norganization shared in the Nobel Prize for Peace in 1998. In more \nrecent years, he has served as the president of the Committee for \nHealth in Southern Africa and as an NGO delegate to the United Nations \nConference on Racism and Discrimination, in addition to leading several \nhuman rights missions abroad.\n  Dr. Geiger also has been a prolific researcher and author of numerous \narticles, book chapters, reports, and monographs on such topics as \ncommunity-oriented primary care and community health centers, poverty \nand health care, the role of physicians in the protection of human \nrights, and health effects of nuclear war. Most recently, he has \ncontributed to seminal reports on racial and ethnic disparities in \nclinical diagnosis and treatment.\n  As an educator and a physician, Dr. Geiger has produced generations \nof committed health professionals throughout the world and has provided \nmedical care to countless patients and communities of all backgrounds. \nBefore assuming his current position as Arthur C. Logan Professor \nEmeritus of Community Medicine at City University of New York Medical \nSchool and Visiting Professor of Epidemiology at Mailman-Columbia \nSchool of Public Health, he served as Chairman of the Department of \nCommunity Medicine at Tufts University Medical School, Visiting \nProfessor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Chairman of the \nDepartment of Community Medicine at State University of New York at \nStony Brook School of Medicine. There is no doubt that this \nextraordinary man embodies the true meaning of ``doctor'' and has \npositively changed the lives of tens of thousands of people.\n  For his work on health care, human rights, and poverty, Dr. Gieger \nhas been recognized with scores of illustrious awards; most recently, \nhe was the recipient of the Award for Academic Leadership in Primary \nCare from Morehouse School of Medicine in 2003 and the Paul Cornely \nAward from the Physicians Forum in 2004. It is only fitting that we \nacknowledge this health champion today. I congratulate Dr. Geiger on a \nlifetime full of remarkable accomplishments and am proud to honor his \n80th birthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/08/senate-section/article/S12524-2", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12524-S12525]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             HELEN BOOSALIS\n\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to a person who has been instrumental in making Lincoln, NE, \none of the great capital cities in America.\n  Helen Boosalis served on the city council before unseating an \nincumbent to be elected mayor of Lincoln, NE, earning her the \ndistinction of being the first woman in America elected to the position \nof mayor in a city with a population of more than 100,000 residents.\n  As mayor of Lincoln from 1975 to 1983, Helen Boosalis was a member of \nthe U.S. Conference of Mayors where she became one of the first women \nto become president of that organization.\n  Three years after leaving the mayor's office, Helen Boosalis won the \nDemocratic nomination to run for Governor of Nebraska in a race where I \nhad the honor of being her campaign chairman. She faced Kay Orr, who \nwas Nebraska State treasurer at the time in what was the first woman-\nversus-woman gubernatorial campaign in American history.\n  She didn't win but she didn't give up her desire for public service \nand helping people who are in need.\n  Helen Boosalis went on to serve as president and chairman of the \nboard of directors of the American Association of Retired Persons and, \nas such, had the opportunity to testify before Congress as she \nchampioned the causes of the Nation's senior citizens.\n  Since leaving that position, Helen Boosalis has tirelessly devoted \nherself to volunteering her services to help one worthwhile cause after \nanother.\n  Her generosity even earned her a quote in the 2004 ``Giving is \nCaring'' inspirational calendar which included quotes from such \nnotables as Albert Einstein, Martin Luther King, Jr., Thomas Jefferson, \nRonald Reagan, Eleanor Roosevelt, Confucius, and Aristotle. Her quote \ngoes to the spirit of voluntarism. It read, ``America has had a long \nand rich tradition of generosity that began with simple acts of \nneighbor helping neighbor.''\n  As an octogenarian, Helen Boosalis continues to serve her fellow \nNebraskans with so much abundant energy that once caused one of her \ncolleagues to describe her as a ``Whirlwind.''\n  Her honors are far too numerous to mention from the prestigious \nMidlander of the Year to Nebraska Woman of Distinction, but the honor \nshe will receive this Sunday in the city she loves may be the best yet \neven though on the surface it appears to be quite humble.\n  Lincoln, NE, is a pedestrian friendly city with a beautiful and \nextensive network of hiking and biking trails that can trace their \nroots to Helen Boosalis' leadership as mayor.\n  On Sunday, November 13, 2005, the section of trail along Nebraska \nHighway Two where the entire system began in the mid 1970s thanks to \nHelen Boosalis' vision as mayor will be named in her honor.\n\n[[Page S12525]]\n\n  A tree will also be planted as living testimony for decades of \nNebraskans to come that they owe the tremendous system of trails that \nthose in Lincoln continue to enjoy to the leadership of Mayor Helen \nBoosalis.\n  In closing, I would like to quote from the invitation for this \nSunday's event:\n\n       It was once said that Helen Boosalis has governed this city \n     with graciousness, with tenacity, with determination, with \n     understanding, with ability, with hope, with vision, with \n     fairness, and with many other valued attributes. Now it's \n     time to honor her with the naming of Helen Boosalis \n     Trail.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/08/senate-section/article/S12525-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12525]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/08/senate-section/article/S12525-2", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12525]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/08/senate-section/article/S12525-3", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12525]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:16 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \ndisagree to the amendment of the Senate to the bill H.R. 3058 making \nappropriations for the Departments of Transportation, Treasury, and \nHousing and Urban Development, the Judiciary, District of Columbia, and \nindependent agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2006, and \nfor other purposes, and agree to the conference asked by the Senate on \nthe disagreeing votes of the two Houses thereon; and appoints the \nfollowing members as the managers of the conference on the part of the \nHouse: Mr. Knollenberg, Mr. Wolf, Mr. Rogers of Kentucky, Mr. Tiahrt, \nMrs. Northup, Mr. Aderholt, Mr. Sweeney, Mr. Culberson, Mr. Regula, Mr. \nLewis of California, Mr. Olver, Mr. Hoyer, Mr. Pastor, Ms. Kilpatrick, \nMr. Clyburn, Mr. Rothman, and Mr. Obey.\n  The message also announced that the House has passed the following \nbill, in which it requests the concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 1973.

A bill to provide an immediate Federal income tax rebate to \nhelp taxpayers with higher fuel costs, to express the sense of the \nSenate regarding full funding of LIHEAP, and to provide consumer \nprotections against fuel price gouging, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Energy Tax \nRebate Act of 2005 and I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  Michigan families and families across America are being delivered a \none-two punch when it comes to energy prices. First, they continue to \nbe hit hard by high gasoline prices. Now they are facing home heating \ncosts this winter that are expected to rise dramatically compared to \nlast year.\n  We can do better than this for our families. So today I am \nintroducing a bill that will provide families with an immediate $500 \ntax rebate to help them pay for rising energy costs. My legislation \nalso includes important consumer protections to make sure Americans are \nnot the victims of unfair market practices and consumer price gouging. \nFinally, my bill includes a Sense of the Senate that the Low-Income \nHome Energy Assistance Program, known as LIHEAP, should be fully funded \nto its authorized level of $5.1 billion. LIHEAP is a successful program \nthat makes sure our most vulnerable families, those living on low \nincomes or fixed-incomes, are able to heat their homes during the cold \nwinter months.\n  Filling our cars with gasoline to take our children to school and \nheating our homes in the winter are not luxuries. They are necessities. \nEnergy is a necessity. Together we can do better and together we will \ndo better.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1973\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representative of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide States with the resources needed to rid \nour schools of performance-enhancing drug use; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Drug \nFree Varsity Sports Act of 2005. This bill would provide States with \nthe resources they need to rid our schools of steroids and other \nperformance-enhancing drugs.\n  I believe steroid use doesn't begin at the professional level. I am \nvery concerned about performance-enhancing drug use among young \nathletes--specifically, high school athletes. Steroid use among high \nschool students is on the rise. It more than doubled among high school \nstudents from 1991 to 2003, according to the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention. Furthermore, a study by the University of \nMichigan shows that the percentage of 12th graders who said they had \nused steroids some time in their lives rose from 1.9 percent in 1996 to \n3.4 percent in 2004. This is unacceptable and a health risk to our \nchildren.\n  Last year, the Polk County School District became the first in \nFlorida to establish random testing for high school athletes, and the \nFlorida House passed a bill that would have made Florida the first \nState to require steroid testing for high school athletes. That bill \nstalled in the Senate, but now Florida and other States are considering \na similar law. Currently, less than 4 percent of U.S. high schools test \nathletes for steroids, and no state requires high schools to test \nathletes. Schools and States say that cost is usually the reason they \ndon't test.\n  In response, I am introducing this legislation to help States with \nthe resources they need to curb the use of steroids and other \nperformance-enhancing drugs. My legislation would provide Federal \ngrants directly to States so that they can develop and implement \nperformance-enhancing drug testing programs.\n  The Drug Free Varsity Sports Act of 2005 would authorize $20 million \nin grants to States to create statewide pilot drug testing programs for \nperformance-enhancing drugs. States that receive the grants would be \nrequired to incorporate recovery, counseling, and treatment programs \nfor those students who test positive for performance-enhancing drugs.\n  Stopping the use of performance-enhancing drugs goes beyond testing. \nThat is why my legislation also would require States that receive \ngrants to allocate no less than 10 percent of the funding to establish \nstatewide policies to discourage steroid use, through educational or \nother related means.\n  In addition, at a recent Senate Commerce Committee hearing on this \nissue, I called on all of the heads of the major professional sports \nleagues and their unions to begin a major, multi-sport, national \nadvertising campaign. This campaign should be paid for by the leagues \nand their players, and directed at young people. It should focus on \ndiscouraging the use of performance-enhancing drugs. We must get the \nmessage out about the dangers of these drugs, and who better to send \nthat message to young people than the leagues they watch and the \nplayers they idolize?\n  There is no simple solution to the issue of steroids in sports. \nCongress can do its part by enacting the Drug Free Varsity Sports Act \nof 2005. But the sports leagues, their players, coaches, and parents \nall must play an active role.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1974\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representative of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

PILOT DRUG-TESTING PROGRAMS FOR PERFORMANCE-ENHANCING \n                   DRUGS.\n\n       (a) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to supplement \n     the other student drug-testing programs assisted by the \n     Office of Safe and Drug-Free Schools of the Department of \n     Education by establishing, through the Office, a grant \n     program that will allow State educational agencies to test \n     secondary school students for performance-enhancing drug use.\n       (b) Program Authorized.--The Secretary of Education, acting \n     through the Assistant Deputy Secretary of the Office of Safe \n     and Drug-Free Schools, shall award, on a competitive basis, \n     grants to State educational agencies to enable the State \n     educational agencies to develop and carry out statewide pilot \n     programs that test secondary school students for performance-\n     enhancing drug use.\n       (c) Application.--A State educational agency that desires \n     to receive a grant under this section shall submit an \n     application to the Secretary of Education at such time, in \n     such manner, and containing such information as the Secretary \n     may require.\n       (d) Priority.--In awarding grants under this section, the \n     Secretary of Education shall give priority to State \n     educational agencies that incorporate community organizations \n     in carrying out the recovery, counseling, and treatment \n     programs described in subsection (e)(1)(B).\n       (e) Use of Funds.--\n       (1) Drug-testing program for performance-enhancing drugs.--\n     A State educational agency that receives a grant under this \n     section shall use not more than 90 percent of the grant funds \n     to carry out the following:\n       (A) Implement a drug-testing program for performance-\n     enhancing drugs that is limited to testing secondary school \n     students who meet 1 or more of the following criteria:\n       (i) The student participates in the school's athletic \n     program.\n       (ii) The student is engaged in a competitive, \n     extracurricular, school-sponsored activity.\n       (iii) The student and the student's parent or guardian \n     provides written consent for the student to participate in a \n     voluntary random drug-testing program for performance-\n     enhancing drugs.\n       (B) Provide recovery, counseling, and treatment programs \n     for secondary school students tested in the program who test \n     positive for performance-enhancing drugs.\n       (2) Prevention.--A State educational agency that receives a \n     grant under this section shall use not less than 10 percent \n     of the grant funds to establish statewide policies that \n     discourage the use of performance-enhancing drugs, through \n     educational or other related means.\n       (f) Report.--For each year of the grant period, a State \n     educational agency that receives a grant under this section \n     shall prepare and submit an annual report to the Assistant \n     Deputy Secretary of the Office of Safe and Drug-Free Schools \n     on the impact of the pilot program, which report shall \n     include--\n\n[[Page S12531]]\n\n       (1) the number and percentage of students who test positive \n     for performance-enhancing drugs;\n       (2) the cost of the pilot program; and\n       (3) a description of any barriers to the pilot program, as \n     well as aspects of the pilot program that were successful.\n       (g) Definitions.--In this section, the terms ``State \n     educational agency'' and ``secondary school'' have the \n     meanings given the terms in section 9101 of the Elementary \n     and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 7801).\n       (h) Authorization of Appropriations.--\n       (1) In general.--There is authorized to be appropriated to \n     carry out this section $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2006.\n       (2) Separation of funds.--The Secretary of Education shall \n     keep any funds authorized for this section under paragraph \n     (1) separate from any funds available to the Secretary for \n     other student drug-testing programs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. OBAMA:\n  S. 1975. A bill to prohibit deceptive practices in Federal elections; \nto the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, today millions of Americans will exercise \ntheir most fundamental right under the Constitution the right to vote. \nAs in every election, I hope all eligible Americans go to the polls to \nexercise this right. Voter participation is fundamental to our \ndemocracy, and we must do all we can to encourage those who can to \nvote.\n  After seeing what happened over the last two presidential elections, \nI have some other hopes for this Election Day. I hope all voters who go \nto the polls find voting machines that work, non-partisan poll workers \nwho understand the law and enforce it without bias, lines that move \nsmoothly, and ballots that make sense and are easy to understand. I \nalso hope voters go to the polls today with accurate information about \nwhat is on the ballot, where they are supposed to vote, and what our \nNation's voting laws are.\n  It might surprise some of you to know, but even in this awesome age \nof technological advancement and easy access to information, there are \nfolks who will stop at nothing to try to deceive people and keep them \naway from the polls. These deceptive practices all too often target and \nexploit vulnerable populations, like minorities, the disabled, or the \npoor.\n  Think about the story of the 2004 presidential election when voters \nin Milwaukee received fliers from the non-existent ``Milwaukee Black \nVoters League,'' warning that voters risk imprisonment for voting if \nthey were ever found guilty of any offense--even a traffic violation. \nIn that same election, in a county in Ohio, some voters received \nmailings misinforming voters that anyone registered to vote by the \nKerry Campaign or the NAACP would be barred from voting.\n  Deceptive practices often rely on a few tried and true tricks. Voters \nare often warned that an unpaid parking ticket will lead to their \narrest or that folks with family members who have been convicted of a \ncrime are ineligible to vote. Of course, these warnings have no basis \nin fact, and they are made with one goal and one goal only to keep \nAmericans away from the polls.\n  I hope voters who go to the polls today are not victims of such \nmalicious campaigns, but I know hoping is not enough. That is why I am \nintroducing the Deceptive Election Practices and Voter Intimidation \nPrevention Act of 2005 to provide voters with real protection from \ndeceptive practices that aim to keep them away from the polls on \nElection Day.\n  The bill I am introducing today provides the clear statutory language \nand authority needed to get allegations of deceptive practices \ninvestigated. It establishes harsh penalties for those found to have \nperpetrated them. And the bill seeks to address the real harm of these \ncrimes--voters who are discouraged from voting by misinformation--by \nestablishing a process for reaching out to these misinformed and \nintimidated voters with accurate and full information so they can cast \ntheir votes in time. Perhaps just as important, this bill creates \nstrong penalties for deceptive election acts, so people who commit \nthese crimes suffer more than just a slap on the hand.\n  This legislation has the support of groups like the NAACP, the \nLawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, Common Cause, the Arc of \nthe United States, United Cerebral Palsy, People for the American Way \nand the National Disability Rights Network.\n  Deceptive practices and voter intimidation are real problems and \ndemand real solutions like those offered in my bill.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me and support this bill and work to \nensure that all eligible voters have the opportunity to have their \nvotes count.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1975\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to make amendments to the Iran Nonproliferation Act \nof 2000; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep concern \nabout the almost daily series of alarming developments in Iran and \nSyria. Both are state sponsors of terrorism. Both have worked to \nundermine our rebuilding efforts in Iraq. Tehran and Damascus both have \na history of refusing to comply with global nonproliferation standards, \nand experts routinely cite disturbing trends that suggest these \ngovernments are aggressively pursuing programs to develop weapons of \nmass destruction. Iran clearly has the intention to develop nuclear \nweapons and is well on its way to doing so. It has been belligerent and \ndishonest in its dealings with the International Atomic Energy Agency \nand our European partners who are negotiating with Tehran. This led to \nthe historic vote on September 24 of this year, when the IAEA Board of \nGovernors found that Iran had breached its obligations under the \nNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and noted Iran's policy of concealing \nits nuclear work and facilities. What was Tehran's response to the \ninternational community? More defiance and the outrageous comments by \nIranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad calling for Israel to be ``wiped \noff the map.''\n  Since coming into office, this administration has mostly allowed \nthese problems with Iran and Syria to fester while its focus was \nelsewhere. It has paid only intermittent attention when crises flare up \nand has not formulated a long-term and comprehensive strategy for \ndealing with the proliferation threat presented by these regimes. The \nsituation has deteriorated to such an extent--with the rapid nuclear \ndevelopments in Iran, the increasing proliferation risk that it and \nSyria pose, the undermining of our work in Iraq, and the extreme \nstatements and actions recently taken by both Tehran and Damascus--that \nwe must take immediate action.\n  Congress took action to augment the U.S. nonproliferation regime in \n2000 when it overwhelmingly passed the Iran Nonproliferation Act, INA, \nin response to repeated transfers of ballistic missile technology and \nknow-how from Russia and other countries to Iran. Known and suspected \nassistance from Russia, China, and Pakistan has also helped Iran make \nprogress in its nuclear program. I believe that the 2000 legislation \nhas winnowed the pool of transgressors by highlighting the most \negregious among them; however, determined governments, industries, and \nindividuals continue to find it a worthwhile risk to trade in goods and \ntechnology that can contribute to an Iranian WMD program. Clearly, it \nis time to strengthen the INA to prevent these transactions. A more \nrobust INA can also serve as a model for curbing proliferation \ninvolving other countries--starting with Syria, whose policies may \nstill be influenced by such determined and effective measures.\n  Congress is on the cusp of adopting some important changes to the INA \nwith S. 1713. If enacted, the reporting and sanctions provisions of the \nstatute would also apply to transactions involving Syria. In addition, \nthe law would also target exports of WMD and missile technology from \nthese two countries. The revamped Iran and Syria Nonproliferation Act, \nISNA, would be a positive step. However, we must do more.\n  Today, I along with my colleague from Arizona, Mr. Kyl, introduce the \nIran Nonproliferation Enhancement Act of 2005. This bill would \nintensify and broaden the sanctions provisions in the INA. First, it \nrequires mandatory sanctions for violators, an approach that Congress \nfavored overwhelmingly when it passed the Iran Missile Proliferation \nSanctions Act of 1997. Second, it requires a more detailed \njustification from the President if he chooses to exercise a national \nsecurity waiver. Third, it introduces requirements that make parent \ncompanies subject to INA sanctions, in addition to their proliferator \nsubsidiaries. And fourth, it expands the list of sanctions to include \nprohibitions on U.S. investment, financing, and financial assistance \nfor proliferators, in addition to the current arms and dual use export \nprohibitions.\n  The current sanctions mechanism is too weak. Under the INA, sanctions \nare authorized rather than required. Since 2000, the administration has \nchosen to impose INA sanctions on foreign companies or individuals on \n65 occasions, with some entities having been sanctioned several times. \nThe State Department has not revealed in unclassified form how many \nentities were reported but not sanctioned and why they were not \nsanctioned.\n  If we accept that a successful Iranian or Syrian WMD program poses a \nmajor threat, then we must get serious about our sanctions and make \nthem mandatory. Our bill does just that. Making sanctions mandatory has \nprecedents. As I previously noted, Congress overwhelmingly approved \nmandatory sanctions against foreign persons and entities engaged in \nmissile proliferation to Iran as part of the Iran Missile Proliferation \nSanctions Act of 1997. President Clinton vetoed the bill, however, \nlargely because at that time his administration was engaged in \nnegotiations with Russia over export controls. The sense was that the \nnewly formed government needed time to develop its controls over \nRussian business. In the end, the administration exercised its \nExecutive order authority to impose broad sanctions on several Russian \ncompanies. However, we must let the international community know that \nthe threat from proliferation is great and that export controls must be \nin place and enforced. Making sanctions mandatory sends that message.\n\n[[Page S12533]]\n\n  Furthermore, nonproliferation legislation should ensure that national \nsecurity waivers are issued only under the most compelling of \ncircumstances. The current national security waiver is too broad, and \nthe administration can simply classify the reason for the waiver in \norder to remove almost all scrutiny. The message sent to those \nassisting Iran and Syria with WMD development is that, even if the \nUnited States catches them, there is only a small chance that we will \nactually do anything about it. There are legitimate reasons for \nclassifying parts of these responses and that is why our bill allows \nthe administration to submit part of the waiver explanation in a \nclassified annex. However, our bill requires the Administration to \nprovide more detailed explanations for such waivers and an explanation \nof why a justification is classified.\n  Currently, the INA sanctions restrict only U.S. arms and dual-use \nexports to violators, and an Executive order authorizes some additional \nrestrictions. Our bill will ensure that all the significant tools in \nour sanctions arsenal are brought to bear on proliferators. It broadens \nINA sanctions to also include prohibitions on U.S. investment, \nfinancing, and financial assistance for violators, and if S. 1713 is \nenacted, also ban their imports into the United States. In an example \nidentified by the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control, China \nNational Aero-Technology Import Export Corporation, CATIC, which was \nsanctioned under the INA in 2002 and 2004, has subsidiaries that export \nto the U.S. Under our bill, the investment sanction would prevent U.S. \ncompanies from making new capital investments in CATIC factories. It \nwould also forbid the purchase by U.S. persons of shares of CATIC \nShenzhen Holdings and CATIC International Holdings, two CATIC-\ncontrolled companies that are listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. \nThe new import ban would block the sale of CATIC products in the United \nStates, cutting off an important source of revenue. Put simply, this \nbill would make it clear for companies like CATIC that they must make a \nchoice--profit from their dealings with the vast U.S. market or \ncontinue to assist Iran or Syria with their WMD and missile programs. \nIt is long past due that companies make such a choice.\n  Under the INA, parent companies can continue to do business with the \nU.S. and profit from our economy, even if their subsidiaries openly \nassist Iran with missile and WMD-related activities. Our bill attempts \nto end this aberration by expanding the scope of the sanctions to \ninclude the parent companies. The Wisconsin Project has identified \nserial proliferators who have flouted U.S. law because they know they \ncannot be touched by the current INA. China Aerospace Science and \nTechnology Corporation, CASC, for example, has had three subsidiaries \nsanctioned--two of them repeatedly--for missile technology transfers to \nIran. Meanwhile, CASC is marketing its commercial satellite launch \nprogram in our country. This amendment would force CASC to choose \nbetween selling missile technology to Iran and the business potential \nin future U.S. satellite launches. The bill's ban on investment would \nalso affect the subsidiaries CASC has listed on the Hong Kong Stock \nExchange. Similarly, the Chinese oil giant Sinopec has been selling \nglass-lined vessels useful for making poison gas to Iran through its \nsubsidiaries. While INA sanctions were imposed on one of its \nsubsidiaries, however, Sinopec remained free to raise billions of \ndollars on the New York Stock Exchange and even receive U.S. technology \nand U.S. foreign aid. This is absurd, and will no longer be possible if \nour bill becomes law.\n  In conclusion, I want to emphasize the urgency of this matter. The \nintelligence community expects that Iran will be able to produce a \nnuclear weapon within a decade, and the CIA has highlighted concern \nabout Iran's robust missile program. Iran has pursued various methods \nfor enriching uranium and experimented with separating plutonium. \nIran's WMD program is making news headlines again, and the IAEA Board \nof Governors found Iran in noncompliance with the NPT. The \nCongressional Research Service reported in its review of the INA that \nIran's efforts to acquire foreign WMD technology seem to have continued \nunabated. Similarly, Syria continues to rely on technology and \nassistance from abroad to develop its ballistic missile program. \nAccording to recent unclassified CIA reports, Syria's chemical weapon \nprogram also depends on equipment and precursor chemicals it receives \nfrom foreign sources.\n  We need to make a serious effort to inhibit WMD development by Iran \nand Syria. Strengthening the INA is one concrete way to do that for \nIran, and when S. 1713 is enacted, also for Syria. We must make clear \nto the world that assisting Tehran and Damascus in developing the most \ndangerous weapons cannot and will not be tolerated. For example, China \nis a country with which we continue to build closer ties. However, a \nrecent Rand study concluded that although China has improved its export \ncontrol system on paper, it does not consistently and effectively \nimplement these controls. Russia is also an important partner, but it \nhas continued to provide Iran with nuclear technology. India is another \nnation with which the United States continues to grow closer, and the \nPresident has even committed to helping it with nuclear energy \ntechnology. Yet India also has very close ties to Iran. We must make \nclear to these nations and to the entire world that it is in the best \ninterest of the international community that Iran and Syria do not \nexpand their WMD capabilities. We must also make it crystal clear that \nif you assist these nations with their quest for weapons, there will be \nserious consequences for you in your relationship and dealings with the \nUnited States. Strengthening the INA as we suggest will make that \nmessage clear and further our national security goals.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1976\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representative of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to repeal section 5 of the Marine Mammal Protection \nAct of 1972; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I come to the floor to introduce this \nbill, which repeals a provision in the 1977 reauthorization of the \nMarine Mammal Protection Act of 1972--a provision which unduly \nrestricts our ability to get States on the west coast the petroleum \nsupplies they need.\n  In the last several weeks, some of our colleagues have participated \nin press conferences, sent out news releases, and come to the floor to \ntalk about the impact of high energy prices. They have expressed \nconcern about the effect these prices are having on our economy, our \nconsumers, our businesses, and our national security.\n  I share their concerns. In fact, for over 3 years, I have been urging \nthe Senate to deal with this situation.\n  It took one of the worst natural disasters in the history of our \nNation for many to evaluate our energy policy. While the circumstances \nare tragic, I am glad our colleagues are taking a closer look at this.\n  The plan our colleagues now support aims to achieve the right goal, \nbut it offers the wrong solution. Their plan calls for energy \nindependence--a goal which I support. But they tout conservation as the \nonly way to reach this goal. This approach would put us on the wrong \ncourse and fail to solve the larger problem.\n  Our country is in the midst of an energy crisis, and we cannot \nconserve our way out. To suggest otherwise does a great disservice to \nall Americans. We don't need a hollow plan, we need results.\n  We cannot get out of this crisis by blaming Americans--who are just \ntrying to live their lives, run their businesses, and get to and from \nwork--for the situation we are in. This is not solely a consumption \nproblem; much of this crisis stems from misguided policies which have \nlocked up our lands and prevented us from building new refineries.\n  The only way to become energy independent is through a combination of \ninitiatives. Conservation is one part of the broader solution.\n  But we also need to develop renewable and alternative sources of \nenergy and invest in nuclear power and we must develop our domestic oil \nand gas resources which exist on Federal lands.\n  The end to this crisis lies in the balance between conservation and \ndevelopment. Yes, I believe that Americans need to conserve our energy \nresources, but this alone won't solve our energy crisis. To suggest it \nwill is to greatly mislead the American public.\n  We need to get serious about our energy policy.\n  My good friend and colleague, Senator Domenici, has told us we must \nexpand on the Energy bill.\n  I agree with Senator Domenici, and I look forward to working with him \non an energy policy for this country that makes sense.\n  Hurricanes Katrina and Rita exposed a weakness in our domestic \nproduction and refining capability, weakness some of us have been \nwarning about for years. All Americans have been hit with higher energy \nprices in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.\n  Some colleagues have expressed concern that this situation was \ncompounded by price gouging. Senator Inouye and I, along with our \ncolleagues on the Commerce Committee, are evaluating several bills \npertaining to that issue. In the coming days, we will be moving forward \nto address some of those concerns.\n  In the process of reviewing these concerns, the claims by those on \nthe west coast were of particular interest to me. Due to current \nrestrictions in the MMPA, it is almost impossible for companies to \nexpand their refineries to increase supply. The provision repealed by \nmy bill is currently impacting the largest refinery on the west coast, \naffecting more than 300,000 gallons of fuel per day.\n  I introduce this bill to enable us to get petroleum resources to west \ncoast States quickly and urge my colleagues to support this initiative.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/08/senate-section/article/S12534-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12534-S12535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 301--COMMEMORATING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE \n                        NATIONAL AUDUBON SOCIETY\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE (for himself, Ms. Stabenow, Ms. Snowe, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. \nCarper, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Martinez, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Kerry, \nMr. Feingold, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Schumer, Mrs. Clinton, \nMs. Collins, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Crapo, Mr. \nBond, Ms. Landrieu, and Mr. Vitter) submitted the following resolution; \nwhich was referred to the Committee on Environment and Public Works:\n\n                              S. Res. 301\n\n       Whereas the welfare of the citizens of the United States is \n     greatly enriched by the purposeful endeavors of individuals \n     and organizations committed to the preservation and \n     protection of our environment, and the enhancement of, and \n     appreciation for, our natural surroundings;\n       Whereas the National Audubon Society, the Nation's largest \n     bird conservation organization, is celebrating its Centennial \n     year in 2005, having been incorporated on January 5, 1905, by \n     dedicated women and men eager to save from extinction the \n     Great Egret and other bird species killed for their feathers \n     to support the fashion industry;\n       Whereas it is the intent of the Senate to recognize and pay \n     tribute to the National Audubon Society upon the occasion of \n     its 100th anniversary;\n       Whereas the founders of the National Audubon Society \n     withstood violence and opposition to organize one of the \n     longest-lived and most successful conservation groups in the \n     United States, dedicated to the protection of birds, other \n     wildlife, and their habitats through advocacy of \n     environmental policy and education based on sound science;\n       Whereas the dedicated efforts of Audubon volunteers, \n     members, and staff in support of landmark bird protection \n     legislation have aided in the rescue efforts of the following \n     species from the threat of extinction: Bald Eagles, Egrets, \n     Ibis, Herons, Flamingos, Whooping Cranes, Peregrine Falcons, \n     Brown Pelicans, Roseate Spoonbills, Atlantic Puffins, and \n     Condors;\n       Whereas the National Audubon Society lent critical support \n     to the protection of wildlife habitats through the passage of \n     legislation, such as the Alaska National Interest Lands \n     Conservation Act and the Act popularly known as the \n     Everglades Restoration Act, the identification of 1,800 \n     habitats critical to the survival of bird species through \n     Audubon's Important Bird Areas Program, and the establishment \n     of private bird sanctuaries;\n       Whereas the National Audubon Society played a critical role \n     in the establishment of the Nation's first wildlife refuge, \n     Florida's Pelican Island, in 1903, and the subsequent \n     protection of Pelican Island and other refuge areas in the \n     National Wildlife Refuge system;\n       Whereas birds are excellent indicators of environmental \n     health, as impacted by such factors as pollution, climate \n     change, toxins, and habitat loss, as well as our own long-\n     term well being, and it is in our best interest\n\n[[Page S12535]]\n\n     to heed such indicators, which may ultimately affect human \n     populations; and\n       Whereas recognizing that the national network of community-\n     based nature centers and chapters, scientific and educational \n     programs, and advocacy of the National Audubon Society, \n     engages millions of people of all ages and backgrounds in \n     positive conservation experiences, and are integral to \n     maintaining the health and beauty of the United States: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commemorates the 100th anniversary of the National \n     Audubon Society;\n       (2) congratulates the National Audubon Society on this \n     milestone; and\n       (3) encourages the National Audubon Society to continue its \n     important work to ensure that the next 100 years of \n     conservation are a success.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to submit a resolution with \nSenator Stabenow to commemorate the National Audubon Society's \nCentennial Anniversary. Senators Snowe, Boxer, Carper, Nelson (FL), \nMartinez, Jeffords, Kerry, Feingold, Durbin, Feinstein, Schumer, \nClinton, Collins, Cantwell, Lieberman, DeWine, Crapo, Bond, Landrieu \nand Vitter have joined us as original cosponsors.\n  The National Audubon Society was first incorporated in 1905 by a \ndedicated group of conservationists with the goal of protecting birds \nsuch as the Great Egret from the plumage trade. Feathered hats were at \nthe height of fashion in those days, and plume-traders would hunt \negrets and other birds as part of a highly profitable business. By \nraising the awareness of the problem, the men and women who founded the \nNational Audubon Society saved egrets and many other bird species from \nextinction.\n  Since that time, Audubon has worked to preserve and protect species \nand the habitat upon which they depend throughout the United States. \nThe organization has been instrumental in setting aside natural areas \nas wildlife sanctuaries, and supporting major habitat restoration \nefforts including ongoing conservation work in the Florida Everglades, \nSan Francisco Bay, and along the Mississippi River. As the U.S. partner \nin BirdLife International's Important Bird Areas (IBA) Program, Audubon \nhas fostered the stewardship and protection of essential wildlife \nhabitat from coast to coast. Through a science-based process of site \nidentification, monitoring, education and outreach, Audubon's IBA \nprogram has laid the groundwork for community-based conservation with \nover 1,600 sites recognized as ecologically important for bird species. \nIn recent months, Audubon has worked with partners to raise awareness \nof the plight of the Red Knot, a long-distance migratory bird species \nin steep decline as the result of the over-harvesting of its food \nsource, habitat destruction and invasive species concerns.\n  The Senate Resolution we are submitting today recognizes the National \nAudubon Society's dedication and commitment to protecting wildlife and \nthe Nation's ecological heritage. We commemorate the National Audubon \nSociety on it's 100th anniversary, and wish the organization many more \nyears of success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/08/senate-section/article/S12535-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 62--DIRECTING THE JOINT COMMITTEE ON THE \n LIBRARY TO PROCURE A STATUE OF ROSA PARKS FOR PLACEMENT IN THE CAPITOL\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL (for himself and Mr. Dodd) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration:\n\n                            S.

Mr. INHOFE submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by\n\n[[Page S12536]]\n\nhim to the bill S. 1042, to authorize appropriations for fiscal year \n2006 for military activities of the Department of Defense, for military \nconstruction, and for defense activities of the Department of Energy, \nto prescribe personnel strengths for such fiscal year for the Armed \nForces, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. __. AMERICAN FORCES NETWORK.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The mission of the American Forces Radio and Television \n     Service (AFRTS) and its American Forces Network (AFN), a \n     worldwide radio and television broadcast network, is to \n     deliver command information by providing United States \n     military commanders overseas and at sea with a broadcast \n     media that effectively communicates information to personnel \n     under their commands, including information from the \n     Department of Defense, information from the Armed Forces, and \n     information unique to the theater and localities in which \n     such personnel are stationed or deployed.\n       (2) The American Forces Radio and Television Service and \n     the American Forces Network provide a ``touch of home'' to \n     members of the Armed Forces, civilian employees of the \n     Department of Defense, and their families stationed at bases \n     and at embassies and consulates in more than 179 countries, \n     as well as Navy, Coast Guard, and Military Sealift Command \n     ships at sea, by providing the same type and quality of radio \n     and television programming (including news, information, \n     sports, and entertainment) that would be available in the \n     continental United States. Additionally, the American Forces \n     Network plays an important role in enabling military \n     commanders to disseminate official information to members of \n     the Armed Forces and their families, thus making popularity \n     and acceptance key factors in ensuring effective \n     communication.\n       (3) It is American Forces Radio and Television Service and \n     American Forces Network policy that, except for the Pentagon \n     Channel service, programming is acquired from distributors of \n     the most popular television program airing in the continental \n     United States. Much of the programming is provided at no cost \n     to the United States Government. The remainder of the \n     programming is provided at less-than-market rates to cover \n     distributors' costs and obligations. Depending on the \n     audience segment or demographic targeted, programs that \n     perform well are acquired and scheduled to maximize audiences \n     for internal and command information exposure.\n       (4) American Forces Radio and Television Service and \n     American Forces Network select programming that represents a \n     cross-section of popular American radio and television, \n     tailored toward the worldwide audience of the American Forces \n     Radio and Television Service and the American Forces Network. \n     Schedules emulate programming practices in the United States, \n     and programs are aired in accordance with network broadcast \n     standards. Specifically, policy on programming seeks--\n       (A) to provide balance and diversity;\n       (B) to deliver a cross-section of popular programming;\n       (C) to target appropriate demographics; and\n       (D) to maintain network broadcast standards.\n       (5) The ``Voice Channel'', or radio programming, of the \n     American Forces Radio and Television Service and American \n     Forces Network is chosen to address requirements specified by \n     the military broadcasting services and the detachment \n     commanders of their affiliate radio stations. American Forces \n     Network Radio makes a best faith effort to obtain the top-\n     rated program of its sort at the time of selection, at no \n     cost to the United States Government. American Forces Network \n     Radio usually retains a scheduled program until it is no \n     longer produced, too few American Forces Network affiliates \n     choose to schedule the program locally, or a similar program \n     so thoroughly dominates its audience in the United States \n     that the American Forces Radio and Television Service \n     switches to this program to offer the higher rated show to \n     the overseas audience.\n       (6) American Forces Network Radio personnel review the \n     major trade publications to monitor announcements of new \n     programs, follow the ratings of established programs, and \n     keep aware of programming trends. When a program addressing a \n     need identified by a Military Broadcasting Service or an \n     American Forces Network affiliate becomes available to the \n     American Forces Network, or a program seems especially worthy \n     of consideration, American Forces Network Radio informs the \n     affiliates and supplies samples to gauge affiliate interest. \n     If affiliates commit to broadcasting the new show, American \n     Forces Network Radio seeks to schedule it.\n       (7) The managers of the American Forces Radio and \n     Television Service continually update their programming \n     options and, in November 2005, decided to include additional \n     programs that meet the criteria that American Forces Radio \n     and Television Service managers apply to such decisions, and \n     that, consistent with American Forces Radio and Television \n     Service and American Forces Network procedures, local \n     programmers at 33 locations around the globe decide which \n     programs actually are broadcast. American Forces Radio and \n     Television Service have consistently sought to provide a \n     broad, high quality range of choices for local station \n     managers.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the men and women of the American Forces Radio and \n     Television Service and the Armed Forces Network should be \n     commended for providing a vital service to the military \n     community worldwide; and\n       (2) the programming mission, themes, and practices of the \n     Department of Defense with respect to its television and \n     radio programming have fairly and responsively fulfilled \n     their mission of providing a ``touch of home'' to members of \n     the Armed Forces and their families around the world and have \n     contributed immeasurably to high morale and quality of life \n     in the Armed Forces.\n       (c) Authority To Appoint Ombudsman as Intermediary.--The \n     Secretary of Defense may appoint an individual to serve as \n     ombudsman of the American Forces Network. Any ombudsman so \n     appointed shall act as an intermediary between the staff of \n     the American Forces Network and the Department of Defense, \n     military commanders, and listeners to the programming of the \n     American Forces Network.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2440. Mr. INHOFE submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by \nhim to the bill S. 1042, to authorize appropriations for fiscal year \n2006 for military activities of the Department of Defense, for military \nconstruction, and for defense activities of the Department of Energy, \nto prescribe personnel strengths for such fiscal year for the Armed \nForces, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle G of title X of division A, add the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 1073.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 261, H.R. 797.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 797) to amend the Native American Housing \n     Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 and other Acts \n     to improve housing programs for Indians.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, today, I rise in support of H.R. 797, the \nNative American Housing Enhancement Act of 2005. This bill is identical \nto a bill Senator Johnson and I introduced in February, S. 475, that \nwill encourage home ownership and enhance housing opportunities for \nNative Americans across the country. H.R. 797 is an important piece of \nlegislation and I commend my Senate colleague, Senator Tim Johnson from \nSouth Dakota, and my colleague on the House side, Congressman Rick \nRenzi from Arizona, for their continued leadership on Indian housing \nissues.\n  Home ownership is a fundamental building block of a successful \ncommunity. Simply put, ownership promotes pride and pride promotes \nimprovement. And, when it comes to Native American housing, we have a \nlot of improving to do. Currently, Native Americans experience some of \nthe worst housing conditions in the country. About 90,000 Indian \nfamilies are homeless or underhoused. Nearly 33 percent of Indian homes \nare overcrowded, while 33 percent lack adequate solid waste management \nsystems and 8 percent lack a safe indoor water supply.\n  Poor housing conditions on our reservations are a symptom of laws and \nregulations that fail to promote a sense of ownership and personal \nresponsibility within our tribes. Although the Native American Housing \nAssistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 made great strides in \ndeveloping an ownership society in Indian country, we still have a lot \nof work to do. This legislation is a step in the right direction. Our \nbill would give tribes more flexibility when developing housing \nimprovement projects, and will also give tribal housing entities the \nopportunity to once again take advantage of a program designed to teach \nkids the value of hardwork and community involvement.\n  The Youthbuild program is a vocational program designed to give low-\nincome kids and highschool drop-outs between the ages of 16 and 24 the \nskills they need to survive in today's world. Youthbuild participants \ngain critical job skills and leadership training by constructing and \nrehabilitating affordable housing units in their communities. The new \nhousing units are owned and managed by community housing authorities \nand then permanently designated for low-income families who need the \nmost help finding a place to live. The program is an excellent tool for \nachieving two goals. The first goal is to provide vocational education \nand life-long learning skills for kids who live in some of the most \neconomically-depressed areas of the country. These kids need skills in \norder to build a workforce that can support economic development on our \nreservations. The second goal is to build affordable housing units so \ntribal families can find homes with running water, adequate sewage \nsystems, and heat and electricity.\n  However, as I mentioned before, tribal housing entities and tribal \nyouth programs were barred from the Youthbuild program when the Native \nAmerican Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996, \nNAHASDA, was enacted. Accessibility was eliminated because NAHASDA gave \nthe tribes the authority to encompass this type of activity under their \nrespective Indian Housing Plans. Unfortunately, when tribes are \nprioritizing their housing projects, many choose to fix crumbling \nfoundations, dry-rot and sanitation systems before they invest in \nYouthbuild-type programs. H.R. 797 will provide an alternative resource \nfor this type of activity. Further, it will\n\n[[Page S12550]]\n\nhelp children in tribal communities feel a sense of accomplishment when \nthey see their friends and neighbors move into new homes they help \nbuilt. And, that builds pride.\n  The bill will also clarify that tribes and tribal entities can access \ncertain grant income and retain program money for successive grant \nyears if used for affordable housing activities. This provision will \nultimately provide tribes and tribal entities with more flexibility in \nplanning and improve their ability to use their funds efficiently.\n  H.R. 797 also amends the Housing Act of 1949 to provide consistency \nacross tribal housing programs by treating tribes applying for housing \nprograms within the Department of Agriculture, USDA, the same as tribes \napplying for housing programs within the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development, HUD. The bill will allow tribes to comply with Title \nII of the Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968 rather than Title VI of the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964 when securing federal funds for USDA housing \nprograms.\n  Under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, tribes are unable to \naccess certain federal funds if Indian preference is a factor in using \nthose funds. Tribes must comply with the Civil Rights Act unless \nCongress explicitly exempts them under an authorizing statute. \nUnfortunately, most Native American housing programs are tailored to \nbenefit tribal members, which puts these programs at odds with the 1964 \nAct.\n  When Congress passed the Native American Housing Assistance and Self \nDetermination Act in 1996, we exempted tribes from the 1964 Civil \nRights Act for housing programs administered by the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development, provided they comply with the Indian \nCivil Rights Act of 1968. H.R. 797 would provide a similar exemption \nfor tribes with respect to housing projects under the Department of \nAgriculture. In short, it brings USDA housing programs in line with HUD \nhousing programs.\n  This is a good bill that will provide real and tangible benefits in \nIndian country. Building a community is about building pride in our \nkids, our neighbors and ourselves. H.R. 797 and S. 475 recognize that \npride comes from working together, learning new and improved skills, \nearning livable wages, and owning a home, among other things.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment at the desk be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a \nthird time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nand any statements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Iran's earlier success in gaining \n     technology and materials from Russian entities helped \n     accelerate Iranian development of the Shahab-3 MRBM, and \n     continuing Russian entity assistance has supported Iranian \n     efforts to develop new missiles and increase Tehran's self-\n     sufficiency in missile production.''\n       (2) Vice Admiral Lowell E. Jacoby, the Director of the \n     Defense Intelligence Agency, stated in testimony before the \n     Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate on February \n     16, 2005, that ``Tehran probably will have the ability to \n     produce nuclear weapons early in the next decade''.\n       (3) Iran has--\n       (A) failed to act in accordance with the Agreement Between \n     Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency for the \n     Application of Safeguards in Connection with the Treaty on \n     the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done at Vienna June \n     19, 1973 (commonly referred to as the ``Safeguards \n     Agreement'');\n       (B) acted in a manner inconsistent with the Protocol \n     Additional to the Agreement Between Iran and the \n     International Atomic Energy Agency for the Application of \n     Safeguards, signed at Vienna December 18, 2003 (commonly \n     referred to as the ``Additional Protocol'');\n       (C) acted in a manner inconsistent with its obligations \n     under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, \n     done at Washington, London, and Moscow July 1, 1968, and \n     entered into force March 5, 1970 (commonly referred to as the \n     ``Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty''); and\n       (D) resumed uranium conversion activities, thus ending the \n     confidence building measures it adopted in its November 2003 \n     agreement with the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, \n     France, and Germany.\n       (4) On September 24, 2005, the Board of Governors of the \n     International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) formally declared \n     that Iranian actions constituted noncompliance with its \n     nuclear safeguards obligations, and that Iran's history of \n     concealment of its nuclear activities has given rise to \n     questions that are within the purview of the United Nations \n     Security Council.\n       (5) The executive branch has on multiple occasions used the \n     authority provided under section 3 of the Iran \n     Nonproliferation Act of 2000 (Public Law 106-178; 50 U.S.C. \n     1701 note) to impose sanctions on entities that have engaged \n     in activities in violation of restrictions in the Act \n     relating to--\n       (A) the export of equipment and technology controlled under \n     multilateral export control lists, including under the \n     Australia Group, Chemical Weapons Convention, Missile \n     Technology Control Regime, Nuclear Suppliers Group, and the \n     Wassenaar Arrangement or otherwise having the potential to \n     make a material contribution to the development of weapons of \n     mass destruction or cruise or ballistic missile systems to \n     Iran; and\n       (B) the export of other items to Iran with the potential of \n     making a material contribution to Iran's weapons of mass \n     destruction programs or on United States national control \n     lists for reasons related to the proliferation of weapons of \n     mass destruction or missiles.\n       (6) The executive branch has never made a determination \n     pursuant to section 6(b) of the Iran Nonproliferation Act of \n     2000 that--\n       (A) it is the policy of the Government of the Russian \n     Federation to oppose the proliferation to Iran of weapons of \n     mass destruction and missile systems capable of delivering \n     such weapons;\n       (B) the Government of the Russian Federation (including the \n     law enforcement, export promotion, export control, and \n     intelligence agencies of such government) has demonstrated \n     and continues to demonstrate a sustained commitment to seek \n     out and prevent the transfer to Iran of goods, services, and \n     technology that could make a material contribution to the \n     development of nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons, or \n     of ballistic or cruise missile systems; and\n       (C) no entity under the jurisdiction or control of the \n     Government of the Russian Federation, has, during the 1-year \n     period prior to the date of the determination pursuant to \n     section 6(b) of such Act, made transfers to Iran reportable \n     under section 2(a) of the Act.\n       (7) On June 29, 2005, President George W. Bush issued \n     Executive Order 13382 blocking property of weapons of mass \n     destruction proliferators and their supporters, and used the \n     authority of such order against 4 Iranian entities, Aerospace \n     Industries Organization, Shahid Hemmat Industrial Group, \n     Shahid Bakeri Industrial Group, and the Atomic Energy \n     Organization of Iran, that have engaged, or attempted\n\n[[Page S12551]]\n\n     to engage, in activities or transactions that have materially \n     contributed to, or pose a risk of materially contributing to, \n     the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or their \n     means of delivery (including missiles capable of delivering \n     such weapons), including efforts to manufacture, acquire, \n     possess, develop, transport, transfer, or use such items.\n\n     SEC. 3.
