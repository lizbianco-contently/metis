Mr. President, this afternoon we begin consideration of S. \n2611, a comprehensive immigration measure. Chairman Specter is here \ntoday to manage amendments to the bill. We have several Senators on \nthis side of the aisle who have indicated they are prepared to pose \ntheir amendments during today's session. I encourage Members to come \nforward and bring their amendments to the managers just as soon as \npossible so that we will be able to consider them. Exactly how we \nhandle amendments over the course of the afternoon, the Democratic \nleader and I and the chairman and managers will be discussing in a few \nminutes. We do expect a full session on the immigration bill today.\n  On Tuesday we have an order to have a rollcall vote at shortly after \n10 o'clock on the confirmation of a circuit court nomination. I expect \nafter that we would have some other votes that could be stacked and \nvoted upon before our policy luncheons.\n  I do want to say, once again, that we need Senators to offer their \namendments, to give us language on their amendments just as soon as \npossible. The debate itself will be fair, will be dignified. We have \nall agreed we want to be able to dispose of these amendments in a way \nthat allows time for effective debate, whatever time is necessary for a \ndebate, but that we would expect to be voting about every 2 hours--and \nthat could go to 3 hours on some and could go to 10 minutes on others. \nBut in order to consider the range and number of amendments that have \nbeen proposed, we do need people to come forward and we will deal with \nthose accordingly.\n  This is an important bill. It is a bill that we have talked a lot \nabout on the floor for a couple of weeks already. There has been much \ngood discussion, both on and off the Senate floor. I think everybody \nhas spent a lot more time with the bill and with the proposed \namendments. Thus, I think we should be able to address the issue in a \ncareful, deliberate way, a complete way, and finish this bill before \nMemorial Day.\n  It is an important bill. It is an important bill to our national \nsecurity. It is an important bill to our values, to our economy, and to \nour safety.\n  I have a brief statement to make on another topic, but I turn to the \nDemocratic leader, if there is any comment on scheduling, of course.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/15/senate-section/article/S4529-7", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I look forward to some very \npronounced debate and voting.\n  We have had a lot of talk about the need to do immigration. Now is \nthe opportunity to see what we can do. I met with my staff today, and I \nasked them to prioritize our amendments. We worked through some of \nthose, which ones we want to offer first, second, third. I am sure that \nhas been done on\n\n[[Page S4530]]\n\nthe majority side also.

Mr. President, as I speak, on the west front of the \nCapitol Building we are observing the 25th National Peace Officers \nMemorial Service. Tribute is being paid to the 155 peace officers who \nlost their lives in the line of duty last year. The President spoke \nthere moments ago, and is still there expressing his sympathy to the \nfamilies who have lost loved ones.\n  It is always, each year, a solemn occasion. It is a sacred occasion. \nIt reminds us of the huge sacrifices our law enforcement makes day in \nand day out on our behalf in our communities all across the country. \nEvery day around the clock America's peace officers are on the front \nlines, protecting our lives, our homes, and our freedoms. On the front \nline, when we need someone to investigate a dark alley or quell a \ndomestic dispute or subdue a criminal, it is these dedicated \nprofessionals who answer that call, who answer that need. Each time \nthey take a risk, and they never know if that risk will be the last \ncall they will make.\n  On August 8, 2005, when Tennessee Correctional Officer Wayne Thomas \nMorgan got ready for work, he couldn't know that it would be his last \nmorning to say goodbye. At 10 a.m, during a routine prisoner transfer \nat the Roane County Courthouse, he was shot and killed. Prison nurse \nJennifer Hyatte ambushed him as he and another guard escorted her \nhusband, George Hyatte, from the courthouse to a prison van. From \nbehind the wheel of her SUV, Jennifer drove into the parking lot, shot \nOfficer Morgan three times, and fled the scene, escaping with her \nhusband in the car.\n  The couple were arrested 36 hours later in Ohio. They now face trial \non murder charges scheduled for later this year. It was an outrageous \ncrime that shocked the Nation and shocked the close-knit Kingston \ncommunity.\n  A deacon and choir member of the Meadowview Baptist Church, Officer \nMorgan was well known and much loved throughout his community. His \nfuneral was attended by over 1,000 people, including law enforcement \nofficers from seven States and Canada.\n  Bradley County Chief Deputy Bill Griffith said Officer Morgan's death \n``reminds those of us in law enforcement that we put our lives on the \nline every day.''\n  Today, we echo those words as we pay tribute to our fallen heroes.\n  I would like to take just a moment to recognize Tennessee's own who \ngave the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty last year: Officer \nMichael Keith Buckner, who served the Decherd Police Department and was \nkilled in an automobile accident while returning from an investigation \nin a severe snowstorm. He is survived by his wife and daughter.\n  Trooper Todd Michael Larkins, who served with the Tennessee Highway \nPatrol for 5 years, was struck and killed by a tractor trailer while \nconducting a vehicle stop. He is survived by his wife and daughter.\n  Correctional Officer Wayne Thomas Morgan, who served with the \nTennessee Department of Correction for 28 years, is survived by his \nwife, son, and daughter.\n  And Officer Kay Frances Rogers, a 15-year veteran who served with the \nMurfreesboro Police Department for 4 of those years, died of injuries \nsustained in a motorcycle accident. She is survived by her mother, \nthree brothers, and three sisters.\n  Our hearts go out to these families, to friends and colleagues. And \nwe bow our heads in recognition of their dedication, their sacrifice, \nand their courage.\n  As a Senator and an American citizen, I pledge to keep working on \nbehalf of our Nation's peace officers.\n  In 2004, I cosponsored the Law Enforcement Safety Act, which the \nPresident signed into law. This legislation was the No. 1 priority for \nour Nation's law enforcement community. It is now law of the land. It \nallows current retired police officers to carry a concealed weapon in \nany of the 50 States. America now has the added security of tens of \nthousands of trained and certified law enforcement officers serving and \nprotecting us across the country even into retirement.\n  There are more than 800,000 law enforcement officers serving \ncommunities all across America, the highest number ever.\n  Each of these officers is a hero. And each of these officers has a \nfamily who deserves our appreciation and gratitude for their service.\n  May God bless the brave women and men who swear to protect and serve \nus.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/15/senate-section/article/S4530-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to the consideration of S. 2611, which the clerk \nwill report by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2611) to provide for comprehensive immigration \n     reform and for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this is summertime. It is the time that we \nsee the rolling out of American blockbuster movies. They also try to \nsave their best for the summer. This summer's blockbuster is ``The Da \nVinci Code,'' starring Tom Hanks. It starts this Friday all across \nAmerica. But the third week in May on the Senate floor we have our own \nSenate blockbuster. It is the sequel though, not the original, part 2 \nof immigration. The first installment didn't go well for a number of \nreasons. One of the reasons I felt it didn't go well was the fact that \nthe President wasn't involved personally in it. He wasn't involved in \nthe debate.\n  For the first installment, I think the Judiciary Committee did very \nwell. They were working on a very tight timeframe. There probably \nshould have been more hearings. That is one reason there were probably \nmore amendments than we would normally have on a bill. But I think \nSenators Leahy and Specter did an outstanding job to work out the \nbipartisan compromise--what we call the McCain-Kennedy legislation. It \nis a bill we tried to deal with on the floor. It didn't move forward \nfor a number of reasons, one of which is the fact we couldn't work out \na procedural mechanism to go forward. We tried. We had two cloture \nvotes. All the Democrats voted to go forward with this; all the \nRepublicans voted not to go forward with the legislation.\n  What did that legislation have in it? Both the McCain-Kennedy and the \nso-called Hagel-Martinez substitute. They have in them provisions that \nI think are so important to this country.\n  First, our border security.\n  I was in the Congress 20 years ago and served in the House of \nRepresentatives when we passed an immigration bill. Obviously, we \ndidn't do a very good job. Twenty years later, we have at least 12 \nmillion people who are here that are undocumented.\n  With this legislation, which is so important, we do good, sound, \nlong-term border security.\n  We also have to have a temporary worker program. There could be a \nnumber of amendments offered on this legislation. But we have to have a \ntemporary worker program. I have said on a number of occasions that Las \nVegas is a perfect example of why we need a temporary worker program. \nIn the next 4 or 5 years, they will have 50,000 new hotel rooms. \nManagement and the union say they cannot find the workers to man those \nhotels. So we need a temporary guest worker program.\n  I have mentioned we have 12 million people who are now living in the \nshadows. We have to have a way of bringing them out of the shadows. The \nMcCain-Kennedy legislation sets the framework for doing that. How? By \nputting them on path of legalization--a path that would require their \nhaving jobs, paying taxes, staying out of trouble, no\n\n[[Page S4531]]\n\ncrimes, learning English, paying some penalty. Then they move to the \nback of the line. It will take a long time for them to get to the front \nof the line, but at least they can come out of the shadows and not be \nworried about being picked up for a violation of some kind, with their \nAmerican husbands and wives and their children. We need to do that.\n  Finally, we have to have in a good immigration bill something to make \nmeaningful employer sanctions. That is why I support the legislation \nnow before the Senate.\n  Of course, I am going to vote for some amendments. I think some \nimprovements can be made.\n  We are now on the sequel of what took place before the Easter \nvacation. Yes, the sequel.\n  I hope the President will take a leading role in this sequel, a role \non this rerun. But his role is up to him. It is up to him. His role \nstarts tonight in a speech that he is going to give to the Nation. We \nhave had preliminary statements as to what this speech is going to be. \nWe understand that one of the things he is going to talk about is \nbringing out the National Guard.\n  I believe in strong border security. If there is a way we can work \nout the National Guard situation, fine. I am willing to go along with \nthat. But my colleague, Senator Hagel, has said he believes that the \nNational Guard is stretched too thin. My colleague, Senator Biden, said \nthe same thing. He said it both yesterday and on Sunday talk shows. \nSome National Guardsmen have had four tours of duty in Iraq.\n  I hope we can come up with something that is meaningful.\n  Governor Napolitano and Governor Richardson of Arizona and New Mexico \nhave stated on a number of occasions over the last many months they \nbelieve the National Guard should be called out. The problem is they \nneed some way of financing this. This is a Federal obligation. The \nStates shouldn't have to bear it.\n  I hope the President will address that.\n  The President must be specific. We must have permanent solutions--not \nstopgap measures for our border security.\n  The President's role in this sequel, ``Immigration No. 2,'' is up to \nhim. I would be the first to give him a leading role. We need him. We \ndidn't have him involved in the first immigration debate. He came in \nand started saying things after the votes had already taken place.\n  I hope the President is willing to stand up and be counted on this \nissue.\n  I have some questions for the President. The first question is very \nbasic. We need to know what kind of immigration reform he supports.\n  Does he believe, as his Republicans in the House do, that we should \nbuild a 700-mile fence on our border? He must take a stand in that \nregard.\n  Does he believe, as his Republican colleagues in the House do, that \nwe should make all undocumented immigrants felons?\n  Does the President believe, as his Republicans in the House believe, \nthat we should make all those who feed, clothe, and otherwise assist \nundocumented immigrants felons--also, people such as priests, \nministers, missionaries, social workers, and welfare personnel?\n  He must speak out on these very unfavorable provisions in the House \nbill.\n  Two weeks ago, I had the opportunity to spend some time in my office \nwith Cardinal McCarrick and Cardinal Mahony, two wonderful, caring, \nspiritual men.\n  Under the House legislation, Cardinal Mahony would be a felon.\n  Here is what Cardinal Mahony said about the bill:\n\n       The whole concept of punishing people who serve immigrants \n     is un-American. If you take this to its logical, ludicrous \n     extreme, every single person who comes up to receive Holy \n     Communion, you have to ask them to show papers. It becomes \n     absurd and the church is not about to get into that. The \n     church is here to serve people. We're not about to become \n     immigration agents. It just throws more gasoline on the \n     discussion and inflames people.\n\n  I believe the Senate will move forward with good, strong immigration \nreform. But I also believe our work could be hijacked by House \nRepublicans who want to turn immigrants into felons.\n  I have fought to prevent this from happening by guaranteeing fair \nrepresentation in the conference committee. The President can do even \nmore tonight.\n  Chairman Sensenbrenner, the chairman of the House Judiciary \nCommittee, the man who among others pushed this felony provision, \nstated publicly that the measure was included at the ``administration's \nrequest.'' If that is the case, President Bush needs to tell Chairman \nSensenbrenner to remove the provision and that it is dead.\n  The President needs to make it clear once and for all that he will \nonly support immigration reform that is tough and smart. He must \npublicly denounce the House bill.\n  The second question for President Bush concerns security. It is fine \nto hear him say that he wants to send the National Guard, but what else \nwill he do to address 4\\1/2\\ years of neglect?\n  We all remember. We were celebrating the fact that one of the first \nthings he did after becoming President was going to Mexico and saying \nhe was going to work out the immigration problems with President Fox. \nIt hasn't worked. This issue has been ignored for 5\\1/2\\ years.\n  Tonight, it is not enough for the President to tell us he wants to \nincrease security at our borders. After all, I repeat, he has had 5\\1/\n2\\ years to do this. If he wants to be credible on border security, he \nmust acknowledge the mistakes in the past and commit to fixing them.\n  The lack of security at our borders is frightening. Apprehensions of \nundocumented immigrants have dropped under President Bush by 30 \npercent. We have gone from apprehending 1.7 million individuals \nillegally crossing between 1996 and 2000 to just over 1 million now.\n  It is not that less people are coming. It is that we don't have the \nresources we need to catch them.\n  A month ago, I was on the border. I saw some of the problems which \nthe overworked Border Patrol agents face. At San Ysidro, it is hard to \ncomprehend, but there are 24 lanes of traffic coming into the United \nStates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week--24 lanes of traffic one way.\n  They are understaffed and underresourced. They simply can't handle \nit. It can be handled, but they need the resources to do it.\n  But it is more than people whom we can't catch coming across our \nborders. We can't forget that a few weeks ago the Government \nAccountability Office reported that in March they detailed how two \nFederal investigators were able to smuggle into our country nuclear \nmaterial. This shocking report is an indictment of what has happened on \nour borders. For too long this administration has neglected its \nresponsibility for protecting our homeland, including our border.\n  The 9/11 Commission told the President that he should work with other \ncountries to develop a terrorist watch list which Border Patrol agents \ncould use to check people crossing the border. Did he do it? No.\n  The 9/11 Commission gave him a failing grade when they issued their \nreport card last year--a ``D.''\n  In the 9/11 legislation which we passed to help secure our country, \nCongress authorized 2,000 new Border Parol agents.\n  What did the President of the United States do to put these 2,000 \nagents in place? Well, he did 75 percent of it. We are still 500 agents \nshort. The President watched as the Republicans in Congress have \nrefused to fund these positions even though we have tried.\n\n  The same legislation, the September 11 act, authorized facilities to \nhold up to 8,000 individuals detained while illegally crossing our \nborder. Currently, we do not have the capacity to hold all those we \ndetain, so they are most often released with a court date. They then \ndisappear into our country. Over the weekend, there were news stories \nabout tens of thousands coming into our country illegally. They are \ndetained. Then we say: See you later, check in for court. Of course, \nthey never come to court. Rarely do they come to court. Why do the \nauthorities let them go? They have no place to put them. Did the \nPresident make sure the new 8,000 detention bed facilities became a \nreality? No. He has allowed the Congress to fund only 1,800 of these \nnew detention beds. No wonder the border agents have no alternative but \nto let them go.\n  All this adds up to a credibility gap. It is no wonder the President \ngot a failing grade, a D. He is coming late to\n\n[[Page S4532]]\n\nthis sequel. He did not appear at all in immigration I. Let's hope he \nappears in immigration II and answers some of these questions.\n  It is not enough for him to unveil a proposal to use our National \nGuard. We need more. He must commit to fixing the problems that have \nbeen neglected and tell us when he will add additional agents. Congress \ncalls for 2,000 agents; we are 500 short. It is not right that Congress \npasses laws saying we need 8,000 additional beds for the people coming \nto our country illegally and we get 1,800. He must commit to fixing the \nproblem. These problems have been neglected. He needs to tell us when \nwe will be getting the necessary authorized agents.\n  The States have had to bear the expense of holding these people. That \nshould be defrayed by the Federal Government. This is not the State's \nborder, it is the U.S. border. We must implement the recommendations of \nthe 9/11 Commission.\n  Question No. 3: If President Bush is going to get tough on border \nsecurity, will he finally get tough on border sanctions as well?\n  This is a question of credibility. For years, this administration has \nbeen willing to look the other way as immigration laws have gone \nunenforced. In 2004, the Government issued just three notices of intent \nto fine employers. There are tens of thousands of employers, and most \nof us believe that lots of them have violated the law with improper \npapers. There were just three notices of intent in 2004. No one was \nfined. In 2005, the administration targeted only one employer for an \nenforcement action. That was Wal-Mart. Overall audits of employers \nsuspected of using illegal immigrants have dropped from 8,000 under \nPresident Clinton to less than 2,000 in 2003. President Bush must \naccount for this record. He must do it in tonight's speech.\n  Question No. 4: If, as rumored, the President will announce he is \ngoing to send the National Guard to our border, will he tell the \nAmerican people how this proposal will work without jeopardizing the \ncritical role the National Guard plays in keeping our communities and \nNation safe?\n  Our National Guard is a vital force on which all of us--Presidents, \nGovernors, mayors, and Members of Congress--depend. Unfortunately, \nPresident Bush has overtaxed, overused, and underfunded this critical \nnational security resource. The men and women of our Guard have given \nus their best in Iraq, Afghanistan, and around the world. They have \ngiven their best on the gulf coast. They have given their best in \nNevada and other States across America, whether it is fires, floods, \nhurricanes, or civil unrest.\n  Now, if it is true that the President is going to order them on \nanother mission, he must tell us how he will help them succeed and \nensure they are ready and prepared should they be called to another \nmission--our border.\n  It is remarkable that in January, this White House submitted a budget \nto Congress calling to cut 17,000 guardsmen. Yet now he is asking them \nto do more with less. Tonight, in clear and consistent terms, we need \nto hear how they will be used, how they will be supported, how they \nwill prepare and be ready for the unexpected missions.\n  Remember, all the preliminaries coming out from the White House say \nthat it is going to be a temporary fix. I am for doing anything we can \nto protect our borders, within reason, but we must do it on a permanent \nbasis, not a temporary basis. We have been told this Guard thing is a \nstop-gap measure.\n  These are just four questions. There are a lot of other questions we \ncould ask, but these are questions on which I will judge the President \ntonight, as I believe the American people will. His answers will tell \nif he is committed to comprehensive reform and if he is finally serious \nabout securing our borders. As I said, today marks the beginning of \nimmigration part II. Scene I closes tonight with the President's \nspeech, leaving many more scenes to play in the Senate, but the \nPresident must be a player, an actor, not a spectator, in all the \nprocesses of this debate, not just the first act.\n\n  The bill before the Senate is not perfect. I like McCain-Kennedy \nbetter than I like the substitute, the Hagel-Martinez bill. There will \nbe amendments to consider and to work their way through the Senate.\n  For example, it is important we pass a bill and go on record \nsupporting the concept of immigration reform, our enforcement-plus-\nreform approach, and opposing the House punitive enforcement-only bill. \nI have made it clear that I will support the Hagel-Martinez compromise \nbut with some amendments. We will be well advised to take a look at \nsome of the provisions in that bill to see if they should be amended. \nThere are Members from both sides with good intentions who want to \noffer amendments, and they should do that. I voted to move forward on \nHagel-Martinez before the Easter recess, with germane amendments being \navailable postcloture. That did not work.\n  However, we are here now. The compromise we have is not perfect. \nAmong other problems with the bill, I particularly wish to highlight my \nconcern with the division of the population of 11 to 12 million \nundocumented immigrants that is in this legislation.\n  Under the Hagel-Martinez bill, we have three groups. The middle group \nof immigrants who have been here between 2 and 5 years will be required \nto do what I have heard some refer to as the ``touch back'' or ``touch \nbase'' return. They have to cross the border at a port of entry then \nthey can come right back. I personally think that is a big waste of \ntime, effort, and energy, but that is what is in that legislation. \nThere will be amendments offered on that, and unless there is something \nI don't understand, I would support the amendment to change that \nprovision. It does not make sense to me. I fear that it may deter \nparticipation in the program because some immigrants fear they will not \nbe allowed to return or will be fined, or it is too much of a hardship \nwith regard to their financial or childcare responsibilities to be able \nto make that trip. There is a waiver in it, but it is very difficult to \nobtain.\n  I repeat, this provision is a waste of time, energy, and effort. I \nknow there will be an amendment offered to take that out.\n  More importantly, this bill includes some mean-spirited provisions \nfor this group that strike me as unwise as a matter of public policy. \nThey have to waive their right to administrative or judicial review, \nwhich means they have no right to contest the decision of some \nbureaucrat who for whatever reason decides they do not meet the \nrequirement to participate in this legalization program. This sounds \nlike a big problem to me.\n  In addition, many tens of thousands of people in this group will be \nineligible for the program because they had a prior deportation order \nand failed to leave the country under a voluntary departure agreement \nor--this is particularly disturbing--they failed to comply with any \nrequest for information by the Department of Homeland Security.\n  The whole point of what we are doing is to deal with this population \nwhich is here under the table, for lack of a better description. They \nare here. They came here illegally, and there has been a decision \nmade--and some people disagree with this, but we cannot simply deport \nall of these people. So we want to put them on a path to legalization. \nI repeat, jobs, taxes, no crimes, learn English, pay penalties. Most \npeople believe that is the right thing to do. And in the future, have a \nbetter hold on our border and make sure we do not have problems in the \nfuture. This is what we need to do.\n  I don't see why we should make a distinction between those who have \nbeen unlucky enough to get caught and put through deportation \nproceedings and those who have not.\n  As far as those who have been here less than 2 years, we have to draw \na cutoff line somewhere, but I am concerned, as the bill stands, this \nwill simply lead to a situation where a couple million people will not \nleave the country and will simply remain here undocumented. That is \nunfortunate. I hope we can make improvements in the bill to address \nthis group of people as well.\n  We have so much to do. I hope we can make some fixes to these \nsections so we can get as many people as possible out of the shadows, \nregistered with the Government, paying taxes, learning English, staying \nout of trouble, and complying with the law generally.\n  I look forward to this bipartisan debate. I hope it is that. There \nare strong feelings, but this is when the Senate is\n\n[[Page S4533]]\n\nat its best. This is a debate which needs to take place. People have \nthe ability to offer their amendments, debate those amendments, and \nmove this legislation along. Democrats and Republicans are working \ntogether to construct legislation to protect our borders. It is so \nimportant we do this. I look forward to this debate. As I have \nindicated, we can do this. We must have this bipartisan measure move \nforward. The American people recognize the importance of it. It is \nimportant for our country.\n  In the Senate now, we have the distinguished chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee. He and I have not always agreed on matters. More \noften we have agreed than disagreed, but I want the record spread with \nmy view on the remarkably good job under a very difficult situation \nthat this experienced legislator has done during his tenure as chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee. We have been able to work our way through \nthe most difficult issues.\n  I don't serve on the Judiciary Committee. Never have. I did in the \nState legislature. All difficult measures that are around come through \nthe Judiciary Committee. They are funneled through the Judiciary \nCommittee. That is the way it was in the State legislature, and we find \nthe same here. Contentious issues find their way into the Judiciary \nCommittee. Senator Specter has done a tremendously good job.\n  As I indicated in my opening remarks, what he and Senator Leahy were \nable to do to get this bill to this point was a miracle. It was nothing \nshort of a miracle to get the bill out of the committee in the first \nplace and then to get it in the Senate. I hope, in the not-too-distant \nfuture, we can all look back and say this is one of the times the \nSenate has shown what the Senate is known for, and that is working its \nway through very difficult issues and having debates the country will \nlong remember.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the distinguished Democratic leader for his \ncomments, and I thank him for his statements today suggesting a \nbipartisan approach to this very important piece of legislation.\n  The leader of the Democrats is accurate when he has characterized the \nwork which Senator Leahy, the ranking member of the full committee, and \nI have done on this bill. It has been 16 months of cooperation on some \nof the tough issues, including moving ahead with bankruptcy reform, \nclass action reform. Through very strenuous efforts, we were able to \nsteer this Senate away from a confrontation and a filibuster in the so-\ncalled constitutional option. We moved through the confirmation of two \nSupreme Court Justices, Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito, which \ncould have been very problematic.\n  We were able to work through the PATRIOT Act. We were able to work \nthrough the asbestos reform bill where there are still issues of \ncontroversy that I hope we will be able to address in the not too \ndistant future. And then, as the distinguished leader of the Democrats \ncommented, moving this immigration bill out of committee was a very \nstrenuous effort on the final Monday, with a marathon session.\n  Now the bill is back in the Senate, and with the spirit of \ncooperation which the distinguished majority leader, Senator Frist, and \nthe distinguished minority leader, Senator Reid, have articulated, we \nare in a position to go forward. But we have a great deal of hard work \nto do.\n\n  As manager of the bill, along with Senator Leahy, it appears we will \nhave some 30 amendments. That is a lot of amendments but a manageable \nnumber if we address them with time limits so the arguments can be made \non both sides and we can proceed to votes.\n  There will be other business which will have to be considered at the \nsame time this bill is on the floor. We have pending the nomination of \nBrett M. Kavanaugh for the Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia Circuit. The prospects are there will be debate and an up-or-\ndown vote, and that will have to be worked into our schedule.\n  The nomination of General Hayden is pending for Director of CIA. What \nthe timetable will be there remains to be seen. But that is an \nimportant position, and it may be that action will be possible on that \nnomination up or down before we adjourn for the Memorial Day recess.\n  But the core work which we have to do will be the amendments on this \nimmigration bill. I have discussed the timing of votes with the \nmajority leader, who is prepared to back the managers of this bill on \ntime limits on the votes. We have a 15-minute time limit on votes and a \n5-minute grace period. It is our expectation we will be enforcing those \nlimits rigorously. When we have stacked votes, as is our custom, we \nhave 10-minute votes and 5-minute extensions. We will be enforcing \nthose limits rigorously.\n  There have been some occasions when the votes have languished for \nvery protracted periods of time. In the past, when we have rigorously \nenforced the time limits, it is something which I think meets with \nvirtually unanimous approval among the Members. Even those who \noccasionally miss a vote appreciate the fact that they do not have to \nwait for 10, 15, or even more minutes after the vote is supposed to \nhave ended until the next vote starts and the next debate starts. So \neveryone should be on notice that we intend to proceed in that manner.\n  We return to the debate on the immigration bill, after a period where \nwe could not come to terms on the structuring of debate before the last \nrecess. But now we are in a position to go forward.\n  This bill is an outgrowth of the core provisions of the McCain-\nKennedy legislation, then reported out by the Judiciary Committee with \nsubstantial modifications, putting the so-called 11 million \nundocumented immigrants at the end of the line, making provisions for \nborder enforcement, making provisions for employer enforcement, and \nmaking provisions for judicial reform.\n  Then we have had additional modifications made by the amendments \noffered by Senator Hagel and Senator Martinez, so that we now have an \namalgam of legislation, trying to work through the ideas of many \nSenators on very hotly contested items, and items which are very \nemotional.\n  There have been questions raised about what will happen beyond a \nSenate-passed bill, which will be a comprehensive bill, which will \ninclude a guest worker provision, which has been advocated by President \nBush, also advocated by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, \nDennis Hastert.\n  With that guest worker provision, and with other provisions, the \nSenate bill will be significantly different from the House bill.\n  We have worked cooperatively with Chairman Sensenbrenner in the past \non complex legislation. With the good faith which I know will be \npresent by both bodies, I believe we can craft, under our bicameral \nsystem, a legislative package in conference which will be acceptable to \nboth the House and the Senate.\n  There have been those who have said they will reject any major \nchanges in the Senate bill. I believe the core provisions in the Senate \nbill--finding an answer to the 11 million undocumented immigrants, an \nanswer to their status, is indispensable on immigration reform.\n  We cannot create a fugitive class in America. We do need immigrants, \nguest workers to handle very important jobs in our economy. I believe \nwithin a broad ambit we can reach agreement with the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  We are looking at this large group of undocumented immigrants, \nestimated by the Pew Hispanic Center to be between 11 and 12 million \nindividuals. We know these undocumented immigrants constitute almost 5 \npercent of our labor workforce. We know, according to the Center for \nAmerican Progress, the total cost to, so-called, round up every illegal \nimmigrant within the United States would be $200 billion to $230 \nbillion over 5 years, without the capacity to house people once they \nare arrested and under very difficult circumstances.\n  The legislation we are considering today is not amnesty. That is a \npejorative term, really a smear term used to denigrate the efforts at \ncomprehensive immigration reform. This is not amnesty because amnesty \nmeans a pardon of those who have broken the law. That is not the case \nhere. These undocumented immigrants will have to pay a fine. They will \nhave to undergo a rigorous criminal background investigation to be sure \nwe do not have a\n\n[[Page S4534]]\n\ncriminal element subject to staying in the United States and being on \nthe citizenship track. They will have to learn English so they can \nintegrate into our society. They will have to have a job for 6 years. \nThey will then be at the end of the line.\n  When the comments are made about enforcing our borders, the first \namendment which will be offered by the proponents of the bill will be a \nborder security certification, which provides that:\n\n       The Secretary may not implement any program authorized by \n     this Act or by any amendments made under this Act which \n     grants legal status to any individual or adjusts the current \n     status of any individual who enters or entered the United \n     States in violation of Federal law unless the Secretary has \n     submitted a written certification to the President and \n     Congress that the border security measures authorized under \n     title I and the increases in Federal detention space \n     authorized under section 233 have been fully completed and \n     are operational.\n\n  Now, this certification really is directed to those who have said we \nought to have border security in place and employment sanctions in \nplace before we consider what we do with the 11 million undocumented \naliens, immigrants, or what we do on a guest worker program. Well, that \nis the cart-before-the-horse argument. This border security \ncertification puts the horse in place before we move ahead to the cart \nand I think, when implemented, as implemented, will answer that point.\n  This bill, which we are laying down today, provides very material \nitems on border enforcement. For example, it increases Border Patrol by \n400 per year for 5 years; authorizes technologies to create a so-called \nvirtual fence along the southern border; authorizes physical barriers \nfor highly trafficked parts of Arizona's border and California's \nborder, and highly trafficked parts on other borders; provides for a \nstudy of a possible new fence along the southern border; and creates \ncrimes for eluding immigration inspectors; and it ends the catch-and-\nrelease practice for other-than Mexicans.\n\n  We also have very substantial provisions on interior enforcement. It \neliminates gang members from admissibility for citizenship and deports \nthose gang members. It clarifies and strengthens alien smuggling laws \nwith increased penalties. It provides criminal penalties for various \nimmigration-related document fraud. It provides for 20 more alien \ndetention facilities, with the capacity for 10,000.\n  In title III we have employment enforcement. One of the major \nfailings of the 1986 legislation was the failure to have employment \nenforcement.\n  We have provisions for a guest worker program. We have provisions for \nfamily-based and employment-based green cards.\n  We have title VI: work authorization and legalization of undocumented \nindividuals.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, at the conclusion of my \noral remarks, the full outline of S. 2611 be printed in the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. We have created, under the work authorization and \nlegalization of undocumented individuals, three separate categories: a \ncategory for those who have been in the United States for more than 5 \nyears before April 5, 2006; a second category, category 2, for those \nwho have been in the United States for less than 5 years before January \n7, 2004, which does have a ``leave country and touch base'' \nrequirement.\n  The Senator from Nevada, the leader of the Democrats, raised his \nconcerns about this provision as to whether it ought to stay in the \nbill and said there will be amendments to remove it. It is a \ncontroversial provision. There is a real issue as to whether it \naccomplishes something which is worthwhile. But in cobbling together \nand crafting a bill, it has been necessary to put in provisions which \nare not universally accepted. And that is the nature of legislation, \nthat there are accommodations, and everyone does not get everything \nthey like. But we will subject this particular provision to very \ncareful analysis and debate, and the will of the Senate will be worked \non it.\n  There is a third category of those who entered the United States \nafter January 7 of the year 2004.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my \nstatement be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Immigration Floor Statement\n\n       Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, today the Senate resumes the \n     debate on immigration reform with S. 2611, featuring the \n     compromise that was crafted by a group of Senators shortly \n     before our last recess. This legislation will affect millions \n     of individuals and will alter America's social and economic \n     landscape. According to the Pew Hispanic Center, between 11 \n     and 12 million individuals reside in the U.S. unlawfully, and \n     illegal immigrants account for about 4.9 percent of the U.S. \n     labor force. According to the Center for American Progress, \n     the total cost to ``round up'' every illegal immigrant within \n     the United States would be $206 to $230 billion over 5 years, \n     a plan that neither is fiscally sound nor accomplishes the \n     goal of bringing the country's undocumented workers out of \n     the underground economy.\n       In 1986, President Ronald Reagan signed into law a bill \n     that instantly conferred legal resident status to millions of \n     illegal immigrants. However, the 1986 bill had several flaws. \n     Most importantly, the legislation did not include \n     comprehensive immigration reform that dealt with all facets \n     of the immigration problem. Thus, it failed to meet American \n     business's demand for increased legal immigration. We cannot \n     afford to repeat the mistake of 20 years ago. Nor can we \n     simply confer legal status to presently undocumented workers \n     without asking for something in return. Amnesty, by \n     definition, is a pardon or a free pass granted to a large \n     group of individuals without any consideration in return for \n     the amnesty granted. Requiring earned adjustments, as our \n     bill does, is not amnesty; it is a system that enables \n     undocumented immigrants, who are neither criminals nor \n     terrorists, to earn legal status and to remain productive \n     members of our society.\n       The 1986 immigration bill's failure to create a guest \n     worker program to meet the needs of our employers meant the \n     market would step in to accommodate those needs. Market \n     forces created, de facto, an ``illegal guest worker'' \n     program, whereby undocumented workers would enter the country \n     illegally in order to obtain work. Employers benefited under \n     this system because they obtained workers. Undocumented \n     workers benefited because they secured jobs. But an ``illegal \n     guest worker program'' is unacceptable. As the economic \n     motivation to come to the U.S. remains strong, we should \n     provide the avenues and incentives for U.S. employers and \n     foreign workers to only use legal channels. The bill before \n     the U.S. Senate makes it attractive for immigrants to use \n     existing legal channels rather than so-called coyotes who \n     illegally traffic foreign workers into the United States.\n       The compromise creates an earned adjustment program for \n     longer-termed undocumented individuals who have deep roots \n     within their communities. It allows for individuals who have \n     been in the United States 5 years before April 5, 2001, to \n     come out of the shadows and legalize their status. However, \n     unlike the 1986 amnesty, which only had minimum requirements, \n     our compromise has strict, objective requirements that must \n     be met in order for the individual to legalize and adjust his \n     status. The individual must undergo security and criminal \n     background checks; must not be determined to be a criminal or \n     a national security threat and deemed inadmissible; must have \n     worked a minimum of 3 of the 5 years prior to April 5, 2001; \n     and must continue to work for a minimum of 6 years after the \n     date of enactment to adjust their status to lawful permanent \n     resident. Most importantly, these individuals are required to \n     ``get in the back of the line'' and cannot adjust their \n     status to lawful permanent resident and get a green card \n     until those waiting in the queue have their opportunity to \n     receive their green card. The individual must also pay a fine \n     of $2,000, pay all applicable back taxes as well as remain \n     current liability, and must demonstrate knowledge of the \n     English language and an understanding of American history and \n     Government.\n       The compromise also creates a new status called ``Mandatory \n     Departure and Reentry'' for individuals who have been in the \n     U.S. and employed less than 5 years but before January 7, \n     2004. These individuals must come out of the shadows during \n     the 3-year period after the date of enactment and must leave \n     the U.S. and return to the country in a legal status. The \n     crux of these provisions is that it encourages undocumented \n     individuals to leave the United States and surrender their \n     status as soon as possible, without separating families and \n     without disrupting businesses. If departure occurs within the \n     first year, the individual is not subject to any fines. If \n     departure occurs within the second year, there is a $2,000 \n     penalty, and if departure occurs within the last year of the \n     program, the alien must pay a fine of $3,000. Individuals who \n     entered after January 7, 2004, must immediately depart the \n     U.S. and apply through the new visa category created in my \n     bill, the new H-2C program for temporary workers. The total \n     number of H-2C visas available will be 325,000 visas and will \n     adjust, either up or down, according to the market demands. \n     These individuals have lived in the shadows and outside the \n     protection of law for too long. As such, out of fear and \n     desperation, many are abused and discriminated\n\n[[Page S4535]]\n\n     against at the workplace and are afraid to come forward. The \n     compromise achieves the goal by allowing these individuals to \n     come forward.\n       Another flaw of the 1986 amnesty was that it did not \n     provide for realistic enforcement. S. 2611 strengthens \n     enforcement of immigration laws and provides the necessary \n     resources for effective border and interior enforcement. S. \n     2611 provides employers with the tools they need to ensure \n     their workforce is authorized, coupled with a commitment to \n     provide the resources necessary to abate the flow of illegal \n     immigrants into this country in the future.\n       The 1986 bill failed because it did not address our \n     Nation's economic need for future guest workers. Immigration \n     reform cannot only deal with the current illegal population \n     or just provide tough border enforcement measures, but must \n     also provide avenues for future immigrants to come to this \n     country to labor and to enjoy the fruits of U.S. citizenship. \n     We must require illegal aliens already in the U.S. to come \n     forward, register, and undergo the necessary background \n     checks to ensure our national security, and we must provide a \n     legal avenue for future immigration to meet the future needs \n     of our economy. As we return to the immigration debate, let \n     us not repeat the mistakes of the past but build upon the \n     growing consensus in America to allow immigration to help \n     shape our future.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have talked long enough to have noted \nthe arrival of the distinguished ranking member, who I know will \nshortly be seeking recognition. Before he does, let me repeat for him \nthe comments made by the distinguished leader of the Democrats, \ncomplimenting the work Senator Leahy has done, complimenting the work \nwhich we have done jointly generally in the Judiciary Committee, and \ncomplimenting the work especially of the Judiciary Committee on this \nimmigration bill.\n  Senator Leahy and I appeared together earlier today in a tribute to \nfallen police officers and commenting about the need for bulletproof \njackets. He and I have worked together on a great many matters, with \nour collaboration having originated before either of us got to the \nSenate at the National District Attorneys convention in Philadelphia in \n1969, when he was DA of Burlington and I was DA of Philadelphia. Our \nefforts on bipartisanship, I think, have been followed by other \nSenators, and I think it has been in the interest of the Senate and the \ncountry to have that kind of cooperation.\n  We will be handling the amendments one at a time. But we invite \nSenators who have amendments to be offered tomorrow to come to the \nfloor this afternoon to debate those amendments. The chief of staff, \nthe staff director, and general counsel, Michael O'Neill, has already \nbeen in touch with a number of those Senators, urging them to come \ndown, following the comments of the distinguished ranking member, to \nstart to talk about amendments so we can have abbreviated debate when \nwe conclude the first amendment.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n       S. 2611, The Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006\n\n\n                      title I--Border enforcement\n\n       Increases border patrol by 400 per year for 5 years \n     (Feinstein-Sessions)\n       Authorizes technologies to create a ``virtual fence'' along \n     the Southern border\n       Authorizes physical barriers for highly trafficked parts of \n     Arizona's border (Kyl)\n       Provides for a study of a possible new fence along the \n     Southern border.\n       Creates crimes for eluding immigration inspectors \n     (Sessions) and constructing border tunnels (Kyl, Feinstein)\n       Ends the ``catch and release'' practice for other-than-\n     Mexicans (Sessions)\n\n\n                     title II--Interior Enforcement\n\n       Makes suspected gang members inadmissible to, and \n     deportable from, the U.S.\n       Clarifies and strengthens alien smuggling laws and \n     increases penalties\n       Adds criminal penalties for various immigration-related \n     document fraud\n       Provides 20 more alien detention facilities with a capacity \n     of 10,000 (Sessions)\n\n  title iii--employment enforcement (subject to a Grassley substitute \n                  amendment to Title III on the Floor)\n\n       Establishes a nationwide, mandatory verification program \n     for hiring workers\n       Limits the number of acceptable hiring documents along with \n     REAL ID standards\n       Makes the standard for hiring illegal workers ``knowingly'' \n     or ``with reckless disregard''\n       Authorizes 2,000 worksite enforcement agents and 1,000 \n     anti-fraud agents\n\n\n                     Title IV--Guest worker Program\n\n        Creates a new guest worker program (called H-2C) for \n     future workers\n       Provides the following in the guest worker program:\n       6-year duration with an annual cap of 325,000\n       Travel privileges in and out of the U.S., and portability \n     between jobs\n       Allows workers to obtain green cards by self-petitioning\n       Allows students with advanced degrees in science/math to \n     stay in the U.S.\n       Exempts workers with advanced degrees in science/math from \n     green card caps\n       Increases the H-1B professional worker visa annual cap from \n     65,000 to 115,000 (with a fluctuating cap)\n\n\n         Title V--Family-based and Employment-based Green Cards\n\n                    Family-based visas/green cards:\n\n       Exempts Immediate Relatives (spouses, minor children, \n     parents) of U.S. Citizens from the 480,000 numerical cap\n       Recaptures unused green cards from past years to reduce the \n     processing backlog\n       Increases the per country limits on visas to add fairness \n     in the overall allocation\n\n\n                  Employment-based visas/green cards:\n\n       Increases the numerical cap from 140,000 to 450,000.

Mr. President, to start the debate, if I may, as I have \nreferred to earlier, I send an amendment to the desk and will ask for \nits consideration when we debate the amendment further tomorrow and \nproceed to a vote. It is an amendment that has been summarized briefly \nwhich would require border security arrangements to be in place before \nwe move ahead to the handling of the 11 million undocumented immigrants \nand the guest worker program.\n  I yield the floor for my distinguished ranking member.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate turns its attention again \nto comprehensive immigration reform. I hope we can finish the job the \nJudiciary Committee started in March and the Senate began considering \nin April. We need to fix the broken immigration system with tough \nreforms that secure our borders and with reforms that will bring \nmillions of undocumented immigrants out of the shadows.\n  I commend the majority and minority leaders for continuing to search \nfor a procedural agreement, even though Republicans blocked action on a \ncomprehensive solution by filibustering before the April recess. \nDemocrats supported the bill that was reported by the Judiciary \nCommittee, and we were willing to support the Hagel-Martinez \ncompromise. In fact, Democrats voted twice in two days for \ncomprehensive reform, but the Republican leadership refused to follow \nthe commitments it made when the cameras were on, and folded its tent \nby declining to support cloture even on the motion of the Republican \nleader.\n  I hope that when the President speaks to the Nation this evening, he \nwill strongly encourage his party to support a comprehensive bill in \nthe Senate. The President offered some helpful comments in April, but \nthese words came too late, as the far right wing of his party had \nalready undermined the potential compromise. Democrats were prepared to \npass a bill in April and are prepared to pass a fair and comprehensive \nbill now.\n  The Bush-Cheney administration has gone to great lengths to create \nthe impression that it is now committed to strengthening our border \nsecurity. The reality is that very little progress has been made. A \nrecent report concluded that the number of people apprehended at our \nborders for illegal entry fell 31 percent under President Bush's watch, \nfrom a yearly average of 1.52 million between 1996 and 2000 to 1.05 \nmillion between 2001 and 2004. The number of illegal immigrants \napprehended while in the interior of the country declined 36 percent, \nfrom a yearly average of roughly 40,000 between 1996 and 2000 to 25,901 \nbetween 2001 and 2004. Audits and fines against employers of illegal \nimmigrants have also fallen significantly since President Bush took \noffice. Given the vast increases in the number of Border Patrol Agents, \nthe decline in enforcement can only be explained by a failure of \nleadership.\n  The recent aggressive and well-publicized enforcement efforts to \ndetain illegal immigrants are little more than political posturing that \ndo little to improve the situation. We need comprehensive reform, \nbacked up by leadership committed to using the tools Congress provides, \nnot piecemeal political stunts.\n  Tonight we expect to hear that the National Guard will be deployed to \nthe Mexican border. Once again the administration turns to the fine men \nand women of the National Guard in a crisis. After our intervention \nturned sour in Iraq, the Pentagon turned to the Guard. After the \ngovernmental-wide failure in responding to Katrina, we turned to the \nGuard. Now, the administration's continual unwillingness to focus on \nour porous border and develop a comprehensive immigration policy, the \nadministration turns once again to the Guard. Yet I am continually \npuzzled that this administration, which seems so ready to take \nadvantage of the Guard, fights so vigorously against providing this \nessential force with adequate, equipment, a seat at the table in policy \ndebates--even adequate health insurance for the men and women of the \nGuard.\n  As long as these Guard units operate under the authority of State \nGovernors, I believe this action is appropriate. In addition, the \nFederal Government should pick up the full costs of such a deployment \nand be clear about the length of this service. Those costs should not \nbe foisted onto the States and their already taxed Guard units. Their \nfamilies have been called upon to sacrifice more than any other group \nof Americans. My heart goes out to the members of the Guard and their \nfamilies.\n  Controlling our borders is a national responsibility, and it is \nregrettable that so much of this duty has been punted to the States and \nnow to the Guard. The Guard is pitching in above and beyond, balancing \nits already demanding responsibilities to the States, while sending \ntroops who have been deployed to Iraq. The Guard served admirably in \nresponse to Hurricane Katrina when the Federal Government utterly \nfailed to respond in a timely or sufficient manner. The Vermont Guard \nand others have been contributing to our national security since the \nimmediate aftermath of 9/11. Later tonight, we expect the President \nwill announce that after more than 5 years of failing to use the \nauthority and funding Congress has provided to strengthen the Border \nPatrol and our border security, it has come to this, militarizing our \nsouthern border.\n  Instead of proposing a budget with robust and complete funding for \nour Border Patrol, the President has focused on providing tax cuts for \nthe wealthiest among us. Congress has had to step in time and again to \ncreate new Border Agent positions and direct that they be filled. \nInstead of urging his party to take early and decisive action to pass \ncomprehensive immigration reform as he signaled he would in February \n2001, the President began his second term campaigning to undercut the \nprotections of our Social Security system that Americans oppose. While \nthe President talks about the importance of our first responders, he \nhas proposed 67 percent cuts in the grant program that supplies \nbulletproof vests to police officers, a program that has special \nresonance today when we meet to recognize the 157 officers we lost last \nyear.\n  Five years of the Bush-Cheney administration's inaction and misplaced \npriorities have done nothing to improve our immigration situation. Its \ntime for action, not more talk. The Senate just passed an emergency \nsupplemental appropriations bill that includes nearly $2 billion for \nborder security. These are important programs and we all support them, \nalthough a number of us believe the Democratic leader was right to \noffer them without taking the funds from our troops' needs in Iraq.\n  Border security alone is not enough to solve our immigration \nproblems. We must pass a bill--and enact a law--that will not only \nstrengthen the security along our borders, but which will also \nencourage millions of people to come out of the shadows. When this is \naccomplished we will be more secure because we will know who is living \nand working in the United States. We must encourage the undocumented to \ncome forward, undergo background checks, and pay taxes to earn a place \non the path to citizenship.\n  Just a few weeks ago I went to the White House with a bipartisan \ndelegation of Senators to speak with the President. The need for a fair \nand comprehensive immigration bill was the consensus at that meeting \nand I believe the President was sincere when he told us that we had his \nsupport. I hope he will include that commitment in his statement to the \nnation tonight. If not, I trust that he will not wait to urge \ncomprehensive immigration reform on those Republican Senators and the \nRepublican House leadership who have yet to endorse our bipartisan \ncomprehensive approach. Without Republican support and the intervention \nof the President with the recalcitrant factions within his party, this \neffort is unlikely to be successful and the hopes of millions will be \ndestroyed. Those who have peacefully demonstrated their dedication to \njustice and comprehensive immigration reform should not be relegated \nback into the shadows.\n  The bill that won the bipartisan support of a majority of the \nJudiciary Committee was a compromise that contained the essential \ncomponents that are required for comprehensive\n\n[[Page S4537]]\n\nimmigration reform. Before the last recess, I was willing to support a \nfurther compromise that incorporated the principles of the Hagel-\nMartinez bill because it was proposed by the majority leader as a \n``breakthrough'' that would allow us to pass immigration reform.\n  Immigration reform must be comprehensive if it is to lead to real \nsecurity and real reform. Enforcement-only measures may sound tough, \nbut they are insufficient. In these next 2 weeks, the Senate has an \nopportunity, and a responsibility, to pass a bill that addresses our \nbroken system with comprehensive reform and puts the pieces in place to \nsecure the Nation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3961\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Isakson, I call up \namendment No. 3961, which was earlier sent to the desk by Senator \nSpecter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Cornyn], for Mr. Isakson, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3961.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit the granting of legal status, or adjustment of \n  current status, to any individual who enters or entered the United \nStates in violation of Federal law unless the border security measures \nauthorized under Title I and section 233 are fully completed and fully \n                              operational)\n\n       On page 53, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 133. BORDER SECURITY CERTIFICATION.\n\n       The Secretary may not implement any program authorized by \n     this Act, or by amendments made under this Act, which grants \n     legal status to any individual, or adjusts the current status \n     of any individual, who enters or entered the United States in \n     violation of Federal law unless the Secretary has submitted a \n     written certification to the President and Congress that the \n     border security measures authorized under Title I and the \n     increases in Federal detention space authorized under section \n     233 have been fully completed and are fully operational.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and send another amendment to the desk on behalf of \nSenator Kyl.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, what was the request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator restate his request?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment and send another amendment to the desk on behalf of Senator \nKyl and myself, and I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I don't think this is in keeping with what \nI understand the distinguished Republican leader and the distinguished \nDemocratic leader had discussed as a procedure, nor discussed by the \nchairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. So I will, for the moment, \nobject until such time as we can figure out what is it they want. I \ncame in late on the earlier agreement, but I want to make sure the \nSenator from Texas is following what the two leaders had proposed. So I \nwill object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, about a month ago when we were debating \nimmigration reform and, unfortunately, because of the inability to get \namendments heard and debated and voted on, that process was derailed, \nand here we are again. I was under the distinct impression that we were \nactually going to have a chance to offer amendments and then have \ndebates and votes. We will work out whatever the misunderstanding is \nbetween the sides. But my hope is that we will have that opportunity \nbecause I think the American people are yearning for an honest and \ncomplete and comprehensive debate about this issue. It affects all of \nus. It affects all of the States that each of us as Senators represent, \nand it represents a clash of our values. We are proudly a nation of \nimmigrants, but we are also a nation of laws. Unfortunately, it is hard \nto reconcile the second ideal as a nation of laws with the current \nsituation we see in this country with our porous border which last year \nallowed 1.1 million people to come across the border, and because we \nonly had about 2,000 detention beds, most of those individuals were \nsimply subject to what has now become known as the notorious catch-and-\nrelease program. And those who were sent back to Mexico came back again \nin short order, and we saw roughly 250,000 of those individuals who \nwere detained at the border came from countries other than Mexico, \nincluding countries such as Syria, Iran, and other countries of special \ninterest, which cause a lot of people, including me, an awful lot of \nconcern because it is indicative of the fact that our southern border \nhas become a magnet and has become a sieve for illegal immigration, not \njust from Mexico and Central and South America but literally from \ncountries all around the world.\n  I support comprehensive immigration reform, as a Senator from Texas. \nWith about a 1,600-mile border, we understand what the border is about. \nA number of Senators have had the opportunity since this debate began \nto go to the border. I think that has been very instructive for all of \nthem. But I can tell you that my constituents live and work along the \nborder and have come to know both the tremendous benefits of that \nregion of our country and the culture that transcends international \nboundaries, the fact that families have relatives on both sides of the \nborder, the fact that for the last 11 years, since NAFTA, the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement, was signed by the United States, Canada, \nand Mexico, we have seen a tremendous growth in legal commerce and \ntraffic across the border that has been enormously beneficial to all of \nthose countries and created an awful lot of new jobs in my State.\n  None of us want to jeopardize all of the benefits that attend to the \nfact that we do have a neighbor to our immediate south, Mexico, and the \nbenefits that come from the cultural heritage and interaction, but the \nfact is that illegal immigration across the southern border of the \nUnited States has changed dramatically over the last few years because \nMexico has been unable to control its southern border and, in fact, has \nbecome a sort of a land bridge into the United States and created a \ntremendous amount of concern, as it should, in a post-9/11 world. We \nsimply have to know who is coming into our country and why they are \nhere. We can no longer assume their motives are simply benign.\n  I have no doubt that in most instances--perhaps nearly all \ninstances--people come to this country for the same reason people have \nalways come to America, and that is for a better life. We all \nunderstand that on a fundamentally human level. But we also understand \nthat if we don't control our immigration system, if we don't control \nour borders, not only are we less secure, but literally our way of life \nmay be subjected to a huge tsunami of humanity, people from all over \nthe world who want to come to the United States, but if they don't do \nso in a controlled way, in a way that complies with our laws and allows \nus to regulate the flow in the pursuit of our national interest, that \nwe will have lost something very important, and part of that will be \nthe opportunity to provide the sort of prosperity we enjoy today to our \nchildren and our grandchildren.\n\n  My hope is we will create a legal system of immigration that we will \nbe able to regard with pride and that people who, as they always have, \ncome here from all around the world through a legal system of \nimmigration will become Americans. After all, becoming an American is \nan idea and an ideal. In other words, it doesn't matter where your \ncountry of origin is, where you were born. It doesn't matter how you \npronounce your last name. It doesn't matter what race you are or what \nethnicity you are. When people come to America and become Americans, \nthey become part of this vast melting pot which we thank God for every \nday and which has become the envy of the world.\n  We have benefited enormously from the fact that we are a nation of \nimmigrants, but we are in danger because we are no longer a nation of \nlaws when it comes to our immigration system.\n  During the course of this debate, I will be offering several \namendments. I want to talk about one of them in a moment. Because of \nthe objection, we won't be offering any additional\n\n[[Page S4538]]\n\namendments today until we can work out the differences between the \nmajority and minority side.\n  As the chairman of the Immigration and Border Security and \nCitizenship Subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee, it has been \nmy great honor to preside over a number of hearings on our broken \nimmigration system. That has both caused me a great deal of concern but \nalso a sense that there is a lot we can do if we focus on answering the \npractical questions that need to be answered before we can actually fix \nour broken immigration system.\n  The Judiciary Committee voted out a bill that I think is fair to say \nbears the authorship of Senator McCain and Senator Kennedy. That then \ncame to the floor and now has been amended by Senator Hagel and Senator \nMartinez and is supported by a bipartisan group of Senators.\n  I am sorry to say at this point that I am not able to support that \nbill, as amended, but it is my hope that after this debate and during \nthe course of the amendment process that we have votes, and hopefully I \nwill be able to win a few of those votes on amendments that will \nimprove the bill to the point where I feel comfortable supporting the \nSenate bill. That is my hope.\n  Regardless, I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues and \nour colleagues from the House once the Senate passes a bill, assuming \nwe are successful in doing so, in trying to reconcile the differences \nin the approach the Senate intends to take in comprehensive reform and \nthe House approach, which is primarily a border security bill.\n  I am proud to say that this bill, when I talk about comprehensive \nreform, has a number of components. I mentioned the first is border \nsecurity. I am proud to say that the bill Senator Kyl of Arizona and I \nfiled about a year ago now has been largely incorporated into the bill \nbefore us. When it comes to the work we need to perform for security \nalong our border, we need to vastly increase the number of Border \nPatrol agents.\n  I understand the President tonight may make some announcement with \nregard to the use of National Guard on a temporary basis to fill in the \ngaps and provide additional boots on the ground so we can get to that \nlevel of security faster, and I believe we should use all of our \nnational assets to provide border security. But I also had the honor \nthis morning of going out to Fort Belvoir, where the Army Materiel \nCommand provided a demonstration to me with some of the unmanned aerial \nvehicles and ground sensors, the radars, the thermal imagery, and so \nforth, that the military has developed for force protection. It has \nobvious applications in providing the Department of Homeland Security \nadditional technology which will allow us to secure our border. Here \nagain, the problem is not a shortage of ideas; the problem is the \nshortage of assets, including human assets and technological assets \nthat will actually allow the Department of Homeland Security to \naccomplish the goal of border security. We have a long way to go \nbetween ideas and concepts and actually building the infrastructure, \nactually purchasing the technology and training people to operate it.\n\n  That is one reason I look forward to further debate on Senator \nIsakson's amendment currently pending that provides a trigger. In \nessence it is saying the rest of the provisions of the bill will not be \nimplemented until such time as the Secretary of the Department of \nHomeland Security certifies that the border security provisions have, \nin fact, been implemented. I think that is a significant proposal.\n  I commend to my colleagues an article that I read this morning called \n``Can Immigration Reform Work?'' This is an article written by Lawrence \nB. Lindsey, who was the former chief economic adviser for President \nBush. Mr. Lindsey writes as an advocate of comprehensive immigration \nreform, as am I, but he asks some very practical questions which I \nthink have to be answered during the course of this debate.\n  First of all, advocates of the current bill pending on the floor \nacknowledge that beneficiaries of the provisions of the bill, the 12 \nmillion or so who will benefit from the earned legalization--or some \nmight call it amnesty based on its similarity with the amnesty of \n1986--but the argument is that the beneficiaries of this provision of \nthe bill will have to go to the back of the line. Again, I commend the \nLindsey article to my colleagues.\n  The question is: The back of which line? Basically what this bill \ndoes is it allows people who are currently here in an unauthorized \nstatus; that is, they have come either in violation of the immigration \nlaws or they have come here legally and have overstayed in violation of \nthe immigration laws, it allows them 6 years before they can then \nreceive a green card. A green card confers legal permanent residency. \nAfter 5 more years, in other words, a total of 11 years, they can then \napply for and receive American citizenship.\n  The problem with the current bill on the floor is that it essentially \nguarantees the 12 million a green card and all they have to do is stay \nwhere they are. In other words, the line does not start in America; the \nline starts at the consulate in Hong Kong or in Mexico City or in \nBogota, Colombia, or in some other place around the world where people \nwould apply for a green card, not here in the United States. What they \nare essentially saying is people under this current bill can break in \nline in front of those who have been waiting patiently outside the \ncountry, but break in line for those awaiting citizenship who otherwise \nwould have to wait outside the country. There is something, it seems to \nme, fundamentally unfair about line-jumping, about breaking in line, \nand many have expressed concerns, and I am one of those who have the \nconcerns, about rewarding people for line-jumping.\n  Another aspect of Mr. Lindsey's article, which I again commend to my \ncolleagues because, again, these are practical questions: How are you \ngoing to solve this problem? And I stand here as someone who is \ninterested in solving the problem and as a supporter of comprehensive \nimmigration reform. But we have to do better than the bill that is \ncurrently on the floor. That is why I strongly urge my colleagues to \nstudy it and also to listen to the amendments, and hopefully we can \nimprove it.\n  The other question that Mr. Lindsey raises is the sheer immensity of \nthe program proposed in the Hagel-Martinez compromise. In 2004, the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service issued almost 1 million green \ncards and naturalized 537,000 people. Contrast that with what this bill \nwould do. It would give green cards to about 12 million people in one \nfell swoop and make them eligible for citizenship 6 years later, which \nis roughly a twelvefold increase in the workload of the agencies and \nthe people who are actually supposed to make this work.\n  I hope all of us will pay close attention to whether this thing that \nwe are creating, this comprehensive immigration reform, can actually \nwork. Part of making it work is going to be making sure there are the \npeople and the processes, the databases, the computers, the cards, all \nof the things that are going to be necessary to actually make it \nfunction as intended. If not, we are going to be swamped by a tsunami \nof newly legalized people seeking documentation without any real \nability to actually respond to that.\n  The third issue he raises is the need for what he calls a certificate \nof legal residency. We are going to have to--and the bill does provide, \nand there will be some additional debate about this--a work site \nverification program, which is absolutely critical to the functioning \nof comprehensive immigration reform. I think it needs to be beefed up \nand improved because what we need to provide employers is a way to \nswipe a card through a card reader and then almost immediately the \nlight turns green and that means that person can work here legally. If \nit is red, they can't. Right now, employers can be presented some \ncombination of up to 19 different documents to prove eligibility to \nwork in the United States, and what happens is the human smugglers and \nthose who benefit from this phenomenon provide a whole host of \ncounterfeit documents.\n\n  In other words, there are millions who generate fake documents such \nas driver's licenses, Social Security cards, and birth certificates. So \nwe need a secure identification card that can help us as part of this \nenforcement regime because if we don't, then we will find ourselves 5 \nyears or 10 years from now\n\n[[Page S4539]]\n\nin the same fix we are in today, except probably worse.\n  I say that because in 1986 the Congress thought it was fixing this \nproblem once and for all when it granted what everyone acknowledges was \nan amnesty. It bears a lot of resemblance to the proposal that is on \nthe floor today. Yet some say: Well, it is not really amnesty, it is \nearned legalization. Well, whatever it is, it looks very similar, if \nnot its identical twin. But everyone I think will agree that the \namnesty in 1986 was a complete and total failure, probably for one of \ntwo reasons.\n  Some say: Well, it is because we didn't really have any provision for \na legal work force, a temporary worker program as part of that. But I \nthink most people would agree that it was mainly a failure of work site \nverification and employer sanctions. There have been virtually no \nemployer sanctions prosecuted by the Federal officials responsible for \nthat, and part of the reason has been because it is very hard for \nemployers to know whether the person they are in fact hiring is legally \neligible to work in the United States.\n  We can figure this one out. It is not rocket science. If we can go \ninto a convenience store and buy a bag of chips and a Coca Cola and \nhand the clerk our card and they swipe it and in a matter of seconds it \nis authorized, we can figure this one out. We have a variety of \nidentification cards and biometric identifiers to help verify that the \nperson who holds the card is in fact the same person whose name is on \nthe card. So we can figure that out. I will talk more about that later.\n  I think the proponents of this bill as written need to convince the \nAmerican people that this time we are serious, that we are not going to \npull the rug out from under the American people if they put their \nconfidence in the solution proffered by this bill. I remember what my \ndad always said: Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on \nme. The American people can be enormously forgiving and tolerant. But \nif they feel as if the Federal Government is simply not serious about \nthis and is going to pan this bill off as strict on enforcement and not \nfund it and not implement it, and not be serious about it, I think \nthere is going to be a terrible price to be paid. Unfortunately, it \nwill be deserved if we are not serious about doing what we say we are \ngoing to do when it comes to enforcement, including work site \nverification.\n  I want to talk briefly about an amendment I tried to offer, but there \nwas an objection. Hopefully, we will work this out. This was actually \nthe amendment that was pending by Senator Kyl and myself back about a \nmonth ago when this whole debate got derailed because we couldn't get \nany votes on the amendments and basically we ended up going nowhere. \nAfter a month now, we are back here again. Hopefully, we are locked and \nloaded and ready to proceed in the regular order, which means that in \nthe world's greatest deliberative body we will actually have debates \nand we will actually have votes and majorities will prevail and people \nwho don't get the majority vote will lose. While none of us likes to \nlose, that is the process, and that should be the process.\n  Unfortunately, we are here a month later, but now I hope we have an \nopportunity to have those debates and to have those votes and to \nproceed to passage of a good bill.\n  The amendment I am referring to specifically would exclude from the \nbenefits of the bill on the floor--and what I mean by that is the 12 \nmillion people who are here in an unauthorized status, who either came \nillegally or who overstayed their legal authorization; they are here in \nviolation of our immigration laws. It would exclude from amnesty or \nearned legalization or whatever you want to call it the benefits for \nconvicted felons. In other words, convicted felons would not get \namnesty under this bill if this amendment passes. People who have \ncommitted at least three misdemeanors would not get amnesty under this \nbill if this amendment is agreed to and passes. Finally, it would \nexclude the benefits of the bill to those it applies to, those who have \nactually had their day in court and lost and simply melted into this \nhuge American landscape.\n  What I mean by that is they are absconders. In other words, they are \npeople who have been caught in violation of the law, people who have \nhad their day in court, who have exhausted their remedies, and then \nrefused to show up when it came time to go back home. These are known \nas absconders.\n  What this amendment would do is say, if you are an absconder, then \nyou don't get the benefit of the amnesty because you have already had \nyour one bite at the apple, and we are not going to give you two bites \nat the apple. I don't think any Americans really believe that it is \njust OK to ignore a lawful court order. How many Americans, for \nexample, after receiving a subpoena to show up in court or maybe a jury \nsummons, simply ignore it and skip the date?\n  Today in the United States, there are 544,000--544,000--aliens who \nhave been ordered deported but then have gone underground. That is more \nthan a half million people who simply chose to ignore a lawful court \norder. Under current law, it is a felony offense punishable by up to 4 \nyears in jail to not comply with a deportation order. So let's be \nclear. We are not talking about civil violations. We are talking about \ncriminals, people who not only have overstayed their legal \nauthorization or who have come in illegally and been caught; we are \ntalking about people who have had their day in court and simply ignored \nthe judgment of the court and gone underground.\n  I believe this amendment is indicative of whether we will continue to \ntolerate and reward those who violate our immigration laws.\n  The current bill increases penalties and would impose a mandatory \nminimum criminal sentence of 6 months on any alien who fails to leave \nthe country after being ordered deported.\n  The current bill requires the Department of Homeland Security to list \nabsconders in the NCIC, the national database, criminal database, so \nthat State and local police officers can arrest them when they are \nencountered during regular traffic stops.\n  These are both steps in the right direction, I believe. But then, \noddly in the same bill, the same proposal on the floor, it would allow \nthose same individuals to apply for legalization and would prohibit the \nDepartment of Homeland Security from apprehending or detaining these \nsame aliens. In other words, this bill simultaneously increases \ncriminal penalties for failing to follow a court order but then rewards \nthe same criminal act with an easier path to a green card. I do not \nthink there is a better example of Congress sending mixed signals on \nimmigration reform. If we are going to avoid the mistakes of 1986 and \navoid the massive buildup of people who are in our country out of \nstatus, we have to create a system that encourages self-compliance by \nillegal aliens.\n  Each year, there are 300,000 deportation hearings. What is the point \nof conducting those hearings if those who are ultimately ordered \ndeported after they have had their day in court simply go underground \nand ignore a lawful court order? If the absconder rate is about 85 \npercent today, what will it be in the future if we reward those who \nfail to comply with amnesty? The aliens who comply and who leave the \ncountry would not be eligible for amnesty. So the message, at least so \nfar as the bill on the floor is concerned, is you are better off \nviolating the law, hunkering down, melting into the landscape, and then \nyou are going to get amnesty. But if you actually comply with a lawful \ncourt order and leave, then you are not entitled to the benefits under \nthe bill--exactly the opposite of the message we ought to be sending. \nWe need to decide whether we are more interested in granting amnesty \nthan we are in reforming the immigration laws and restoring confidence \nin the immigration system.\n  Without this amendment, the current bill would grant amnesty to \naliens who committed felony offenses, thereby encouraging further \nviolations of immigration and undermining the integrity of our \nimmigration court system.\n  Some may argue that the majority of aliens deported never receive \nnotice that they are in proceedings. That is simply not true. \nDeportation proceedings are initiated when written notice is provided \nto the alien, which is almost always done when that individual is \napprehended. The notice, informally called a notice to appear, advises \nthe recipient of three things: No.\n\n[[Page S4540]]\n\n1, the conduct alleged to be in violation of the law; No. 2, the \nalien's obligation to provide the Government with a written record of \nan address; and No. 3, the consequences of failure to provide or update \nthe address on record with the Government.\n  The Government is also required by statute to provide notice to the \nalien of any change or postponement of the proceedings. Just as in any \nother civil or criminal proceeding, the alien has an obligation to \nprovide a current address. If that were not the case, how would the \nimmigration courts administer the 300,000-plus cases they hear each \nyear?\n  So what happens if the alien fails to appear at the hearing? The \ncourt may order the alien removed in absentia only if the Government \nestablishes by clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence that the \nwritten notice was provided to the alien and that the alien is, in \nfact, deportable. The court may rescind the order if, within 6 months \nof the order, the alien establishes that he did not receive notice of \nthe hearing or if exceptional circumstances prevented the alien from \nappearing. This amendment we are offering--will offer when permitted--\nincludes the same waiver standard, so any alien who establishes that he \nor she did not receive notice as required or was unable to appear at a \nhearing because of a medical emergency or other exceptional \ncircumstance remains eligible to apply.\n  The text of the amendment is unambiguous. It would not apply to any \nalien who entered without inspection, overstayed a visa, or violated \ntheir visa status unless the alien has had his or her day in court and \nbeen ordered deported. To avoid any confusion, this amendment uses the \nexact language as in the current Immigration and Nationality Act.\n  In conclusion, let me say that national security demands that we know \nwho is living within our borders, especially since 9/11. We must reform \nour immigration laws in order to bring millions of those who are living \noutside of the law out of the shadows and in compliance with that law. \nBut success of immigration reform cannot be measured solely on how many \naliens obtain legal status. The 1986 amnesty bill brought millions of \nillegal aliens out of shadows. Yet Congress never lived up to its \ncommitment to enforce the law at the border and at the worksite. Today, \n20 years since the 1986 amnesty, the continued failure to enforce the \nlaw has resulted in a new class of illegal aliens that is estimated to \nbe approximately 12 million. That is four times larger than 20 years \nago.\n  I share the goal of comprehensive reform and of bringing those 12 \nmillion illegal aliens out of the shadows and into compliance with the \nlaw. In fact, I believe we ought to give them a second chance to \nreenter the country in a legal status. But I also believe that we \nshould not repeat the failures of 1986 and restore credibility and law \nand order to the immigration system. The current bill, without any \namendment, rewards criminal behavior and will undermine the \nGovernment's ability to enforce the immigration laws. My amendment, \nwhich only excludes criminals from obtaining legal status, will reveal \nwhether we are really serious about reforming our immigration laws or \nif we are strictly interested in granting legal status to as many \nillegal aliens as possible, irrespective of whether they are criminals \nor whether rewarding them would repeat the failures of 1986.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The Senator from Massachusetts \nis recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome the start of this week and the \nprospect of a good and fair debate on the whole issue of our borders \nand how we are going to deal with immigration reform. There are some \nexceedingly important public policy issues and questions that have to \nbe decided. But it certainly appears that the Senate itself is prepared \nto take votes on these measures. I believe that is certainly the way we \nought to proceed.\n  I hope as we start the debate we understand there are a lot of \nmisstatements about the different positions which have been outlined in \nthe course of this debate. It is going to be important for the American \npeople to listen to those of us who are putting forward proposals--I \nwill outline briefly the proposal of Senator McCain and myself--and \nthen to listen to those who are supportive of those proposals. In this \ndebate, not unlike other debates, we will find those who misrepresent \nour proposal, distort our proposal, and then differ with it. That is a \nrather tried, true, tested process around here. Why should I believe \nthis debate might be different? Maybe that is hoping for too much.\n  These are tough enough choices and decisions for this body to make. \nHopefully we will have the opportunity to have a fair debate on the \nsubstance of these matters. That is certainly what I look forward to. I \nknow Senator McCain looks forward to that. That is certainly in the \ntradition of this great legislative body.\n  I will take just a few minutes this afternoon to outline in broad \nterms the proposal Senator McCain and I supported. We go back, Senator \nMcCain and I.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from Massachusetts yield briefly?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am glad to yield for a question.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, through the Chair--the Senator, because of \nairplane connections today, wasn't here. I made a statement on this \nlegislation. One of the things I want to make sure the Senator from \nMassachusetts understands is that I completed my statement this morning \nsaying that I hope we can have bipartisan, good debate on this \nlegislation; this legislation is so badly needed.\n  I also want the Senator from Massachusetts to understand that as far \nas I am concerned, the key to our having been able to move forward on \nthis legislation is the work done by the Democratic Senator from the \nState of Massachusetts, the senior Senator from Massachusetts, and the \nRepublican Senator from Arizona, the senior Senator from Arizona. The \nKennedy-McCain legislation is the framework for doing something to \nsolve a problem that needs to be solved. I hope we can move forward on \nthis matter in a bipartisan, constructive way.\n  I said this morning there are strong feelings on all sides of this \nissue, as there should be. But I hope the Senator from Massachusetts \nagrees with me that it is imperative that this legislation be completed \nand that--the Senator, being the modest person he is, would not agree \nwith me about the importance of the Kennedy-McCain bill--but I want the \nSenator to know that I believe the key to our moving forward was the \nwork done on this matter in many private meetings, some public \nmeetings, with you and the Senator from Arizona. I want to compliment \nand applaud you for the work done, making it possible to be at the \npoint we are in this legislation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank our leader, Senator Reid, for \nboth his support and encouragement, working with Senator Frist to bring \nus to this point. That was a real challenge.\n  I thank him for his comments. If he will remain on the floor for just \na moment? I am very hopeful that, as he outlined in his statement, we \nwill have a bipartisan approach to an issue of enormous importance--the \nsecurity of our borders. How are we going to treat the 12 million \nindividuals who are here now, the overwhelming majority of whom want to \nplay by the rules, work hard, be part of the American process and \ndream, like the tradition of so many other immigrant groups? We have \ntough enforcement issues. We have issues of fairness. And I thank the \nSenator for his comments.\n  The Senator knows the history of this institution. To find the type \nof bipartisanship which we have had on this issue, we would have to go \nback, frankly, to almost the time of the civil rights laws. Maybe the \naction to end the war in Vietnam. We have not had that kind of \nbipartisanship in a major policy issue that I know of in any recent \ntime.\n  As the Senator from Nevada has pointed out, we are facing an issue of \nenormous importance with regard to our national security. This is a \ndefining issue of who will eventually have that great opportunity of \nparticipating as an American citizen, really the greatest achievement, \nin personal terms, for so many people who earn that citizenship. We are \nback for a few moments to a time when the Senate of the United States, \nRepublicans and Democrats, came together to take action on a \ncontroversial and difficult\n\n[[Page S4541]]\n\nissue but one that was clearly in the national interest.\n  I think the comments of the Senator remind us of that tradition. That \nis what this institution has done when it has been at its best. We did \nit with Medicare. We did it with civil rights. We did it on the issues \nof ending the war. We did it with the progress we have made on \ndisability issues, knocking down the walls of disability and gender. On \nall of these issues, we came together. We had strong bipartisan \nmajorities on them. That is not something we have seen very much of, I \nwould say, in very recent times. We have that opportunity now.\n  As I hear the Senator, he is calling on us to really try to make sure \nthat this institution is going to act in its great traditions and make \nsomething worthy of remembering. I think that is what I hear from the \nSenator, and I thank him for that expression.\n  As I was saying, I thank our leaders for bringing us to where we are. \nI am grateful for the opportunity of working with Senator McCain to \nbring forward this reform bill and for the work Senator Hagel, Senator \nMartinez, and so many others have brought us to this point. As we have \ntalked about at other times, 2\\1/2\\ years ago I had legislation, and \nSenator McCain had legislation maybe 2\\1/2\\ years ago. We began to come \ntogether. About that time, Senator Hagel had legislation, somewhat \ndifferent from that of Senator McCain and me. They are all working to \ntry to come together in a common spirit to address this issue.\n\n  What we now have is something that has come out of our Judiciary \nCommittee with a 12-to-6 bipartisan vote. We have now before the Senate \nstrong legislation that will deal with our national security concerns \nand also deal with the issue of earned--and we mean earned--\nlegalization and tough enforcement at the workplace.\n  I think we have a good combination. I am very grateful to all those \nwho have been a part of this process. So many have added so much to \nhelp get us where we are today.\n  We recall that throughout our history courageous immigrants have \nprovided the hard work, the strong family, and the love of country \nwhich defines the American spirit. They dug our canals, built our \nrailroads, they advanced our science, fostered our innovation, and they \nfought in our wars. And 60,000 have served our colors with pride in \nIraq and Afghanistan.\n  Those are the permanent resident aliens that are in the service in \nIraq and Afghanistan--and other places around the world. They became \npart of the American dream.\n  Immigrants have been the heart and muscle that has moved this country \nforward for 400 years and helped make America the envy of the world.\n  Last month, we were reminded, in a personal way, of the contributions \nof immigrants by the moving stories related by Senator Domenici and \nSenator Martinez. Senator Domenici told how his parents came here from \nItaly with nothing. His father earned his citizenship through his \nservice in the Army in the first World War. His mother was here for \nmany years before gaining her legal status and once faced deportation \nbut later became an American citizen. The Domenici's worked hard, \nlearned English, built a successful grocery business and one of their \nchildren went on to become a distinguished and respected Senator.\n  Senator Martinez of Florida told us about his family's flight from \nCuba to begin a new life in America. A young Martinez was 15 years old \nwhen his family escaped from Cuba to seek a new life of freedom. And \nsimilar to millions before him, his family worked hard, learned \nEnglish, and earned their success in Florida. Today, Mel Martinez was \nnot only a Cabinet Secretary but was elected by the people of Florida \nto serve as their Senator.\n  This is the immigrant story.\n  We are a great people because that story has been repeated millions \nof times over many generations.\n  As in the past, today's immigrants are tomorrow's Americans, \nregardless of where they came from or how they got here. They and their \nchildren and grandchildren will contribute anew to our national life.\n  I have mentioned that from my office in the JFK Building in Boston, I \ncan look out the window and see the pier where my great-grandparents \nlanded from Ireland in 1848--and the stairs they walked up too. The \nimmigrants called them the ``golden stairs'' because it offered the \ngolden hope of opportunity for them. I can look out the window and see \nthose same eight stairs where all of them walked up and entered Boston \nto begin their lives and begin earning their American citizenship.\n  It is something that is not in our remote past. Every American knows \nhow our immigration system is currently broken. It falls short of \nmeeting our security needs and strengthening our economy, upholding our \nvalues--and what we have tried in the past no longer works today.\n  We have heard already the issue--Well, we already had amnesty in \n1986, and it didn't help us because we didn't have enforcement. But \nthis bill is not amnesty. Amnesty was in 1986, when we said we forgive \nyou--and we were also supposed to have effective enforcement by \nemployers. They were to take those not provided with amnesty and to \nenforce the law. That was never done under Republican or Democratic \nadministrations. But we are not talking about that now.\n  We are talking about an entirely different situation.\n  There was a time when oceans and borders protected us and enabled us \nto better control immigration. That is no longer the case today. In the \npast decade, we have spent more than $20 billion to triple our border \npatrols and build fences. But we have learned that border enforcement \nalone will not work. Building fences and putting more agents on the \nborder is doomed to fail. It is a strategy that will make us weaker, \nnot stronger, in dealing with immigration.\n  Ten years ago we had 40,000 individuals coming across the border \nillegally. We have spent $20 billion, and we have tripled the number of \nborder agents. We added $10 billion more in terms of border security, \nand now we have more than 400,000 individuals crossing illegally. You \ncan estimate. Some will say it is 600,000 or 700,000. Border security \nenforcement in and of itself will not work.\n  We need an immigration program for the 21st century that is worthy of \nour heritage as a nation of immigrants--one that is tough, smart and \nfair; one that sees to our security and reflects our humanity.\n  I believe the compromise legislation before us meets that test.\n  It is four parts.\n  First, it mandates very tough enforcement. It doubles our Border \nPatrol; builds fences and barriers along the border, and requires \nstate-of-the-art technology in fighting illegal immigration. It \nincreases enforcement against employers who hire undocumented workers, \nand requires tamper-proof immigration documents so that employers can \ndetermine who can and cannot work in America.\n  It fully implements a system for keeping track who comes to our \ncountry and when they leave. It establishes new penalties against \ndigging tunnels under the border and for evading immigration officials. \nIt sets up a massive new effort to shut down criminal syndicates that \nsmuggle immigrants into the country. It expands the capacity of our \nimmigration detention facilities and grants new authority to detain \ndangerous immigrants. It provides vast new authorities to identify and \nremove terrorists and criminals.\n  In the area of border enforcement, those needs are self-evident. We \nare talking specifically about the border with 12,000 new Border Patrol \nagents, 2,000 more than were actually requested in the 9/11 Commission. \nIt creates the high-technology ``virtual fence.'' This is key. Using \nnewer kinds of technology for a ``virtual fence.''\n  I think it is vastly more effective than putting a chain fence along \n1,800 miles of border.\n  It expands the exit-entry security system at land borders and \nairports so we can know people coming in and when they leave. We can do \nthat more effectively.\n  It deals with records and vehicle barriers. It authorizes permanent \nhighway check points near the border. It authorizes the additional \nports of entry along the land borders and new criminal penalties for \ntunnels.\n\n  This is a problem in southern California as Senator Feinstein pointed \nout.\n\n[[Page S4542]]\n\n  They have a new land and water surveillance plan at present time. It \ncan be expanded and has been effective to secure Mexico's southern \nborders.\n  Ours is the only plan that recognizes that, if you are going to be \neffective, you have to also deal with the countries in Central America \nand deal with the challenges that we are facing from individuals in \nSouth America coming across.\n  We have to work with Mexico in an effective way to limit the number \nof people coming into Mexico, and also more effective in terms of the \npeople coming into Central America--and to do that in ways that work, \nwith the cooperation of those countries. We can do that.\n  It also deals with the alien smuggling and requires the additional \ntime for detention.\n  That is one aspect of what we have at the border.\n  Another one is interior, and we have worksites.\n  Those are the three elements of enforcement.\n  We deal with money laundering.\n  We provide for fraud-proof immigration documents with biometrics.\n  Unless you effectively deal with documents, you are never going to \nget a handle on the constant fraudulent production of documents. We are \ndoing that with biometrics. That is going to be enormously effective. \nIt is the technology.\n  We have the new border fences and the other elements in terms of \ninterior.\n  This is the result of a good many hours we spent in the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  The third aspect of enforcement is in the workforce. We have added \n10,000 worksite inspectors.\n  The fact is we have not had inspection of worksites, as I mentioned, \nunder either Republican or Democratic administrations. They have been a \njoke. Therefore, employers have hired undocumented, and illegal \nworkers, with all kinds of implications--driving wages down, work \nconditions down, exploitation of these individuals, all of that.\n  That will be ultimately changed because we have effective \nenforcement.\n  We have a process by which we are going to insist on valid \ndocumentation.\n  These are the various kinds of provisions. They are all outlined in \nthe legislation. I think they are enormously compelling.\n  These are some of the new enforcement tools that our bill provides. \nThese steps alone are not enough.\n  Therefore, the second step in our bill acknowledges that the 11 \nmillion undocumented immigrants who are already here are not going \naway. But they also have something to offer to our communities and to \nour country. Common sense says we cannot and should not embark on a \nmassive deportation program. That would disrupt communities and \nbusinesses and it would uproot families.\n  What are you going to do when there are children who are citizens? \nAre we going to deport their parents because they are undocumented? \nThere is a whole host of families like that. That would disrupt \nfamilies. And cost money. Of course, the best estimate is some $240 \nbillion, requiring a caravan of buses stretching from Alaska all the \nway through California. Instead, we should recognize the desire of \nthese immigrants to contribute to America.\n  Our bill provides a means for them to earn the privilege of American \ncitizenship. It is not amnesty. Amnesty means forgiveness. Amnesty \nmeans going ahead of the line. No one goes to the head of the line. \nThey go to the back of the line. They do not only go to the back of \nline for current applicants, but they go to the back of the line for \neveryone who is in line today. They go to the back of the line in terms \nof their ability to adjust their status. They have to pay the penalty. \nThey have to learn English. They have to demonstrate that they have no \ncriminal activities. And they have to demonstrate that they are \nworking.\n  The fastest they can be able to earn their citizenship is 11 years. \nThey have to demonstrate that they are learning English. They are \nplaying by the rules; they are in no trouble with the law; they pay the \npenalty at the beginning and another penalty at the end.\n  They have that opportunity of going to the back of the line, and at \nthe end of 11 years, they have the opportunity of becoming citizens.\n  That is not what we will hear during the debate. It is so easy for \nthose who are opposed to our program who will say that is amnesty; that \nis just amnesty. But it isn't. They pay a penalty and go to the back of \nthe line. And they have to earn citizenship over a long period of time.\n  They have to demonstrate that they are contributing something to \nAmerica over 11 years. That is called earning the right to become a \ncitizen.\n  The alternative, with all due respect to all of those who are out \nhere talking about deportation. They ought to get it straight.\n  Which are they for? There is no in between.\n  Members can say: We don't like the McCain-Kennedy approach, which is \nbasically supported by the Hagel. We don't like that. That is the \nalternative. There isn't another one that I know of.\n  We should recognize the desire that many of these immigrants want to \ncontribute to America. And our bill provides the means for them to earn \nthe privilege of American citizenship.\n  They must pay taxes. There is a penalty for coming illegally. They \nhave to learn English and obey our laws over several years.\n  Third, our bill recognizes that we must provide legal challenges for \nfuture immigrants so that employers are not tempted to hire illegal \nimmigrants in the future.\n  That is all part of bringing the people out of the shadows. The \nreality is, immigrants will come and employers will hire them even if \nwe erect miles and miles of new fences. It is far better for future \nimmigrants to be here legally so they are out of the shadows and \nprotected by our laws rather than used illegally to undermine American \nwages and American jobs. For that reason, our bill establishes a \nprogram to allow workers to come here legally, to work here temporarily \nwith the prospect of earning their way to permanent status in the \nfuture. They have to demonstrate the prevailing wage that will be \navailable to them, and they will then have the document that will give \nthem the assurance of employment. They will be able to avoid that kind \nof exploitation. That is an important part of this proposal.\n\n  That is our program. It has been embraced by employers, workers, \nRepublicans, Democrats, civil rights groups, immigration experts, \nimmigrant groups, and more. We are all waiting to hear what the \nPresident has to say about it in his national immigration address this \nevening.\n  President Bush is to be commended for his courage and leadership in \nadvancing the immigration debate in our Nation. As a former Governor of \na border State, he understands the issue and appreciates what is at \nstake. He knows the many contributions of immigrants to our Nation. \nTonight, we need President Bush to speak in a clear, strong voice in \nfavor of this comprehensive, bipartisan, commonsense immigration plan. \nEach of its three elements is necessary to fix our broken system. None \nwill work in isolation from the others. That is the key aspect. All \nthree steps must be implemented at the same time if we are to restore \nthe integrity of American immigration. All of them are based upon \nconforming with the law, both in terms of the border and those who \nmight be guests.\n  The President must state unequivocally that enforcement-only \napproaches are a failed strategy and ``enforcement-first'' may make a \ntidy bumper sticker slogan, but it is not a strategy for success. \nHowever, I urge the President not to distract the Nation from the \nurgent work of immigration reform. I know we will hear tonight from the \nPresident about the possibilities of deployment of the National Guard \nalong the border. All are very much aware that our National Guard is \nstretched, and stretched thin; that our National Guard has important \nresponsibilities in Western States to manage fires. Even up in my \nState, as of today, we have dramatic floods in the northeast \ncommunities in my State of Massachusetts. We are facing the hurricane \nseason where the National Guard has played an absolutely key and \nindispensable role.\n  We understand the way the administration is considering using the \nNational Guard; not putting them on the front line of deployment but \nhaving them more in a support role. That would certainly make sense \nbecause\n\n[[Page S4543]]\n\nour border guards have some 15 weeks of training in how to deal with \nthese challenges. To be effective, that is necessary training.\n  We will hear more about this issue this evening. It is important we \nhave the full story from the administration about the utilization of \nthe National Guard. There are important issues and questions that we \nwill all have and we will look forward to the responses by the \nadministration.\n  I believe our national attention and our valuable tax dollars should \nbe spent on the hiring and training of Border Patrol agents and \nimmigration officers needed along the border. That is what we have in \nthis proposal when we are talking about the expanded number of border \nagents as recommended not only by our Judiciary Committee but also by \nthe 9/11 Commission. We believe this is the way to move.\n  In a way, the reform debate is much larger and far reaching than the \nissue of immigration alone. It is about the kind of America we have \nbeen and the even stronger America we hope to become. It is about a \nland whose greatest strength is the way we treat our neighbors and care \nfor our fellow citizens. It is about opening doors of opportunity to \nunleash the talents and strengths of everyone in the land, regardless \nof color or creed, so that we face the future with hope and \ndetermination. That is what this debate is all about.\n  We see it in the faces of hundreds of thousands who have marched for \nopportunity in cities across our land. We see it with our employers who \nknow that a skilled, diverse workforce is essential to our \ncompetitiveness in the global economy. We see it with our military \nleaders who are recruiting a diverse fighting force to think in new \nways as we deal with our dangerous world.\n  Just as in the past, this debate comes with controversy. This has \nalways been the case throughout our immigrant history. Just as it was \nwith the struggle for civil rights in the 1960s, who today would argue \nthat Italian or Irish or Catholic or Jewish immigrants should be \nexcluded? And just the same, who would argue that African Americans \nshould be excluded from our schools, or that discrimination against the \nhiring of Latinos is acceptable in America today?\n  Similarly, over the next several days, as the Senate debates \nimmigration, there will be strongly felt discussion and hotly contested \namendments. Many of these amendments, if adopted, would end the \nprospects for comprehensive reform. The outcome of these amendments \nwill determine what vision of America we will pursue--one mired in fear \nthat seeks to preserve the status quo, or one anchored in hope that \nlooks with optimism to America's future. That is the issue behind this \nwhole debate.\n  I look forward to participating in the debate. Hopefully, we will \nhave a positive outcome.\n  I see my friend and colleague from West Virginia in the Senate. I \nknow he is eager to speak. I had one other item that I will address \nvery quickly if I could. It is timely. Then I will yield the floor.\n\n\n                                Medicare\n\n  Mr. President, for seniors in Medicare today, it is judgment day, the \nday when the misjudgments, the failures, the basic errors of the \ncompetence in implementing the Republican Medicare law will bite into \nthe savings of 8 million seniors across America. Today, the situation \nwill get worse as seniors are hit with financial penalties if they are \nunable to wade through the complicated tangle of private insurance \nplans and the Part D Program.\n  In Massachusetts, citizens have over 45 stand-alone drug coverage \nplans and a number of HMO plans to choose from, each with different \ndrugs offered at different prices. Seniors have to work out which plan \ncovers which drug at which price, with what copayment, what deductible, \nfor dozens of separate plans. They struggle with long waits on the \nMedicare help line and inaccurate and frequently changing information \nabout the program as even the administration struggles to understand \nand explain it.\n  Today, my State, Massachusetts, is currently under a state of \nemergency due to major flooding in the State. I have requested for all \nof Massachusetts an extension of the Part D deadline in our State. Many \nseniors have been evacuated from their homes, others have no \nelectricity, and many have no ability to get to the Post Office or to \ncounselors to discuss enrollment due to the flooded roads.\n  I urge the administration to extend the deadline for these seniors. \nThe administration has said that their computer programs will enable \nseniors to decide which plans to choose, but not every senior is \ncomputer literate, and many do not have access to the Internet. The \nprogram is so confusing that even HHS Secretary Leavitt could not work \nout which drug program was right for his parents. Imagine how difficult \nthe choice is for seniors who do not have the HHS Secretary to help \nthem? If seniors have not worked through all of that confusion by \ntoday's arbitrary and punitive deadline, the Republican Medicare law \nhits them with a fine that grows month after month for as long as they \ndo not sign up for the program.\n  Every Member of the Senate and our staffs and the employees of every \nFederal agency can obtain health insurance through the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits Plan. It is voluntary. Most people sign up \nfor coverage, but some may decide not to because they are included in a \nspouse's policy or have some other coverage.\n  Are Members of Congress who decide not to sign up for the Federal \ncoverage hit with extra payments when they enroll at a later date? Of \ncourse not. But the GOP law says seniors who do not sign up by today's \ndeadline in the Medicare Program will have to pay a penalty when they \nsign up later. Those payments will go up and up and up the longer the \nseniors decide not to enroll.\n  The Republican majority is not rushing to impose fines on Members of \nCongress who do not sign up for health care by some arbitrary date, but \nthat does not stop them from enacting a law that penalizes seniors who \nmiss the Medicare deadline.\n  Senator Bill Nelson has introduced important legislation to let \nseniors make their selection of a drug program without being coerced \ninto a premature choice by today's deadline. The administration says \nenrolling in the drug benefit is entirely voluntary, but it is hardly \nvoluntary if you have to pay a fine when you did not join by an \narbitrary deadline. The proposal Senator Nelson has offered will waive \nthe penalties that seniors would otherwise have to pay for not signing \nup for a drug plan in time.\n  The fiasco of today's punitive deadline is all the more serious \nbecause enactment of a good Medicare drug program could and should have \nbeen a chance to make real progress in meeting the health care needs of \nAmerican seniors.\n  I was here when we passed the Medicare Program. We failed to pass it \nin 1964; we passed it in 1965. The Medicaid Program was passed 8 or 10 \nmonths later and both of them were implemented within 11 months--when \nwe did not have computers, and it was done without a hitch. Now the \nadministration has said 2 to 2\\1/2\\ years to implement this program, \nwith all the computers in the world, and the seniors in my State are \nconfused, troubled, and scared.\n  The proposal Senator Nelson has offered is to try and relieve that \nanxiety, that fear, the sense of loss that so many of our seniors have.\n  If I can get the attention of the Presiding Officer, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Committee on Finance be discharged from further \nconsideration of H 1841; that the Senate proceed to its immediate \nconsideration, the bill be read a third time and passed, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate, \nand that any statements related to the bill be placed in the Record at \nthe appropriate place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Massachusetts \ndoes have the attention of the Chair, and on behalf of the Republican \nleadership, I object.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this was an attempt to try, on this last \nday, to give one last opportunity for the Senate to address this issue \nin the form of the Nelson amendment. I regret very much we have an \nobjection to it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner). The distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia is recognized.\n\n\n         The Necessity of the Senate in the Federal Government\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n\n[[Page S4544]]\n\n  In my continuing series of statements on the idea of a Senate, I \nrefer today to the necessity of the Senate in the Federal Government by \nJames Madison in the Federalist 62, 1787.\n  Was the Senate really necessary? Was a Senate really necessary? Since \nthe American Revolution, the United States had operated under a single \nbody legislature, but the Framers of the Constitution created both a \nSenate and a House of Representatives.\n  Writing in the Federalist Papers, a collection of 85 letters, written \nto newspapers in support of the Constitution's ratification, James \nMadison explained the unique nature of the Senate and the cautious \ndeliberative role that it would play in the American Government.\n\n       Federalist 62:\n       The qualifications proposed for senators, as distinguished \n     from those of representatives, consists in a more advanced \n     age and a longer period of citizenship. . . . The propriety \n     of these distinctions is explained by the nature of the \n     senatorial trust, which, requiring greater extent of \n     information and stability of character, requires at the same \n     time, that the senator should have reached a period of life \n     most likely to supply these advantages . . .\n       It is equally unnecessary to dilate on the appointment of \n     senators by the State legislatures. . . . It is recommended \n     by the double advantage of favoring a select appointment, and \n     of giving to the State governments such an agency in the \n     formation of the federal government. . . .\n       The equality of representation in the Senate is another \n     point, which, being evidently the result of compromise \n     between the opposite pretensions of the large and the small \n     States, does not call for much discussion. . . .\n       In this spirit it may be remarked, that the equal vote \n     allowed to each State is at once a constitutional recognition \n     of the portion of sovereignty remaining in the individual \n     States, and an instrument for preserving that residuary \n     sovereignty. . . .\n       Another advantage accruing from this ingredient in the \n     constitution of the Senate is, the additional impediment it \n     must prove against improper acts of legislation. No law or \n     resolution can now be passed without the concurrence, first, \n     of a majority of the people, and then, of a majority of the \n     States. It must be acknowledged that this complicated check \n     on legislation may in some instances be injurious as well as \n     beneficial; and that the peculiar defence which it involves \n     in favour of the smaller States would be more rational, if \n     any interests common to them, and distinct from those of the \n     other States, would otherwise be exposed to peculiar danger. \n     But as the larger States will always be able, by their power \n     over the supplies, to defeat unreasonable exertions of this \n     prerogative of the lesser States; and as the facility and \n     excess of law-making seem to be the diseases to which our \n     governments are most liable, it is not impossible that this \n     part of the Constitution may be more convenient in practice, \n     than it appears to many in contemplation. . . .\n       . . . The necessity of a senate is not less indicated by \n     the propensity of all single and numerous assemblies, to \n     yield to the impulse of sudden and violent passions, and to \n     be seduced by factious leaders into intemperate and \n     pernicious resolutions. . . . All that need be remarked is, \n     that a body which is to correct this infirmity, ought itself \n     to be free from it, and consequently ought to be less \n     numerous. It ought moreover to possess great firmness, and \n     consequently ought to hold its authority by a tenure of \n     considerable duration. . . .\n       . . . The mutability in the public councils, arising from a \n     rapid succession of new members, however qualified they may \n     be, points out, in the strongest manner, the necessity of \n     some stable institution in the government.\n\n  On September 17, 1787, the 39 delegates to the Constitutional \nConvention, meeting in Philadelphia, signed the new Federal \nConstitution. They agreed that the new Constitution, intended to \nreplace the Articles of Confederation, would take effect when it gained \nratification by 9 of the 13 States.\n  To overcome suspicion and outright opposition, supporters of the \nConstitution needed to convince Americans of the wisdom of the new \nplan. In the weeks and months that followed, newspapers throughout the \nStates printed opinion pieces that both praised and condemned the \nproposed Federal structure. Most prominent among these propaganda \npieces was a series of letters written by Alexander Hamilton, James \nMadison, and John Jay. Signed ``Publius,'' and published in 1788 as \n``The Federalist,'' these essays explained how the new Constitution--\ndividing the Government into three equal branches--would preserve the \nUnion, reconcile differences among States and political factions, and \npromote a common welfare, while carefully controlling power through a \nsystem of checks and balances.\n  Of the 85 essays the trio authored, seven dealt specifically with the \nSenate--Nos. 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 75, and 76--while others, such as \nessay No. 51, discussed the Senate as part of the broader definition of \na Federal Government that included a bicameral legislature.\n  In essay No. 62, James Madison eloquently stated the need for a \nsmaller, more deliberative body in the legislative branch to cool the \npassions and control the urges of democratic masses. By requiring \nSenators to be at least 30 years old, 5 years greater than the minimum \nage for their House counterparts, and to be elected by State \nlegislatures rather than through direct popular election, the Framers \ncreated an institution designed to provide experience and stability.\n  Such qualifications would be vital in a body to which the \nConstitution assigned such constitutional duties as providing advice \nand consent to treaties and to Presidential appointments. Senators also \nwould serve 6-year, overlapping terms, creating continuity by allowing \ntwo-thirds of its Members to remain from Congress to Congress. Longer \nterms, combined with a system of indirect election, would allow \nSenators to resist the whims of public opinion.\n  The Framers also established equality of States in the Senate, \nassigning each State two Senators. The ``Great Compromise of 1787,'' \nreached on July 16, 1787, reconciled the demands of the large States \nwith those of the small States by establishing proportional \nrepresentation of States in the House of Representatives based on \npopulation, and equal representation in the Senate. This compromise \nguaranteed that the Senate would remain a smaller body than the House, \nwhere Members could enjoy more freedom in debate and create the \nnecessary compromises to bring about successful legislation.\n  Of all the qualities established by the Framers, only the system of \nindirect election has changed significantly over time. Election by \nState legislatures ultimately proved vulnerable to corruption. \nFollowing the Civil War, newspaper reporters accused State legislatures \nof accepting bribes to elect Senators favorable to special interests or \nremaining willfully ``deadlocked,'' depriving some States of their \nSenate representation for months--yes, for months--even years.\n  Reformers reacted to these allegations by advocating a constitutional \namendment that would allow the people to vote directly for Senators. \nThis correction to the Framers' handiwork for the Senate went into \neffect in 1913 as the 17th amendment.\n  The Senate has remained a smaller body where States have an equal \nvoice. It has served continuously now--continuously, may I say to the \ndistinguished occupant of the Chair, the very able senior Senator from \nthe Old Dominion, the State of Virginia--since 1789, never requiring \nthe biennial reorganization necessary in the House.\n  Senators have tended to be somewhat older and more experienced than \nRepresentatives, and the Senate has remained--yes, remained--a \ndeliberative institution that has brought caution and stability to the \nlegislative process.\n  As James Madison commented at the Constitutional Convention, the \n``use of the Senate is to consist in its proceeding with more coolness, \nwith more system, and with more wisdom, than the popular branch'' of \nthe Congress.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my understanding is we are on the \nimmigration bill as of this afternoon, and there is an amendment now \npending. I wish to say a few words about the general issue of \nimmigration and also talk about a couple of items the Democratic \nleader, Senator Reid, spoke about earlier today.\n  First of all, I think this needs to be, and I hope will be, a very \nsensitive debate. The fact is, this is a great country in which we \nlive. It is a country\n\n[[Page S4545]]\n\nthat in many ways over many decades of its two-plus centuries has been \nbuilt by immigrants, has been nourished by immigrants. Virtually every \none of us in this Chamber would have come from immigrant parents, \ngrandparents, or great-grandparents. So it is important we understand \nthat and we understand what immigrants have brought to and have given \nthis country.\n  It is also important that we understand why as a country we have \ndecided to have immigration laws and to have quotas for immigration. \nThe reason we have had quotas for immigration is the world has \nprogressed in different parts of this globe at a very different rate. \nIn some countries, the economies have lagged far behind. In other \ncountries, the economies have become very advanced, and the \ncircumstances of the countries are very different.\n  This Earth of ours has somewhere around 6.3 billion people living on \nit, this little planet. We circle around the Sun. Of the 6.3 billion \npeople, somewhere now nearing 300 million people live in this little \nplace called the United States of America.\n  We are pleased to live on this planet. One-half of the people who \nlive on this planet make less than $2 a day, one-half of the people who \nlive on this Earth have never made a telephone call, and 1.5 billion \npeople living on this Earth don't have daily access to clean, potable \nwater. There are people living on this Earth with great challenges.\n  We, however, are a country that has been blessed with resources, \nwonderful people, and ingenuity, and we have built something very \nspecial. Building it was not easy. Building the kind of economy and the \nstandard of living we have had in this country has required sacrifice. \nWe have had people die on the streets for the right of workers to \norganize. We have had very substantial debates about rights--about \ncivil rights, workers' rights, about women's rights. We have done a lot \nof things that are very tough and challenging, and we have built quite \na remarkable country.\n  Because of that, this is a country to which many around the world \naspire to come, to live here, to work here, to be here. If tomorrow, \nfor example, we in the United States said, on Tuesday, tomorrow, May \n16, there is a new policy, and that new policy is this: Anyone living \non this planet is able to come to this country unrestricted, come here, \nstay here, live here, work here, you are welcome, the welcome mat is \nout, if we did that, what do we think might happen? I know what would \nhappen. Tens of millions of people--tens and tens and tens of millions \nof people--would aspire to find their way to the United States of \nAmerica because it is, in fact, a beacon of hope and opportunity all \naround the world. There are jobs in this country, jobs available, rates \nof pay that are far in excess of those of Third World countries. The \ndifference between, for example, the jobs in Mexico and the rate of pay \nfor those jobs versus the jobs in the United States is very \nsubstantial.\n  We have on our southern border people who aspire to come to this \ncountry from Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, on up through Mexico to \ntry to cross our borders. The result is we have, in order to protect \nour way of life and our standard of living and to protect jobs that \nneed to go to American workers, quotas that limit the amount of \nimmigration, and those quotas year by year are quotas we work with to \ntry to understand how many we can have come into this country from \nvarious parts of the world.\n  Let me give some statistics about last year to the extent we know it. \nLast year, 1.1 million people tried to come into this country illegally \nfrom the border of Mexico, up through that southern border; 1.1 million \npeople tried to enter this country illegally and were apprehended, \nstopped, and not allowed to enter the United States illegally. Mr. \nPresident, 750,000, it is estimated, did come to that border and got \nacross the border illegally and were not detected and were not stopped. \nSo 1.1 million were detected, stopped, and prevented from entering. \nProbably three-quarters of a million entered illegally. Another \n175,000, it is estimated, came to that border and entered legally; that \nis, children, relatives, and others. Under the quota system, they \nentered legally. This is a circumstance just on our southern border.\n  The result is we have immigration laws, and those laws are laws that \ndetermine how many we can allow into this country. We do that for the \nprotection and for the economic interests of the American people.\n\n  The American people include immigrants who have been here, came here \nlegally; some have been here a long time. We want to make sure that \njobs are available for them, that the middle class in this country has \njobs that pay well with benefits.\n  We also have another influence in this country, and the other \ninfluence is that larger corporations are now made much larger because \nof mergers and are wanting to export good American jobs to China and \nimport cheap, substandard labor, particularly from the South, and pay \neven less than minimum wage, and because they are hiring someone \nillegal, they are highly unlikely to be critical of them if they don't \npay the minimum wage. They feel they don't have the right to criticize.\n  We have a circumstance where at least some enterprises in this \ncountry want to export good American jobs and import cheap labor on the \nbottom. That is, in my judgment, the circumstance that will pull apart \nthe middle class in our country. That is why we have to be concerned \nabout all that is happening.\n  The situation which exists in this country is that we put together, \nrecognizing there was an immigration problem, a bill 20 years ago in \nthe Congress--I wasn't serving in the Senate at the time, I was in the \nHouse. It was a bill called Simpson-Mazzoli. It was named after Senator \nSimpson and Congressman Mazzoli. It was said at the time that the way \nto deal with illegal immigration is to shut off the jobs because people \naspire to come here illegally to take a job. They see this job as hope \nand promise for the future.\n  I have pointed out many times about a helicopter I was on that ran \nout of gas at one point. We were touring down near Honduras and \nNicaragua in the jungle and mountainous area. I was on a helicopter, \nand we ran out of fuel. We landed under power, but the red lights were \non and alarms were ringing, and the pilots brought us down right then \nand there in this jungle, mountainous area. We were there a good many \nhours until the U.S. Army found out where we were and hauled us out of \nthere.\n  The campasinos in the area came walking through the underbrush to see \nwho landed in these two helicopters. Three of us had an interpreter \nwith us. I was talking to the campasinos through the interpreter. They \nhad never seen anyone from the United States. They lived up in the \nhills, a life of significant difficulty and poverty.\n  I was talking with them about their lives. I asked one young woman: \nHow many children do you have?\n  She said: Only four, kind of disappointed. She was a very young \nwoman. The interpreter told me later: The reason that woman said ``only \nfour'' is you should understand there is no social security program \ndown here. The only social security you have is to have as many \nchildren as you can possibly have and hope that enough of them survive \nthat perhaps if you are lucky enough to reach old age, you will have \nchildren alive to support you in your old age. That is social security.\n  A number of women with a number of children came looking to see who \nlanded. I was talking with, as I said, this young woman: What is your \nwish, your desire for your future and your children's future? What are \nyou hoping for?\n  She said: That is easy. I want to come to the United States of \nAmerica.\n  I said: Why do you want to come to the United States of America?\n  Oh, she said, that is an area where there is hope and opportunity for \nmy children, and jobs.\n  You find that all over. So it is not surprising there are people \ntrying to cross our border, trying to find jobs and opportunities in \nthis country.\n  We passed legislation 20 years ago called Simpson-Mazzoli. The basic \npremise of that legislation was very simple. The premise was this: The \nattraction for people to come to this country illegally is to find a \njob and to earn money. If you shut off that attraction, shut off that \njob, you at least substantially diminish illegal immigration coming \ninto this country. And so the legislation was passed.\n\n[[Page S4546]]\n\n  I went back recently and read all the debate about Simpson-Mazzoli. \nThe legislation was passed, and it was going to shut off the jobs. In \nfact, how was that going to happen? It was going to happen because \nthere were going to be employer sanctions, saying to America's \nemployers: If you hire illegal aliens, if you hire illegal immigrants \nto come into this country to take a job, you are going to be in some \ntrouble. You can't hire people who are here illegally to work in your \nplants, to work in your businesses.\n  Those then were the approaches that were going to be used to shut \ndown this illegal immigration. What happened? Let me give an example. I \nam told that last year, there was only one action taken against an \nAmerican business--one--in all of America for hiring illegal workers.\n  I will give an example of hiring illegal workers. A couple of weeks \nago--there is an energy plant being built in North Dakota--the highway \npatrol picked up I believe it was seven people. I believe six were from \nGuatemala, one was from Mexico. They detained them. They were not here \nlegally. They had come here illegally to take a job in constructing the \nenergy plant.\n  The law enforcement people took them to Minot, ND, to the immigration \noffice. As a result of that, they took them back down to a motel nearly \nan hour south of Minot and dropped them off at the motel where they \nwere staying with the admonition that they are now required, because \nthey were here illegally, to show up in Minneapolis some weeks hence \nfor a hearing. Of course, they will never show up in Minneapolis. They \nare gone. That is the way the system works: Come here, find a job; if \nyou get caught, they say show up later; you never show up later. And \nthat is the way the system works. That is the way the system works.\n\n  Now, what about the employer who hired these seven people? In 2004, \nin the entire United States of America, the administration took action \nagainst three companies that hired illegal immigrants. Let me say that \nagain. In the entire country, they took action against only three \ncompanies that hired illegal immigrants. That is the same as saying to \ncompanies: You know what, don't worry, be happy. Hire illegal workers \nif you wish. Pay them substandard wages if you wish because they won't \ncomplain because they are illegal. Don't worry about it. It is a great \nway of cutting your costs. Be our guests because we are not going to \nenforce the law.\n  That is unbelievable to me.\n  So the whole promise of the law that was changed 20 years ago to shut \noff these jobs for people who are not in our country legally was a \ncomplete failure because there was an abject lack of enforcement. Now \nwe have a piece of legislation on the floor of the Senate dealing with \nimmigration, and we are going to go through this process again. We are \ntold there are 11 million to 12 million people who have come into our \ncountry illegally. Some have come in recent years, some have been here \na long while, and some have been here long enough to have children and \ngrandchildren. So the question is: What do you do about that?\n  Then we have people come to the floor of the Senate and they say: \nWell, let's do a new immigration bill. Yet doing a new immigration bill \nwithout effectively finding ways to shut the border to illegal \nimmigration will have us back in the same Chamber in 10 years or 20 \nyears saying: Now what do we do about the next 10 million or 20 million \npeople who are here illegally?\n  Let me tell you why I think this is so important. No. 1, I said when \nI started that I think it is important that this be dealt with in a \nvery sensitive way. I don't want people to in any way suggest that this \ndebate diminishes or demeans immigrants. We have some wonderful people \nwho have come to this country. That is how I got to this country. I \nwasn't alive when my ancestors came here, but they came over from \nNorway, and most Members of this Senate are here in this country \nbecause someone had the courage to get on a boat and probably land at \nEllis Island. So let's understand that, first of all, about \nimmigration.\n  But let's also understand that the issue of legal and illegal \nimmigration is different. There are legal ways to come to this country \nand there are ways to get into this country illegally. What we have \nbuilt in this country is very unusual on the face of the Earth.\n  I have spoken before about a man named Jim Fyler. Jim Fyler died. He \nwas shot 54 times--54 times he was shot. Do you know why he was shot? \nBecause he felt that coal miners ought to have a right to organize for \nbetter pay and better work hours, so he gave his life. Well, Mr. Fyler \nis one example of dozens of examples of what we have done in this \ncountry: The courage of men and women to stand up for the interests of \nworkers for good jobs that pay well, with benefits, including \nretirement, health care, and more. So we have built something very \nspecial.\n  Now we have a whole series of influences which include, yes, illegal \nimmigration to diminished salaries, diminished wages, diminished \nbenefits, and diminished opportunities for American workers. It is not \nright.\n  So what I feel we should do is work on this immigration system in a \nserious and thoughtful way and try to evaluate what do we do about \nseveral issues. First, what do we do to control our border? I know some \nof the discussions today and perhaps this week and next week will be \nabout terrorists. Yes, we have to try to keep terrorists from coming \nacross the border. That is something that is very important. Terrorists \nwish to do harm to the American people. We need to keep terrorists from \ncoming across this border and trying to kill American citizens. But in \naddition to the issue of detecting terrorists and preventing them from \ncoming in, we also need to have some control of our border to prevent \nan uncontrolled inflow of illegal immigrants who will take American \njobs at substandard wages and then beginning to put downward pressure \non American workers and American wages.\n  It is not an accident what is happening in this country today. You \ncan read all the newspapers and evaluate what you find. You find \ncompanies that want to ship good jobs overseas to China. Why? Because \nthey pay less money to get their products produced, and they want to \nship their product back to this country to sell it and then they want \nto run their income through the Grand Cayman Islands and not pay taxes. \nSo the same companies that want to export good Americans jobs are the \nsame companies that would like to import cheap wages for the jobs we \nlost here.\n  Alan Blinder, a very respected economist, used to be vice chairman of \nthe Federal Reserve Board. He wrote a piece that is interesting. I know \nsome, when they talk about exporting American jobs, are viewed as \nxenophobes and isolationists and protectionist.\n  Allen Blinder wrote a piece; he is a former vice chair of the Fed, a \nvery respected economist. He said there are somewhere between 42 \nmillion and 54 million American jobs that are potential jobs to be \noutsourced--outsourced--because there is a billion to a billion and a \nhalf workers in the rest of the world who will do those jobs for 30 \ncents an hour, 50 cents an hour, and you can put them in unsafe work \nplants, put the chemicals in the air and water. You don't have to worry \nabout all that. They are much less expensive than hiring an American \nworker. He also said that it is likely that 42 million to 54 million \nAmerican jobs would not be exported, but even those that are not \nexported, if they remain here, they are competing with lower wages and \nwith those workers overseas who are willing to accept much lower wages.\n  So we face some very significant economic pressures for the American \nworker and the middle class in this country. Nobody seems to think much \nabout it, care much about it or talk much about it. But it is implicit \nin this discussion as well, and it applies not to a certain class of \nAmerican workers; it applies to all American workers. Yes, those are \nHispanic workers and African-American workers; all American workers are \naffected by this. Those who are in the minority suffer most. They are \nthe first to lose their jobs and the last to get a job back, and when \nthey do get a job back, it is lower pay because they are told: This is \na new global economy, and you have to compete with others in other \nparts of the world willing to work for much less money.\n  So that is the subtext as well for this kind of discussion, but I \nwant to finally say this: If this debate moves forward\n\n[[Page S4547]]\n\nwithout an understanding that you have to find a way to deal with this \nissue of employer sanctions or shut off the lure, shut down the lure of \na job; if we don't decide to get serious about saying to employers: You \ncan't hire illegal immigrants, you can't do that without significant \nsanctions; if we don't do that, then we should make reservations to \ncome back every 10 years and have another debate about how we deal with \nthe next 5 million or 10 million people who want to come into this \ncountry.\n\n  So I think that this issue in the coming couple of days is going to \nbe a difficult issue with perhaps a lot of amendments. I will be \noffering an amendment. My amendment will be one that will eliminate the \nguest worker provision which is the extra ``above'' provision saying \nthat there are another--with this new proposal before us, there is \nanother, I think it is 3.8 million workers who don't yet live in this \ncountry, but above H-2A and H-2B and the other programs, above all of \nthat, there is another 3.8 million workers living outside the country \nnow that will be allowed in as a part of this compromise. It doesn't \nmake any sense to me. That is not, in my judgment, the right thing to \ndo.\n  So there will be, as I said, a lot of amendments and a difficult \ndebate, I am sure. I think this is a very important issue, but I think \nit is very important that we do it right and get it right. One of the \nquestions we ought to consider for all Americans as we proceed is what \nare the consequences on American workers, on American jobs, wages, \nretirement, the future? That is a very important issue as we consider \nthese immigration issues in the next 2 weeks.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and make a point of order that the \nquorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to thank my colleague from \nNorth Dakota, Senator Dorgan, for his comments. I happened to be in \nSouth America a few weeks ago, and I noticed in the State Department \nnews clips that there was a poll taken in Nicaragua, and it said that \n60 percent of the people of Nicaragua would move to the United States \nif they could. Then I asked the Ambassador of Peru about it, and he \nsaid: Well, that is interesting. We did a poll down here just a couple \nof months ago and it was 70 percent. So I think Senator Dorgan has \nraised an important point, and that point is this: The United States \nmust decide how many people and what skill sets we need in our country \nto strengthen our country. We simply cannot allow everybody in the \nworld to individually decide they would like to come here and then to \ngrant that request. It simply is not possible. I think what we would \nsee in the months to come and the years to come is that more and more \npeople would choose to come here, and as word got out if this bill were \nto pass in its present form, that they would decide to come here. The \nnumbers could grow to exceed a level that most people think not \npossible today.\n  I had a press conference this morning, and we dealt with the question \nof the numbers of people that would be allowed into our country if this \nlegislation were to pass. The numbers are staggering. Also at that \npress conference was Mr. Robert Rector, senior research fellow at the \nHeritage Foundation, the man who did the basic research on the welfare \nreform bill, one of the more respected individuals in Washington in \nterms of numbers and public policy. He stated at that press conference \nthat this legislation is some of the most important legislation ever to \ncome before Congress, and he compared it as rivaling in significance to \nSocial Security and Medicare. That is what he said this morning. So we \nhave to think seriously about the legislation that is before us.\n  Yes, we want to treat fairly and justly those people already in the \ncountry--even those who are here illegally--and figure out a way to do \nthat right, and that is very significant. We also want to work hard on \nthe border and to make sure we have a legal system that works in this \ncountry, and we have been doing some work on that. I don't think we are \nthere yet. This bill does not get us there, but we can talk about it \nand perhaps make some progress.\n  I would say there is a deeper issue that is part of S. 2611 that has \nnot been discussed publicly until this morning, and that is how many \npeople might be admitted under this bill. My staff, Cindy Hayden and \nher Judiciary team, have been working for a week to try to figure out \njust how many people could be admitted. Right now, under current law, \nthis country would admit 19 million new residents over 20 years. Under \nthe legislation that is proposed today, over a 20 year period, we would \nadmit a minimum of 78 million people--four times the number admitted \nunder current law. In fact, as this chart shows, the number of people \nwe admit could be as high as 217 people. If the base numbers in this \nbill grew at the maximum acceleration factors automatically built into \nthe bill, acceleration factors that kick in not with regard to Congress \nor with regard to the Department of Labor making any certification of \nneed but simply because people show up and apply to come into our \ncountry, they could actually hit 217 million people. That is a stunning \nnumber. That is two-thirds of the present population of the United \nStates of America. I don't think it is going to hit 217 million, but I \ndo think it is going to exceed 78 million.\n  Mr. Rector ran his numbers, and they came out very similar to ours. \nHis top number for people admitted over 20 years was 200 million \ninstead of 217 million. Based on his judgment about what might actually \nhappen, he thinks that the number will be 103 million people over 20 \nyears, five times the current rate of immigration into our country \ntoday. Based on this finding, that would mean that 20 years from today, \n25 percent of the people in this country will not be native born \ncitizens. That is a huge thing. What does that mean to jobs and \nemployment and wages? We haven't thought that through. What have we \ndone to make sure that the people who come here are welcomed and can be \nmet, affirmed and raised in the traditions of America which have \ncreated the land of opportunity that attracts people here?\n  What about those people who came into our country legally or those \nwho may be given amnesty under this bill? They are out working at a \nlittle above minimum wage and then, boom, every year, larger and larger \nnumbers of people come in, keeping them down at the minimum wage level, \nnot allowing them to build up their salaries. Those are all problems \nthat we have not thought through in a significant way, but they are big \nproblems. These are huge problems. But there is momentum to pass \nsomething. What we hear in the Senate is we need to pass something, to \nsend some sort of signal, I guess, politically or otherwise, that we \ncare. We have to do this.\n\n  We need to think. This Senate is supposed to carefully and \nthoughtfully consider legislation before we pass it. I am going to talk \na good bit about it as time goes on throughout this debate. There are \nso many important things contained in the legislation, so much \nexperiment, unthought-out policies that could be detrimental to our \nfuture, that we must discuss them in an effective way.\n  I guess it was about 3 weeks ago when the bill was previously on the \nfloor and they tried to ram this thing through here. The Democratic \nleader would not even allow an amendment and they almost passed it. \nSome of us had to battle and push back. Senator Frist, the majority \nleader, finally said we can't operate under this procedure. We are not \ngoing to deny our Members the right to have an amendment in the Senate \non a piece of legislation that may be as important as Medicare and \nSocial Security. For heaven's sake, that was the scheme of things.\n  Now we are supposed to move a 600 page piece of legislation through \nhere, with an agreement that only 20 amendments are guaranteed to get a \nvote, and then we will pass the bill at the end of the week. I don't \nthink we can really fix it by the end of this week, frankly. I don't \nthink there is enough knowledge in the Senate about what is in the \nlegislation to make it possible\n\n[[Page S4548]]\n\nfor us to reach an agreement on how to fix this.\n  When we had this issue blowup recently--I guess that is the word you \nwould call it--and they tried to move this through and Senator Reid \nsaid we would not have any amendments and it was pulled down, I raised \nthe point at that time that we did not fully comprehend the importance \nof what is in it. We need to study the bill. We need to study the \npolicy behind the bill. Around the country, I called for hearings in \nthe Judiciary Committee, a national discussion on what would be the \nappropriate way to handle the people who are here illegally.\n  We are going to handle them in a nice and fair and generous way. What \nabout the people who want to come in the future? What are we going to \ndo about them? We can discuss that. Trust me, that is much larger in \nthis piece of legislation. The people who are allowed under this bill \nto come here in the future dwarf the 11 million who are here now. We \nneed to have a national dialog, but we have not had it.\n  We ended up having one hearing, about 2 hours long, maybe a little \nmore. I think three or four Senators came in and out during the \nhearing. I was there. We had five economists. They made some important \npoints, although not in depth because of the shortage of time. They \nnoted that the bill as written emphasizes low-skilled workers, and all \nof them agreed that a low-skilled worker--over half of those now coming \nin do not have a high school education--cost the economy more than they \nbring in. All the economists agreed on that. A low-skill worker is not \na net benefit for America at this point.\n  They questioned chain migration. They suggested we should question \nmore about the skill sets of people who want to come here. They \ndiscussed the fact that there is strong evidence that workers' wages, \nmiddle-class and low-end-skill wages today are depressed by larger \nnumbers of immigrants who come in who are willing to work for less.\n  Why would we think the law of supply and demand worked for every \nother component of our American economy but doesn't work for labor? How \nsilly is that? Those are some of the things we discussed in the one \nhearing we had in the Judiciary Committee.\n  Friday, I came down to the Senate floor. I made a speech just this \npast Friday, detailing 15 loopholes in the base bill. Each of those \nloopholes is very significant and raises important questions we need to \naddress. I will point out briefly what some of those are.\n  Under the bill on the floor today, illegal aliens with felonies or \nthree misdemeanors can get amnesty. That is not what the American \npeople want or what we should want.\n  Illegal aliens who have previously filed fraudulent asylum \napplications, prohibited by law from getting amnesty or citizenship \ntoday, can get amnesty and are put on a path to citizenship.\n  There is no continuous work requirement. They say the people are here \nto work, but the bill doesn't require continuous work in any \nsignificant way.\n  They allow evidence that can be produced to prove you have been in \nthe country or been working that is very dubious and will clearly lead \nto fraud. The bill says you must accept just and reasonable inferences \nas evidence and that you can have documents from day labor centers and \nthat an alien can file his or her ``sworn declaration,'' and they must \nbe accepted as evidence that the alien satisfies the work requirement.\n  I pointed out that the bill is fundamentally unfair because it \nbenefits only those who broke the law and not those who followed it and \ngot their work visas to come to the United States or those who left the \ncountry when their visa expired as they were supposed to.\n  Another loophole was that the annual numerical cap is not a cap at \nall. If it is met each year, it automatically goes up 20 percent \nwithout any thought going into that, or discussion.\n  Furthermore, in-state tuition will be made available to illegal \naliens, reversing carefully considered and fully debated law that we \npassed a number of years ago in the Congress.\n  These are mostly enforcement loopholes. They deal with amnesty \nprovisions and the enforcement provisions of the bill. They are part of \nthis 614-page bill. But until today, no one has discussed publicly what \nS. 2611 would do about future immigration or how significant that could \nbe. So we will be discussing that during the course of this debate. I \nam going to talk about it. I will not be able to complete those remarks \ntonight, but we will be talking about it the rest of the week, and I \nthink we will see a national discussion begin as a result of the \nefforts of my staff, and that of the Heritage Foundation, \nindependently, to conclude what the numbers will be.\n\n  Who and how many people will be admitted on the path to citizenship \nunder this bill? I think we in the Senate, unfortunately, are \nblissfully ignorant of the scope and impact of the legislation.\n  I think most Members of the Senate still believe that the bill \nlanguage that says ``guest workers'' is language that means temporary \nworkers when the truth is that virtually all those who will qualify in \nthe future under this bill are not temporary in any way but will be \nable to stay permanently in this country and will be placed on a direct \npath to citizenship. That is a fact.\n  On April 19, when we were trying to decide how to handle all these \nmonumental issues, I wrote to the Judiciary Committee and asked to have \nhearings on the full impact of this bill which is now before the \nSenate. I asked a number of questions--see if you don't think these are \nfair questions to ask about a piece of legislation of this \nsignificance.\n  I asked: What is the estimated numerical impact of each of the \nproposed immigration programs? Wouldn't you like to know that? What is \nthe numerical impact? How many will come in?\n  No. 2, how does the future chain migration of family members impact \nthe total immigration numbers on the proposal? We don't know that \nnumber. As a matter of fact, in all the numbers we have worked on, we \nhave not tried to calculate it.\n  Next, what will be the legislation's estimated fiscal impact on the \nFederal budget, as well as State and local governments' budgets? How \nmuch will it impact the Treasury of the United States, the taxpayers? \nDoes anybody know that? The answer is no.\n  Next, how will entitlement programs such as Medicaid, TANF--welfare--\nand food stamps be affected? Do we need to know that? Sure.\n  What level of immigration in the future is in our best national, \neconomic, social, and cultural interests? What is the interest of the \nUnited States? What do we need as a country? What would be good for us?\n  We believe in immigration, we want immigration to continue. I think \nwe might even probably agree that we should increase the number of \npeople who come legally into our country. But what level is correct? \nHave we discussed that? Have you heard any debate about that?\n  I next asked what categories of immigrants should compose the overall \nlevel of annual immigration. What categories? So I said we need to have \na national discussion.\n  We had one hearing. We had a group of professors for about 2 hours to \ndiscuss the general economic principles relating to immigration. It \njust was not satisfactory. We did not examine in any way the specific \nprovisions of this 600-page piece of legislation.\n  I sent another letter on April 28 asking our Judiciary Committee to \nhold five hearings and focus comprehensively on the effects of the \nproposed legislation. That did not occur. There have never been any \nhearings on the specifics of this bill. Therefore, as we have gone \nthrough it, my staff and I, trying to figure out the numerical impacts \nof the bill, we came up with some significant numbers. I will not go \ninto the full detail of that tonight. I will talk more about it \ntomorrow.\n  I will point out again that these are the charts which show the 20-\nyear impact of 2611. These numbers can be calculated based on the \nprovisions of the bill, but it takes a lot of time and effort. We have \ncharts that go down each provision to calculate what the minimum \nnumbers admitted would be and what the maximum numbers admitted would \nbe.\n  Under this piece of legislation today, if the caps, the upper limits \non the immigration numbers that automatically go upward if they are \never met, don't go up at all and people bring in their families, their \nspouses and children\n\n[[Page S4549]]\n\nwho then become citizens, at a minimum 78.7 million people would be \nadmitted over 20 years. That is four times the 18.9 million that the \ncurrent law allows for today. Who has discussed the impact of that? And \nabsolutely it is going to be more, in my view, than 78.7 million, for \nany number of reasons I will discuss.\n  In fact, if all the top quotas were hit, that number would hit 217 \nmillion, according to our calculations. The Heritage Foundation \ncalculated the number to be about 200 million, I believe. Though that \nis the top number, Mr. Rector says a careful, conservative analysis of \nthe legislation would lead him to believe that over 100 million people \nwould actually come into America on a path to citizenship in 20 years. \nThat is his best judgment. If somebody doesn't agree, I would like hear \nabout it. One hundred million is five times the number that now can \ncome into our country. It has not been discussed until today. Nobody \nhas really discussed it but us today, that I know of. It is time to \ntalk about that, wouldn't you think? Did anybody even know this was in \nthe legislation? They would have passed this bill without an amendment \njust a few weeks ago. That was the plan around here, to move it on to \nconference. They say: Let's just get it out of here. Don't worry about \nwhat is in it, Sessions. Don't bother to read it, it is 614 pages. You \nknow you will find something you don't like. That is kind of the talk \ngoing on around here.\n  We decided to read it. My staff actually came away stunned by the \nbreadth and the size and scope of this legislation.\n  We need to talk about it more. I will have a few amendments. I am not \ngoing to try to file too many amendments. But we will talk about it as \ntime goes.\n  I urge my colleagues to not say to yourself: Well, we need to pass \nsomething or I think I will vote for this bill, and maybe they will fix \nit in conference.\n  This is a piece of legislation that is extremely important to the \npeople of this country of the United States. It is extremely important \nfor our future as a Nation.\n  Mr. Rector said it is a matter of huge importance to our Nation.\n  We need to think about it.\n  If it is not the piece of legislation you thought it was, if it \nprovides amnesty when they said it didn't, if you thought the workers \nwere temporary and guest workers when they are permanent and on the \nroute to citizenship, and you had no idea the number was going to be \n100 million new people in the country permanently on the path to \ncitizenship, five times the current number, then I ask you to vote no.\n  Let us back up here. Let us fix this bill or let us not pass this \nbill.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/15/senate-section/article/S4549-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4549]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, as we honor and celebrate America's teachers \non National Teacher Appreciation Day, I thought it would be appropriate \nto say a few words about the state of education in my home State of \nNevada.\n  I had an eye-opening meeting recently with the school superintendents \nfrom all corners of Nevada, and they shared the challenges that \nteachers and students face each day and ideas on what we can do to \nimprove education. With only 17 school districts in the State, we have \na unique situation where our education leaders can come together--in \none room and around one table--for a discussion of the issues that \nconcern them.\n  Even more remarkable is the unique diversity of Nevada's school \ndistricts. Our 17 school districts range from one of the Nation's \nlargest and most diverse, Clark County, to vast, rural Esmeralda \nCounty, which has less than 100 students in the entire district. Such \ndiversity makes Nevada a microcosm of the Nation and provides a \nsnapshot of the varied needs of teachers and students across the \ncountry.\n  I met with many of the same superintendents during the early years of \nNo Child Left Behind implementation to discuss the difficulties that \ntheir school districts were having in meeting the requirements of the \nnew law.\n  When NCLB was passed, there were many who lauded President Bush's \ncommitment to education. After all, who among us would allow any child \nto slip through the cracks in our education system if we could prevent \nit? None of us would do that. And at the time, many thought that this \nsweeping legislation would fill those gaps. Unfortunately, this hasn't \nbeen the case.\n  My own State of Nevada has suffered under the burden of unfunded \nmandates and punitive measures this law has imposed. But I want to give \nour educators in Nevada credit: from our teachers to our \nsuperintendents, they have all tried hard to comply with this law.\n  They have robbed Peter to pay Paul with their budgets. They have \ncompromised on teaching art and history classes. They have shortened \nthe time allotted for recess. And they have even tacked on extra \nreading or math classes.\n  Instead of resisting these requirements, they have tried to work \nwithin it, and I commend them for their unified efforts. But there is \nonly so much they can do with a flawed law.\n  To be sure, Nevada isn't the only State that has struggled under this \nlaw. It is a national problem. School districts across the country are \nalready trying to juggle school construction costs, increasing \ngraduation rates, finding money for textbooks, reducing class sizes, \nand figuring out what to do about overcrowded high schools.\n  But, now, in its fourth year of implementation, most of us have heard \nsimilar stories about the many problems with No Child Left Behind.\n  So with an eye toward authorization of NCLB, I asked to meet with the \nState's school superintendents once again, not so much to discuss \nproblems with the law, but, rather, ways to improve it and make it more \nresponsive to the needs of our students and teachers. One after the \nother, these educators gave examples of how changes, some minor and \nothers much larger, to the No Child Left Behind Act could help them to \nreach its stated goal.\n  No Child Left Behind is based on the premise that we can track the \nprogress of every school by using a one-size-fits-all approach, \nincluding standardized tests. And what I heard from these \nsuperintendents was that their problems aren't standardized--so a one-\nsize-fits-all approach doesn't always work.\n  In Clark County, Carla Steinforth talked about accommodating the more \nthan 12,000 students that move into the county each year by building a \nschool nearly every month.\n  Another of the more pervasive challenges that Nevada as a whole, and \nClark County in particular, face: the influx of students who are not \nnative English-speakers. There are so many children entering our public \nschools who don't speak English that--under the NCLB--most of our \npublic schools will eventually be on the ``watch-list'' or considered a \n``failing school.''\n  One idea to deal with the district's growing and constantly changing \nstudent population was to implement a ``growth model'' or \naccountability. Under such a model, student progress would be measured \nfrom year to year, rather than by measuring 1 year of student \nperformance to another, as is currently being done. Keith Rheault, the \nState superintendent of education, said Nevada is pursuing this idea, \nunder a pilot program that opens up this possibility to just a few \nStates. Everyone, it seems, with the exception of the Federal \nGovernment, has recognized the need for greater flexibility under CLB.\n\n  A neighboring school system, Nye County, is growing but at a much \nslower rate than Clark County. Nye County is the largest school \ndistrict in the continental United States. The superintendent, Rob \nRoberts, talked about the morale of many of the students, teachers, and \nparents, when their school has been labeled as a ``failing school.''\n  In rural Mineral County, Superintendent Steven Cook discussed the \ndifficulty the district has had in retaining and attracting special \neducation teachers. He talked about the\n\n[[Page S4550]]\n\nneed for greater flexibility for rural counties with teacher \nqualification requirements in NCLB. The superintendent of White Pine \nCounty, Bob Dolezal, concurred and shared the challenges of ensuring \nthat his high school teaching staff of five, who each have taught \nmultiple subjects, would be considered ``highly qualified'' to teach \nall subjects.\n  Make no mistake about it: The issue is not whether teachers in rural \nareas should be qualified to teach multiple subjects--they should. \nHowever, requiring them to attain ``highly qualified'' status in all \nsubjects simultaneously is unreasonable.\n  In other counties, like Douglas County, they have actually seen \nenrollment decline, as housing costs drove families to less expensive \nareas. Yet the district has had increased expenses because of onerous \nNCLB requirements. The superintendent, John Soderman, said he \nappreciates the accountability principles in the law but also talked \nabout the negative implications of the law's punitive nature.\n  Mary Pierczynski in Carson City cited NCLB's effect on thinking and \ncreativity. They have over 200 days of curriculum to teach but with \nonly 180 days of school. And standardized testing is taking up more 10 \ndays of that time.\n  In Humboldt County, it is difficult to get qualified \nparaprofessionals, and additional requirements will leave many of the \nschools without aides. Superintendent Charlotte Peterson said that the \nonly other option would be to bring them in from many miles away.\n  In Eureka County, where there are just a few hundred students, Ben \nZunino talked about a feeling of inevitability for schools to be \nlabeled as failing and how one student's performance can often make the \ndifference between a school being labeled as high achieving or needs \nimprovement. To improve this, Lincoln County Superintendent Rick Hardy \nsuggested counting the percentage of students who move into proficiency \nas a way of recognizing improvement and the hard work of teachers and \nstudents.\n  In Storey County, Rob Slaby is fretful about the time for history and \narts that has been lost to testing and preparation for these tests and \nsuggested some kind of credit for these important subjects.\n  Dottie Merrill from Washoe County, the State's second largest school \ndistrict, suggested that students who are English-learners not be \nincluded in testing until they have been in the United States for a few \nyears, as opposed to 1 year, as is currently in the law. This would \ngive schools the time necessary to help these students transition to \nschool in the United States.\n  Nearly all superintendents mentioned the struggle to pay for the \nbasics, like school buses and supplies, with the ever-increasing costs \nof NCLB requirements. If the Federal Government would fully fund NCLB, \nas it had promised, it would alleviate some of these hardships.\n  As an example, many of the districts mentioned the cost to provide \ntransportation for their increasingly scattered student population. In \nmany rural counties, where some students travel up to 150 miles a day \nfor school, transportation expenses can be upwards of 70 percent of the \nbudget. Many districts have had to cut some special events because of \nrising transportation costs, and all were concerned about the amount \nschool bus costs and high gas prices will cut into their overall \nbudgets.\n  I have touched on just a few of the problems with the No Child Left \nBehind Act and some of the ways educators in Nevada have suggested to \nimprove it. It is going to take a lot of hard work to make it what it \npromised to be: a tool that will help the teachers and students in \nevery public school in America.\n  Today, as we honor the Nation's teachers for their work and \ndedication, we must ensure that we keep our promise to America's \nstudents. We can't afford to leave them behind.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/15/senate-section/article/S4550-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4550]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNITION OF CHUCK FULKERSON\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today I rise to honor one of the true heroes \nfor Nevada's veterans, retired COL Charles ``Chuck'' Fulkerson. This \nman is a Reno native, a war hero, and a dedicated public servant.\n  I have known Chuck for many years, and I have always appreciated his \ndedication to improving the lives of veterans in our State. When Chuck \nspoke about veterans issues, he spoke from a position experience.\n  In 1955, Chuck enrolled in the Army Reserve while an undergraduate at \nthe University of Nevada-Reno. The Korean war had ended, but our world \nwas still a very unstable place. A few years, later when the United \nStates found itself involved in another crisis in Southeast Asia, Chuck \nanswered his Nation's call to service. He went to Vietnam, not once but \ntwice, for tours of combat. After the war, Chuck served his country in \nEurope before returning home to serve in the Nevada National Guard.\n  While maintaining his military obligations, Chuck served the citizens \nof Nevada in a variety of government positions. Gov. Bob List appointed \nChuck to be the director of the Nevada Selective Service in 1979. After \nalmost 6 years of service in that role, Gov. Dick Bryan recalled Chuck \nto active duty when he appointed Chuck to be the director of the \nproperty and fiscal officers for the Nevada National Guard.\n  After almost 40 years of military service, Chuck retired in 1991. He \ntaught military history at the University of Nevada-Reno, but his \npublic service to our State was not yet complete. Gov. Kenny Guinn \nappointed Chuck to be the executive director of the Nevada Office of \nVeterans Services in 2000, an office he faithfully served until this \nMarch.\n  Chuck presided over the Nevada Office of Veterans Services at a \ncritical point in our State's history. Since 1990, Nevada's veterans \npopulation has increased by more than 40 percent. This unprecedented \ngrowth put strain on many resources in Nevada, but Chuck was never \ndiscouraged.\n  Instead, he worked tirelessly for more staff and additional resources \nto help Nevada veterans.\n  Under Chuck's watch, Nevada modernized their veterans services \nincluding the completion of a new Veterans Nursing Home in Boulder \nCity. Chuck presided over the construction of this facility, which is \nhome to more than 162 of America's heroes. Another key part of Chuck's \nwork was his effort to improve veterans cemeteries through Nevada, \nincluding cemeteries at Boulder City and Fernley. I was pleased to work \nwith Chuck to secure Federal appropriations to expand these cemeteries.\n  The Board of Regents of the Nevada System of Higher Education has \nawarded Chuck their highest award, naming him a Distinguished Nevadan. \nWith his long list of accomplishments for Nevada's veterans, Chuck is \nmost deserving of this high honor, and I am pleased to recognize his \naccomplishments today before the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/15/senate-section/article/S4550-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4550-S4551]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      PEACE OFFICERS MEMORIAL DAY\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the brave \nmen and women who lost their lives while serving as law enforcement \nofficers and to thank them for making the ultimate sacrifice.\n  Today is Peace Officers Memorial Day, a day to honor all the law \nenforcement officers in our communities who have been killed or \ndisabled in the line of duty. I was proud to join Senator Patrick Leahy \non S. Res. 472, a Senate resolution, which passed the Senate last week, \ncommemorating this important day.\n  This past Saturday, thousands of people from across the country \ngathered at the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial here in \nWashington, DC, for a candlelight vigil to honor these fallen officers. \nAnd today, there was a Peace Officers Memorial Service in front of the \nU.S. Capitol for these brave men and women. I am proud that we had a \ndedicated group of Michigan officers in attendance, representing their \nfellow officers from around the State.\n  The names of 466 fallen officers were added to the memorial on \nSaturday, including 8 officers from Michigan: Lavern Steven Brann, \nBattle Creek, Michigan; William A. Daniels, Cassopolis, Michigan; Owen \nDavid Fisher, Flint, Michigan; Dale Francis Bernock, Dearborn, \nMichigan; Scot Andrew Beyerstedt, Mattawan, Michigan; Benjamin Lewis \nCarpenter, Newaygo,\n\n[[Page S4551]]\n\nMichigan; Michael Allen Scarbrough, Wayne County, Michigan; and Paul \nLee Mickel, Wayne County, Michigan. We honor all of these officers \ntoday.\n  In Michigan, we also remember two officers who recently lost their \nlives in the line of duty. Less then a month ago, Reserve Officer \nMatthew Tuttle and Chief Scott Sumner were killed in a helicopter \naccident in Scio Township while providing aerial support for officers \nwho were involved in a foot pursuit.\n  Chief Sumner was a 19-year veteran of the Chelsea Police Department, \nand Officer Tuttle was only 28 years old. Our thoughts and prayers go \nout to their families and the entire Chelsea Police Department.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I commemorate the hard work and \nsacrifices made daily by law enforcement officers all across our great \nland. Many have lost their lives in the line of duty so that our \nfamilies and communities may remain safe. We must never forget those \nwho have given their lives to protect us all.\n  The annual celebration of Peace Officers Memorial Day and National \nPolice Week during the calendar week has its roots in Public Law 87-\n726, which was signed into law on October 1, 1962 by President John F. \nKennedy. Public Law 87-726 designated this day and week as a time for \n``recognition of the service given by the men and women who, night and \nday, stand guard in our midst to protect us through enforcement of our \nlaws.'' This law was later amended during the 103rd Congress as part of \nthe Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act in 1994 to order the \nUnited States flag on all Government buildings displayed at half-staff \non May 15.\n  Since the turn of the last century, more than 60 law enforcement \nofficers have been killed in the line of duty in New Mexico. This year, \namong other activities, law enforcement officers from around the \ncountry honored the lives of three New Mexico police officers whose \nnames were recently added to the National Law Enforcement Officers \nMemorial in Washington, D.C. One occurred a very long time ago, and the \ntwo others just last year.\n  Officer Michael R. King and Officer Richard W. Smith, Jr., both of \nthe Albuquerque Police Department, are two of the three officers being \nhonored this year. Their deaths occurred on a day that has become \ningrained in the hearts of most New Mexicans as one of the bloodiest \nand most tragic in recent times. Officers King and Smith, longtime \nveterans of the Albuquerque Police Department, were responding to a \ncall on August 20, 2005 ordering the pickup of a mental health patient \nfrom Kaseman Hospital. When they arrived at the scene, Officers King \nand Smith had no way of knowing that the subject of their call, John \nHyde would be implicated in the shooting deaths of three people earlier \nthat day. During the pickup Officers King and Smith were gunned down in \nthe street before their murderer fled on a motorcycle. It took a force \nof approximately 300 of their fellow officers to chase down and finally \napprehend the man responsible for the deaths of these brave and \nrespected police officers.\n  The other officer honored this year was gunned down in Hope, New \nMexico approximately 108 years ago. At the time, Eddy County Deputy \nSheriff Bud Johnson had traveled to Hope in order to serve a warrant on \none L.E. Pratt in regard to an infraction over water control. According \nto the Eddy County Sheriff's Department, Pratt shot and killed Bud \nJohnson with a shotgun when he was notified of the warrant. Deputy \nSheriff Johnson died immediately.\n  Deputy Johnson's death shows us that the dangers of police work have \nbeen present throughout the long history of our Nation. All too \nrecently, citizens of New Mexico mourned the loss of Deputy James \nMcGrane, Jr., who was killed on March 22, 2006 during a traffic stop in \nTijeras, NM. While we remember those who have lost their lives, we also \ntake solace in the fact that many others have been able to survive the \ndangers of duty. Officer John Garcia, Officer Josh Otzenberger, \nSergeant Carol Oleksak, Deputy Shaun Sanchez, and Sheriff's pilot Chris \nHolland were all shot during the past two years while protecting our \ncommunities. We are thankful that most of them survived these close \nbrushes with death and were able to return to duty.\n  We should remember their dedication to protect and serve, and the \ntragic price they paid for that devotion. We must also remember the \nfamilies of all fallen officers and the sacrifices they have incurred \nbecause of a deep-seated commitment to duty and public service. All of \nus from New Mexico owe a debt of gratitude to each and every officer \nwho has lost their lives in the line of duty. To all who have paid the \nultimate price and to those who continue to serve, may we forever be \ngrateful and never take for granted what you do. You have my utmost \nadmiration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/15/senate-section/article/S4551-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4551]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MARLBORO MUSIC FESTIVAL\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Just south of Route 9 in southern Vermont, \nalong a tree-lined road, lies one of Vermont's distinctive \ndestinations, Marlboro College. Walk through this picturesque school in \nthe summer months and you will hear some of the sweetest melodies \nimaginable, or you may be enveloped by warm pulses of sound that seem \nto linger like the wispy clouds above. The sounds you hear are those of \nanother year of the Marlboro Music Festival.\n  Since its founding in 1951, this 8-week festival--one of the world's \npremiere chamber music workshops and weekend concert series--brings \nsome of the most renowned and experienced musicians together with the \nrising stars of tomorrow.\n  This year has marked the 40th anniversary of the Musicians From \nMarlboro, the festival's active touring program which sends the \nmusicians on the road to perform periodically across the country. At \nsome of the Nation's premier venues, including historic places like the \nFreer Gallery in Washington and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New \nYork, the concerts feature the exceptional music heard first in the \nMarlboro Music Festival.\n  As this remarkable event approaches again this year, spanning the \ngorgeous Vermont months of June through August, it is fitting to pause \nto note the accomplishments of the Musicians From Marlboro and the \nentire Marlboro Music Festival. For four decades, the festival's \ntouring group has brought their music to every corner of the United \nStates. For four decades, the musicians have set a model of artistic \nexcellence that has inspired other musicians and artists and their \naudiences. This band of musicians--outwardly casual but hard-driven in \ntheir pursuit of beauty and truth in their art--has moved thousands of \nconcert-goers.\n  The touring group has featured such superb musicians as Rudolph \nSerkin, Richard Goode, Benita Velente, and Murray Perahia. Performers \nwho went on to make up such noted ensembles as the Guarneri and Emerson \nString Quartets have received critical early boosts from the Marlboro \nexperience of intensive summers and the tours. Their alumni can be \nfound in many leading orchestras, from the Philadelphia Orchestra to \nthe Chicago Symphony Orchestra.\n  There is certainly something about Vermont and the Green Mountains \nthat helps inspire the ensemble. Whatever the inspiration, the \nMusicians From Marlboro are a superb reflection of the best Vermont has \nto offer.\n  Vermont is a richer place because of the Marlboro Music Festival, and \nthe festival and its musicians have touched innumerable audiences \nacross the country with their artistry. I know my colleagues join me in \ncongratulating the Marlboro Music Festival and its Musicians From \nMarlboro on this great achievement of 40 years of touring and in \nwishing the festival many more happy and sonorous decades to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/15/senate-section/article/S4551-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4551-S4552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  In the summer of 1988 in Orange County, CA, a group of six youths \nwent\n\n[[Page S4552]]\n\non a spree of beatings that police say was targeted at gay men. Robert \nJoyce testified that while walking along a stretch of coast popular to \ngay people, he was attacked by the youths. According to police reports, \nJoyce was beaten for several minutes, including being hit in the head \nwith a 2-inch metal pipe. He required 80 stitches to mend his wounds. \nDuring the attack the attackers yelled, ``Kill him! kill him! kill the \nfaggot!'' The group of youths attacked several other gay men in the \narea before being apprehended by police.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/15/senate-section/article/S4552-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    PROTECTING AMERICA'S MINERS ACT\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am proud to have introduced the Protecting America's \nMiners Act.\n  The need for this legislation is clear. This year began with the \nterrible tragedies at the Sago and Alma mines in West Virginia. Within \ndays of the new year, 14 coal miners had died. In February, I went to \nWest Virginia to meet with some of the families of the men who died. It \nwas one of the most moving visits I have had in my career in the \nSenate. I left West Virginia with renewed commitment to passing \nlegislation this year to improve safety and health conditions in our \nNation's mines. The expert testimony at the HELP Committee hearing on \nmine safety in March only reinforced my commitment.\n  I was also deeply moved earlier this month by the West Virginia \nhearings on the Sago mine disaster and Randal McCloy's letter to his \nfallen coworkers' families about the conditions in the mine after the \nexplosion. We have lost 26 coal miners so far this year--more than died \nin all of last year. The victims of these disasters and of prior \ndisasters, like the explosion at Jim Walters No. 5, deserve nothing \nless than our dedication to making sure that they did not die in vain. \nThe best way we can honor those fallen miners is to act on what we have \nlearned. This bill is an important step in fulfilling that commitment.\n  There are many things we may still learn from these tragedies. But \nsome lessons are already clear. We have not done enough to provide \nminers with oxygen and communications needed to survive an emergency. \nWe must strengthen our safety enforcement so companies cannot treat \nsafety violations as simply the cost of doing business. The average \nfine at the Sago mine was just $156 dollars--less than most parking \ntickets. And many safety and health standards are woefully outdated.\n  To address these lessons, this bill requires warning systems to alert \nminers when the air in the mine is becoming dangerous, before a \ndisaster occurs; the most up-to-date communications and tracking \ntechnology in mines as soon as possible so rescuers can locate and \ndirect miners in an emergency; more oxygen stored in mines so miners \ncan survive until they can evacuate or are rescued; rescue chambers so, \nas a last resort, if miners cannot evacuate, they can safely await \nrescue in the mine; and increased penalties for repeat violators and \nminimum penalties.\n  In addition, some very specific problems at the Sago mine came to \nlight during the hearings this month in West Virginia, such as \nineffective equipment, lack of communications, and families' exclusion \nfrom the investigation process. To address this, the bill requires \ncompanies to check on the reliability of the oxygen stored for use in \nan emergency; independent investigations and public hearings on serious \naccidents; and an opportunity for victims' families to participate in \naccident investigations.\n  This bill not only tries to learn from past disasters but also looks \nto the future. The bill includes a program to help MSHA replace its \naging inspector workforce. These new safety standards will do no good \nif MSHA cannot properly staff its inspection teams to ensure that the \nnew standards are being enforced. It also directs Federal research \ndollars where they are most urgently needed--to develop better \nbreathing apparatus, communications technology, atmospheric warning \nsystems, and mine rescue technology.\n  We have a responsibility as Members of Congress to see that our mine \nsafety laws make our mines the safest in the world. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Protecting America's Miners Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/15/senate-section/article/S4552-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              HONORING THE HONORABLE CHARLES L.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth \n     of Kentucky relative to urging support for the ``25 by 25'' \n     initiative promoting agricultural-based renewable energy; to \n     the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n                               Resolution\n\n       Whereas, having an affordable, reliable, and plentiful \n     energy supply is crucial to our economy, as well as our \n     national and international food supply; and\n       Whereas, current and future risks to U.S. energy security \n     are mounting, while domestic and global energy demands are \n     escalating; and\n       Whereas, the Commonwealth of Kentucky has tremendous \n     renewable energy resources; and\n       Whereas, the development of renewable energy sources, \n     including wind power, biodiesel, biomass, methane digesters, \n     ethanol, and solar, benefits the environment and will have a \n     direct economic benefit to agricultural landowners and rural \n     communities; and\n       Whereas, agricultural communities and their partners will \n     experience multiple benefits, including establishing \n     additional markets for agricultural commodities; increasing \n     farm income; creating added-value uses for crops, livestock, \n     and their byproducts; and creating new job opportunities; and\n       Whereas, American agriculture is well positioned to play an \n     expanded role in the development and implementation of new \n     energy solutions; and\n       Whereas, America's farms and ranches can become the \n     factories that produce a new generation of fuels to help meet \n     the nation's energy needs; and\n       Whereas, ``25 by 25'' is an agriculturally led initiative \n     that envisions America's farms and ranches producing 25 \n     percent of America's energy demand by the year 2025, while \n     continuing to produce abundant, safe, and affordable food and \n     fiber; and\n       Whereas, agriculture's role as an energy producer will have \n     a positive effect on national security and trade imbalances, \n     and will serve as a catalyst for rural development in the \n     Commonwealth of Kentucky; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the House of Representatives of the General \n     Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:\n       Section 1. We, the members of the Kentucky House of \n     Representatives, support and endorse the vision of ``25 by \n     25'' whereby agriculture will provide 25 percent of the total \n     energy consumed in the United States by the year 2025, while \n     continuing to produce abundant, safe, and affordable food and \n     fiber.\n       Section 2.

A bill to designate the Department of Veterans Affairs \nOutpatient Clinic in Tulsa, Oklahoma, as the ``Ernest Childers \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic''; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today for myself and on the behalf \nof my colleague, Dr. Coburn, to introduce a bill to honor the memory an \nAmerican hero and proud son from our great state of Oklahoma. Ernest \nChilders was the first Native American to receive the Congressional \nMedal of Honor. This is our Nation's highest military award and it was \nawarded to him by Congress ``for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity \nat risk of life above and beyond the call of duty in action.''\n  Ernest Childers was born in Broken Arrow, OK, on February 1, 1918, as \nthe third of five children. His father died when he was young and he \ngrew up mostly on a farm. His hunting skills in his youth provided much \nof the food for his family and formed the basis of a great military \ncareer.\n  Ernest Childers enlisted in the Oklahoma National Guard in 1937 while \nattending the Chilocco Indian School in north-central Oklahoma. He then \nwent to Fort Sill in Lawton, OK, for basic training before being \ndeployed to Africa in World War II. On September 22, 1943, despite a \nbroken instep that forced him to crawl, 2nd Lieutenant Childers \nadvanced against enemy machine gun nests in Oliveto, Italy, killing two \nsnipers and capturing an enemy mortar observer in the process. His \nactions were instrumental in helping the Americans win the Battle of \nOliveto and won him the Congressional Medal of Honor. He continued his \ncareer in the Army earning several other military awards including the \nCombat Infantry Badge, Europe and Africa Campaign Medals, The Purple \nHeart, The Bronze Star, and the Oklahoma Distinguished Service Cross. \nHe retired from the Army in August of 1965 as a Lieutenant Colonel in \nOklahoma's 45th Infantry Division.\n  Ernest Childers passed away on March 17, 2005 and was Oklahoma's last \nCongressional Medal of Honor winner still living in the state. He was \nan honored guest of many Presidential Inaugurations and as a Creek \nIndian, was named Oklahoma's Most Outstanding Indian by the Tulsa \nChapter of the Council of American Indians in 1966. He once said ``The \nAmerican Indian has only one country to defend, and when you're picked \non, the American Indian never turns his back.'' Mr. President, I am \nproud and believe it is only appropriate to introduce a bill to rename \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs' Outpatient Clinic in Tulsa, \nOklahoma, the Ernest Childers Department of Veterans Affairs Outpatient \nClinic to honor the enduring legacy of a true hero and fine soldier.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/15/senate-section/article/S4555-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4555]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SUBMITTED RESOLUTONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 477--COMMEMORATING THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DATE \n   THAT RICK MONDAY HEROICALLY RESCUED THE AMERICAN FLAG FROM BEING \n DESECRATED AND RECOGNIZING RICK MONDAY FOR HIS COURAGE AND PATRIOTISM\n\n  Mr. LOTT submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 477\n\n       Whereas, on April 25, 1976, Rick Monday played centerfield \n     for the Chicago Cubs in a game against the Los Angeles \n     Dodgers at Dodger Stadium;\n       Whereas, during the 4th inning of that game, 2 individuals \n     ran onto the outfield of Dodger Stadium, doused an American \n     Flag with lighter fluid, and attempted to set the Flag on \n     fire;\n       Whereas, once Rick Monday recognized that those individuals \n     were about to publicly desecrate the American Flag, he \n     quickly ran towards those individuals and grabbed the \n     American Flag from them just as they were attempting to place \n     a lit match on to the Flag;\n       Whereas the patriotic act of Rick Monday to rescue the \n     American Flag inspired--\n       (1) the crowd at Dodger Stadium to stand in ovation and \n     spontaneously begin singing ``God Bless America'';\n       (2) millions of citizens throughout the United States, \n     especially those citizens who were serving or had served in \n     the Armed Forces; and\n       (3) citizens of the United States who today continue look \n     to the Flag as a symbol of liberty and justice;\n       Whereas Rick Monday, after reflecting on his act of \n     rescuing the American Flag, said: ``That flag represents all \n     the rights and freedoms that we have in this country. If you \n     desecrate the flag, you desecrate the efforts of all the \n     people who fought and died to protect those rights and \n     freedoms.'';\n       Whereas the Major League Baseball Hall of Fame recognizes \n     the actions taken by Rick Monday when he saved the American \n     Flag as 1 of the 100 Classic Moments in the history of \n     baseball;\n       Whereas Rick Monday served the United States honorably and \n     courageously in the Marine Corps Reserve for over 6 years;\n       Whereas Rick Monday was a 2-time Major League Baseball All-\n     Star during his distinguished, 19-year career; and\n       Whereas April 25, 2006, marked the 30th anniversary of the \n     date that Rick Monday saved the American Flag from being \n     desecrated: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commemorates the 30th anniversary of the date that Rick \n     Monday heroically rescued the American Flag from being \n     desecrated;\n       (2) recognizes Rick Monday for--\n       (A) his courage and patriotism;\n       (B) upholding the noble ideals and freedoms represented by \n     the American Flag; and\n       (C) honoring the men and women whose sacrifices have \n     protected those ideals and freedoms;\n       (3) respectfully requests the Secretary of the Senate to \n     transmit an enrolled copy of this resolution to--\n       (A) Rick Monday;\n       (B) the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in \n     Cooperstown, New York;\n       (C) the Commissioner of Major League Baseball, Bud Selig;\n       (D) the owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers owner, Frank \n     McCourt; and\n       (E) the owner of the Chicago Cubs, the Tribune Company.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/15/senate-section/article/S4555-3", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4555]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 478--COMMEMORATING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CHARGE-\n                             COUPLED DEVICE\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBURG submitted the following resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Wartime Treatment Study \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 802. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) During World War II, the United States successfully \n     fought the spread of Nazism and fascism by Germany, Italy, \n     and Japan.\n       (2) Nazi Germany persecuted and engaged in genocide against \n     Jews and certain other groups. By the end of the war, \n     6,000,000 Jews had perished at the hands of Nazi Germany. \n     United States Government policies, however, restricted entry \n     to the United States to Jewish and other refugees who sought \n     safety from Nazi persecution.\n       (3) While we were at war, the United States treated the \n     Japanese American, German American, and Italian American \n     communities as suspect.\n       (4) The United States Government should conduct an \n     independent review to assess fully and acknowledge these \n     actions. Congress has previously reviewed the United States \n     Government's wartime treatment of Japanese Americans through \n     the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of \n     Civilians. An independent review of the treatment of German \n     Americans and Italian Americans and of Jewish refugees \n     fleeing persecution and genocide has not yet been undertaken.\n       (5) During World War II, the United States Government \n     branded as ``enemy aliens'' more than 600,000 Italian-born \n     and 300,000 German-born United States resident aliens and \n     their families and required them to carry Certificates of \n     Identification, limited their travel, and seized their \n     personal property. At that time, these groups were the two \n     largest foreign-born groups in the United States.\n       (6) During World War II, the United States Government \n     arrested, interned or otherwise detained thousands of \n     European Americans, some remaining in custody for years after \n     cessation of World War II hostilities, and repatriated, \n     exchanged, or deported European Americans, including \n     American-born children, to hostile, war-torn European Axis \n     nations, many to be exchanged for Americans held in those \n     nations.\n\n[[Page S4557]]\n\n       (7) Pursuant to a policy coordinated by the United States \n     with Latin American countries, many European Latin Americans, \n     including German and Austrian Jews, were captured, shipped to \n     the United States and interned. Many were later expatriated, \n     repatriated or deported to hostile, war-torn European Axis \n     nations during World War II, most to be exchanged for \n     Americans and Latin Americans held in those nations.\n       (8) Millions of European Americans served in the armed \n     forces and thousands sacrificed their lives in defense of the \n     United States.\n       (9) The wartime policies of the United States Government \n     were devastating to the Italian Americans and German American \n     communities, individuals and their families. The detrimental \n     effects are still being experienced.\n       (10) Prior to and during World War II, the United States \n     restricted the entry of Jewish refugees who were fleeing \n     persecution and sought safety in the United States. During \n     the 1930's and 1940's, the quota system, immigration \n     regulations, visa requirements, and the time required to \n     process visa applications affected the number of Jewish \n     refugees, particularly those from Germany and Austria, who \n     could gain admittance to the United States.\n       (11) Time is of the essence for the establishment of \n     commissions, because of the increasing danger of destruction \n     and loss of relevant documents, the advanced age of potential \n     witnesses and, most importantly, the advanced age of those \n     affected by the United States Government's policies. Many who \n     suffered have already passed away and will never know of this \n     effort.\n\n     SEC. 803.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 477 which was submitted earlier \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 477) commemorating the 30th \n     anniversary of the date that Rick Monday heroically rescued \n     the American flag from being desecrated.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the baseball field has been the setting for \nsome of the most meaningful moments in American history. It was on a \nbaseball field that the great slugger Lou Gehrig, shortly after \nlearning he was suffering from a fatal disease, delivered his \npoignantly stirring farewell speech, in which he declared himself to be \n``the luckiest man on the face of the earth.'' It was on a baseball \nfield that Jackie Robinson broke the color line that had prevented \nAfrican Americans from competing in the Major Leagues, thus triggering \nnot only integration in professional baseball but the removal of racial \nbarriers throughout American society as well. And it was on a baseball \nfield 30 years ago that another significant moment took place, one that \ncontinues to resonate in the minds of millions of Americans.\n  On April 25, 1976, the Chicago Cubs were playing the Los Angeles \nDodgers in an afternoon game at Dodger Stadium. It was early in the \nseason; thus, not much was riding on the game's outcome. Both teams \nwere under .500 at the time. So for the fans in attendance, there was \nlittle reason to believe at the outset that the game ultimately would \nbe anything more than pleasantly forgettable.\n  That all changed during the bottom of the game's fourth inning. The \nDodgers were at bat when two protestors ran out onto the outfield grass \ncarrying an American flag. These two proceeded to spread the flag on \nthe ground, douse it with lighter fluid, and pull out some matches. \nPlaying centerfield for the Cubs that day was Rick Monday. As soon as \nhe recognized that these individuals were about to burn the American \nflag, Monday charged towards them. As Monday--a former Marine Corps \nreservist--would later describe, ``I was mad. What they were trying to \ndo was wrong. It was wrong in 1976, and I still think it's wrong today. \n. . . That flag represents all the rights and freedoms that we have in \nthis country. If you desecrate the flag, you desecrate the efforts of \nall the people who fought and died to protect those rights and \nfreedoms.'' Just as one of the protestors was about to put a lit match \nto the American flag, Monday--while running at full speed--grabbed the \nflag away.\n  The legendary Hall of Fame broadcaster Vin Scully did the radio play-\nby-play for the Dodgers that day. His real-time description of the \nincident was as follows:\n\n       There's two of them. I'm not sure what he's doing out \n     there. It looks like he's going to burn a flag. And Rick \n     Monday runs and takes it away from him!. . . . I think a guy \n     was going to set fire to an American flag, can you imagine \n     that? Monday, when he realized what [the protestor] was going \n     to do, raced over and took the flag away from him. . . . This \n     guy was going to try and perform the indignity of setting \n     fire to the American flag. . . . It looked like a piece of \n     cloth but you couldn't really tell from here what it was. But \n     Monday, from his angle, took one look and realized it was a \n     flag. And the fellow evidently was all set to set fire to \n     it when Monday realized it.\n       And Rick will get an ovation and properly so. So Rick \n     Monday--his alertness and quick thinking--gets a round of \n     applause in center field. And on the message board, it just \n     says, ``Rick Monday--You Made a Great Play.'' And Monday is \n     getting another ovation, and well he should. And now a lot of \n     the folks are standing, and now the whole ballpark. And he's \n     going to get a standing ovation.\n\n  Rick Monday's courageous and patriotic act of saving the American \nflag from public desecration then inspired the crowd at Dodger Stadium \nto spontaneously begin singing ``God Bless America.'' As Monday \nremembers it, ``It moved the entire crowd. I don't remember if we won \nor lost the game, but I'll never forget the people singing.''\n  Rick Monday soon began receiving thousands of letters from people all \nacross the country thanking him for rescuing the flag. His heroic act \nwas especially inspiring to those men and women who were serving in the \nmilitary or were war veterans. For instance, Monday received a letter \nfrom a Vietnam veteran who, as Monday described:\n\n     wrote that there were two things that he had with him in two \n     tours of Vietnam. These two things kept him in check with \n     reality. One was a small picture of his wife. The other was a \n     small American flag that was neatly folded. The picture was \n     folded inside the flag and in the left breast pocket of his \n     uniform. He would be in mud for weeks and months at a time. \n     Those two things were what he looked at to connect him with \n     reality, other than his buddies, and some of them were lost \n     in battle. He wrote in the letter, ``Thanks for protecting \n     what those of us who were in Vietnam held onto dearly.''\n\n  More recently, Monday was visiting the U.S.S. Arizona Memorial in \nHawaii when a survivor of Pearl Harbor walked up to him. When Monday \nwent to shake his hand, the veteran--with tears in his eyes--raised his \narm and saluted Monday. He then told Monday, ``What you did reaffirmed \neverything we did as members of the Armed Services.''\n  To fully appreciate what Rick Monday did 30 years ago, one must \nremember what the country was going through at that time. The Vietnam \nWar and Watergate had left our country bitterly divided, and America \nwas\n\n[[Page S4566]]\n\nstruggling to regain its confidence in the tumultuous aftermath. In \nsaving the American flag from those who sought to desecrate it, Monday \nconveyed through his actions that the country the flag represents, as \nwell as the liberty and justice the flag symbolizes, are precious and \nworth defending. Monday's rescue of the flag thus helped rejuvenate \nAmerican patriotism throughout the country. For this reason, the \nBaseball Hall of Fame recognizes the actions taken by Monday when he \nsaved the American Flag as one of the 100 Classic Moments in the \nhistory of baseball.\n  Because of the courage and patriotism demonstrated on a baseball \nfield by Rick Monday 30 years ago, I am pleased to introduce a \nresolution commemorating the 30th anniversary of the date that Rick \nMonday heroically rescued the American flag from being desecrated. It \nis a fitting way to honor a historic act performed by a man who not \nonly was a great ballplayer but who is a great American as well.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 477) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S.

If you \n     desecrate the flag, you desecrate the efforts of all the \n     people who fought and died to protect those rights and \n     freedoms.'';\n       Whereas the Major League Baseball Hall of Fame recognizes \n     the actions taken by Rick Monday when he saved the American \n     Flag as 1 of the 100 Classic Moments in the history of \n     baseball;\n       Whereas Rick Monday served the United States honorably and \n     courageously in the Marine Corps Reserve for over 6 years;\n       Whereas Rick Monday was a 2-time Major League Baseball All-\n     Star during his distinguished, 19-year career; and\n       Whereas April 25, 2006, marked the 30th anniversary of the \n     date that Rick Monday saved the American Flag from being \n     desecrated: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commemorates the 30th anniversary of the date that Rick \n     Monday heroically rescued the American Flag from being \n     desecrated;\n       (2) recognizes Rick Monday for--\n       (A) his courage and patriotism;\n       (B) upholding the noble ideals and freedoms represented by \n     the American Flag; and\n       (C) honoring the men and women whose sacrifices have \n     protected those ideals and freedoms;\n       (3) respectfully requests the Secretary of the Senate to \n     transmit an enrolled copy of this resolution to--\n       (A) Rick Monday;\n       (B) the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in \n     Cooperstown, New York;\n       (C) the Commissioner of Major League Baseball, Bud Selig;\n       (D) the owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers owner, Frank \n     McCourt; and\n       (E) the owner of the Chicago Cubs, the Tribune Company.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/15/senate-section/article/S4566-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           COMMEMORATING DEVELOPMENT OF CHARGE-COUPLED DEVICE\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Res. 478) commemorating the development of \n     the charge-coupled device.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate is poised to \npass this resolution today honoring the invention of the charge-coupled \ndevice, or CCD, which has greatly improved our level of imaging \ntechnology.\n  In 1969, Dr. Willard S. Boyle and Dr. George E. Smith worked together \nat Bell Labs in Murray Hill, NJ, and created a basic design for a \nsilicon-memory chip, known as a CCD. This breakthrough technology was \ncrucial to advancing digital imaging technology and can be found in \nmost imaging devices, including digital cameras and video recorders, \nspace-based telescopes and satellites, and medical imaging devices.\n  A CCD contains a light-sensitive chip that is able to store small \namounts of charges in capacitors. A group of these capacitors create a \npixel, which can be combined with other pixels to generate an image. \nThe first CCD had just six pixels while the average camera now contains \nfour to six million pixels. It is a credit to Dr. Boyle and Dr. Smith's \ninnovation that this technology has been developed into the high \nresolution images we use in our every day lives.\n  Each year, the National Academy of Engineering honors an engineer or \nengineers whose accomplishments have significantly bettered society by \nimproving our quality of life, providing the ability to live freely and \ncomfortably, and/or easing access to information. This year, the \nAcademy has chosen to honor Dr. Boyle and Dr. Smith with the \nprestigious Charles Stark Draper Prize for their innovation in imaging \ntechnology and invention of the CCD.\n  The National Inventors Hall of Fame has also chosen to commemorate \nDr. Boyle and Dr. Smith's contributions to society by inducting them \ninto their Hall of Fame. The National Inventors Hall of Fame was \nfounded in 1973 by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the \nNational Council of Intellectual Property Law Associations.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me in commemorating the \ncontributions to our society and standard of living that CCD technology \nhas made and congratulating Dr. Willard S. Boyle and Dr. George E. \nSmith for their justly deserved awards.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent the resolution be agreed to, the \npreamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nand any statements related thereto be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am glad we are returning to the \nimmigration bill, as Senator Frist has alluded. I am concerned, as he \nis, there will be so many amendments offered we may not be able to \nbring it to a satisfactory conclusion soon.\n  We tried to get a limitation on amendments on the Democratic side and \nwere unsuccessful and decided, finally, in desperation really, to go \nforward and to have amendments offered on the floor in the hopes that \nMembers who offer them would accept reasonable limitations on their \ndebate time.\n  It was unusual that when we debated health insurance for small \nbusinesses last week, the Republican majority used a procedure called \n``filling the tree,'' and then, of course, the cloture motion to cut \noff amendments, to limit amendments. When it comes to immigration, \nthere has been no effort by the majority to do that. So we are going to \nface quite a few amendments, and I hope we can handle them in a \nreasonable and expeditious way.\n  This is an important bill. Comprehensive immigration reform is \nnecessary in America. Our system is broken, badly broken. It does not \nprotect America as it should, and it is not fair to people who have \ncome to this country. We have to find a reasonable way to come up with \ncomprehensive, tough but fair law when it comes to the issue of \nimmigration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/15/senate-section/article/S4568-3", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4568-S4570]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, there is another law that has an important \nmilestone today and that is Medicare prescription Part D. I remember \nthis bill when it was debated about 2\\1/2\\ years ago--2\\1/2\\ years ago \non the floor of the Senate--and was passed and enacted by the \nPresident.\n  So the administration had 2 years to get ready, 2 years to be \nprepared for the millions of people under Medicare who would become \neligible for a prescription drug benefit.\n  This is an important benefit, one that was not included in the \noriginal Medicare legislation. In those days, there were not that many \nprescription drugs, and they were not that good. Now we have quite a \nvariety of very good drugs available to help the elderly and others \nstay healthy and strong and independent. So adding a prescription drug \nbenefit to Medicare made sense.\n  Keeping people healthy and at home rather than sick and in the \nhospital or in the nursing home is not only morally right, it makes \nsense financially. So we passed a bill 2\\1/2\\ years ago. But it was not \na very good one. It was extremely complicated.\n  Imagine, if you will, a bill written by the pharmaceutical industry \nand the insurance industry. And that is what we ended up with, a bill \nthat allows those two industries to capitalize on opportunities for \nprofit-taking, which they are going to do and already have done. \nUnfortunately, it is at the expense of senior citizens.\n  In my State of Illinois, seniors who are trying to figure out which \nmight be the best approach for their prescription drugs have 45 \ndifferent choices. Forty-five choices may sound like a holiday for \nsome, akin to going to shop at a department store, but for many seniors \nit became overwhelming and confusing.\n  They tried to get help. They called the Medicare hotline. That was \nsupposed to be the 1-800 number that would answer their questions. If \nyou could get through--after waiting for a long period of time--surveys \nof people who tried to get through found that many times they were \ngiving out bad information.\n  They also put out brochures. Medicare put out some written \ninformation for seniors, and people looked at it closely and said: \nWell, this is wrong. It is written poorly. It does not describe the law \nas it currently exists.\n  So what was a senior to do? Many of them turned to family friends. I \nhave had friends of mine whose moms and dads had to make this call. \nThey sat down with them, worked through the paperwork. They went \nonline. They helped them make the choice. But that was not always the \ncase. Some people don't have a family member who is available or one \nwho can understand the complexities of this choice. So they went to \nother places.\n  They would go to their pharmacist. So many pharmacists--I want to \nsalute them this evening--so many pharmacists gave up their time. \nFrankly, that is what they have to sell, their time and professional \nadvice. And they gave it up for their customers to try to help them \nthrough this immensely complicated legislation.\n  Where are we today? Well, today, as the enrollment deadline is \nreached on May 15, 6 million Medicare recipients have yet to sign up \nfor prescription drug benefits. If you say: Well, being out of 40 \nmillion or so, then you have done pretty well. It ignores the fact that \nover 25 million already had coverage. They were already covered with \nprescription drug protection. So we were setting out to sign up some 15 \nor 16 million, and we did not get it done and fell short--fell short by \nabout 40 percent or maybe more. The final figures will come in, in the \nnext few days.\n  Of the 6 million who have not signed up as of today, 3.2 million are \nlow-income elderly and disabled. They are eligible for extra help in \npaying for their medicine.\n  In my home State, approximately 478,000 eligible beneficiaries have \nyet to sign up. That is about one-third of the eligible people in my \nhome State of Illinois.\n  Despite the best efforts of all the senior citizen groups, all of the \ntraveling by the President, and all of the information that has been \ngiven, a third of the eligible people have not signed up for Medicare \nprescription Part D in my State.\n  That is an indication of the tough choice that many have to make. \nAccording to the latest numbers available from Social Security, only 21 \npercent of seniors in Illinois eligible for extra help have been \nenrolled. Millions of beneficiaries need more time. Many beneficiaries \nare simply overwhelmed by the unnecessary complexity and confusion of a \nprogram that could have been so simple and straightforward.\n  Even if they take appropriate steps, they don't always get good \ninformation, and many of these people will not sign up by the deadline. \nThe Government Accountability Office completed a study last week that \nfound that Medicare's written promotional materials used too much \ntechnical jargon, that the call waiting times lasted from a few minutes \nto close to an hour, and the Government Web site was so confusing that \nmany people gave up before completing the process.\n  Someone wrote in the New York Times today that this is clearly a \nsituation where a program was designed and written by people who don't \nview Government as a solution to a problem, they view Government as a \nproblem. So they created a program that is entirely too complicated and \nconfusing.\n  Investigators at GAO posed as seniors or individuals helping seniors \nand they placed 500 calls to 1-800-MEDICARE and found that about a \nthird of them resulted in bad information being given to seniors. These \nmistakes just added to the confusion. So what happens? If somebody \nfails to sign up today, when they were supposed to, unfortunately, \nthere are going to be some dire consequences. First, they will not be \nable to enroll in a prescription drug plan under Part D until November \n15 for coverage that starts in January of 2007. So for the remainder of \nthis year, they will not have the protection of a\n\n[[Page S4569]]\n\nprescription drug plan, even if they explained it to them and they \ncould make their choice.\n  In addition, if they didn't sign up by today, under current law, as \nwritten and passed by this Senate and signed by the President, these \nseniors are going to face a significant penalty, an increase in monthly \npremiums of 1 percent for every month past the deadline. That means \nthey will automatically be subject to a 7-percent minimum penalty tax \nfor the rest of their lives. This is not a one-time penalty. They are \nstuck, branded. They came in too late, and they are supposed to pay the \nprice.\n  I cannot tell you how many times we Democrats have come to the floor \nand said this is unfair. We need to extend the deadline and lift the \npenalty on those who otherwise would face the 7 percent indefinitely, \nfor the rest of their lives, and we need to change this program.\n  Time after time, the Republican majority said: No, we are going to \nstick with this. It is tough, but that is the way it has to be.\n  It is my understanding that come tomorrow there will be an effort \nmade--a bipartisan effort--to extend the deadline and lift the penalty. \nWe are not sure. But delaying the penalty would be a good start. \nWithout delaying the enrollment deadline, however, 6 million seniors \nwill be left without coverage between now and November. Countless more \nwill be left in limbo if they say there is no penalty if you didn't \nsign up by May 15, but you cannot sign up until November. Some people \nwill be stuck with no opportunity to seek and to have the coverage they \nneed for their prescription drugs.\n  In addition to the millions of seniors who have not yet signed up, \nthere are many awaiting decisions from Medicare after filing complaints \nabout various enrollment problems. They need more time.\n  Let me tell you about this afternoon. My office received a call from \na couple in Illinois. They are enrolled in the Illinois Cares Rx \nprogram, a program for low-income seniors. This couple also had \nsupplemental insurance through a former employer. Under the Illinois \nCares Rx program, they could only enroll in one of two plans. They \nenrolled last December and until last week had been successfully \nfilling prescriptions covered by the plan. Then, unknown to them, their \nformer employer also signed them up for a plan. So the couple has been \nenrolled in two plans since January. Rather than giving the couple a \nchoice of plans, Medicare now has automatically disenrolled them from \nthe plan they had originally selected. They just learned this. The plan \nchosen by their former employer is not one of the two participating \nIllinois Cares Rx plans, which means the couple is now ineligible for \nthe Medicare Part D Program and are paying nearly half of their monthly \nincome for premiums and copays.\n  So this is an example of the complexity of this system. When you let \nall of these different entities bombard seniors who are doing their \nbest to understand what is best for them--in my office, my staff \nassistant, Christa Donahue, received a phone call last year from a \nwoman who said she wasn't sure which plan to take. We asked her: Can \nyou tell us what prescription drugs you are currently taking? She gave \nus a list of four or five drugs. We decided, for our own knowledge, to \ntake those five drugs and go after the 45 different plans in Illinois \nand see what happened to them. I will tell you what happened. Day after \nday, and week after week, the protection that had been promised in each \nof those plans changed. On any given day, the plan could drop one of \nthe drugs they originally said they would cover or it could increase or \ndecrease the price of the drug.\n  So seniors who believed they had signed up for something they could \ncount on could not be sure. They could not be certain their drug would \nbe covered when they needed it to be covered. They could not be certain \nnew drugs would be covered, and they could not be certain of the price.\n  It was written in a way that always gave the advantage to the drug \ncompany and the insurance company at the expense of the senior citizen. \nNow, this couple thought they had done the right thing and it turns \nout, because of this bureaucratic glitch, they have been denied \ncoverage for their prescription drugs and won't have a chance to sign \nup until November for the next year. Meanwhile, nearly half of their \nmonthly income is going into premiums and copays.\n  So this is a situation that could have been avoided with a simpler \nbill, one designed to help seniors, one they could understand. It \nwasn't written that way; it was written to protect profits.\n  Even more surprising about this couple is, when they called Medicare \nand requested that they be switched back to the original plan that \nsaves them the most money, they were told the change was impossible to \nmake because they had already used up their one opportunity to switch \nplans during their initial enrollment period. Talk about bureaucratic \nmuckity-muck. These poor folks are going to be stuck because the law we \nwrote was so complicated and because the bureaucracy decided to \npenalize them. I hope they will get by--at great sacrifice--until we \ncan clear up the problem and straighten up this law.\n\n  Unless Medicare resolves this couple's problems today--and we tried \nduring the course of the day--they are going to be stuck in the wrong \nplan until November, forced to pay higher premiums and higher drug \nprices, through no fault of their own.\n  That is one story. Seniors need more time. We certainly should extend \nthe enrollment deadline until the end of the year. We should suspend \nany penalty during that period of time, and we also should do something \nI think is critically important: we ought to acknowledge the obvious. \nWe should have allowed Medicare to offer an option under this plan--\nyes, one Medicare option that people could turn to as the standard \noption.\n  I am not saying private insurance companies could not compete with \nthe Medicare option, but if Medicare was negotiating for the lowest \ndrug prices for seniors, we know what would happen.\n  The Veterans' Administration negotiated to help seniors bring costs \ndown and that brought the cost of drugs down. It made more drugs \navailable for the veterans who served our country. The same could have \nhappened for seniors under Medicare. The pharmaceutical companies and \ninsurance companies knew that. They didn't want Medicare's bargaining \npower to bring it down to the lowest prices. So they stopped our \nefforts--repeated efforts--to allow Medicare to offer an option under \nMedicare prescription Part D.\n  It is time to change that. It is time to allow Medicare to negotiate \nfor seniors, to bring down costs even at the expense of profit taking \nby the drug companies.\n  If this sounds vaguely familiar, it is what Canada does. They have \ndone that to protect their seniors and others living in their country. \nThey have said to the drug companies: You are entitled to a profit but \nnot profiteering. You are entitled to make money for additional \nresearch but not at the expense of some of the most vulnerable people \nin Canada.\n  So they limited the amount of increase each year in the cost of the \nprescription drugs. That is why even today many people--even people in \nmy family--are going to Canada to buy drugs. They are much cheaper \nthere than in the United States. The difference between Canada and the \nUnited States is not a difference in culture, it is a difference in \nleadership--leadership where their Government stood up for seniors and, \nin this case, our Government stood up for pharmaceutical companies and \ninsurance companies, so drugs would be more expensive than they should \nbe and seniors will pay more and the benefit will not be as good as it \nshould be.\n  We have problems with this bill, a doughnut hole. Wait until the \nmiddle of the year when it reaches 2,200. At that point coverage stops. \nPeople still will pay monthly premiums for their prescription drug \nplan, and in addition they are going to have to pay out of pocket \nalmost $3,000 before the coverage kicks in again. It is going to be a \ntime of awakening and reckoning.\n  I think that many who supported the plan and voted for it--I did \nnot--will have to explain to their seniors how this makes sense. May 15 \nwill come and go. The efforts to extend the deadline, to lift the \npenalty and change the plan, despite being made many times on the floor \nof the Senate, have been rejected.\n  By tomorrow, I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will put \naside\n\n[[Page S4570]]\n\ntheir loyalty to this flawed plan and be more loyal to the seniors who \ncount on us every day.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/15/senate-section/article/S4570-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4570]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:45 A.M.
