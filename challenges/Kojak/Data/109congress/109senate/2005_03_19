Mr. President, the Congress has been working nonstop over \nthe last 3 days to do its part to uphold human dignity and affirm the \nculture of life. I am pleased to announce that the House and Senate \nRepublican leadership have reached an agreement on a legislative \nsolution. The Senate has come in today to pass an adjournment \nresolution which we will send shortly to the House of Representatives. \nProcedurally, this action will have the effect of bringing the House \ninto session so they can either pass compromise legislation by \nunanimous consent on Sunday or place this legislation on the suspension \ncalendar for consideration early Monday morning. The Senate will be \nprepared to reconvene as soon as the House passes this new legislation.\n  It has been more than 24 hours since Terri Schiavo's feeding tube was \nremoved. Under the legislation we will soon consider, Terri Schiavo \nwill have another chance. It is a simple bill, only two pages long. It \nallows Terri's case to be heard in Federal court. More specifically, it \nallows a Federal district judge to consider a claim ``by or on behalf \nof Theresa Marie Schiavo for the alleged violation of any right of \nTheresa Marie Schiavo under the Constitution or laws of the United \nStates relating to the withholding or withdrawal of food, fluids, or \nmedical treatment necessary to sustain her life.''\n  I am pleased with our progress thus far, and I am committed as leader \nto see this legislation pass and give Terri Schiavo one last chance at \nlife.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/19/senate-section/article/S3095-7", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3095-S3096]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--H.R. 841\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
