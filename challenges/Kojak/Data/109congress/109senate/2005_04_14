Mr. President, once again today, the Senate will be in a \nperiod for morning business for 60 minutes. Following that time, the \nSenate will resume debate on the emergency supplemental appropriations \nbill. We have several amendments pending from yesterday that are \ncurrently under review, and Members may want to speak to those \namendments.\n  Much of the day yesterday we spent--both on the floor and off the \nfloor--discussing the immigration issue. The issues surrounding \nimmigration are critically important to our economy, to equity, and to \nsecurity and fairness. They are all vital to this country. The \nleadership has encouraged those who want to participate in a \ncomprehensive debate on immigration to postpone consideration of their \namendments from this standpoint because this is an emergency \nsupplemental spending bill to support our troops in Iraq and \nAfghanistan and to have appropriate funding for tsunami relief.\n  There will be a time later, before the end of the year, when we will \naddress immigration in a comprehensive way. In spite of that, we have \nrespected the rights of individual Senators who feel they absolutely \nmust address specific issues, but I continue to encourage those who \nwant to address immigration in a comprehensive way to do so at a more \nappropriate time.\n  I know we can work out a process to keep moving forward on the \nemergency supplemental bill, but we have to address specifically the \nrange of immigration issues that have been brought forth to the \nmanagers.\n\n  The managers will continue to consider the amendments that are \nbrought forward. Amendments that are brought forward, I encourage they \nrelate to the supplemental emergency spending bill as much as possible. \nWe expect votes over the course of today, and we will have, I expect, a \nvery busy schedule over the course of the day.\n  Mr. President, I have a few other remarks to make, but I will be \nhappy to turn to the Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I thank the leader. I say through the Chair \nto the majority leader, we have worked--even started working last \nweek--on the immigration amendments. We have a finite list now. We have \n12 amendments. I think that can be whittled down, for lack of a better \nword, to even less than that, considerably less than that.\n  What we should do is lock in these amendments as a finite list. \nWithin a very short period of time, we can find out how many really \nhave to be offered.\n  The pending amendment, the one Senator Mikulski offered, will have \nnearly--in fact, it may have--60 votes. So that will be adopted with \nease.\n  I hope we do not have to file cloture on this bill. I acknowledge \nthis is important legislation. The money for the funding of the troops \nis absolutely necessary. All one has to do is read the paper every \nmorning to understand how badly our troops need it. I was just there, \nand they need all the resources they can get. We want to make sure they \ndo not have to wait a second for what they need.\n\n[[Page S3610]]\n\n  I will work with the leader through the morning and early afternoon, \nand see if we can get this number whittled down. Also, the majority \nleader has a few on his side.\n  I hope we can limit the immigration amendments to very few--I would \nsay, at the most, three on each side, or four at most, and have the \nothers set aside until a time the majority leader has indicated he will \ngive, sometime before we finish work this year, so there can be a full \ndebate on those immigration matters.\n  As the leader knows, the problem--and he had nothing to do with it--\nis in this bill. There is immigration material in this bill. They have \nso-called REAL ID which came about as a result of our trying to get \nother legislation done last year. An arrangement was made by the House \nleadership that they would allow, on the first moving vehicle to come \nalong, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee to put his legislation \nin the bill. It is in this bill. That is the problem we have.\n  The Republican leader did not want it in this bill, I did not want it \nin this bill, but it is in the bill. As a result, we do not have the \nnormal objection that is available when we legislate on an \nappropriations bill.\n  I will work with the leader. We will get staff working on this, as \nthey have, to see if we can narrow this considerably. The amendments \nthat deal with the subject matter at hand, the funding of this bill, \nare just a few in number. We dealt with some of the most important ones \nyesterday.\n  I hope we can finish this bill in a reasonably good period of time, \nand maybe, if we are fortunate, we can get something such as the \nhighway bill or something such as that before we finish our work \nperiod--maybe the TANF bill, whatever is out there for us to do.\n  I understand the problems the leader has, and I will be happy to work \nwith him to alleviate his load as much as possible.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I have a few other comments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/14/senate-section/article/S3610-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             H2N2 FLU VIRUS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, there is one issue I talked about initially \nMonday and want to bring forth once again.\n  Nothing is more important than the safety of the American people, and \nwe have a lot of work to do in a particular area. Yesterday we learned \nthat samples of the deadly H2N2 flu virus were accidentally shipped to \n5,000 laboratories all over the world. Thankfully, nearly all of the \nsamples have been destroyed.\n  The H2N2 virus is lethal. It is fatal. Back in 1957, it killed over \n70,000 people just here in the United States and as many as 1 million \nto 4 million people around the world.\n  This latest news underscores, once again, just how vulnerable we are \nas an American people, as a world people, because viruses know no \nborders, they know no geography. There are no barriers.\n  On Monday, 3 days ago, I spoke of the need to bolster State \npreparedness and Federal preparedness in this arena. I mentioned that \nexotic and deadly viruses, such as the Marburg virus that at this very \nmoment is racking all of northern Angola--the Marburg virus being a \nvirus which is an Ebola-like virus, a hemorrhagic-fever-type virus--\nthose viruses that are racking that country which we do not understand, \nfor which we have no cure, for which we have no vaccine, are literally \njust a plane ride away from this room or from whoever is listening to \nme now through the media around the country. It is just a plane ride \naway.\n  Avian flu has already killed 50 people. Some say, 50 people, that is \nnot thousands of people. But it is 50 people from a virus that not too \nlong ago we did not know anything about, that began to be harbored in \nbirds, and now is being harbored in other animals and now has killed \nand jumped to kill 50 people; with just a tiny drift and ultimately a \nshift in a mutation, it becomes transmissible.\n  Once again, we have no vaccine for avian flu. It is something for \nwhich we have no cure. We only have to look back to 1917, another type \nof avian flu, but very similar, which killed a half a million \nAmericans, 50 million people around the world.\n  Meanwhile, as all this goes on, there are only five major vaccine \nmanufacturers worldwide that have production facilities in the United \nStates. That is for all vaccines. Only two of those are actually United \nStates companies. Our manufacturing base for vaccines is woefully \ninadequate for any of the threats I have just mentioned.\n  Over the past 2 decades, the number of manufacturers who make \nvaccines for children has dwindled from 12 down to now just 4, and only \n2 of the 4 manufacturers that make lifesaving vaccines for children are \nhere in the United States.\n  I spoke, as I mentioned, on this topic on Monday. I spoke on Monday \nbecause it was the 50th anniversary of the polio vaccine. Yesterday's \nnews about the H2N2 virus is just one more reason why we need to take \naction. It is imperative we strengthen our domestic vaccine supply, we \noffer appropriate legal protections, and we encourage and incentivize \ncollaboration between public and private sectors. We need to advance \nresearch and development. We need to put all these initiatives together \nto protect us from a deadly viral outbreak that scientific experts warn \ncould come to our shores any day.\n  America has been the engine of countless lifesaving discoveries and \nglobal health efforts. Once again, we are called upon to lead for the \nsafety of our fellow citizens and, indeed, citizens around the world.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/14/senate-section/article/S3610-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I wish to make a couple of comments today \non some very important issues we will face in the days ahead.\n  We have the supplemental appropriations bill on the floor of the \nSenate asking for just over $80 billion for the cost of the war in Iraq \nand Afghanistan.\n  Most of it is to replenish military accounts. A number of amendments \nhave been offered. Immigration amendments are now pending. I intend to \noffer a couple of amendments as well.\n  I will describe one of those amendments this morning. It deals with \nthe establishment of a special committee of the Senate, modeled after \nthe Truman Commission, to investigate the waste, fraud, and abuse that \nis happening with respect to contracting in Iraq.\n  I also wish to address another amendment I will offer, that would \nshut down the investigation that has been going on now 10 years by Mr. \nBarrett, an independent counsel. He started in 1995 to investigate \nallegations against Henry Cisneros, who was a Cabinet Secretary, \nallegations that he had given payments to a former mistress and then \nlied about it.\n  That independent counsel investigation started in 1995 and has been \ngoing on ever since. But Mr. Cisneros pled guilty in 1999. And he was \npardoned in 2001 by a Presidential pardon. Yet here it is 2005 and the \nindependent counsel is still spending money, $1.3 million, I believe, \nfor the previous 6 months. I believe it is time for this Congress to \nsay stop, enough is enough. Stop wasting the taxpayers money. What on \nEarth could you be thinking about? Four years after the person was \npardoned and 7 years after the person pled guilty, the independent \ncounsel is still spending money? If ever there were an example of \nGovernment waste and lack of common sense, this is it.\n  I also wish to mention briefly this country's trade deficit. I wanted \nto come to the floor the day before yesterday, but I was not able to do \nthat.\n  There was a small announcement the day before yesterday that in \nFebruary our trade deficit was $61 billion in 1\n\n[[Page S3611]]\n\nmonth. This is an example of what is happening to this country's trade \ndeficits: We are choking on red ink. This is serious. It is a crisis, \nand nobody seems to care. The White House is snoring its way through \nthis issue. The Congress is sleeping through it. Nobody gives a rip \nabout this at all. Nearly $2 billion a day is the amount we purchase \nfrom abroad from other countries in goods and services in excess of the \namount we sell to them. That means every single day foreign countries \nand foreign investors own $2 billion more of our country, claims \nagainst our country, stocks, bonds, assets, or real estate.\n  This is a crisis that will have a profound impact on future economic \ngrowth in this country. It will have a profound impact, and does, on \nthe wholesale export of American jobs all across the world.\n  Yesterday, I read a piece that General Motors called in its \nsubcontractors and said: You need to start moving your jobs to China to \nbe more competitive.\n  Evidence is all around us that this trade strategy we have is \nunsound. It does not work. It injures our country. It is hollowing out \nour manufacturing sector, and it is moving American jobs overseas. This \ncountry had better take notice. This Congress had better sit up and \nstart caring about this, and this President had better start parking \nAir Force One and providing some leadership on things that are a \ncrisis.\n  No, Social Security is not in crisis. Social Security will be fully \nsolvent until George Bush is 106 years old. That is hardly a crisis. \nBut the announcement that in February of this year we had a $61 billion \n1-month trade deficit ought to provoke this White House and this \nCongress, Republicans and Democrats, to take action in support of this \ncountry's economic interests for a change.\n  What do we hear about trade? We do not hear anybody wanting to do \nanything about this, and I will speak later on about what we should do \nin some detail. What we hear is we want another trade agreement to be \npassed by the Congress called the Central American Free Trade \nAgreement, CAFTA. To me, it is an acronym that means careless and \nfoolish trade agreement.\n  Along with my colleague from Georgia, Senator Lindsey Graham, we are \ngoing to lead the opposition, and I hope we can round up the votes in \nthis Congress to defeat this trade agreement. The message ought to be \nto those folks who are negotiating these agreements and then sending \nthem to Congress under fast track, please fix some of the problems that \nhave been created in past trade agreements before negotiating new ones \nand before asking the Congress to approve new ones. Fix a few of the \nproblems that have been created.\n  Do my colleagues think this is not a problem? This comes from NAFTA. \nThis comes from GATT. This comes from all of the distant cousins of the \ntrade agreements that we brought to the Senate floor, almost all of \nwhich I have voted against, because I believe they pull the rug out \nfrom under the interests of this country. They pull the rug out from \nunder our workers and our businesses. So I hope very much that we can \nfinally get someone's attention. If $61 billion a month in trade \ndeficits is not a wake-up call that gets someone's attention, my guess \nis they are permanently asleep.\n  Now, I wish to speak about the issue of contracting in Iraq. There is \nmassive waste, fraud, and abuse going on in contracting in Iraq, as is \nthe case in many circumstances where a lot of money is being poured out \nto prosecute a war. If one does not watch carefully, people are going \nto fleece the taxpayers, and that is what is happening. Nobody seems to \ncare about that, either.\n  We cannot get aggressive hearings in the Congress about oversight. \nWhy is that? I do not know. So as chairman of the Democratic Policy \nCommittee, we have held four hearings on these abuses.\n  In a moment, I will read a few newspaper headlines about this waste, \nand yes, these headlines mention the word Halliburton, and I know that \nwhen the word Halliburton is mentioned people think, okay, now this is \npolitical, it is partisan, now we are going after Vice President Cheney \nbecause he used to head that corporation. This has nothing to do with \nVice President Cheney. He has been long gone from Halliburton. This has \nnothing to do with the Vice President, nothing to do with partisan \npolitics. It has everything to do with the American taxpayers being \ncheated.\n\n  So to the extent that Halliburton is in these headlines, it is \nbecause they were given very large sole-source contracts without any \ncompetitive bidding. Billions of dollars have gone into the pockets of \nHalliburton and here is the result, with a substantial lack of \noversight.\n  First, let me describe this picture. This does not deal with \nHalliburton, by the way. This deals with a company called Custer \nBattles, two guys named Custer and Battles. This picture shows $2 \nmillion in cash wrapped in Saran wrap. This fellow, incidentally, was \nthe guy who was turning over the $2 million because the company that \nwas owed the $2 million showed up with a bag. Why did they show up with \na bag to collect cash wrapped in Saran wrap? Because they were told in \nIraq: When you are contracting, bring a bag, you are going to get cash, \nby the bagful.\n  Now, these people got a lot of cash. This is their first $2 million. \nThey have been accused of substantial fraud. Doing security at \nairports, they allegedly confiscated the forklift trucks, took them off \nthe airport property, repainted them, and then sold them back to the \nCoalition Provisional Authority, which was the U.S. taxpayer.\n  So here is the first delivery of $2 million in cash in a bag to a \ncompany that is now widely accused of fraud.\n  Now, here are some of the stories of waste that I mentioned, \ninvolving Halliburton. I will read some of these headlines. This was a \nformer Halliburton employee who testified before our committee: \n``Halliburton Manipulated Purchase Orders to Avoid Oversight''--that is \na newspaper headline. For purchase orders under $2,500 buyers only \nneeded to solicit one quote from a vendor. To avoid competitive \nbidding, requisitions were quoted individually and later combined into \nthe $2,500 and more. They were told to do that in order to cheat.\n  In fact, this particular guy held up a towel, and he said: This was a \ntowel we were supposed to order because we were buying towels for U.S. \nsoldiers.\n  They paid nearly double the price for the towels because instead of \nordering the towel that was the plain towel, they ordered one \nembroidered with their company's logo on it so the American taxpayer \ncould pay nearly double.\n  ``Halliburton Discouraged Full Disclosure to Auditors.'' \n``Halliburton Overcharged for Oil.'' This is from the fellow who used \nto run the portion of the Defense Department that would purchase oil, \nyes, even in areas where we were at war, and he said: During my tenure \nat the Defense Department, we were occasionally forced to pay sole-\nsource prices in some locations, but not even in remote central Asia \ndid we pay close to a gallon for jet fuel of what Halliburton was \ncharging in Iraq. He said that overcharging for oil was simply out of \ncontrol. This is a former Defense Department official.\n  By the way, Halliburton ordered 25 tons of nails--that is 50,000 \npounds of nails. Do my colleagues know where they are today? They are \nlaying in the sand of Iraq because they came in the wrong size. \nSomebody made a mistake on the order. If someone wants 50,000 pounds of \nnails, they are laying in the sands of Iraq someplace. The American \ntaxpayer paid for them, and Halliburton got reimbursed for it.\n  We had testimony of people driving $85,000 trucks in Iraq, and those \ntrucks were abandoned just because they had a flat tire or because they \nhad a clogged fuel pump. They were abandoned and torched, and they went \nand bought new trucks. So much for oversight. Nobody cares because it \nis a war and because there are sole-source contracts. These are pieces \nof testimony from whistleblowers, from former employees, who said: Here \nis what is going on. The truck piece was from a truckdriver in Iraq who \nworked for Halliburton.\n  It is just unbelievable when one listens to what is happening: Bags \nof cash, billions of dollars. We say we are going to put air-\nconditioning in a building near Baghdad, and so our contractor hires a \nsubcontractor, who hires a couple of workers, and we get\n\n[[Page S3612]]\n\ncharged for air-conditioning and they put in a ceiling fan that does \nnot work. Does anybody care? Can we get anybody in this Congress, any \ncommittee, to hold oversight hearings to care about the massive fraud, \nwaste, and abuse? Not on one's life, not a chance. God forbid that we \nshould be critical of anything that is going on around here, despite \nthe fact that the American taxpayer is getting fleeced wholesale.\n\n  I offered an amendment in the Appropriations Committee that would \nhave set up a Truman-style investigating committee. Senator Harry \nTruman from Missouri, at a time when there was a Democrat in the White \nHouse, decided there was substantial abuse by contractors at the start \nof World War II, and he persuaded a Democratic Congress to set up an \ninvestigative committee. Yes, a Democratic Congress and a Democrat in \nthe White House set up an investigative committee, and they saved a \nmassive amount of money by uncovering a dramatic amount of fraud and \nwaste.\n  Now we have one party control, and nobody wants to embarrass anyone \nelse, so they do not look at anything. It is see no evil, hear no evil, \nspeak no evil. Meanwhile, the American taxpayers are completely getting \nfleeced by massive waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  We have done four hearings. I mentioned Halliburton, but I also can \nmention Custer Battles. I can mention other companies. Obviously, \nHalliburton is the poster child because they received giant contracts \nwithout bidding, and then we see that they are charging the American \ntaxpayer to feed 42,000 soldiers a day when, in fact, they are only \nfeeding 14,000 soldiers a day. So they are charging us for 28,000 meals \nthat are not served. Fraud? I would think so. But what happens these \ndays? First, it does not even get investigated. If it does get \ninvestigated, they get a slap on the wrist and a pat on the back with \nanother contract.\n  This Congress needs to start facing up to these issues and getting \ntough. No, this is not partisan. If we are going to shove $81 billion \nout the door in a supplemental defense funding bill, should we not, \nalong with it, provide the appropriate approach to investigate these? \nThat is what my amendment will do.\n  I offered my amendment in the Appropriations Committee. It was turned \ndown on a partisan vote, regrettably. This is not a partisan amendment. \nMy hope is that perhaps I will see a different result on the Senate \nfloor.\n  How much time remains on our 30 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). There is 15\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I believe the Senator from Connecticut is \ngoing to be coming over to claim parts of our 30 minutes, but the time \nis running. I see the Senator from Kentucky is on the floor. I know \nthat by previous consent we have established 30 minutes on our side \nfollowed by 30 minutes on the other side. At this point, I will \nrelinquish the floor if I could ask that we would reserve the remaining \ntime for Senator Lieberman from Connecticut because he is not here. If \nthe other side would like to continue to take some of their time and \nthen provided that when Senator Lieberman comes, he would have reserved \nthe additional 15\\1/2\\ minutes? I will make that a unanimous consent \nrequest and see if the Senator from Kentucky would agree to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The majority whip.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/14/senate-section/article/S3612-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3612-S3614]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FILIBUSTERING OF JUDICIAL NOMINEES\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we as senators have an enormous amount \nof work to do for the American people. For example, while our economy \nis strong, unfortunately gas prices are way too high. People are \nfeeling those costs every time they fill up at the pump. This Senate \nneeds to seriously address a long-term energy policy for this country, \nand reduce our dependence on foreign oil.\n  We have serious work to do to reform America's tax code, so it is \nfairer for all Americans, and leads to a more robust economy.\n  We have undertaken a debate on how to reform Social Security so it is \nstronger and more secure for future generations, as it has served \nmillions so well already over the last 70 years.\n  Our road system needs improving. Millions of Americans take to the \nroads everyday to get to work and keep this country moving. It's \ncritical the Senate pass a highway bill. In short, we have a formidable \nagenda before us. We welcome that challenge. I think that our \nconstituents sent us here to get things done, not just to sit in these \nfancy chairs. But the Nation's business may soon come to an abrupt \nhalt.\n  In the face of so much important work to be done, sadly, my \nDemocratic friends on the other side of the aisle are promising to pull \nthe plug on this chamber, and thus shut down the Government. Just \nbecause a majority of Senators want to restore the 200-year-old norms \nand traditions of the Senate, by granting a President's judicial \nnominees who have majority support the simple courtesy of an up-or-down \nvote, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are threatening to \nstop this Senate dead in its tracks.\n  An energy bill to begin to address the high cost of gasoline and \nreduce our dependence on foreign oil? They would say: Forget it.\n  A highway bill, to begin desperately needed repairs on bridges and \nroads across the country? They would say: Not a chance.\n  These and other priorities will not happen if the Democrats shut down \nthe Government. Because they cannot have what no Senate minority has \never had in 200 years--the requirement of a supermajority for \nconfirmation--they threaten to shut the Government down.\n  The American people by now must rightly be asking, ``How did we get \nin such a mess?''\n  It was not by accident. The Democrats did not stumble into this \nposition. It was carefully conceived.\n  Four years ago, in May of 2001, the New York Times reported that 42 \nof the Senate's then-50 Democrats attended a private weekend retreat in \nFarmington, PA, to discuss a plan of attack against the President's \njudicial nominees.\n  According to this article, the unprecedented obstruction by the other \nside is not based on checks and balances, or the rights of the \nminority. It is about ideology. The Democrats invited speakers to their \nretreat who warned them that President Bush was planning to, ``pack the \ncourts with staunch conservatives.''\n  Now, here's the clincher. According to the New York Times, one \nparticipant said:\n\n       It was important for the Senate to change the ground rules, \n     and there was no obligation to confirm someone just because \n     they are scholarly or erudite.\n\n  Let me make sure that last part came through loud and clear. The \nDemocrats are accusing the Republicans, who merely want to restore the \n200-year-tradition of giving judicial nominees with majority support an \nup-or-down vote, of some kind of power grab. Yet here is a 4-year-old \nadmission that it is the Democrats who are clearly out to ``change the \nground rules.'' They knew what they were doing. This was thoroughly \npremeditated.\n  That quote says it all. If a minority of the Senate does not get its \nway in obstructing judges from serving on our Nation's Federal courts, \nthey will ``change the ground rules.'' They will shut down the \nGovernment. I say to my friends, I wouldn't take the extreme step of \nshutting the government down.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this New York Times article of May 1, \n2001 printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the New York Times, May 1, 2001]\n\n                 Democrats Readying for Judicial Fight\n\n                           (By Neil A. Lewis)\n\n       President Bush has yet to make his first nominee to a \n     federal court and no one knows whether anyone will retire \n     from the Supreme Court this summer, an event that would lead \n     to a high-stakes confirmation battle.\n       Nonetheless, the Senate's Democrats and Republicans are \n     already engaged in close-quarters combat over how to deal \n     with the eventual nominees from the Bush White House. \n     Democrats in particular are trying to show some muscle as \n     they insist that they will not simply stand aside and confirm \n     any nominees they deem right-wing ideologues.\n       ``What we're trying to do is set the stage and make sure \n     that both the White House and the Senate Republicans know \n     that we\n\n[[Page S3613]]\n\n     expect to have significant input in the process,'' Senator \n     Charles E. Schumer, New York's senior Democrat, said in an \n     interview. ``We're simply not going to roll over.''\n       Forty-two of the Senate's 50 Democrats attended a private \n     retreat this weekend in Farmington, Pa., where a principal \n     topic was forging a unified party strategy to combat the \n     White House on judicial nominees.\n       The senators listened to a panel composed of Prof. Laurence \n     H. Tribe of Harvard Law School, Prof. Cass M. Sunstein of the \n     University of Chicago Law School and Marcia R. Greenberger, \n     the co-director of the National Women's Law Center, on the \n     need to scrutinize judicial nominees more closely than ever. \n     The panelists argued, said some people who were present, that \n     the nation's courts were at a historic juncture because, they \n     said, a band of conservative lawyers around Mr. Bush was \n     planning to pack the courts with staunch conservatives.\n       ``They said it was important for the Senate to change the \n     ground rules and there was no obligation to confirm someone \n     just because they are scholarly or erudite,'' a person who \n     attended said.\n       Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, \n     then exhorted his colleagues behind closed doors on Saturday \n     morning to refrain from providing snap endorsements of any \n     Bush nominee. One senior Democratic Senate staff aide who \n     spoke on the condition of anonymity said that was because \n     some people still remembered with annoyance the fact that two \n     Democratic senators offered early words of praise for the \n     nomination of Senator John Ashcroft to be attorney \n     general.\n       Senators Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey and Joseph R. \n     Biden Jr. of Delaware initially praised the Ashcroft \n     selection, impeding the early campaign against the \n     nomination. Both eventually acceded to pressure and voted \n     against the nomination.\n       The current partisan battle is over a parliamentary custom \n     that Republicans are considering changing, which governs \n     whether a senator may block or delay a nominee from his home \n     State. Democrats and Republicans on the Judiciary Committee \n     have not resolved their dispute over the ``blue-slip policy'' \n     that allows senators to block a nominee by filing a blue slip \n     with the committee.\n       On Friday, Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the ranking \n     Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, and Mr. Schumer sent a \n     letter to the White House signed by all committee Democrats \n     insisting on a greater role in selecting judges, especially \n     given that the Senate is divided 50-50 and that the \n     Republicans are the majority only because Vice President Dick \n     Cheney is able to break any tie.\n       Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader, \n     told reporters today that he believed ``some consideration \n     will be given to Democratic input, but I don't think they \n     should expect to name judges from their State.''\n       Mr. Lott said he expected that Democrats might slow the \n     process but, in the end, would not block any significant \n     number of nominees.\n       Behind all the small-bore politics is the sweeping issue of \n     the direction of the federal courts, especially the 13 \n     circuit courts that increasingly have the final word on some \n     of the most contentious social issues. How the federal bench \n     is shaped in the next 4 or 8 years, scholars say, could have \n     a profound effect on issues like affirmative action, abortion \n     rights and the lengths to which the government may go in \n     aiding parochial schools.\n       Mr. Bush is expected to announce his first batch of \n     judicial nominees in the next several days, and it is likely \n     to include several staunch conservatives as well as some \n     women and members of minorities, administration officials \n     have said. Among those Mr. Bush may put forward to important \n     Federal appeals court positions are such conservatives as \n     Jeffrey S. Sutton, Peter D. Keisler, Representative \n     Christopher Cox of California and Miguel Estrada.\n       The first group of nominees, which may number more than two \n     dozen, is part of an effort to fill the 94 vacancies on the \n     Federal bench while the Republicans still control the Senate.\n       But it remains unclear if there will be a Supreme Court \n     vacancy at the end of the court's term in July. Speculation \n     on possible retirements has focused on Chief Justice William \n     H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and John Paul \n     Stevens. But in recent days, associates of Justice O'Connor \n     have signaled that she wants it known that she will not \n     retire after this term.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. the record about who is out to change what is not \nmerely confined to the statements from this article. No, we have 4 \nyears of behavior to corroborate these statements.\n  Soon after that Democrat retreat, and continuing to this day, we have \nseen our Democratic friends make major changes in the Senate's ground \nrules for confirming qualified judicial nominees.\n  For example, almost immediately the Democrats began to litmus-test \njudges in order to strain out the ones they considered too \nconservative. When they controlled the Judiciary Committee in the 107th \nCongress, they even held hearings on using ideology in the confirmation \nprocess in an effort to legitimize their practice of litmus-testing \njudges.\n  The Democrats have widely-applied their litmus tests. They have \nfilibustered almost 1 circuit court nominee for every 3 they have \nconfirmed. As a result, in his first term, President George W. Bush had \nonly 69 percent of his circuit-court nominees confirmed. That is the \nlowest confirmation percentage of any President since World War II.\n  In addition, the Democrats began to demand that they in effect get to \nco-nominate judges along with the President. The Constitution clearly \nprovides in Article II, Section 2, that the President, and the \nPresident alone, nominates judges. The Senate is empowered to give \n``advice'' and ``consent.'' The Democrats, however, have sought to \nredefine ``advice and consent'' to mean ``co-nominate.''\n  President Bush, rightly so, has not acceded to this attempt to upset \nour Constitution's separation of powers. Unfortunately, the \nadministration of justice is suffering. In the case of the Sixth \nCircuit, for example, Democratic Senators are willing to let one-fourth \nof the circuit seats sit empty in order to enforce their demands. As a \nresult, the Sixth Circuit--which includes Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio and \nMichigan--is far and away the slowest circuit in the Nation. My \nconstituents and the other residents of the Sixth Circuit are the \nvictims. Thanks to the other side's obstruction, Kentuckians know too \nwell that justice delayed means justice denied.\n  The Democrats have changed other ground rules in the confirmation \nprocess. But all these changes were just precursors to what happened in \nthe last Congress. In 2003, Democrats instituted the ultimate change in \nthe Senate's ground rules: they began to obstruct, via the filibuster, \non a systematic and partisan basis, well-qualified nominees who \ncommanded majority support. That is unprecedented in over 200 years of \nSenate history.\n  Republicans did not filibuster judicial nominees, even though it \nwould have been easy for us to do so. Let me give you the names of some \nvery controversial Democratic judicial nominees whom we could have \neasily filibustered, during the Clinton and Carter years: Richard Paez, \nWilliam Fletcher, Susan Oki Molloway, Abner Mikva. None of these \nnominees had 60 votes for confirmation.\n  Other controversial Democratic nominees, like Marsha Berzon, barely \nhad 60 votes for confirmation, but we did not whip our caucus to try to \nfilibuster them either. Indeed, just the opposite occurred: Senators \nLott and Hatch, to their great credit, argued that we ought not to set \nsuch a precedent, no matter ow strongly we oppose the nominee. I \nremember voting for cloture myself, voting to shut off debate on Paez \nand Berzon both, and then voting against them when they got their up-\nor-down vote, which they were entitled to get.\n  Our friends, the Democrats, are driving a double standard: The \nnominees of a Democratic President only had to garner majority support, \nas had every other judicial nominee in history until Democrats sought \nto change the ground rules. But nominees of a Republican President have \nto get a much higher level of support. That is the ultimate in \nhypocrisy.\n  Because the majority may seek to restore the norms and traditions of \nthe Senate--norms and traditions that my Democratic friends have \nupset--the Democrats are now threatening to shut down the Government. \nThat is not right.\n  We need to recommit ourselves to the 200 year principle that in a \ndemocracy an up-or-down vote should be given to a President's judicial \nnominees. It is simple. It is fair. It has been that way for over 2 \ncenturies. And it's served us well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN, Mr. President, the continual controversy over Senate \nconfirmation of Federal judges needs to be resolved. It promises to \nhang as a cloud over the Senate unless we reach an understanding of the \nappropriate role of the Senate.\n  I had been hopeful that the Senate leadership would be able to \nresolve this issue by reaching an agreement that would be acceptable to \nboth sides. However, that does not now appear likely.\n  Therefore, I have advised the distinguished majority leader, Mr. \nFrist,\n\n[[Page S3614]]\n\nthat I will support him in his effort to bring this confrontation over \njudicial filibusters to an end.\n  There should be no question in anyone's mind about my intentions. I \nwill work in concert with our leader, and with the distinguished \nmajority whip, Mr. McConnell, to end filibusters of judicial \nnominations in the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remains 14 minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. My colleague from Connecticut is here. Let me take a \ncouple of minutes and then yield to my colleague for the remaining \ntime.\n  I must confess, it is hard sometimes to listen on the floor of the \nSenate without a big broad smile at the irony of this debate. Restoring \nthe normal traditions of the Senate? There is a debate going on in the \nSenate, but that is not what it is about. This is about changing the \nrules in the middle of a game because one party in control doesn't get \neverything they want on every issue all the time.\n  We have confirmed 205 judges for this President and opposed the \nconfirmation of only 10 of them. Because of that, the other side has an \napoplectic seizure and decides they want to turn this Senate into the \nHouse, where there is no unlimited debate and one party can treat the \nother party like a piece of furniture they can sit on.\n  The Framers of this Constitution did not consider the Senate should \nbe a compliant body during one-party rule. The minority has rights. One \nof those rights is unlimited debate.\n  I think it is very interesting to hear on the floor of the Senate how \ngenerously the Republicans treated nominees under the Presidency of \nPresident Clinton, when they--in 50 cases of people who were notified \nby the President they were nominated for a lifetime appointment on the \nFederal court--did not even have the courtesy of giving them 1 day of \nhearings. Not even a day of hearings. They didn't get to see the light \nof day in this Congress, let alone a filibuster.\n  What a shameful thing to do to someone to whom the President says, I \nam going to nominate you for a lifetime appointment on the court. They \ndidn't give them 1 day of hearings.\n  Now they complain because we approved 204 and didn't approve 10. Now \nthey complain the President didn't get every single judgeship he \nwanted. Have they ever heard of the words ``checks and balances''? Did \nthey take a course at least in high school to understand what it means?\n  No. If this nuclear option, as it is called in this town, is employed \nby the majority party, with an arrogance that I have never seen in the \nyears I have served in the Congress--if they do that, they will rue the \nday because they, one day, will be in the minority and they, one day, \nwill wonder what on Earth did we do, to eliminate the unlimited debate \nprovision in the United States Senate that George Washington and Thomas \nJefferson said represents the cooling of the passions in this country, \nrepresents the one location of reasoned debate in this Government of \nours.\n  I hear all these discussions about how this is about traditions and \nnorms. Nothing could be further from the truth. What the majority is \ntrying to do is change the rules of the Senate because the minority \ndidn't approve 10 out of 215 judges. What an arrogant attitude and what \ndamage they will do to this institution if they employ a tactic to \nchange the rules at this point and turn this Senate into another House \nof Representatives. They will have done damage for the long term and \ndamage I believe they themselves will regret because one day they, too, \nwill be in the minority. Then they will again understand what this \nConstitution provides with respect to minority rights.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/14/senate-section/article/S3614-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3614-S3616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         DEATH BENEFITS IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in morning business \nabout the provision of this supplemental appropriations bill before us \nthat rights a wrong done with regard to death benefits of those who \nserved the United States in uniform. I begin my remarks by thanking my \nfriend and colleague from Alabama, Senator Sessions, and acknowledge \nhis leadership on this very important humanitarian reform. I also thank \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee, under the leadership of Senator \nCochran and Senator Byrd, for bringing forward this emergency \nsupplemental in a way that includes an important provision to improve \nthe financial benefits for families of our fallen soldiers.\n  I am grateful that this supplemental uses the so-called HEROES bill, \nS. 77, which Senator Sessions and I cosponsored and introduced in \nJanuary as the basis for the reforms to enhance the death benefit and \nthe level of coverage under the Servicemen's Group Life Insurance \nProgram.\n  Yesterday, the Senate amended this provision and voted to increase \neligibility for the expanded death benefit to $100,000, which was in \nour HEROES bill, to include all active-duty service men and women.\n  These reforms honor the brave men and women wearing America's uniform \nwho have made the ultimate sacrifice to defend our liberty by giving \nthem and their families what we the American people owe them. \nObviously, nothing can replace the loss of life. But a decent death \nbenefit and adequate life insurance can provide our service members and \ntheir loved ones with a sense of security about their future which they \ndeserve. For too long, they have not gotten that peace of mind, and \nindeed not the respect they deserve.\n  Senator Sessions and I have worked together for some time as members \nof the Senate Armed Services Committee to investigate and then to react \nto this wrong. We began looking at the question of what survivor \nbenefits were in place for our men and women in uniform as we were \nconcerned that the benefits being provided to families of those who \nlose their lives in the service of this country lagged behind benefits \nprovided for public service employees in high-risk occupations, namely \npolicemen and firefighters. The families of fallen policemen and \nfirefighters deserve those higher benefits. But so, too, of course, do \nthe families of fallen military personnel.\n  When Senator Sessions and I began this review, the death benefit paid \nto the families of service men and women who were killed in action was \n$6,000, an embarrassing sum. A small step forward was taken last year \nwhen the death benefit was increased to $12,000, but obviously that was \nstill woefully inadequate.\n  Two studies, one done by the Department of Defense and the other done \nby the Government Accountability Office, documented that survivor \nbenefits provided to some of the public employee groups I have \nmentioned in high-risk positions were greater than those provided for \nour soldiers killed in combat. That was evidently unfair, and that is \nwhy our legislation, the HEROES bill, was worked on for over 2 years \nwith the Pentagon's service member group and veterans groups which \nresulted in a bill to correct that imbalance by adjusting military \nsurvivor benefits to more equitably reflect today's world.\n  I am very gratified that idea has taken hold, and it is reflected in \nthe emergency supplemental before the Congress today.\n  With the changes adopted, if soldiers buy the servicemen's group life \ninsurance, their families will receive $250,000, for which the soldier \npays, and then an additional $150,000 of insurance the U.S. Government \nwill pay for. In addition to that will be the $100,000 death benefit. \nThat is half a million dollars, which in these times is not a lot when \nwe consider families left behind, a parent or a spouse and children who \nwill need to go to college and all the expenses related to it. These \nfamilies who have lost a family member have a terrible void. All of us \nwho have visited with them in our respective States or elsewhere have \nfelt that void and have tried to the extent we could to let them know \nwe share it with them. But, of course, it is uniquely and singularly \ntheirs as they go through their life. Nothing can fill that void. But \nthe least we can do is what we do in this bill--give them some sense of \nfinancial security as they go forward, with a kind of security in a \nmuch more fundamental sense that their loved one's service has given \neach and every American.\n\n[[Page S3615]]\n\n  Theodore Roosevelt once said:\n\n       A man who was good enough to shed blood for his country is \n     good enough to be given a square deal afterward.\n\n  Of course, in our time we say a man and a woman.\n  T.R. was right, and the men and women who are shedding blood for our \nNation today in the cause of liberty and doing so in a way that has \nfundamentally improved the security of the American people here at home \nshould know their families will be taken care of no matter what happens \nto them.\n  I can't think of a piece of legislation which I have been involved in \nmy over 17 years in the Senate that I have felt better about. This is \none of those occasions that doesn't get celebrated quite enough where \nwe forget the party labels, Republican and Democrat, and act in a \nhigher calling, which is our status as Americans which unites us all. I \nam glad to see we are about to put these reforms in place.\n  We all recognize we have to keep faith with our service men and \nwomen. We have to give them a square deal. They are doing their duty to \nprotect us, and it is our duty to protect their families, should they \ngive their lives in defense of our liberty. That is what the provisions \nin the supplemental do. I am proud to have been a part of it. I am \ngrateful to my colleagues for supporting it. I urge its adoption.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I associate myself with the comments of \nSenator Lieberman and say how he expressed my feelings about this \nimportant legislation. It has been a pleasure to work with him in a \nbipartisan way. He has demonstrated time and again his interest in \nmatters of national defense and national security and his commitment to \nthose who serve us. I, too, believe, as was discussed not too long ago \nat one of the hearings, there is a bond between the American people and \nthose we send out to defend our interests in dangerous areas of the \nworld. We as American people need to honor that bond.\n  One of the commitments I think we must make as a people is to say to \nthose who go in harm's way to execute the just policies of the United \nStates that if something happens to you, we are going to try to take \ncare of your family. That is one thing you don't need to worry about.\n  I believe the HEROES bill, as we named it, honoring every requirement \nof exemplary service, is the legislation that moves us a long way in \nthat regard. I couldn't be more excited. I thank the Appropriations \nCommittee Chairman, Senator Cochran, and the ranking member, Senator \nByrd, for their support of making this a part of the supplemental.\n  We certainly have worked hard in trying to gain support from the \nmilitary community and the Department of Defense which understands \nexactly how and what we should do to better support those who lose \ntheir lives in the service to their country. We did a number of things.\n  Two years ago, as part of the Defense bill I asked that we put in \nlanguage to study this. Senator Lieberman and I talked about it. And \nthey put that language in. We have gotten some studies back. We began \nto figure and think about what we could do to make families more secure \nin the case of the loss of a loved one. Last year, they completed the \nstudy and we began to look at it. The President and the Secretary of \nDefense responded to our request promptly and, I believe, honestly and \nobjectively.\n  The Senate report that is before us today recommended increasing the \ndeath gratuity benefit from $12,420 to $100,000 for our service members \nwho die on active duty in a combat theater, and then we amended the \nbill to include those who serve on active duty who lose their lives. It \nalso allows, as I have proposed, for every member of the military to \nraise the level of coverage under the servicemen's group life insurance \nwhich is capped out at $250,000 to $400,000. I believe that is a more \nlegitimate sum for a family suffering this kind of loss.\n  Additionally, for those serving in the combat zone or a designated \ncontingency, the Department of Defense will pay the member's premium \nfor the first $150,000 of insurance to guarantee they are participants \nin that program.\n  The report before us also makes these changes retroactive to cover \nthose who lost their lives since the beginning of the global war on \nterrorism which began October 7, 2001. Families of our service members \nwho have died since October 7, 2001, will receive a one-time cash \npayment of $238,000 which is a sum of the added coverage of life \ninsurance, $150,000 more life insurance, coupled with proposed increase \nof the death gratuity of $88,000.\n  Finally, the report will place language in the law to require service \nmembers to inform their spouses of the level of coverage that may be \nenacted.\n  As I conclude my remarks, let me be clear on this issue. There is no \namount of compensation that can replace the loss of a loved one. Not \nfor a soldier, not for a police officer, not for a teacher, or a \nfireman. However, our military service members volunteer to leave their \nfamilies and engage in a very difficult and dangerous campaign to \ndefeat terrorists and secure peace and prosperity not only for America \nbut for countless millions around the world. The training and \noperations conducted to ready them for combat are also dangerous and \nwill also be included in the death gratuity section of the report. The \nenhancements of the death gratuity and SGLI outlined in this bill \nreflect the risks and dangers faced by our service men and women as \nthey serve us around the world.\n\n  The language stays true to what our President requested in the \nsupplemental and what Senator Lieberman and I put in S. 77, the HEROES \nbill. This report and the death benefits enhancements offered are based \non a sound analysis of this highly important and emotional issue. We \ncan never do enough to thank these brave Americans. Each and every one \nof them who serves us in our military today is a national treasure.\n  I am thankful and grateful that the Senate has included the HEROES \nprovision in this report, and I look forward to voting on this bill and \nseeing it enacted into law.\n  I note that not too many months ago I flew from Baghdad to Kuwait in \na C-130 late at night, and there were two flag-draped coffins of \nsoldiers who had given their lives in service to our country. \nYesterday, I talked with the daughter, 25 years old, of Sergeant Major \nBanks. Her mother, a sergeant major in the Army, was one of the \nsoldiers who died in the tragic helicopter crash in Afghanistan \nrecently. I talked to her about her mother, and how much she admired \nher mother, and to think how she had risen through the ranks to become \na sergeant major, growing up in a poor area of Alabama, African \nAmerican, who inspired her daughter, Shante Banks, as she described her \nmother's influence on her life. She gave her life serving our country, \nas many have.\n  I believe we have done the right thing here. I think it is going to \nbe a good step forward. I have enjoyed the opportunity to work with \nSenator Lieberman as we have moved this legislation forward.\n  I thank the President and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). The Senator from South Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. I thank the Senator from Alabama and the Senator from \nConnecticut for the great work they have done in recognizing the \nsacrifice of our men and women who are fighting for freedom's cause in \nIraq and Afghanistan and other places around the world. This is \nimportant legislation. I am pleased to be able to support their efforts \nand to see it becomes a matter of law.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Thune pertaining to the introduction of S.J. Res. \n12 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. ENSIGN). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S3616]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/14/senate-section/article/S3614-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3614-S3616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         DEATH BENEFITS IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in morning business \nabout the provision of this supplemental appropriations bill before us \nthat rights a wrong done with regard to death benefits of those who \nserved the United States in uniform. I begin my remarks by thanking my \nfriend and colleague from Alabama, Senator Sessions, and acknowledge \nhis leadership on this very important humanitarian reform. I also thank \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee, under the leadership of Senator \nCochran and Senator Byrd, for bringing forward this emergency \nsupplemental in a way that includes an important provision to improve \nthe financial benefits for families of our fallen soldiers.\n  I am grateful that this supplemental uses the so-called HEROES bill, \nS. 77, which Senator Sessions and I cosponsored and introduced in \nJanuary as the basis for the reforms to enhance the death benefit and \nthe level of coverage under the Servicemen's Group Life Insurance \nProgram.\n  Yesterday, the Senate amended this provision and voted to increase \neligibility for the expanded death benefit to $100,000, which was in \nour HEROES bill, to include all active-duty service men and women.\n  These reforms honor the brave men and women wearing America's uniform \nwho have made the ultimate sacrifice to defend our liberty by giving \nthem and their families what we the American people owe them. \nObviously, nothing can replace the loss of life. But a decent death \nbenefit and adequate life insurance can provide our service members and \ntheir loved ones with a sense of security about their future which they \ndeserve. For too long, they have not gotten that peace of mind, and \nindeed not the respect they deserve.\n  Senator Sessions and I have worked together for some time as members \nof the Senate Armed Services Committee to investigate and then to react \nto this wrong. We began looking at the question of what survivor \nbenefits were in place for our men and women in uniform as we were \nconcerned that the benefits being provided to families of those who \nlose their lives in the service of this country lagged behind benefits \nprovided for public service employees in high-risk occupations, namely \npolicemen and firefighters. The families of fallen policemen and \nfirefighters deserve those higher benefits. But so, too, of course, do \nthe families of fallen military personnel.\n  When Senator Sessions and I began this review, the death benefit paid \nto the families of service men and women who were killed in action was \n$6,000, an embarrassing sum. A small step forward was taken last year \nwhen the death benefit was increased to $12,000, but obviously that was \nstill woefully inadequate.\n  Two studies, one done by the Department of Defense and the other done \nby the Government Accountability Office, documented that survivor \nbenefits provided to some of the public employee groups I have \nmentioned in high-risk positions were greater than those provided for \nour soldiers killed in combat. That was evidently unfair, and that is \nwhy our legislation, the HEROES bill, was worked on for over 2 years \nwith the Pentagon's service member group and veterans groups which \nresulted in a bill to correct that imbalance by adjusting military \nsurvivor benefits to more equitably reflect today's world.\n  I am very gratified that idea has taken hold, and it is reflected in \nthe emergency supplemental before the Congress today.\n  With the changes adopted, if soldiers buy the servicemen's group life \ninsurance, their families will receive $250,000, for which the soldier \npays, and then an additional $150,000 of insurance the U.S. Government \nwill pay for. In addition to that will be the $100,000 death benefit. \nThat is half a million dollars, which in these times is not a lot when \nwe consider families left behind, a parent or a spouse and children who \nwill need to go to college and all the expenses related to it. These \nfamilies who have lost a family member have a terrible void. All of us \nwho have visited with them in our respective States or elsewhere have \nfelt that void and have tried to the extent we could to let them know \nwe share it with them. But, of course, it is uniquely and singularly \ntheirs as they go through their life. Nothing can fill that void. But \nthe least we can do is what we do in this bill--give them some sense of \nfinancial security as they go forward, with a kind of security in a \nmuch more fundamental sense that their loved one's service has given \neach and every American.\n\n[[Page S3615]]\n\n  Theodore Roosevelt once said:\n\n       A man who was good enough to shed blood for his country is \n     good enough to be given a square deal afterward.\n\n  Of course, in our time we say a man and a woman.\n  T.R. was right, and the men and women who are shedding blood for our \nNation today in the cause of liberty and doing so in a way that has \nfundamentally improved the security of the American people here at home \nshould know their families will be taken care of no matter what happens \nto them.\n  I can't think of a piece of legislation which I have been involved in \nmy over 17 years in the Senate that I have felt better about. This is \none of those occasions that doesn't get celebrated quite enough where \nwe forget the party labels, Republican and Democrat, and act in a \nhigher calling, which is our status as Americans which unites us all. I \nam glad to see we are about to put these reforms in place.\n  We all recognize we have to keep faith with our service men and \nwomen. We have to give them a square deal. They are doing their duty to \nprotect us, and it is our duty to protect their families, should they \ngive their lives in defense of our liberty. That is what the provisions \nin the supplemental do. I am proud to have been a part of it. I am \ngrateful to my colleagues for supporting it. I urge its adoption.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I associate myself with the comments of \nSenator Lieberman and say how he expressed my feelings about this \nimportant legislation. It has been a pleasure to work with him in a \nbipartisan way. He has demonstrated time and again his interest in \nmatters of national defense and national security and his commitment to \nthose who serve us. I, too, believe, as was discussed not too long ago \nat one of the hearings, there is a bond between the American people and \nthose we send out to defend our interests in dangerous areas of the \nworld. We as American people need to honor that bond.\n  One of the commitments I think we must make as a people is to say to \nthose who go in harm's way to execute the just policies of the United \nStates that if something happens to you, we are going to try to take \ncare of your family. That is one thing you don't need to worry about.\n  I believe the HEROES bill, as we named it, honoring every requirement \nof exemplary service, is the legislation that moves us a long way in \nthat regard. I couldn't be more excited. I thank the Appropriations \nCommittee Chairman, Senator Cochran, and the ranking member, Senator \nByrd, for their support of making this a part of the supplemental.\n  We certainly have worked hard in trying to gain support from the \nmilitary community and the Department of Defense which understands \nexactly how and what we should do to better support those who lose \ntheir lives in the service to their country. We did a number of things.\n  Two years ago, as part of the Defense bill I asked that we put in \nlanguage to study this. Senator Lieberman and I talked about it. And \nthey put that language in. We have gotten some studies back. We began \nto figure and think about what we could do to make families more secure \nin the case of the loss of a loved one. Last year, they completed the \nstudy and we began to look at it. The President and the Secretary of \nDefense responded to our request promptly and, I believe, honestly and \nobjectively.\n  The Senate report that is before us today recommended increasing the \ndeath gratuity benefit from $12,420 to $100,000 for our service members \nwho die on active duty in a combat theater, and then we amended the \nbill to include those who serve on active duty who lose their lives. It \nalso allows, as I have proposed, for every member of the military to \nraise the level of coverage under the servicemen's group life insurance \nwhich is capped out at $250,000 to $400,000. I believe that is a more \nlegitimate sum for a family suffering this kind of loss.\n  Additionally, for those serving in the combat zone or a designated \ncontingency, the Department of Defense will pay the member's premium \nfor the first $150,000 of insurance to guarantee they are participants \nin that program.\n  The report before us also makes these changes retroactive to cover \nthose who lost their lives since the beginning of the global war on \nterrorism which began October 7, 2001. Families of our service members \nwho have died since October 7, 2001, will receive a one-time cash \npayment of $238,000 which is a sum of the added coverage of life \ninsurance, $150,000 more life insurance, coupled with proposed increase \nof the death gratuity of $88,000.\n  Finally, the report will place language in the law to require service \nmembers to inform their spouses of the level of coverage that may be \nenacted.\n  As I conclude my remarks, let me be clear on this issue. There is no \namount of compensation that can replace the loss of a loved one. Not \nfor a soldier, not for a police officer, not for a teacher, or a \nfireman. However, our military service members volunteer to leave their \nfamilies and engage in a very difficult and dangerous campaign to \ndefeat terrorists and secure peace and prosperity not only for America \nbut for countless millions around the world. The training and \noperations conducted to ready them for combat are also dangerous and \nwill also be included in the death gratuity section of the report. The \nenhancements of the death gratuity and SGLI outlined in this bill \nreflect the risks and dangers faced by our service men and women as \nthey serve us around the world.\n\n  The language stays true to what our President requested in the \nsupplemental and what Senator Lieberman and I put in S. 77, the HEROES \nbill. This report and the death benefits enhancements offered are based \non a sound analysis of this highly important and emotional issue. We \ncan never do enough to thank these brave Americans. Each and every one \nof them who serves us in our military today is a national treasure.\n  I am thankful and grateful that the Senate has included the HEROES \nprovision in this report, and I look forward to voting on this bill and \nseeing it enacted into law.\n  I note that not too many months ago I flew from Baghdad to Kuwait in \na C-130 late at night, and there were two flag-draped coffins of \nsoldiers who had given their lives in service to our country. \nYesterday, I talked with the daughter, 25 years old, of Sergeant Major \nBanks.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 1268, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1268) making emergency supplemental \n     appropriations for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2005, \n     to establish and rapidly implement regulations for State \n     driver's license and identification document security \n     standards, to prevent terrorists from abusing the asylum laws \n     of the United States, to unify terrorism-related grounds for \n     inadmissibility and removal, to ensure expeditious \n     construction of the San Diego border fence, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Mikulski Amendment No. 387, to revise certain requirements \n     for H-2B employers and require submission of information \n     regarding H-2B nonimmigrants.\n       Feinstein Amendment No. 395, to express the sense of the \n     Senate that the text of the REAL ID Act of 2005 should not be \n     included in the conference report.\n       Bayh Amendment No. 406, to protect the financial condition \n     of members of the reserve components of the Armed Forces who \n     are ordered to long-term active duty in support of a \n     contingency operation.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I was about to call up amendment No. 366, \nwhich I am going to pull back from at this point. We are working with a \nnumber of subcommittees to get exact language, but I would like to go \nahead and frame the debate. Senator Brownback will be joining me.\n  This is actually the Darfur Accountability Act which we had \nintroduced on the floor at an earlier point. We have 30 cosponsors of \nthe amendment. We will continue to work with the appropriate \nsubcommittees and others to refine the language before we bring it \nback.\n  This amendment we will be offering is one that parallels the \nimportance which is now being placed on moving this supplemental, which \nis absolutely essential to support our men and women in uniform. They \ndeserve our support. We all know that. It is most certain that I will \nbe voting positively with regard to making sure that our deeds and \nwords match in our support of the troops and that we allocate our \nresources accordingly. That is what the debate on the supplemental is \nabout. I look forward to working on that.\n  But so, too, there are those the Congress and the administration have \nalready acknowledged are being subjected to acts of genocide, the Black \nMuslim villagers of Darfur, Sudan. This genocide is being committed by \ntheir own countrymen with the support of their Government. It is time \nfor action. Here, too, we need to put our words and deeds into a match. \nThey need to be congruent. This amendment is intended to deal with the \nemergency, the urgently needed response to this ongoing genocide taking \nplace in Darfur as I stand here, a place where there have been killings \nof up to 10,000 people every month, 300 to 350 human beings almost \nevery day.\n  Never have we been so aware of mankind's horrible history, and yet so \nreluctant to act on its lessons as it applies to this situation in \nDarfur. This month we are commemorating the 11th anniversary of the \nRwandan genocide. ``Hotel Rwanda,'' the movie, is showing on thousands \nof screens in homes across the country, and we continue to recall our \nshameful failure to prevent the slaughter of 800,000 people. Do we need \nto have a play 5 years from now or 10 years from now called ``Hotel \nDarfur''?\n  April 17 marks the 30th anniversary of the Khmer Rouge takeover in \nCambodia, the beginning of a genocide that killed between 1 and 2 \nmillion people. Do we need to revisit the killing fields? In January, \nthe liberation of Auschwitz was commemorated by the Congress and by a \nspecial session of the United Nations General Assembly. Throughout all \nof these commemorations and remembrances, we hear the same words: Never \nagain. Never again will we accept the slaughter of our fellow human \nbeings. Never again will we stand by and let this happen.\n  As Vice President Cheney said eloquently at the Holocaust \ncommemorations in Poland:\n\n       [We] look to the future with hope--that He may grant us the \n     wisdom to recognize evil in all its forms . . . and give us \n     courage to prevent it from ever rising again.\n\n  There is perhaps no more powerful moral voice over the last half \ncentury than author and Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel. Last year he \nspoke to the Darfur issue.\n  He said:\n\n       How can a citizen of a free country not pay attention? How \n     can anyone, anywhere not feel outraged? How can a person, \n     whether religious or secular, not be moved by compassion? And \n     above all, how can anyone who remembers remain silent? That \n     is what the issue in Darfur, Sudan, is about. That is why \n     this Darfur Accountability Act--this amendment that we are \n     speaking to today--is so important.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full remarks by Mr. Wiesel on Darfur \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n [Remarks delivered at the Darfur Emergency Summit, New York, July 14, \n                                 2004]\n\n                       On the Atrocities in Sudan\n\n                            (By Elie Wiesel)\n\n       Sudan has become today's world, capital of human pain, \n     suffering and agony. There, one part of the population has \n     been--and still is--subjected by another part, the dominating \n     part, to humiliation, hunger and death. For a while, the so-\n     called civilized world knew about it and preferred to look \n     away. Now people know. And so they have no excuse for their \n     passivity bordering on indifference. Those who, like you my \n     friends, try to break the walls of their apathy deserve \n     everyone's support and everyone's solidarity.\n       This gathering was organized by several important bodies. \n     The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum's Committee on Conscience \n     (Jerry Fowler), the Graduate Center of the City University of \n     New York, the American Jewish World Service (Ruth Messinger) \n     and several other humanitarian organizations.\n       As for myself, I have been involved in the efforts to help \n     Sudanese victims for some years. It was a direct or indirect \n     consequence of a millennium lecture I had given in the White \n     House on the subject, ``The Perils of Indifference''. After I \n     concluded, a woman in the audience rose and said: ``I am from \n     Rwanda.'' She asked me how I could explain the international \n     community's indifference to the Rwandan massacres. I turned \n     to the President who sat at my right and said: ``Mr. \n     President, you better answer this question. You know as well \n     as we do that the Rwanda tragedy, which cost from 600,000 to \n     800,000 victims, innocent men, women and children, could have \n     been averted. Why wasn't it?'' His answer was honest and \n     sincere: ``It is true, that tragedy could have been averted. \n     That's why I went there to apologize in my personal name and \n     in the name of the American people. But I promise you: it \n     will not happen again.''\n       The next day I received a delegation from Sudan and friends \n     of Sudan, headed by a Sudanese refugee bishop. They informed \n     me that two million Sudanese had already died. They said, \n     ``You are now the custodian of the President's pledge. Let \n     him keep it by helping stop the genocide in Sudan.''\n       That brutal tragedy is still continuing, now in Sudan's \n     Darfur region. Now its horrors are shown on television \n     screens and on front pages of influential publications. \n     Congressional delegations, special envoys and humanitarian \n     agencies send back or bring back horror-filled reports from \n     the scene. A million human beings, young and old, have been \n     uprooted, deported. Scores of women are being raped every \n     day, children are dying of disease hunger and violence.\n       How can a citizen of a free country not pay attention? How \n     can anyone, anywhere not feel outraged? How can a person, \n     whether religious or secular, not be moved by compassion? And \n     above all, how can anyone who remembers remain silent?\n       As a Jew who does not compare any event to the Holocaust, I \n     feel concerned and challenged by the Sudanese tragedy. We \n     must be involved. How can we reproach the indifference of \n     non-Jews to Jewish suffering if we remain indifferent to \n     another people's plight?\n       It happened in Cambodia, then in former Yugoslavia, and in \n     Rwanda, now in Sudan. Asia, Europe, Africa: Three continents \n     have become prisons, killing fields and cemeteries for \n     countless innocent, defenseless populations. Will the plague \n     be allowed to spread?\n       ``Lo taamod al dam reakha'' is a Biblical commandment. \n     ``Thou shall not stand idly by the shedding of the blood of \n     thy fellow man.'' The word is not ``akhikha,'' thy Jewish \n     brother, but ``reakha,'' thy fellow human being, be he or she \n     Jewish or not. All are entitled to live with dignity and \n     hope. All are entitled to live without fear and pain.\n       Not to assist Sudan's victims today would for me be \n     unworthy of what I have learned from my teachers, my \n     ancestors and my friends, namely that God alone is alone: His \n     creatures must not be.\n       What pains and hurts me most now is the simultaneity of \n     events. While we sit here and discuss how to behave morally, \n     both individually and collectively, over there, in Darfur and \n     elsewhere in Sudan, human beings kill and die.\n\n[[Page S3617]]\n\n       Should the Sudanese victims feel abandoned and neglected, \n     it would be our fault--and perhaps our guilt.\n       That's why we must intervene.\n       If we do, they and their children will be grateful for us. \n     As will be, through them, our own.\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Tragically, since that speech by Mr. Wiesel, we have \nseen precious little actionable courage in preventing the genocide that \nrages in Darfur. Last July, the Congress recognized that genocide is \ntaking place and voted on it here on the floor of the Senate. In \nSeptember, the Bush administration did the same. Yet, since then, the \nsituation has only deteriorated.\n  Estimates of the death toll in Darfur now range from between 250,000 \nto over 300,000 human beings. Killings, torture, destruction of \nvillages, rape and other forms of sexual violence all continue. More \nthan 1.8 million persons have been forced from their homes, and unless \nthe attacks subside and access by humanitarian organizations improves, \nas many as 3 million Sudanese people could be displaced by the end of \nthe year.\n  Let me say that these displaced individuals are going into camps \nstrategically. We need to understand that this is not breeding a \ncommunity of good will to the rest of the world. These are people who \nare disenfranchised, dislocated, and will pose a strategic threat, \npotentially, as a breeding ground of terrorism for the future.\n  This tragedy is that the Government of Sudan remains deeply complicit \nin this genocide, supporting jingaweit militias and participating in \nattacks on civilians. Helicopter gunships strafe villages, spraying \nnail-like flachettes unsuitable for anything other than killing.\n  International monitors of all kinds have been attacked, including \nmembers of the African Union force deployed to Darfur to try to bring \nabout a monitoring of the peace agreements that have been set forth. \nGovernment-backed militias have threatened foreigners and U.N. convoys.\n  In recent weeks, an American aid official was shot and wounded, and \nthe U.N. was forced to withdraw its international staff in west Darfur \nto the provincial capital. Other NGOs are uneasy about their people and \nare talking about withdrawal.\n  Even today, we get reports of a new rampage--an attack on a village \nin Darfur by 350 armed militia. The report by the UN and the AU called \nit a ``senseless and premeditated savage attack.'' The militia \n``rampaged through the village, killing, burning and destroying \neverything in their paths and leaving in their wake total destruction, \nwith only the mosque and the school spared.''\n  I have a U.N. report, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From UN News Service, Apr. 8, 2005]\n\nUN, African Union Condemn ``Savage Attack'' on Darfur Village by Armed \n                                Militia\n\n       United Nations and African Union representatives today \n     condemned a ``senseless and pre-meditated savage attack'' \n     Thursday on a town in the western Darfur area of Sudan by \n     more than 350 armed militia while the Government dragged its \n     heels in designating land for the AU monitoring force meant \n     to deter such incidents.\n       Having learnt ``with utter shock and disbelief'' of the \n     relentless daylong attack on Khor Abeche by armed militia of \n     the Miseriyya tribe of Niteaga, ``we condemn this senseless, \n     and pre-meditated savage attack,'' Jan Pronk, the Special \n     Representative of UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, and AU \n     Ambassador Baba Gana Kingibe said in a joint statement.\n       Nasir Al Tijani Adel Kaadir was identified as having \n     commanded the initial force of over 200 on horses and camels \n     and they were later reinforced by a further 150, also from \n     Niteaga, they said in a statement.\n       His name and those of his collaborators would be sent to \n     the UN Security Council sanctions committee to be brought to \n     justice and they expected the Sudanese Government to take \n     appropriate action, the two said.\n       The attackers ``rampaged through the village, killing, \n     burning and destroying everything in their paths and leaving \n     in their wake total destruction with only the mosque and the \n     school spared,'' their statement said.\n       ``This attack, the savagery of which has not been seen \n     since the sacking of Hamada in January 2005, was apparently \n     in retaliation for the alleged theft of 150 cattle whose \n     tracks were supposedly traced to Khor Abeche village,'' Mr. \n     Pronk and Mr. Kingibe said.\n       They noted that since 3 April the AU had prepared to deploy \n     troops in Niteaga and Khor Abeche to deter precisely this \n     kind of attack, ``but was prevented from acting by what can \n     only be inferred as deliberate official procrastination over \n     the allocation of land for the troops' accommodation.''\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, how has the international community \nresponded to these issues? In recent weeks, the U.N. Security Council \npassed three resolutions. To be sure, to give them credit, there has \nbeen some progress. One resolution referred the situation in Darfur to \nthe International Criminal Court. Another established a U.N. committee \nto recommend targeted sanctions against those responsible for human \nrights abuses.\n  But much has not been done. There have been no efforts to impose, or \neven seriously threaten, sanctions against the Government of Sudan. In \nfact, the Security Council promised significant assistance as a reward \nfor the welcomed implementation of the January peace agreement, the \nnorth-sought agreement between Khartoum and the south, without any \nconditions related to Darfur. Our amendment, which Senator Brownback \nand I will be proposing, supports the peace agreement and allows \nassistance to implement that agreement. But we should not be rewarding \nthe Government of Khartoum while thousands upon thousands of civilians \nin Darfur are dying.\n  This amendment will call for military no-fly zones over Darfur. \nNeither the Bush administration nor our NATO allies have addressed this \ncritical issue. We need to act so that the kinds of tragedies we see in \nthis picture to my right are no longer permitted.\n  This amendment calls for accelerated assistance to the African Union. \nA retired Marine colonel, Brian Steidle, who worked alongside the AU, \nhas described the AU's effectiveness where it has been deployed. But \nthere are currently only 2,200 African Union troops on the ground. Over \n3,400 are authorized, and we hope it can grow to over 6,000 in the next \nyear. We need to increase their numbers and provide whatever assistance \nthey need. Therefore, I am offering a second amendment later in the \ndebate on this underlying supplemental with Senators DeWine, Brownback, \nand others. It is a money appropriation or allocation for the AU to \naccelerate the deployment of boots on the ground.\n  But money alone will not bring security to Darfur. The Darfur \nAccountability Act calls for an expansion of the AU's mandate to \ninclude the protection of civilians. Ultimately, we will have to be \nrealistic about what it takes to police an area the size of Texas. It \nwill take many thousands of troops, more than the AU will be able to \nfield. The 10,000 new U.N. troops authorized by the Security Council \nare therefore a welcome development. But, again, their role in Darfur \nis virtually undefined, certainly vague and uncertain as to whether \nthey can be involved in this.\n  Mr. President, the people of Darfur will not be saved unless stopping \ngenocide becomes a priority. Words and deeds need to match. This \namendment will call on the administration to raise Darfur in all \nrelevant bilateral and multilateral meetings. I hope we can get it \nraised.\n  I am pleased that Deputy Secretary of State Zoellick is going to \nSudan this week. But unless we mobilize an international effort, this \nengagement will be insufficient. We have already seen a lot of lost \nopportunities. I will leave that for the record where President Bush, \nSecretary of Defense Rumsfeld, and the Secretary of State have been in \ninternational areas where we can mobilize that kind of support. We \nsimply cannot just keep calling it genocide and labeling it and talking \nabout it; we need to do something about it. Stopping this evil is an \nurgent and highly moral issue for all of us to take on. That is why \nthere is so much bipartisan focus on this issue.\n  We want to evoke the culture of life. We ought to be protecting those \n10,000 people a month who are dying. How can we claim to be learning \nthe lessons of history when we fail to act? How can we do that? We \ncannot continue to talk about moral responsibilities and then not act \non them.\n  In his remarks in the piece that I put in the Record, Elie Wiesel put \nthis clearly:\n\n       What pains and hurts most now is the simultaneity of \n     events. While we sit here and\n\n[[Page S3618]]\n\n     discuss how to behave morally, both individually and \n     collectively, over there, in Darfur and elsewhere in Sudan, \n     human beings kill and die.\n\n  Mr. President, we must act. The United States must lead a coalition \nof conscience to stop the genocide. That is what this amendment calls \nfor. I urge my colleagues to support it. We will be back with the exact \ndetails. I am very appreciative of the leadership of Senator Brownback, \nSenator DeWine, and a number of individuals on both sides of the aisle. \nWe need to make that coalition of conscience real. It is time to act. I \nbelieve this is an appropriate amendment on the supplemental.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I am delighted to join my colleague \nfrom New Jersey on this amendment. I think by definition a supplemental \nis about emergency needs and emergency spending. I don't know of a \nbigger one taking place right now in the world than in Darfur. So it is \nmy hope that within this supplemental we will be able to deal with this \nissue of Darfur, both in funding and in some language to be able to \nstop this. This is a completely manmade genocide; it is a completely \nmanmade disaster. It is one that can be stopped with a reasonable \nnumber of troops on the ground, with a reasonable engagement strategy.\n  This can stop. Instead of the 300,000 deaths going on up, this can \nand will stop. They need food aid, and they need allocation of funds \nfor African Union forces. We will have Assistant Secretary Zoellick on \nthe ground in Khartoum. He is going to go to the south, and then to the \nwestern part of Sudan after that, to look and to press the situation. \nThe administration is engaged and is pushing. We need to do this in the \nsupplemental. It is important for it to take place.\n  Lest people think this was last year's disaster that we are just \nputting forward more now and saying wasn't that terrible then, we \nshould have acted, I want to show you pictures from this year. Senator \nCorzine showed pictures earlier. This is of a village; it was taken by \nAfrican Union monitors. It is completely burned out, razed. You can \nstill see the smoke smoldering. This was taken by monitors, and they \ngot there just after the village was burned.\n  I have some very graphic pictures I am going to be showing. If people \ndon't want to see them, please turn away. It is the face of genocide. \nGenocide, by definition, involves the killing of one group of people by \nanother. That is taking place and is taking place now. This is a young \nchild who was shot in the upper right portion of the torso, and it \nexits here. You can see the gash here. We don't know if this child \nlived or died. He probably died given the state of health care there. \nThis happened after a raid that took place. This is a child shot in a \nraid because he was an African child.\n  This is a gentleman who was killed and burned.\n  This is a village that is on fire. Someone in a helicopter took this \npicture, supported by the African Union.\n  These are all current pictures.\n  This one I believe my colleague showed as well. It is of a gentleman \nwho was tied up, killed, and probably brutalized in Darfur.\n  These are the faces, and this is the picture of genocide. It is \ncontinuing to occur, and it is occurring now. I encourage my colleagues \nto vote for the passage of the amendment Senator Corzine and I and \nothers are putting forward. It is an amended version of the Darfur \nAccountability Act. It has the wide bipartisan support of 30 members. \nThe amendment calls for several steps to be taken, which my colleague \noutlined: a new U.N. Security Council resolution with sanctions against \nthe Government of Sudan; an extension of the current arms embargo to \ncover the Government of Sudan; military no-fly zone over Darfur; \nexpansion of the U.N. mission in the Sudan; and a mandate to protect \ncivilians in all of Sudan, which includes Darfur. It calls on the \nUnited States to appoint a Presidential envoy to Sudan and to raise \nthis issue at the highest diplomatic levels in bilateral relations with \nSudan, the Chinese, and other governments that can be of assistance. \nThis calls for accelerated assistance to the African Union mission in \nDarfur and an expansion of the size and mandate of the mission \nnecessary to protect civilians.\n  In addition, I hope the administration will push for a coalition of \nconscience. My colleagues mentioned a coalition of willing nations to \njoin the efforts and demand an end to the genocide by making a \ndeclaration of conscience and backing it by actions if the U.N. \nSecurity Council fails to do so.\n  Last week was the 11th-year anniversary of the genocide in Rwanda, \nwhen we declared and the world declared ``never again.'' We are now \nseeing it take place yet again. Can we learn from that? This is \nstoppable, and it is not by a huge commitment. We are not asking for \n100,000 U.S. troops to go there. We are not asking for any U.S. troops. \nWe are asking for financial support for the African Union and food aid \nto be able to maintain the villagers who have been run out of their \nvillage. With that, we believe firmly that this can and will stop and \nthat people will be able to return to their villages.\n  Time is of the essence. Every day in this harsh climate in this \nregion is a day that more people die. There simply are not the \nresources in the area to be able to support the individuals who are \ninvolved.\n  My colleague covered most of the points. I plead with my colleagues \nto pass this amendment in the supplemental. It is an emergency need. It \nis an emergency that is taking place. With this, we will be able to \nsave lives. Keep it in the conference report so it gets to the \nPresident, it gets implemented and the help does come, so when \nSecretary Zoellick returns from the region, he will have this level of \nresources to work with, he will have this commitment from the Congress \nto work with, and we will be able to move forward.\n  If the U.N. fails to act--and I am terribly disappointed in what the \nU.N. is doing in this situation; they are not doing anything at all--\nthe United States must press forward with those willing to act so the \ngenocide can stop, so the killing will stop, so we can move forward \nwith peace and people can go back to their lives.\n  I hope people can start to feel and see some of that pain in front of \nour very eyes that we can stop. We can stop this. I plead with my \ncolleagues to please stop it and support this amendment.\n  I do believe we will get this passed. We need to pass it. I hope it \nis kept in the bill through the entire process.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I add one postscript on this Darfur \nAccountability Act. The House has language dealing with Darfur. We did \nnot have as much of it in here. It is two parts: food and military \nassistance. We are working closely with the committee to try to get \nthis worked through. It will not go over the amount that is in it. It \nwill be offset in other places within the budget. I want to make sure \nthat is clear to my colleagues who are interested in this. They are \nsupportive, but they do not want to bust the supplemental caps. This \nwill be taken from other places we are working on right now.\n  Senator McConnell, Senator Cochran, and other of our colleagues are \nworking diligently with us. It is in two places as far as food aid and \nits assistance to peacekeepers. These will be African Union \npeacekeepers. So I want to get the practicalities of it out.\n  I also admonish my colleagues that where we sit as the most powerful \nNation on the face of the Earth, we are called on to remember those who \nare in bondage as if we were in bondage ourselves. That may seem a \nstrange concept, but when others are free, we are free. If others are \nin bondage, we are going to feel those chains and it will constantly \nrub against our souls. This is something that is important and it is \nalso historic for us.\n  When we fought against slavery in this country, the issue was that \nthe bondage of others was our bondage and people felt it, they fought \nagainst it. It is in the great heritage of this country to fight for \nfreedom for other people, so\n\n[[Page S3619]]\n\nthat when they are in bondage we feel that, but when we can help break \nthat, we will also break bondages on ourselves and make us use the \ngreatness of America for the goodness of the world. It is that goodness \nthat keeps us moving toward greatness.\n  This is not a large sum of money we are talking about, but it is \ncritically important.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I salute the Senator from Kansas. I know \nhe and the Senator from New Jersey have demonstrated extraordinary \nleadership on many issues that have come before this Senate, but \ncertainly on the Darfur Accountability Act. I am an original cosponsor \nof that bipartisan measure and a strong supporter.\n  The latest estimates tell us more than 300,000 people have died in \nDarfur. The world has let this happen. In spite of all of our anguished \npromises after Rwanda that this would never happen again, it is \nhappening again. Reports from aid workers back from Sudan state that \nattacks on the ground are still taking place. Villages are still being \nburned. Much of Darfur is still in a climate of terror. People are \nstill afraid to go out for basics, to venture out for water, for wood, \nor the necessities of life.\n  Early this week, Human Rights Watch released a new report that \nSudanese security forces, including police deployed to protect \ndisplaced persons, and allied jingaweit militias continue to commit \nrape and sexual violence on a daily basis. Refugee camps are no refuge. \nWomen who fled Darfur to refugee camps in Chad have been imprisoned by \nChadian authorities for trying to collect firewood outside their camps. \nMany of them were raped while in jail.\n  This has become a charnel house. This is an inferno. This is one of \nthe rings of hell, and it is happening on our watch.\n  In some areas of Sudan, women who are raped by the jingaweit militia \nare now being threatened with prosecution. In short, Darfur still cries \nout for action. If these conditions do not constitute an emergency, I \ndo not know what does.\n  Do we want to return to the Senate 6 months from now and lament the \nfact that another 300,000 victims have been added to the death tolls in \nthis area? The amendment which will be offered later seeks a new U.N. \nSecurity Council resolution with sanctions, concerted United States \ndiplomacy, an extension of the current arms embargo to cover the \nGovernment of Sudan, the freezing of assets and denial of visas to \nthose responsible for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, \naccelerated assistance of the African Union Mission, and a military no-\nfly zone in Darfur.\n  One of the other components of this amendment is the appointment of a \nnew special envoy to seek peace in Sudan to fill the role Ambassador \nDanforth played so well. As in many things, Pope John Paul II was ahead \nof this. He sent a special envoy last year so that voices of the people \nof Darfur might be heard.\n  The Bible tells us: Blessed be the peacemaker. We need to be \npeacemakers today. Let us hold the Government of Sudan accountable for \nits crimes and for these atrocities. Let us help the people of Darfur, \nand in doing so let us help to end this genocide.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I have requests to make on behalf of the \nmanagers of the bill with respect to amendments that have been cleared \non both sides of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that veterans with a \n       service-connected disability rated as total by virtue of \n   unemployability should be treated as covered by the repeal of the \n phase-in of concurrent receipt of retired pay and veterans disability \n                  compensation for military retirees)\n\n       On page 169, between lines 8 and 9, insert the following:\n\n\nsense of senate on treatment of certain veterans under repeal of phase-\n    in of concurrent receipt of retired pay and veterans disability \n                              compensation\n\n       Sec. 1122. It is the sense of the Senate that any veteran \n     with a service-connected disability rated as total by virtue \n     of having been deemed unemployable who otherwise qualifies \n     for treatment as a qualified retiree for purposes of section \n     1414 of title 10, United States Code, should be entitled to \n     treatment as qualified retiree receiving veterans disability \n     compensation for a disability rated as 100 percent for \n     purposes of the final clause of subsection (a)(1) of such \n     section, as amended by section 642 of the Ronald W. Reagan \n     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 \n     (Public Law 108-375; 118 Stat. 1957), and thus entitled to \n     payment of both retired pay and veterans' disability \n     compensation under such section 1414 commencing as of January \n     1, 2005.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the issue of \nconcurrent receipt and the Bush administration's unfair attempt to \ncontinue to restrict some of our Nation's veterans from receiving the \nfull pay and benefits they have earned.\n  We have debated the ban on concurrent receipt for many years. It is \nan unfair and outdated policy that I and many others in this Chamber \nhave worked hard to end.\n  Over the years, we have made some progress.\n  In 2003, the Congress passed my legislation which allowed disabled \nretired veterans with at least a 50-percent disability rating to become \neligible for full Concurrent Receipt benefits over a 10-year period. \nThis was a significant victory, and as a result of the legislation, \nhundreds of thousands of veterans today are on the road to receiving \nboth their retirement and disability benefits.\n  And we made further progress last year, with the help of Senator \nLevin and others, when we were able to eliminate the 10-year phase-in \nperiod for the most severely disabled veterans--those who were 100 \npercent disabled. A 10-year waiting period was particularly harsh for \nthese veterans, some of whom would not live to see their full benefits \nrestored over the 10-year period, and others who could not work a \nsecond job and were in fact considered ``unemployable.'' So we passed \nlegislation to end the waiting period and provide some relief to these \ndeserving, totally disabled veterans.\n  Unfortunately, the administration's implementation of this \nlegislation has created a new inequity by discriminating between two \ncategories of totally disabled retirees.\n  There are those veterans who have been awarded a 100 percent \ndisability rating by the VA and those whom the VA has rated ``totally \ndisabled''. The veterans considered totally disabled are paid at the \n100 percent disabled rate. This is because the VA has certified that \ntheir service-connected disabilities have left them unemployable.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter sent \nby the Defense Department to the Office of Management and Budget on \nthis issue last December.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. REID. The letter indicates clearly the Defense Department General \nCounsel's opinion that both of these groups should be paid their full \nretired pay and disability compensation under the law Congress passed \nlast year, and it requested permission from OMB to execute the payments \nto unemployables.\n  That permission apparently was not forthcoming, since the Pentagon is \nstill withholding payments for the ``unemployable'' group after all \nthese months--contrary to its own General Counsel's legal review.\n  For all other purposes, both the VA and the Defense Department treat \nunemployables exactly the same as those with 100 percent disability \nratings.\n  In fact, these unemployables must meet a criterion that not even the \n100 percent-rated disability retirees have to meet. They are certified \nas unable to work because of their service-connected disability. The \nadministration pays equal combat-related special compensation to both \ncategories. Yet the administration is discriminating unemployables and \n100 percent disabled retirees with noncombat disabilities in flagrant \ndisregard for the letter of the law as interpreted by its own legal \ncounsel.\n  The time to act is now.\n  As we stated last year, these veterans do not have 10 years to wait \nfor the full phase-in of their benefits. The administration needs to \nact quickly.\n  Hopefully, the expression of the Senate contained in this bill will \nclarify the intent of the Congress so those most severely disabled \nveterans will begin to reap the benefits of last year's legislation.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                     Office of the\n\n\n                                   Under Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, Dec. 21, 2004.\n     Dr. Kathleen Peroff,\n     Deputy Associate Director for National Security, Office of \n         Management and Budget, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ms. Peroff: This letter is to advise your office of \n     how the Department intends to compensate members for full \n     concurrent payment of military retired pay in addition to \n     their Veterans' Affairs (VA) disability compensation under \n     the provisions of section 1414 of title 10, United States \n     Code, as amended by section 642 of the Ronald Reagan National \n     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 (Public Law \n     108-375). Section 642 eliminated the phase-in period for \n     those retirees/veterans determined by the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs to have a disability or combination of \n     disabilities rated as 100 percent disabled.\n       An issue has arisen as to whether this change in the law \n     includes those who are rated as less than 100 percent \n     disabled, but for whom a rating of 100 percent (total) \n     disability is assigned by the VA because the individual is \n     deemed unemployable. Based on a legal review of the relevant \n     statutory authority and legislative intent language (10 \n     U.S.C. 1414; H. Rept. 108-767), we intend to consider these \n     unemployable retirees/veterans covered by the exemption to \n     the phase-in period and grant them full concurrent payments \n     beginning January 1, 2005.\n       The determination to include these unemployable retirees/\n     veterans will result in an added cost of about $1.3 billion \n     in Military Retirement Fund (MRF) outlays over the course of \n     the phase-in period. It will not affect costs after the \n     phase-in period or carry any added increase in accrual costs. \n     Further, all the added cost of full concurrent receipt is \n     passed directly to the Treasury for payments to the MRF. \n     While verbal communication with relevant congressional \n     committee staff suggests that Congress may not have intended \n     to exempt from the phase-in period those unemployable \n     retirees/veterans compensated for 100 percent disability, \n     neither the amended stature nor legislative intent language \n     support this position.\n       We plan to issue guidance to the Defense Finance and \n     Accounting System and the Services on the matter as quickly \n     as possible. Please advise us if the Administration has any \n     differing views.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Charles S. Abell.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 361) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to, and I move to lay that motion on the \ntable.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 424\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I now send an amendment to the desk, on \nmy own behalf, to make a technical correction to the bill. I ask it be \nreported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 387\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I notice we have been in a quorum call and \nrealize I am not taking time from others. I thought this might be a \ngood time to note that I am a cosponsor of the Mikulski amendment.\n  We all know, from the discussion we had yesterday with the \ndistinguished Senator from Maryland and others, that the amendment \nmakes additional visas available for aliens who wish to perform \nseasonal work in the United States. We are well aware of that in my \nState of Vermont. We are also aware of the fact that for the second \nyear in a row the statutory cap on so-called H-2B visas was met before \nbusinesses that needed additional summer employees were even eligible \nto apply for visas.\n  This is kind of a catch-22. They are told they have to wait for a \nperiod of time to be eligible to apply for the visas, and then when the \ntime comes, the visas are already used. It has hurt businesses across \nthe country. This amendment would provide needed relief.\n  In Vermont, many hotels and inns and resorts that have a busy summer \nseason use these visas. I have heard from dozens of these businesses in \nVermont over the past year. They have struggled mightily to manage \nwithout temporary foreign labor. I know the Lake Champlain Chamber of \nCommerce, the Vermont Lodging & Restaurant Association, and many small \nbusinesses in Vermont are vitally concerned, and I expect similar \nassociations and businesses in the other States are as well.\n  It is interesting, one of the places I have heard from is a summer \nbusiness where I worked when I was working my way through college. I \nknow even then, in our little State, to keep it open, to go forward, \nthey needed those foreign workers.\n  You have a wide range of industries that use these visas. This is not \na parochial issue. It is not just Vermont. I suspect the same argument, \none way or the other, could be made in virtually every State. I would \nbe surprised if there is any Senator who has not heard from a \nconstituent who has been harmed by the sudden shortage of H-2B visas. \nMany of them fear they are going to go out of business altogether if \nCongress does not make these visas available.\n  Now, the amendment would not raise the cap on the program but would \nallow those who had entered the United States in previous years through \nthe H-2B program to return. It seems to be a very fair, very reasonable \ncompromise. After all, these are people, by definition, who came to the \nUnited States legally. Then, after coming to the United States legally, \nthey returned to their own countries legally, as they are required to \ndo. The amendment also addresses those concerns some Members have \nexpressed about fraud.\n  I have been working to solve this crisis for more than a year. I \njoined, last year, with a very substantial coalition of both Republican \nand Democratic Senators in introducing S. 2252, the Save Summer Act of \n2004. This was going to increase the cap on the H-2B program. \nUnfortunately, there was a small number of Republican Senators who \nopposed it, so they put a hold on it. It was never allowed to have a \nvote. Our constituents suffered the consequences.\n  This year, I have urged the Mikulski-Gregg bill, on which this \namendment is based, S. 352, be considered by the Judiciary Committee \nwithout delay. It is a bipartisan bill. It deserves to win a broad \nmajority in this body. But this is not one of these things we can talk \nabout and delay and delay and delay on throughout the spring and \nsummer. Many of these businesses, if they are even going to open their \ndoors, if they are going to stay in business this year, need the relief \ntoday.\n  Most of them are small businesses. An awful lot of them--I know the \nowners in my State; I suspect Senator Gregg from New Hampshire knows \nthem in his State--are people who work very hard, with 80- and 90-hour \nweeks. They are sort of mom-and-pop operations. They own their \nbusinesses, and they need this seasonal help or they go out of \nbusiness. If they go out of business, the other people they hire year-\nround are out of a job, and the local community has lost a significant \nplace.\n  We should move forward. These are people relying on us. I do not know \nthe politics of any of these people. I do not care. They are relying on \nus to help keep their businesses afloat.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 427\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, those following the debate on the floor \nunderstand we are considering the supplemental appropriations bill that \ndeals with the war in Iraq and Afghanistan, the tsunami relief, and \nsome other very important elements. I understand there are pending \namendments and also an effort to reach an agreement about how future \namendments will be offered. So even though I will not be offering an \namendment at this time, I would like to say a few words about an \namendment which I plan to offer as soon as an agreement is reached and \nto alert my colleagues and those following the debate what we are \nseeking to achieve.\n  This amendment, which I am proud to cosponsor with Senator Kennedy \nand Senator Levin, relates to troop training in Iraq. I thank the \nchairman and ranking member for their hard work on the bill. I believe \nit is imperative we continue to support our troops and address other \nemergencies in the world, including the devastating tsunami that swept \nacross the Pacific right after Christmas.\n  We fully support our troops. We also want to see them come home. \nTraining Iraqi troops to take the lead in Iraq is critical to our \nsuccess in that country and to getting our service men and women back \nwhere they belong--with their families at home. Therefore, we are \noffering an amendment today to measure our progress toward that goal.\n  In this bill, the Senate is appropriating $5.7 billion for the Iraqi \nSecurity Forces Fund. The accompanying committee report states:\n\n       The funds shall be available to train, equip, and deploy \n     Iraqi security forces as well as provide increased \n     counterinsurgency capabilities.\n\n  That is certainly very good. Our troops cannot come home until Iraqi \nforces can hold their own.\n  When I was in Iraq just a few weeks ago, General Petraeus took us \nfrom the Baghdad airport to a training field nearby, where we saw about \n12 Iraqi soldiers who were masked to hide their identity for fear of \nretribution from their fellow Iraqis as they went through training \ndrills.\n  I have not been in the military. I can't grade these troops as to \ntheir progress. It certainly appeared that they were learning important \nskills. How many troops in Iraq are reaching that level of competence, \nI can't say. That is the purpose of the amendment.\n  Iraqi forces and police must be able to take the lead in conducting \ncounterinsurgency operations. They must be able to protect their own \nborders, safeguard civilian populations, uphold and enforce the rule of \nlaw. When I met with General Petraeus, he said he believed he was \nmaking progress toward that goal, but I think\n\n[[Page S3622]]\n\nwe need to have a better metric to evaluate. We have received mixed \nmessages and mixed information and statistics from the administration \nabout how many Iraqis are trained and what their training really means.\n  Recent figures we received from the Department of Defense tell us \nthat 136,000 Iraqis have been officially trained and equipped, but it \nis still not clear what that means. Does it mean that 136,000 Iraqi \npolice, military, and border personnel are ready to defend their \ncountry, to protect its citizens and borders? Are they ready to take on \nand defeat the serious insurgent threat against American troops and \nIraqis?\n  A March GAO study was very skeptical about the numbers. Joseph \nChristoff, Director of the GAO, testified before the House Government \nReform Committee that:\n\n       Data on the status of Iraqi security forces is unreliable \n     and provides limited information on their capabilities.\n\n  That was a result of a GAO report of the progress being made by our \nDepartment of Defense. We need answers to basic questions. That is why \nwe are offering the amendment--Senator Kennedy, Senator Levin, and I--\nrequiring the Department of Defense to assess unit readiness of Iraqi \nforces and evaluate the effectiveness and status of training of police \nforces.\n  Our amendment is straightforward. It is a reporting requirement \nasking for regular assessments of both the military forces and the \npolice who are being trained with our tax dollars. This is simply \naccountability. As American tax dollars go into Iraq for the training \nof forces, American taxpayers have the right to know whether we are \nmaking progress. Are we meeting our goals? The GAO report indicated, \nfor example, substantial desertions from the ranks of police in Iraq, \nthe number in perhaps the tens of thousands. That is something we need \nto know if it continues. We need to know how many battalions of \nsoldiers are trained, how effectively they can operate. They face a \nfierce insurgency. Are they ready for battle? We want to give them the \ntools to successfully confront it.\n  Finally, we also ask for an assessment of how many American forces \nwill be needed in 6, 12, and 18 months. We are not imposing a deadline. \nWhat we are doing is saying to the administration: Tell us on the one \nhand the level of success which you are experiencing in training Iraqis \nto defend their own country and tell us what it means in terms of \nAmerican forces. When can we expect troops to start returning if this \nIraqi training is successful?\n  As Iraqi troop training expands and improves, we certainly hope \nAmerican troops will come home. We all want to see progress in Iraq. I \nwant to be able to measure it in a way that everyone in Congress--and \ncertainly everyone across the country--knows we are making meaningful \nprogress.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, will the Senator from Illinois yield for \na question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes, I am happy to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator points out the part of the amendment which \nis asking for an estimate of the number of troops. I am a member of the \nArmed Services Committee. This issue has come up in a number of \ndifferent contexts. We are talking about an estimate. We are looking \nfor an estimate in 6 months and 12 months and 18 months. I am just \nwondering whether the Senator from Illinois saw the New York Times on \nApril 11 where General Casey, top commander in Iraq, told CNN a week \nago that if all went well, ``we should be able to take some fairly \nsubstantial reductions in the size of our forces.'' And another senior \nmilitary official said American forces in Iraq could drop to around \n105,000 by early next year from 142,000 now.\n  Clearly, there are estimates that are being considered. It seems that \nthe American people would like to know what these numbers are rather \nthan reading them in the paper. I believe that is what the purpose of \nthe amendment is--to try to communicate to the American people what the \nbest judgment is in terms of the troops. Estimates can vary. As authors \nof the amendment, we understand that. But I do thank the Senator for \nreferring to the GAO report, the fact that the GAO report of March 14 \nsaid that U.S. Government agencies do not report reliable data on the \nextent to which the security forces are trained and equipped. The \nnumber of Iraqi police is unreliable, and the data does not exclude \npolice absent from duty.\n  All we are trying to do is to get estimates for the American people. \nAm I correct?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from Massachusetts is correct. He makes a \nvaluable point. When we in Congress ask the Department of Defense, how \nare we doing in terms of training troops for the Iraqi side, what are \nyour guesses and best estimates in terms of when American troops can \ncome home, many times they tell us, we can't share that information. \nThey give us widely different numbers.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts makes the point that spokesmen for the \nU.S. military apparently speak to the media frequently, volunteering \ninformation about how quickly troops can come home to the United \nStates. If it is good enough for CNN, should it not be good enough for \nthe USA; should not American taxpayers be given this information? I \nthink we want to know that.\n  I understand that we have to stay the course and finish our job. I am \ncommitted to that, even though I shared Senator Kennedy's sentiments \nabout the initiation of the invasion. One of the problems with the \ninsurgency is the question of whether we are a permanent occupying \nforce. I hope we make it clear to the Iraqis that we are there to \nfinish the job, to stabilize their country, and come home. As we start \nmoving down the line on this amendment, which the Senator from \nMassachusetts and Senator Levin have cosponsored, we are going to be \nmoving toward that goal and delivering the right message.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator. I agree with his conclusions. Many \nof us believe this will be enormously helpful in trying to establish \nthe independent Iraq that all of us would like to see. But I thank the \nSenator for bringing up this matter.\n  This follows other evidence that we have had at other times in \nDefense appropriations legislation, basically to provide this kind of \ninformation to the parents, to the military. We are looking for a best \njudgment, best estimate. Clearly, today the military is thinking in \nthose terms. I believe we ought to have some opportunity to share that \ninformation.\n  I thank the Senator from Illinois for offering this amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). Is there objection to setting \naside the pending amendment?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin], for himself, Mr. \n     Levin, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Byrd, and Mr. Leahy, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 427.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank Senator Durbin for bringing up \nthis matter on the supplemental. I welcome the opportunity to join with \nhim and our colleague from Michigan, Senator Levin, and others who \nsupport the amendment. As we have outlined, this amendment basically \nrequires periodic reports on the progress we are making in training \nIraqi security forces.\n  The Senate is currently debating an appropriations bill that would \nprovide $81 billion, primarily for our ongoing war effort in Iraq. This \nfunding will bring the total U.S. bill for the war in Iraq to $192 \nbillion--and still counting.\n  All of us support our troops. We obviously want to do all that we can \nto see that they have proper equipment, vehicles, and everything else \nthey need to protect their lives as they carry out their mission. It is \nscandalous that the administration has kept sending them into battle in \nIraq without proper equipment. No soldier should be sent into battle \nunprotected. No parents should have to go in desperation to the local \nWal-Mart to buy armored plates and mail them to their sons and \ndaughters serving in Iraq.\n  Our military is performing brilliantly under enormously difficult \ncircumstances. But they don't want--and the American people don't \nwant--an open-ended commitment. After all the blunders that took us \ninto war, we need to be certain that the President has a strategy for \nsuccess.\n  The $5.7 billion in this bill for training Iraqi security forces is a \nkey element of a successful strategy to stabilize Iraq and withdraw \nAmerican military forces.\n  The administration has spoken frequently about the need for these \nfunds. But there has been no accountability. It is time to put some \nfacts behind our policy, and that is what this amendment does.\n  The administration has never really given us a straight answer about \nhow many Iraqi security forces are adequately trained and equipped. \nWe're obviously making progress, but it is far from clear how much. The \nAmerican people deserve an honest assessment that provides the basic \nfacts.\n  But that is not what we're being given. According to a GAO report in \nMarch:\n\n       U.S. government agencies do not report reliable data on the \n     extent to which Iraqi security forces are trained and \n     equipped.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       The Departments of State and Defense no longer report on \n     the extent to which Iraqi security forces are equipped with \n     their required weapons, vehicles, communications, equipment, \n     and body armor.\n\n  It is clear from the administration's own statements that they are \nusing the notorious ``fuzzy math'' tactic to avoid an honest appraisal.\n  On February 4, 2004, Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said:\n\n       We have accelerated the training of Iraqi security forces, \n     now more than 200,000 strong.\n\n  Then, a year later, on January 19, 2005, Secretary Condoleezza Rice \nsaid that:\n\n       We think the number right now is somewhere over 120,000.\n\n  On February 3, 2005, in response to questions from Senator Levin at a \nSenate Armed Services Hearing, General Richard Myers, chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, conceded that only 40,000 Iraqi security forces \nare really capable. He said:\n\n       48 deployable (battalions) around the country, equals about \n     40,000, which is the number that can go anywhere and do \n     anything.\n\n  Obviously, we need a better accounting of how much progress is being \nmade to train and equip effective and capable Iraqi Security forces.\n  I am encouraged by reports from our commanders in Iraq that we are \nmaking enough progress in fighting the insurgents and training the \nIraqi security forces to enable the Pentagon to plan for significant \ntroop reductions by early next year.\n  On March 27, General Casey, our top commander in Iraq, said, if \nthings go well in Iraq, ``by this time next year . . . we should be \nable to take some fairly substantial reductions in the size of our \nforces.''\n  According to the New York Times, on Monday, senior military officials \nare saying American troop levels in Iraq could ``drop to around \n105,000'' by early in 2006.\n  These reports are welcome news after 2 years of war in Iraq.\n  April 9 marked the second anniversary of the fall of Baghdad, and in \nthese last 2 years we have paid a high price for the invasion of Iraq.\n  America went to war in Iraq because President Bush insisted that Iraq \nhad strong ties to al-Qaida. It did not. We went to war because \nPresident Bush insisted that Saddam Hussein was on the verge of \nacquiring a nuclear capability. He was not. Long after the invasion of \nIraq began, our teams were scouring possible sites for weapons of mass \ndestruction. Finally, last January, 21\n\n[[Page S3624]]\n\nmonths after the invasion, the search was called off all together.\n  As Hans Blix, the former chief U.N. weapons inspector, said in a \nlecture last month, the United States preferred ``to believe in faith \nbased intelligence.''\n  Today, American forces continue to serve bravely and with great honor \nin Iraq. But the war in Iraq has made it more likely--not less likely--\nthat we will face terrorist attacks in American cities, and not just on \nthe streets of Baghdad. The war has clearly made us less safe and less \nsecure. It has made the war against al-Qaida harder to win.\n  As CIA Director Porter Goss told the Senate Intelligence Committee on \nFebruary 16, we have created a breeding ground for terrorists in Iraq \nand a worldwide cause for the continuing recruitment of anti-American \nextremists.\n  He said:\n\n       The Iraq conflict, while not a cause of extremism, has \n     become a cause for extremists . . . Islamic extremists are \n     exploiting the Iraqi conflict to recruit new anti-U.S. \n     jihadists . . . These jihadists who survive will leave Iraq \n     experienced in and focused on acts of urban terrorism. They \n     represent a potential pool of contacts to build transnational \n     terrorist cells, groups, and networks in Saudi Arabia, Jordan \n     and other countries.\n\n  Three and a half years after the 9/11 attacks, al-Qaida is still the \ngravest threat to our national security, and the war in Iraq has \nominously given al-Qaida new incentives, new recruits, and new \nopportunities to attack us.\n  According to CIA Director Goss, ``al-Qaida is intent on finding ways \nto circumvent U.S. security enhancements to strike Americans and the \nhomeland.''\n  Admiral James Loy, Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security, also warned \nthe Intelligence Committee about the threat from al-Qaida. He said, \n``We believe that attacking the homeland remains at the top of al-\nQaida's operational priority list . . . We believe that their intent \nremains strong for attempting another major operation here.''\n  The danger was also emphasized by Robert Mueller, the FBI Director, \nwho told the Intelligence Committee, ``The threat posed by \ninternational terrorism, and in particular from al-Qaida and related \ngroups, continues to be the gravest we face.'' He said, ``al-Qaida \ncontinues to adapt and move forward with its desire to attack the \nUnited States using any means at its disposal. Their intent to attack \nus at home remains--and their resolve to destroy America has never \nfaltered.''\n  In addition to taking the focus off the real war on terror--the war \nagainst al-Qaida--the war in Iraq has cost us greatly in human terms.\n  Since the invasion began, we have lost more than 1500 servicemen and \nwomen. More than 11,500 have been wounded. That's the equivalent of a \nfull Army division, and we only have 10 active divisions in the entire \narmy. Despite recent progress, since the Iraqi elections in January we \nhave still lost more than one soldier a day.\n  We need to train the Iraqis for the stability of Iraq. But we also \nneed to train them because our current level of deployment is not \nsustainable. Our military has been stretched to the breaking point, \nwith threats in other parts of the world ever-present.\n  As the Defense Science Board told Secretary Rumsfeld last September, \n``Current and projected force structure will not sustain our current \nand projected global stabilization commitments.''\n  LTG John Riggs said it clearly: ``I have been in the Army 39 years, \nand I've never seen the Army as stretched in that 39 years as I have \ntoday.'' A full 32 percent of our military has already served two or \nmore tours of duty in Iraq or Afghanistan. That fact makes it harder \nfor us to respond to threats elsewhere in the world.\n  The war has also undermined the Guard and Reserve. Forty percent of \nthe troops in Iraq are Guard or Reservists, and we are rapidly running \nout of available soldiers who can be deployed.\n  The average tour for reservists recalled to active duty is now 320 \ndays, close to a year. In the first Gulf War, it was 156 days; in \nBosnia and Kosovo, 200 days. In December, General James Helmley, the \nhead of the Army Reserves warned that the Reserve ``is rapidly \ndegenerating into a `broken' force'' and ``is in grave danger of being \nunable to meet other operational requirements.''\n  The families of our military, Guard and Reserves are also suffering. \nTroops in Iraq are under an order that prevents them ever from leaving \nactive duty when their term of service is over.\n  A survey by the Defense Department last May found that reservists, \ntheir spouses, their families, and their employers are less supportive \nnow of their remaining in the military than they were a year ago.\n  The war has clearly undermined the Pentagon's ability to attract new \nrecruits and retain those already serving. In March, the active duty \nArmy fell short of its recruiting goal by a full 32 percent. Every \nmonth this year, the Marines have missed their recruiting goal. The \nlast time that happened was July 1995.\n  The Army Reserves are being hit especially hard. In March, it missed \na recruiting goal by almost half, falling short by 46 percent.\n  To deal with its recruiting problems, the Army National Guard has \nincreased retention bonuses from $5,000 to $15,000 and first-time \nsigning bonuses from $6000 to $10,000. The Pentagon has raised the \nmaximum age for Army National Guard recruits from 34 to 39. Without \nthese changes, according to General Steven Blum, Chief of the Army \nNational Guard, ``The Guard will be broken and not ready the next time \nit's needed, either here at home or for war.''\n  We all hope for the best in Iraq. We all want democracy to take root \nfirmly and irrevocably.\n  Our men and women in uniform, and the American people deserve to know \nthat the President has a strategy for success. They want to know how \nlong it will take to train the Iraqi security forces to ably defend \ntheir own country so American men and women will no longer have to die \nin Iraq. They want to know when we will have achieved our mission, and \nwhen our soldiers will be able to come home with dignity and honor.\n  At a March 1 hearing in the Senate Armed Services Committee, General \nAbizaid, the leader of the Central Command, gave the clearest \nindication so far about when our mission might end.\n  General Abizaid said, ``I believe that in 2005, the most important \nstatement that we should be able to make is that in the majority of the \ncountry, Iraqi security forces will take the lead in fighting the \ncounterinsurgency. That is our goal.''\n  Speaking about the capabilities of the Iraqi security forces, General \nAbizaid said, ``I think in 2005 they'll take on the majority of the \ntasks necessary to be done.'' That's this year.\n  On March 27, General Casey, commanding General of the Multi-National \nForce in Iraq said, ``By this time next year . . . assuming that the \npolitical process continues to go positively . . . and the Iraqi army \ncontinues to progress and develop as we think it will, we should be \nable to take some fairly substantial reductions in the size of our \nforces.''\n  Our troops are clearly still needed to deal with the insurgency. Just \nas clearly, we need an effective training program to enable the Iraqis \nto be self-reliant.\n  But there is wide agreement that the presence of American troops \nfuels the insurgency. If the Iraqis make significant progress this \nyear, it is perfectly logical to expect that more American troops will \nbe able to return home.\n  Shortly after the elections in Iraq in January, the administration \nannounced that 15,000 American troops that were added to provide \nsecurity for the elections would return.\n  Additional reductions in our military presence, as Iraqis are trained \nto take over those functions, would clearly help take the American face \noff the occupation and send a clearer signal to the Iraqi people that \nwe have no long-term designs on their country.\n  In US News and World Report in February, General Abizaid emphasized \nthis basic point. He said ``An overbearing presence, or a larger than \nacceptable footprint in the region, works against you . . . The first \nthing you say to yourself is that you have to have the local people \nhelp themselves.''\n  Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz stated in a hearing at the Senate Armed \nServices Committee on February 3, ``I have talked to some of our \ncommanders in the area. They believe that over the course of the next \nsix months you will see whole areas of Iraq successfully handed over to \nthe Iraqi army and\n\n[[Page S3625]]\n\nIraqi police.'' Today 2 of those 6 months have passed, and all of us \nhope that we are on track to meet his goal.\n  Before the election in Iraq in January, the administration repeatedly \nstated that 14 of the 18 provinces in Iraq are safe. We heard a similar \nview in a briefing from Ambassador Negroponte earlier this year.\n  If some areas can soon be turned over to the Iraqis, as Secretary \nWolfowitz indicated, it should be done. It would be a powerful signal \nto the Iraqi people that the United States is not planning a permanent \noccupation of their country. If entire areas are being turned over to \nthe Iraqis, we should be able to bring more American troops home.\n  We know the road ahead will be difficult, because the violence is far \nfrom ended.\n  The President's commitment to keeping American troops in Iraq as long \nas it takes and not a day longer is not enough for our soldiers and \ntheir loved ones. They deserve a clearer indication of what lies ahead, \nand so do the American people.\n  President Bush should be able to tell us how much progress--how much \nreal progress--we are making in training the Iraqi security forces. Our \namendment asks for specific information on that progress, if it's \nhappening.\n  President Bush should be able to tell us how many American soldiers \nhe expects will still be in Iraq 6 months from now, 12 months from now, \n18 months from now.\n  General Abizaid and other military officials have begun to provide \nclarification of that very important issue, and I hope the President \nwill as well.\n  Our amendment contributes significantly to that goal, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment Senator \nKennedy has addressed, which was introduced by Senator Durbin. It \nrepresents an effort to obtain information that is critically important \nto the American people in reaching a judgment, critically important to \nthe Congress in reaching a judgment, critically important, I believe, \nto our military leaders, first and foremost, in reaching a judgment as \nto how quickly we can remove forces from Iraq.\n  It is in everybody's interest that we succeed in Iraq. Some of us who \nwere highly critical of the way we went into Iraq--more unilaterally \nthan we should have, without the support of any Muslim nations, making \nour presence a Western occupation of a Muslim nation, with all of the \nproblems that unleashes, and many of us who have been critical of the \nway in which the Iraqi army was disbanded unilaterally, without much \nthought, and the way in which we did not have a plan for a violent \naftermath when we went in, the way in which we didn't listen to our \nmilitary leaders in terms of the need to prepare for the possibility of \nthe violent aftermath. All of us, those of us who were critics and \nthose of us who were supporters, now have a common interest in Iraq and \nhave had, once the decision was made to go into Iraq, and that is that \nwe succeed in Iraq.\n  Success in Iraq requires that the Iraqis take over their own defense \nand their own security. This amendment will help give us a roadmap \ntoward understanding how long it will take, what is necessary, what the \ncost will be for the Iraqis to take over their own security, the key to \nour exit, first reductions in our American forces, and then to our \nultimate departure from Iraq, and the key to it is how quickly we can \nturn over to Iraq their own security.\n  This amendment sets forth a number of reporting requirements, which \nwill help us to make a judgment as to how quickly that can be done, \nwhich will help the American people to understand there is a strategy \nhere, there are markers along the road we are on which will tell us \nwhether we are achieving that essential security and, more importantly, \nwhether the Iraqis are achieving that essential security for \nthemselves.\n  Two things are going to be necessary here for success to be achieved. \nOne is to secure the area and the other is a political accommodation \nbetween the people in Iraq--people who have different religious \nbeliefs, different ethnic backgrounds, people who are now going to have \nto put themselves together to form a nation.\n  In terms of the training of Iraqi troops, we have very different \nestimates over the months, and it is very difficult for us in Congress \nand for the American people to make a judgment as to how quickly we are \ngoing to be able to reduce our presence in Iraq--a presence which has \nfueled the insurgency against us, which is used as a propaganda tool \nagainst us, because we are characterized as Western occupiers in a \nMuslim nation. The longer we stay there, the more troops we have there, \nthe more we play into the hands of those who want to destroy us and \ndestroy the hopes of Iraqis for a nation.\n  I want to give a few examples of the discrepancies in the \ncharacterization of the ability of the Iraqis to protect and defend \nthemselves. Back in September of last year, President Bush said the \nfollowing:\n\n       Nearly 100,000 fully trained--\n\n  I emphasize fully trained.\n\n     --and equipped Iraqi soldiers, police officers, and other \n     security personnel are working today.\n\n  But then George Casey, our commander of the multinational force in \nIraq, in January said the following:\n\n       When Prime Minister Allawi took office in June of 2004, he \n     had one deployable battalion. Today, he has 40. When you \n     multiply 40 battalions that are deployable with the number of \n     people in each battalion, it comes out to approximately \n     30,000 personnel.\n\n  So when General Casey spoke in January, months after President Bush \ntold us there were 100,000 fully trained and equipped Iraqi soldiers, \nthere were still but 30,000 personnel in Iraq who were deployable.\n  This is what General Myers said in February: That there are about \n40,000 Iraqis in the police and military battalions, 40,000 that can \n``go anywhere in the country and take on almost any threat.''\n  That is a very different impression than is given by the weekly \nstatus reports we get from the administration. This is the State \nDepartment's most recent weekly status report as to what they call \ntrained-and-equipped Iraqi forces--152,000 this week.\n  There are not 152,000 Iraqi forces capable of taking on insurgents. \nIf we are lucky, the number is about one-third of that. But we have to \nknow two numbers, not just one, not just the weekly State Department \nnumber as to how many people are trained and equipped, but how many of \nthose people are sufficiently trained and equipped so they can take on \nthe insurgency. That is the critical number--how many are capable \nmilitarily of taking on insurgents.\n  I will give one other example of the discrepancy of the \ncharacterization of the capability of Iraqi forces.\n  When this supplemental in front of us was provided to us in February, \nthis is what the supplemental represented to us: That 89 of the 90 \nbattalions of Iraqi security forces that have been fielded--89 of 90--\nare ``lightly equipped and armed and have very limited mobility and \nsustainment capabilities.'' That is about 95 percent plus of the Iraqi \nsecurity forces today, according to the supplemental request; 95 \npercent are lightly equipped and armed and have limited mobility and \nsustainment. How different that is from the most recent weekly report \nwe just received of 152,000 troops.\n  It is essential, it is critically important, no matter what one's \nviews of the war are--the wisdom of going in, how well run it has been \nsince we went in--no matter how pessimistic or optimistic one is, no \nmatter how critical or positive one is, in terms of the operations and \nthe way they were planned or not planned and the decision to go in as \nwe did, we must have numbers, we must have estimates, which this \namendment would require in regular reports, as to what the capabilities \nare of the Iraqi forces.\n  We need two numbers. We need that total number, 152,000, but we need \nthe number of Iraqi forces that are capable of taking on the \ninsurgents: How many are deployable? how many have real mobility and \nsustainment capabilities? How many are well trained and equipped so \nthey can take on the insurgents?\n  That number is critical to Iraq. It is critical to Americans. \nAmericans have the right to know the information this amendment \nrequires be provided in regular reports.\n  I have one other comment before I yield the floor. In addition to the \nsecurity requirements that must be met so\n\n[[Page S3626]]\n\nwe can say that our involvement in Iraq has been a success, there must \nbe a political accommodation. That political accommodation, in many \nways, is more complicated than the military situation. We need people \nwho now distrust each other, people who have attacked each other over \nthe decades, to now come together politically and to work out a new \nconstitution which will protect the rights of minorities in Iraq.\n  We have a major group in Iraq, the Shi'a, who feel, and properly so, \nthat a small minority of Sunni Baathists, particularly in the \nleadership of the Baathist political movement, attacked the Shi'as with \ngas and with other means. These are Iraqis who were destroyed by \nIraqis, by Saddam Hussein and the henchmen who were around Saddam \nHussein. So the Shi'a community needs to accommodate themselves to a \nsignificant protection for a Sunni minority, and that Sunni minority \nmust get used to the fact, the reality, the Shi'as are the majority of \nIraqis, and they have elected a majority of members who are going to be \npresent in the Iraqi Assembly. Of course, there is the yearning of the \nKurds for significant autonomy. All that needs to be put together.\n  It is a very complicated equation for that to happen. As we hopefully \nachieve some success on the security side, we must keep a very wary eye \nopen as to what is happening or not happening on the political side of \nthe challenge in Iraq.\n  The constitution will be written by a commission which will be \nselected by an assembly which is now in place. That assembly will have \nits Prime Minister within the next few days and will then be able to \nselect a constitutional commission which will write a constitution. \nThat commission needs to reflect the Iraqi people, not the makeup of \nthe assembly which has much too small a percentage of Sunnis, given the \nfact they did not vote. But the Shi'a majority needs to be wise enough, \nin selecting the commission that will write the constitution, to have a \nbroadly representative commission that will write a constitution that \nis protective of the minorities in Iraq, that will guarantee majority \nrights, of course, but that in any decent nation will protect the \nminority as well.\n\n  That is the challenge they face. They are supposed to meet that \nchallenge by August. They will not do that, obviously. They have a 6-\nmonth extension beyond that where they must write a constitution. \nGetting that constitution written is a major challenge, and anything we \ncan do to facilitate that, it seems to me, would be very wise, indeed.\n  We have two challenges, one of which is addressed in the amendment \nbefore us relative to Iraqi security and the progress they are \nhopefully making, to give us the information that is important for a \njudgment to which the American people, the Congress, and our uniformed \nmilitary are entitled from this administration. I hope this has broad \nsupport and the Senate adopts the Durbin amendment.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 387\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of an \namendment that my good friend from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, and I \nand a number of other Senators have offered and which does have \nbipartisan support. It has to do with the H-2B visa program.\n  Small businesses all over our Nation count on the H-2B visa program \nto keep their businesses operating. Many use this program year after \nyear because it is the only way they can legally hire temporary or \nseasonal positions when no American workers are available. These \ncompanies hire all the American workers they can find, and they do look \nfor American workers. But if they cannot find them, they need to get \nadditional seasonal help, they need to find workers to meet the demands \nof their businesses and, indeed, to stay in business. These businesses \nare in construction, seafood, yard services, tourism and other season \nenterprises.\n\n  Congress has capped the H-2B visa program at 66,000 visas per year. \nThat has not been adjusted since this visa category was initially \ncapped in 1990. So since 1990 the visa cap has been 66,000. However, \nduring those years, and here we are 15 years later, there are a variety \nof factors that have hampered U.S. employers from having the ability to \nfind and hire more willing American workers for short-term positions. \nThe shortages occur for a variety of reasons. It is actually getting \nmuch worse because Americans are unwilling to engage in low-skilled, \nsemi-skilled short-term employment. In most instances, Americans are \nunwilling to relocate to a new location for several months out of a \nyear, a move that many of these short-term jobs require. That is \nlogical. People aren't going to want to move for 3 or 4 months and then \nmove back to another place.\n  According to the Department of Homeland Security, the H-2B cap of \n66,000 was reached a few months into the fiscal year. This is the \nsecond year in a row the cap has been reached this early. You may \nwonder why we are reaching the cap at such an early stage. What is the \nproblem? Under current law employers cannot file an H-2B application \nuntil 120 days before they need the employee. Therefore, the H-2B \nprogram puts businesses whose peaks are in the summer and in the autumn \nat a disadvantage because the Citizenship and Immigration Services \ncannot process their applications until at least January or February, \nsince these jobs generally start around Memorial Day. Therefore, if the \ncap is reached in January and February, as it was in the last several \nyears, these employers who rely on seasonal workers are clearly put at \na disadvantage.\n  I have heard from these employers. One of our most important jobs \nthat I have as a Senator is to listen to people out there in the real \nworld, to see what are the effects of certain laws and see if there are \nways to allow those in the free enterprise system, particularly small \nbusinesses, to continue to operate. I do listen to my constituents. My \nconstituents have clearly voiced their concerns about the H-2B program \nand have asked for help. I think it is important that we respond.\n  I will give some examples of what is going on. There is a company \ncalled WEMOW. WEMOW is a landscaping design and lawn maintenance \ncompany in Blacksburg, VA. This company relies heavily on the H-2B \nprogram, and sadly they have had to cut back on services they can \nprovide because of the lack of a workforce to meet that demand. \nChristopher Via, who is the president of WEMOW, wrote me. I will quote \nfrom his letter. He said:\n\n       While my company spends considerable time and money to \n     recruit U.S. workers, the positions we need to fill are hot, \n     labor intensive, physically exhausting low- and semiskilled \n     jobs that many Americans do not want to fill. Therefore, our \n     ability to meet seasonal demand and stay in business relies \n     on finding temporary workers. H-2B workers have proven \n     critical in filling this need.\n\n  Of course, they are late in the season, so therefore they do not get \nthe workers they could to meet those needs.\n  Another letter I received is from a company in Yorktown. Yorktown is \na very famous tourism area. Stephen C. Barrs, the president of C.A. \nBarrs Contractor, Inc., wrote:\n\n       While our company recruits U.S. workers, our company and \n     our industry as a whole have been unable to find American \n     workers. We have presented evidence to the Department of \n     Labor that there are no U.S. workers available to fill our \n     vacant positions. Our company employs approximately 100 \n     people, and we specialize in road construction. The H-2B \n     program provides foreign employees who have proven tremendous \n     employees. We have relied on the H-2B program for 6 years and \n     find this program invaluable. Once our season ends, our H-\n     2B workers return home. This is more a small business \n     issue than an immigration issue. We fear this program is \n     in jeopardy, and if it is cut in any way, our small \n     businesses will sustain a very damaging loss.\n\n  These are two of hundreds of letters I have received from small \nbusinesses all across Virginia, asking for our immediate help. Our \namendment does that. It provides an immediate legislative remedy that \nhelps these businesses get part-time seasonal workers.\n  Before I get into the details of what this amendment does, I want to \nclearly outline what this amendment does not do. I first want to stress \nthat this amendment in no way changes the existing requirements for \napplying for an H-2B visa. U.S. employers must demonstrate to State and \nFederal departments of labor that there are no available U.S. workers \nto fill vacant seasonal positions. Subsequently, they\n\n[[Page S3627]]\n\nmust obtain an approved labor certification from the U.S. Department of \nLabor, file a visa petition application with the Citizenship and \nImmigration Service for H-2B workers, and obtain approved H-2B visas \nfor workers in their home countries.\n  With that understanding, I would like to outline what this amendment \ndoes effectuate. Specifically, our amendment would exempt temporary \nseasonal workers who have participated in the H-2B visa program, and \nhave completely followed the law during the past 3 fiscal years from \ncounting toward the statutory cap of 66,000.\n  Second, this amendment has a number of new antifraud provisions. One \nsuch provision requires employers to pay an additional fee of $150 on \neach H-2B petition, and those fees are placed into the fraud and \nprevention detection account of the U.S. Treasury.\n  Third, this amendment creates new sanctions for those who \nmisrepresent facts on a petition of an H-2B visa. This provision is \ndesigned to further strengthen the Department of Homeland Security's \nenforcement power to sanction those who violate our Nation's \nimmigration laws. If an employer violates this section, the Department \nof Homeland Security will have the power to fine the individual \nemployer and/or not approve, of course, their H-2B petitions.\n  Fourth, moreover, the amendment divides the cap more equitably, \ngiving half of the visas to fall and winter businesses and half to \nspring and summer businesses. So you do not get into this whole gaming \nsituation of when do the applications get in, and end up with a \nfrustrating disruption at the end of the year.\n  Finally, this amendment adds some simple, commonsense reporting \nrequirements that will allow Congress to get more information on the H-\n2B program users as we in Congress move toward a more comprehensive, \nlong-term solution to this problem.\n  Our amendment provides the needed temporary addressing and the fix \nthat is needed to a problem that, if left unresolved, will ultimately \nharm our economy. Jobs will be lost, whether they are in landscaping, \nwhether they are in seafood, whether they are in contracting, whether \nthey are in tourism. These are all small businesses. They are good, \nlaw-abiding citizens. They are trying to use and will use this program \nlawfully, but we need to bring some common sense into this program.\n  We need to act as soon as possible. Many of these businesses are \nfamily businesses, and they need to stay in operation. They provide \nservices which their customers and the people in their communities \ndesire.\n  I strongly and respectfully urge my colleagues to vote in favor of \nthis amendment. It is not solely an immigration issue. As my friend and \nconstituent from Yorktown said, this is a small business issue as well.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 351\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Salazar] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 351.\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that the earned income tax \n    credit provides critical support to many military and civilian \n                               families)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. _. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) In an effort to provide support to military families, \n     this Act includes an important increase in the maximum \n     payable benefit under Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance \n     from $150,000 to $400,000.\n       (2) In an effort to provide support to military families, \n     this Act includes an important increase in the death gratuity \n     from $12,000 to $100,000.\n       (3) In an effort to provide support to military families, \n     this Act includes an important increase in the maximum \n     Reserve Affiliation bonus to $10,000.\n       (4) The Federal earned income tax credit (EITC) under \n     section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 provides \n     critical tax relief and support to military as well as \n     civilian families. In 2003, approximately 21,000,000 families \n     benefitted from the EITC.\n       (5) Nearly 160,000 active duty members of the armed forces, \n     11 percent of all active duty members, currently are eligible \n     for the EITC, based on analyses of data from the Department \n     of Defense and the Government Accountability Office.\n       (6) Congress acted in 2001 and 2004 to expand EITC \n     eligibility to more military personnel, recognizing that \n     military families and their finances are intensely affected \n     by war.\n       (7) With over 300,000 National Guard and reservists called \n     to active duty since September 11, 2001, the need for tax \n     assistance is greater than ever.\n       (8) Census data shows that the EITC lifted 4,900,000 people \n     out of poverty in 2002, including 2,700,000 children. The \n     EITC lifts more children out of poverty than any other single \n     program or category of programs.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) Congress should take steps necessary to support our \n     troops and their families;\n       (2) it is not in the interests of our troops and their \n     families to reduce the earned income tax credit under section \n     32 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; and\n       (3) the conference committee for H. Con. Res. 96, the \n     concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2006, \n     should not assume any reduction in the earned income tax \n     credit in the budget process this year, as provided in such \n     resolution as passed by the House of Representatives.\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, before commenting on this amendment, I \nwish to take a minute to thank the chairman and ranking member, \nSenators Cochran and Byrd, for all their hard work on this important \nbill. I am especially appreciative of the help and support they have \noffered this Senator on two amendments.\n\n  They and their staffs have been helpful as we try to ensure that the \nbrave Lebanese people who stood up to their Syrian occupiers know we \nare here to support them. Earlier today we made a down payment on a \ncommitment to help ensure they have the free and fair elections and \nstrong and vibrant democracy they have earned. I want especially to \nthank the staffs of Senators McConnell and Leahy for the help on the \nLebanon amendment.\n  I am also hopeful that we will be able to fix something that I have \nconsidered an injustice since I came to the Senate earlier this year. \nThe assistance we provide to military families in the event of a loss \nof their family member is referred to as the ``death gratuity.'' That \nis a misnomer, and I am hopeful that we will be able to correct that by \nrenaming this assistance as something more fitting, namely, ``Fallen \nHero Compensation.''\n  Regarding the amendment I have just sent to the desk, it is quite \nsimple. It clearly states our support for the earned income tax credit, \nespecially because this program benefits working families and a large \namount of our active duty military personnel.\n  Given that we are considering a bill that provides critical support \nto our troops and their families and that later this week many millions \nof Americans will be filing their taxes, I believe this amendment \nneeded to be heard on this bill this week.\n  The EITC was first enacted in 1975 to aid the working poor. According \nto an analysis released just this week by a highly respected, non-\npartisan institute in Denver, the Bell Policy Center, in the past year, \nmore than 150,000 active military personnel nationwide qualified for \nthe EITC. In my State of Colorado alone, over 3,000 members of the \nmilitary qualified for the EITC.\n  The EITC has long enjoyed bipartisan support because the credit is \nextended only to families that have work income. Most recently, under \nthe leadership of Senator Mark Pryor, this body overwhelmingly approved \nthe expansion of the EITC to more military families.\n  That is as it should be . . . given all that these families give for \nour country, it is the least the country can do for them.\n  Now, however, it appears that this effective program that has lifted \nover 2.7 million children above the poverty level is coming under \nattack.\n  Recently the House of Representatives indicated that it is \nconsidering cutting the EITC in its budget reconciliation. Such cuts, \nif enacted by\n\n[[Page S3628]]\n\nthe full Congress, could lead to higher taxes for many of our military \nfamilies.\n  This is not fair and this is not right.\n  At a time when many of our military personnel are overseas and when \nour national guard reserves have been called up at historic rates, we \nshould be providing for our men and women in uniform. We should not be \ntaking away from them and placing them at a greater financial \ndisadvantage.\n  I hope the Senate will be heard loudly and clearly that this is not \nthe right thing to do. Our troops and their families deserve no less.\n  I urge my Senate colleagues to reject any cuts to the EITC.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Colorado. In \nfact, I rise to discuss an individual who the Senator from Colorado and \nI met when we were part of a bipartisan delegation led by the \nDemocratic leader, Harry Reid, a couple of weeks ago. On that trip, we \nvisited a number of countries--Kuwait, Iraq, Israel, France, Georgia, \nUkraine, and the Palestinian territory. We saw a number of emerging \ndemocracies. It made me think of what our own country might have been \nlike more than 200 years ago. We visited with two men who were named \nPrime Minister and Speaker of the Iraqi Parliament a week later. In \nGeorgia, we saw the young government. Many of them were educated here \nin the United States as students. When we went to Ukraine, we met Mr. \nYuschenko and some of the students who had been part of this \nrevolution. What we saw was very impressive, as were those people we \nwere introduced to.\n  But from my way of thinking, there was no one more impressive than \nthe Finance Minister of the Palestinian Authority, Salam Fayyad, who \ninstituted a number of reforms to fight corruption and bring \ntransparency to the finances of that Authority.\n  This remarkable individual was born Palestinian, and his family fled \nthe West Bank for Jordan in 1968. He studied at the American University \nin Beirut. He later received a Ph.D. in economics from the University \nof Texas at Austin. He worked for the Federal Reserve in St. Louis and \nthe International Monetary Fund in Washington, DC. He became the IMF \nrepresentative to the Palestinian Authority and moved to Jerusalem in \n1995. Then, in 2002, he was named Finance Minister of the Palestinian \nAuthority.\n  What is remarkable is that all of us either know or suspect that when \nArafat was in power, there was gross corruption with the moneys that \ncame into Palestine. Mr. Fayyad has done the following things: He \ncentralized control of the Palestinian Authority's finances. \nPreviously, agencies had collected the money and kept it. That meant, \nfor example, that education was poorly funded since it collected little \nmoney. Mr. Fayyad forced all the incoming funds to be put into the \ngeneral treasury and disbursed by the Finance Minister.\n  The next thing he did was direct deposits for Palestinian security \nforces. Previously, money was given in plastic bags to commanders for \nthem to distribute. Obviously, this led to what might generously be \ncalled a lot of mismanagement of those funds. Now soldiers are much \nhappier because they get their pay on time, and the government is sure \nthe money is going where it should. The soldiers and the government \nboth know the money is not going to somebody who didn't earn it.\n  Public budgeting: He issued the first publicly detailed budget for \nthe Authority, which totaled about $1.28 billion. The Ministry now \nissues public monthly reports of the government's financial status.\n  Eliminating graft: Due to his efforts, revenue of the Palestinian \nAuthority is up from $45 million to $75 million, largely because money \nthat was skimmed off the top in the past is going into the treasury \nwhere it belongs. I am not just saying this today because I want to \ngive a pat on the back to Mr. Fayyad, who, in taking these steps, has \nshown a great deal of courage. I am sure there are a good number of \npeople in the Palestinian territory who were skimming money off the top \nbefore who are not going to be happy with him now. I am bringing this \nup today because it has to do with a vote we are about to take here in \nthe Senate.\n  The bill before us, the supplemental appropriations bill, provides \n$200 million of the President's request for aid to the Palestinian \nterritories. There is another $150 million in the normal budgeting \nprocess. Unlike the House version of this supplemental appropriations \nbill, our version--the Senate version as it is coming to us--preserves \nthe President's waiver authority that would allow him to designate a \nportion of those funds as he sees fit by the use of the Palestinian \nAuthority. I believe that policy--the Senate policy--is the right \npolicy. In other words, our policy would permit our President, \nPresident Bush, to decide that Mr. Fayyad and the government of the \nPalestinian Authority could properly spend this money. Some people are \nsaying they stole money over there before. Yes they did. Yasser Arafat \nis dead and buried. It is time to make a new start.\n\n  The Finance Minister has made great strides to ensure that funds are \npublicly accountable. We will be able to keep track of where our \ntaxpayer money goes. The Palestinian Authority needs some money. There \nis no poorer part of the world than the Gaza Strip. Someone has to \nprovide security in the Gaza Strip. We look to the Palestinian \nAuthority to do that if the Israelis pull out. Someone has to provide a \nsocial services safety net for these poor people so they are not \ntempted to join with the terrorists. We look to the Palestinian \nAuthority to do that.\n  Why in the world would we keep our President from making the decision \nthat would give the money to the Palestinian Authority, which is the \ngroup we are counting on to provide security and to provide the social \nsafety net?\n  Nongovernment agriculture organizations can provide valuable help in \nsupport of what the Palestinian Authority is doing. If we are going to \ndo business with the Palestinian Authority, and are going to expect \nthem to be accountable for keeping things safe and providing a basic \nlevel of social services so people are able to eat, we should deal \ndirectly with them. At the very least we should give the President of \nthe United States the authority, as the Senate bill does, to deal \ndirectly with the Palestinian Authority.\n  I am happy with what our Committee on Appropriations has done. I \ndisagree with what the House of Representatives has done, and I suppose \nthe matter will go to conference. I hope in the conference the Senators \nwill insist on the Senate provision, and I hope our House Members will \nsee the wisdom of giving our President the discretion to give the money \nto the Government that we are going to hold accountable.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, my colleague from South Carolina, \nSenator Lindsey Graham, and I come to the floor this afternoon to speak \nabout the necessity of expanding TRICARE for National Guard members and \nreservists. I especially thank Senator Graham for his hard work and \nadvocacy on behalf of this legislation.\n  Almost 2 years ago exactly, in the spring of 2003, Senator Graham and \nI joined at the Reserve Officers Association building to announce the \nfirst version of this legislation. In the intervening years, we have \nmade a great deal of progress in expanding access to TRICARE, the \nmilitary health program. But we agree there is still a long way to go.\n  We recently discovered our proposed legislation to ensure that \nNational Guard and Reserve members have access to the military health \nprogram known as TRICARE does not have a cost this year, so it was not \nappropriate for us to attempt to attach this to the supplemental \nappropriations bill that is currently on the floor. But we are \nextremely hopeful we will be able to include legislation in this year's \nDepartment of Defense authorization bill.\n  Because Senator Graham and I serve on the Armed Services Committee, \nwe have heard firsthand, as have many of my colleagues, about the \nextraordinary\n\n[[Page S3629]]\n\nstrain being placed on our Guard and Reserve Forces. We are well aware \nthat a major part of our military success in Iraq and Afghanistan has \nbeen because of the role played by reservists and Guard members who \nheeded the call to serve their country--for some, not once, not twice, \nbut three times in Iraq and/or Afghanistan.\n  Since September 11, our reservists and National Guard members have \nbeen called upon with increasing frequency. From homeland security \nmissions where they were absolutely essential in New York after 9/11, \nNational Guard men and women patrolled and guarded our subways, the \nAmtrak lines in Penn Station, other places of importance. We have seen \nin so many other instances where they were called to duty here in our \nown homeland. We also know they have paid the ultimate sacrifice, \nlosing their lives in serving the missions they were called to fulfill \nin Iraq and Afghanistan or being grievously wounded and returning home, \nhaving given their all to our country.\n  In New York we have over 30,000 members of the Guard and Reserves, \nand over 4,000 are currently deployed in support of Operation Iraqi \nFreedom. When I have visited with our activated reservists and National \nGuard in New York, I have been greatly impressed by their willingness \nand even eagerness, in some cases, to serve. But I have also heard \nabout the strains they face, that their families have borne, that their \nbusinesses have endured. It is abundantly clear we are having some \ndifficulty in recruitment and retention of the Guard and Reserve \nbecause of the extraordinary stresses being placed on these very \ndedicated individuals. Now more than ever, we need to address the needs \nof our Guard and Reserve members. The general of the Army Reserves, \nGeneral Helmly, has expressed concern about whether we are going to be \nable to meet our needs for the Reserve component.\n  The legislation Senator Graham and I have been working on for 2 years \nis bipartisan. It is not a party issue. It is a core American issue. \nOur TRICARE legislation allows Guard and Reserve members the option of \nenrolling full time in TRICARE, getting the family health insurance \ncoverage that is offered to active-duty military personnel. The change \nwould offer health care stability to families who lose coverage under \ntheir employers' plans when a family member is called to active duty. \nIn fact, one of the most shocking statistics was that about 25 percent \nof our active-duty Guard and Reserve had some medical problems, but the \nnumbers were particularly high for the Guard and Reserve because so \nmany of these--primarily but not exclusively--young people either had \njobs which didn't offer health insurance or worked for themselves and \ncould not afford health insurance. So when they were activated and \nreported, they were not medically ready to be deployed. This is not \nsimply the right thing to do; this is part of our military readiness \nnecessity.\n\n  The legislation addresses these critical issues. I am very grateful \nfor Senator Graham's leadership and the support of so many in this \nbody. He and I will be working with Chairman Warner and Ranking Member \nLevin and the rest of the Armed Services Committee to get our TRICARE \nlegislation authorized in this year's Department of Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  Finally, I know there are questions of cost that obviously have to be \naddressed. I don't think you can put a price on the military service \nthese men and women have given our country. When I was in Iraq a couple \nof weeks ago, I was struck by how many men I saw with white hair. I \nthink I was surprised there were so many people in their fifties, late \nfifties, who had been called back to active duty, members of the \nIndividual Readiness Reserve. The men I spoke with had flown combat \nmissions in Vietnam. There they were again, having left their families, \nleft their employment, their homes, and doing their duty in Baghdad or \nFallujah or Kirkuk and so many other places of danger.\n  We have an all-volunteer military. That all-volunteer military has to \nbe given not only the respect it so deserves but the support and the \nresources it has earned.\n  I am hopeful we will have unanimous support in the Armed Services \nCommittee to add this legislation, that we will have support from the \nadministration and, in an overwhelming vote in both Houses of Congress, \nnot give lipservice and rhetorical pats on the back to our Guard and \nReserve members but show them in a tangible way that we appreciate and \nrespect their service and we understand the strains they are living \nunder and often their families are suffering under. One small way to \nshow our appreciation as a nation is to make sure once and for all they \nand their families have access to health care.\n  It is a great pleasure to be working with Senator Graham, and I look \nforward to successfully ensuring that this legislation is once and for \nall enacted, first in the Armed Services Committee and then on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I will take up where my colleague left \noff. Before she leaves the floor, I acknowledge what a pleasure it has \nbeen to work with her and other members of the Democratic Party and the \nRepublican Party to do something for our Guard and Reserve Forces. She \nhas outlined very well what we are trying to do. It shows what can \nhappen when the body will come together on an issue that should never \ndivide us. Whether you are Republican or Democrat or independent, this \nwar affects us all. No one asked the young men and women fighting the \nwar their party identification or affiliation or their political \nbackground when they went off to serve our Nation.\n  The least we can do as a body is stand behind them and their families \nto provide a benefit they need.\n  We had a hearing yesterday, to build upon what Senator Clinton said. \nWe had the chief of the Army, Air Force, Marine Corps, Reserve \ncomponents, and the Naval Reserve, and we talked about the stress on \nthe force in terms of the Reserve community. We have 175,000 people \ntoday who have experienced duty in this war from the Guard and Reserve. \nForty percent of the people in Iraq and Afghanistan are guardsmen and \nreservists. We could not fight without them.\n  This is the biggest utilization of the Guard and Reserve since World \nWar II. The skill set they bring to the fight is indispensable. There \nare civil affairs people helping Afghan and Iraqi officials set up a \ndemocracy. We have medical personnel and many others who are \nindispensable. The military police are predominantly guardsmen and \nreservists, and they are indispensable in Iraq and Afghanistan. They \nhave done a terrific job.\n  The reason we are involved in this legislation and we have so much \nbipartisan support for what we are trying to do is the Guard and \nReserve is the only group of part-time Federal employees--and as a \nguardsman or reservist, you work for the Federal Government. You also \nwork for the State government, but you have a dual status. Reservists \nare part of the Federal military, the DOD. They are the only group in \nthe whole Federal Government that is not eligible for some form of \nhealth care from the Federal Government.\n  A temporary employee in your office or my office, somebody working in \na temporary capacity, is able to sign up for Federal health care \nbenefits that we enjoy. They have to pay a premium. A part-time worker \nis able to sign up for Federal health care benefits. The only group \nthat works part time and doesn't get any benefits is the Guard and \nReserve. The one thing we found from the hearing is that is a mistake. \nAt least 10 percent of the people being called to active duty from the \nGuard and Reserve are unable to be deployed because of health care \nproblems. About 30 percent of the people in the Guard and Reserve have \nno private health care insurance. So from a ratings point of view, \nabout 10 percent of the force is taken out of the fight without a shot \nbeing fired. That makes no readiness sense. The health care network for \nthe Guard and Reserve today is not doing the job in terms of making the \nforce fit and ready to serve.\n  When a person is deployed from the Guard and Reserve, they leave \nbehind a family more times than not. Half of the people going into the \nfight from the Guard and Reserve suffer a pay reduction, having no \ncontinuity of health care or predictability of what the benefits will \nbe in a continuous fashion.\n\n[[Page S3630]]\n\nHow long you will be gone and when you are coming home matters in terms \nof recruiting and retention. Sixty-eight percent of the Army Reserve's \ngoal is being met in recruiting. The Guard and Active Forces are \nsuffering in recruiting because this war has taken a toll. The more \nattractive the benefit package is, the more we can appreciate the \nservice, the more likely we are to get the good people and recruit \npatriotic Americans.\n  What this legislation is designed to do is fill in that gap and solve \nthe problem that faces the Guard and Reserve families, and that is lack \nof health care. Every Reserve component chief says that when they talk \nto the troops, the one thing that means the most to them, on top of \nevery other request, is continuity of health care. So we are proposing \na benefit for the Guard and Reserve that they will have to pay for, but \nwe will allow, for the first time, Guard and Reserve members to sign up \nfor TRICARE, the military health care system, like their Active-Duty \ncounterparts have, with one major difference: they will have to pay a \npremium, unless they are called to active duty, similar to what we pay \nas Federal employees.\n  I believe that is a fair compromise. It will allow uninsured \nguardsmen and reservists to have health care at an affordable price. It \nwill allow people who have uneven health care in the private sector to \nget constant health care. We will have a system where people, when they \nare called to active duty, will have the same set of doctors and \nhospitals that service the family as when they are in the Guard and \nReserve status. We think it desperately will help recruiting and \nretention and readiness, and it will make people ready for the fight.\n  We have worked on the costs. We are looking at cutting the cost of \nthe program in half by requiring a slightly higher premium from the \nforce and offering TRICARE standard versus TRICARE prime. I believe it \nfiscally makes sense but still achieves the goal of the original \nlegislation of providing continuity of health care.\n  The reason we are not offering the amendment on the supplemental is \nthat because of the cost saving we have achieved in redesigning the \nprogram, there is no cost to be incurred in 2005. We are working in a \nbipartisan manner with the chairman of the Armed Services Committee to \ngo ahead and offer a full-time military health care benefit \nto guardsmen and reservists that they can sign up for, to give them \ncontinuity of care at a fair premium. It is a good deal for all \nconcerned. The reason we are doing this is obvious: We are utilizing \nthe Guard and Reserve in a historic fashion. If we don't change the \nbenefit structure, we are going to drive the men and women away from \nwanting to serve. After a while, it gets to be too onerous. I hope we \nwill be able to produce a product in committee in the authorization \nbill that will allow this program to be offered to the entire force.\n\n  Here is what we did last year. I will end on this note. The body \nreached a compromise last year. Last year, we came up with a program \nthat for every person in the Guard and Reserve who was mobilized for 90 \ndays or more, from September 11, 2001, forward to today, for every 90 \ndays they served on active duty, they would get a year of TRICARE for \nthemselves and their families. That program goes into effect April 26 \nof this year, a few days from now. I have the brochure called TRICARE \nReserve Select. About a third of the force would be eligible. It will \ncover the Selective Reserve, drilling reservists. That is one change we \nmade.\n  I am still in the Reserves, but I am in an inactive status. I do my \nduty over at Bolling Air Force Base. I am not subject to deployment, so \nI will not be included. The bill we are designing covers people subject \nto being deployed and being sent to the site. The compromise of last \nyear will allow a year of TRICARE for every 90 days you are being \ncalled to active duty.\n  There are thousands of reservists who will be eligible for this \nprogram, and this brochure called TRICARE Reserve Select will be \navailable to your unit, and you need to inquire as to whether you and \nyour family would be eligible to join TRICARE because of your 90-day-\nplus deployment. The goal this year is to build upon what we did last \nyear by offering the program to the entire drilling force.\n  The other two-thirds of the Select Reserves who are subject to being \ndeployed, who drill and prepare for combat-related duties so that when \nthey get called, if they do, they will be ready to go to the fight, it \nwill be a benefit for their families that I think most Americans would \nbe glad to provide.\n  So we have a program in place for those who have been called to \nactive duty for 90 days or more since September 11, 2001. It goes into \neffect in a week. It will make you and your family eligible for TRICARE \na year for every 90 days you serve. So if you serve a year in Iraq, you \nget 4 years. The goal this year is expanded to total drilling Selected \nReserve force. We cut the program in half by increasing the benefit \npayment required of the Guard and Reserve member and reshaping the \nbenefit package. I think it is more affordable than ever, but the cost \nof having 10 percent of the force unable to go to the fight is \nfinancially and militarily very large. The cost of lack of continuity \nof health care for Guard and Reserve families is emotionally \ndevastating.\n  With about two-tenths of 1 percent of the military budget, we can fix \nthis problem and reward Americans who are doing a great job for their \ncountry. The likelihood of the Guard and Reserve being involved in a \ndeep and serious way in the war on terror is probably unlimited.\n  The last fact I will leave with you is this: We talked to the Reserve \ncommander yesterday about the utilization of the Air Reserves. Fifty \npercent of the people flying airplanes in terms of transport into the \ntheater of operation and servicing the theater of operation with a C-\n130 are Reserve or Guard crews. I have been to Iraq 3 times now, and I \nhave flown about 16 or 17 flights on a C-130 from Kuwait into Iraq and \nAfghanistan. Every crew except one has been a Reserve or Guard crew.\n  There is a rule in the military that a Guard or Reserve member cannot \nbe deployed involuntarily for more than 24 months. That rule has served \nthe force well because it takes stress off the force, it keeps people \ngainfully employed because if you are gone all the time, it is hard to \nkeep a civilian job. So we put a cap of 24 months of involuntary \nservice into the theater of operations, into the war zone.\n  What astonished me was that two-thirds of the pilots and the aircrews \nin the Guard and Reserve have already reached that mark. Two-thirds of \nthose who serve in the Guard and Reserve have already met their 2-year \ninvoluntary commitment.\n  One fact that keeps this war afloat is that they are volunteering to \ngo back. Legally we cannot make them go back, but they are volunteering \nto keep flying. And God bless them because two-thirds of 50 percent \nstatutorily do not have to go to this fight. They choose to go to this \nfight. This benefit package is a recognition of that commitment.\n  I am very optimistic--to all those Guard and Reserve families who may \nbe listening today--that help is on the way, that this body is going to \nrise to the occasion, and we are going to improve your health care \nbenefits because you earned it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 430\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in every year since 1951, Congress has \nincluded a provision in the General Government Appropriations Act which \nstates the following:\n\n       No part of any appropriation contained in this or in any \n     other act shall be used for publicity or propaganda purposes \n     within the United States not heretofore authorized by \n     Congress.\n\n  I am quoting from section 624 of Public Law 108-447.\n  This is the law of the land, and yet despite the law, the Congress \nand the American people continue to hear about propaganda efforts by \nexecutive branch agencies. On more than one occasion, this \nadministration has provided tax dollars to well-known conservative talk \nshow hosts to promote its agenda. One was paid a hefty fee to promote \nthe No Child Left Behind Act. Another talk show host was paid to \npromote the administration's welfare and family policies.\n  If those examples are not bad enough, in an effort to blur the line \nbetween\n\n[[Page S3631]]\n\nindependent media and administration propaganda, some agencies have \nproduced prepackaged news stories designed to be indistinguishable from \nnews stories produced by free market news outlets.\n  According to the Government Accountability Office, the GAO, which is \nan arm of the Congress, in an opinion dated February 17, 2005, the \nadministration has violated the prohibition on publicity and \npropaganda. In a memorandum sent to executive branch agencies, the GAO \nstated:\n\n       During the past year, we found that several prepackaged \n     news stories produced and distributed by certain Government \n     agencies violated this provision.\n\n  So very simply, according to the GAO, the administration broke the \nlaw. The GAO specifically cited the Office of National Drug Control \nPolicy and the Department of Health and Human Services for violating \nthe antipropaganda law. But these are not the only agencies pretending \nto be a credible news outlet.\n\n  On March 13, 2005, the New York Times wrote about the \nadministration's approach in an article entitled ``Under Bush a New Age \nof Prepackaged TV News.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire article be printed in the \nRecord following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BYRD. The Times article spotlighted three new segments that each \nlooked the same as any other 90-second segment on the local news. But \nthese are not new. The Federal Government produced all three of these. \nThe Times told of a news segment produced by the State Department \nfeaturing a jubilant Iraqi American telling a news crew in Kansas City: \n``Thank you, Bush. Thank you, USA.''\n  The Department of Homeland Security apparently produced a so-called \nnews report on the creation of the Transportation Security \nAdministration. The reporter called the establishment of TSA ``one of \nthe most remarkable campaigns in aviation history.'' But what the \nAmerican people, the viewers, did not know was that the so-called \nreporter was actually a public relations professional working under a \nfalse name for the Transportation Security Administration. How about \nthat?\n  A third segment broadcast in January was based on a news report \nproduced by the Department of Agriculture. The Agriculture Department \napparently employs two full-time people to act--listen now--to act as \nreporters. They travel the country and create their own so-called news, \ndistributing their work via satellite and mail, always pushing the \nWhite House line.\n  What are things coming to?\n  In the January report, these U.S. Department of Agriculture \nemployees, claiming to be independent journalists, called President \nBush ``the best envoy in the world.''\n  I am not here to argue whether George W. Bush is America's best envoy \nto the world, but I would rather leave that discussion to independent \nanalysts, not to administration employees or on-the-payroll journalists \npushing the White House line.\n  Yes, the administration should explain its ideas and positions to the \nAmerican people. No one argues that fact. Educating the public about \nissues affecting their lives is an essential role of the Government. \nBut the administration should not engage in a blatant manipulation of \nthe news media. Leave the work of manipulation to the Rush Limbaughs of \nthe world. Keep the job of Government focused on the people. \nManufacturing propaganda is a blatant misuse of taxpayer dollars, and \nit is your money, your money, Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer.\n  The administration has disputed GAO's views. The administration takes \nthe view that it is OK to mask the source as long as the ads are \n``purely informational.''\n  The White House Office of Management and Budget, with the support of \nthe Justice Department, went so far as to issue a memorandum to agency \nheads dated March 11, 2005, specifically contradicting the conclusions \nof the Government Accountability Office. The Justice Department \nconcluded that the Government Accountability Office's:\n\n        . . . conclusion fails to recognize the distinction \n     between covert propaganda and purely informational Video News \n     Reports, which do not constitute propaganda within the common \n     meaning of the term and therefore are not subject to the \n     appropriations restriction.\n\n  If paying national columnists and talk show hosts, faking news \nsegments, hiring actors to pretend to be reporters ``do not constitute \npropaganda,'' what does? What does constitute propaganda? It is time \nfor the administration to back off.\n  We, the American people, trust the media to provide us with \nindependent sources of information, not biased news stories produced by \nthe administration at the taxpayers' expense. It is time for the White \nHouse to be upfront with the American people: no propaganda, no \nmanipulation of the press. The administration should tell the people \nits position on issues, yes, but should do so honorably and without \nsuch deliberate manipulation of the free press. Propaganda efforts such \nas these are not the stuff for a Republic such as ours. The American \npeople must be able to rely on the independence of the news media. The \nconstitutionally guaranteed freedom of the press is not for sale. The \ncountry must know that reporters--real reporters--are presenting facts \nhonestly, presenting facts fairly, presenting facts without bias. \nDemocracy should not be built on deception.\n  Just yesterday, the Federal Communications Commission, on a unanimous \nvote--on a unanimous vote of 4 to 0--approved a public notice that \ndirects--that directs, hear me--that directs television broadcasters to \ndisclose to viewers the origin of video news releases produced by the \nGovernment or corporations when the material runs on the public \nairwaves. The Commission acknowledged the critical role that broadcast \nlicensees and cable operators play in providing information to the \naudiences they serve. This information is an important component of a \nwell-functioning democracy. Along with this role comes a \nresponsibility, the responsibility that licensees and operators make \nthe sponsorship announcements required by the foregoing rule and obtain \nthe information from all pertinent individuals necessary for them to do \nso. The public notice goes on to stress that the Commission may impose \nsanctions, including fines, including imprisonment, for failure to \ncomply with the ruling. You better watch out. So the FCC, by a \nunanimous vote, I say, made clear, crystal clear, as clear as the \nnoonday Sun in a cloudless sky, what their rules are. They made clear \nto the broadcasters what their rules are.\n  Now Congress should make clear what the rules are for Federal \nagencies. Just yesterday, the Federal Communications Commission, on a \nunanimous vote, 4 to 0, approved this public notice, I am saying it \nagain, that directs television broadcasters to disclose to viewers the \norigin of video news releases produced by the Government or \ncorporations--I will say this a third time--when the material runs on \nthe public airwaves.\n  So this is a warning. We, in the Congress, ought to do our best in \nsupport of the ruling and to enforce it.\n  Let me say now that my amendment prevents any agency from using \ntaxpayer dollars to produce or distribute prepackaged news stories \nintended to be viewed, intended to be heard, intended to be read, which \ndo not clearly identify the so-called news was created by a Federal \nagency or funded with taxpayer dollars. That is plain common sense.\n  I urge Senators to back the law that we, Congress, have passed each \nyear since 1951:\n\n       No part of any appropriation contained in this or any other \n     Act shall be used for publicity or propaganda purposes within \n     the United States not heretofore authorized by Congress.\n\n  Back it up. My amendment simply makes it clear, I say again, that \nCongress does mean what Congress says. I urge adoption of the \namendment. I will yield the floor, but I want to send my amendment to \nthe desk.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 13, 2005]\n\n              Under Bush, a New Age of Prepackaged TV News\n\n                   (By David Barstow and Robin Stein)\n\n       It is the kind of TV news coverage every president covets.\n       ``Thank you, Bush. Thank you, U.S.A.,'' a jubilant Iraqi-\n     American told a camera crew\n\n[[Page S3632]]\n\n     in Kansas City for a segment about reaction to the fall of \n     Baghdad. A second report told of ``another success'' in the \n     Bush administration's ``drive to strengthen aviation \n     security''; the reporter called it ``one of the most \n     remarkable campaigns in aviation history.'' A third segment, \n     broadcast in January, described the administration's \n     determination to open markets for American farmers.\n       To a viewer, each report looked like any other 90-second \n     segment on the local news. In fact, the federal government \n     produced all three. The report from Kansas City was made by \n     the State Department. The ``reporter'' covering airport \n     safety was actually a public relations professional working \n     under a false name for the Transportation Security \n     Administration. The farming segment was done by the \n     Agriculture Department's office of communications.\n       Under the Bush administration, the federal government has \n     aggressively used a well-established tool of public \n     relations: the prepackaged, ready-to-serve news report that \n     major corporations have long distributed to TV stations to \n     pitch everything from headache remedies to auto insurance. In \n     all, at least 20 federal agencies, including the Defense \n     Department and the Census Bureau, have made and distributed \n     hundreds of television news segments in the past four years, \n     records and interviews show. Many were subsequently broadcast \n     on local stations across the country without any \n     acknowledgement of the government's role in their production.\n       This winter, Washington has been roiled by revelations that \n     a handful of columnists wrote in support of administration \n     policies without disclosing they had accepted payments from \n     the government. But the administration's efforts to generate \n     positive news coverage have been considerably more pervasive \n     than previously known. At the same time, records and \n     interviews suggest widespread complicity or negligence by \n     television stations, given industry ethics standards that \n     discourage the broadcast of prepackaged news segments from \n     any outside group without revealing the source.\n       Federal agencies are forthright with broadcasters about the \n     origin of the news segments they distribute. The reports \n     themselves, though, are designed to fit seamlessly into the \n     typical local news broadcast. In most cases, the \n     ``reporters'' are careful not to state in the segment that \n     they work for the government. Their reports generally avoid \n     overt ideological appeals. Instead, the government's news-\n     making apparatus has produced a quiet drumbeat of broadcasts \n     describing a vigilant and compassionate administration.\n       Some reports were produced to support the administration's \n     most cherished policy objectives, like regime change in Iraq \n     or Medicare reform. Others focused on less prominent matters, \n     like the administration's efforts to offer free after-school \n     tutoring, its campaign to curb childhood obesity, \n     its initiatives to preserve forests and wetlands, its \n     plans to fight computer viruses, even its attempts to \n     fight holiday drunken driving. They often feature \n     ``interviews'' with senior administration officials in \n     which questions are scripted and answers rehearsed. \n     Critics, though, are excluded, as are any hints of \n     mismanagement, waste or controversy.\n       Some of the segments were broadcast in some of nation's \n     largest television markets, including New York, Los Angeles, \n     Chicago, Dallas and Atlanta.\n       An examination of government-produced news reports offers a \n     look inside a world where the traditional lines between \n     public relations and journalism have become tangled, where \n     local anchors introduce prepackaged segments with \n     ``suggested'' lead-ins written by public relations experts. \n     It is a world where government-produced reports disappear \n     into a maze of satellite transmissions, Web portals, \n     syndicated news programs and network feeds, only to emerge \n     cleansed on the other side as ``independent'' journalism.\n       It is also a world where all participants benefit.\n       Local affiliates are spared the expense of digging up \n     original material. Public relations firms secure government \n     contracts worth millions of dollars. The major networks, \n     which help distribute the releases, collect fees from the \n     government agencies that produce segments and the affiliates \n     that show them. The administration, meanwhile, gets out an \n     unfiltered message, delivered in the guise of traditional \n     reporting.\n       The practice, which also occurred in the Clinton \n     administration, is continuing despite President Bush's recent \n     call for a clearer demarcation between journalism and \n     government publicity efforts. ``There needs to be a nice \n     independent relationship between the White House and the \n     press,'' Mr. Bush told reporters in January, explaining why \n     his administration would no longer pay pundits to support his \n     policies.\n       In interviews, though, press officers for several federal \n     agencies said the president's prohibition did not apply to \n     government-made television news segments, also known as video \n     news releases. They described the segments as factual, \n     politically neutral and useful to viewers. They insisted that \n     there was no similarity to the case of Armstrong Williams, a \n     conservative columnist who promoted the administration's \n     chief education initiative, the No Child Left Behind Act, \n     without disclosing $240,000 in payments from the Education \n     Department.\n       What is more, these officials argued, it is the \n     responsibility of television news directors to inform viewers \n     that a segment about the government was in fact written by \n     the government. ``Talk to the television stations that ran it \n     without attribution,'' said William A. Pierce, spokesman for \n     the Department of Health and Human Services. ``This is not \n     our problem. We can't be held responsible for their \n     actions.''\n       Yet in three separate opinions in the past year, the \n     Government Accountability Office, an investigative arm of \n     Congress that studies the federal government and its \n     expenditures, has held that government made news segments may \n     constitute improper ``covert propaganda'' even if their \n     origin is made clear to the television stations. The point, \n     the office said, is whether viewers know the origin. Last \n     month, in its most recent finding, the G.A.O. said federal \n     agencies may not produce prepackaged news reports ``that \n     conceal or do not clearly identify for the television viewing \n     audience that the agency was the source of those materials.''\n       It is not certain, though, whether the office's \n     pronouncements will have much practical effect. Although a \n     few federal agencies have stopped making television news \n     segments, others continue. And on Friday, the Justice \n     Department and the Office of Management and Budget \n     circulated a memorandum instructing all executive branch \n     agencies to ignore the G.A.O. findings. The memorandum \n     said the G.A.O. failed to distinguish between covert \n     propaganda and ``purely informational'' news segments made \n     by the government. Such informational segments are legal, \n     the memorandum said, whether or not an agency's role in \n     producing them is disclosed to viewers.\n       Even if agencies do disclose their role, those efforts can \n     easily be undone in a broadcaster's editing room. Some news \n     organizations, for example, simply identify the government's \n     ``reporter'' as one of their own and then edit out any phrase \n     suggesting the segment was not of their making.\n       So in a recent segment produced by the Agriculture \n     Department, the agency's narrator ended the report by saying \n     ``In Princess Anne, Maryland, I'm Pat O'Leary reporting for \n     the U.S. Department of Agriculture.'' Yet AgDay, a syndicated \n     farm news program that is shown on some 160 stations, simply \n     introduced the segment as being by ``AgDay's Pat O'Leary.'' \n     The final sentence was then trimmed to ``In Princess Anne, \n     Maryland, I'm Pat O'Leary reporting.''\n       Brian Conrady, executive producer of AgDay, defended the \n     changes. ``We can clip `Department of Agriculture' at our \n     choosing,'' he said. ``The material we get from the U.S.D.A., \n     if we choose to air it and how we choose to air it is our \n     choice.''\n\n\n      Spreading the Word: Government Efforts and One Woman's Role\n\n       Karen Ryan cringes at the phrase ``covert propaganda.'' \n     These are words for dictators and spies, and yet they have \n     attached themselves to her like a pair of handcuffs.\n       Not long ago, Ms. Ryan was a much sought-after ``reporter'' \n     for news segments produced by the federal government. A \n     journalist at ABC and PBS who became a public relations \n     consultant, Ms. Ryan worked on about a dozen reports for \n     seven federal agencies in 2003 and early 2004. Her segments \n     for the Department of Health and Human Services and the \n     Office of National Drug Control Policy were a subject of the \n     accountability office's recent inquiries.\n       The G.A.O. concluded that the two agencies ``designed and \n     executed'' their segments ``to be indistinguishable from news \n     stories produced by private sector television news \n     organizations.'' A significant part of that execution, the \n     office found, was Ms. Ryan's expert narration, including her \n     typical sign-off--``In Washington, I'm Karen Ryan \n     reporting''--delivered in a tone and cadence familiar to \n     television reporters everywhere.\n       Last March, when The New York Times first described her \n     role in a segment about new prescription drug benefits for \n     Medicare patients, reaction was harsh. In Cleveland, The \n     Plain Dealer ran an editorial under the headline ``Karen \n     Ryan, You're a Phony,'' and she was the object of late-night \n     jokes by Jon Stewart and received hate mail.\n       ``I'm like the Marlboro man,'' she said in a recent \n     interview.\n       In fact, Ms. Ryan was a bit player who made less than \n     $5,000 for her work on government reports. She was also \n     playing an accepted role in a lucrative art form, the video \n     news release. ``I just don't feel I did anything wrong,'' she \n     said. ``I just did what everyone else in the industry was \n     doing.''\n       It is a sizable industry. One of its largest players, \n     Medialink Worldwide Inc., has about 200 employees, with \n     offices in New York and London. It produces and \n     distributes about 1,000 video news releases a year, most \n     commissioned by major corporations. The Public Relations \n     Society of America even gives an award, the Bronze Anvil, \n     for the year's best video news release.\n       Several major television networks play crucial intermediary \n     roles in the business. Fox, for example, has an arrangement \n     with Medialink to distribute video news releases to 130 \n     affiliates through its video feed service, Fox News Edge. CNN \n     distributes releases to 750 stations in the United States and \n     Canada through a similar feed service, CNN Newsource. \n     Associated Press Television News does the same thing \n     worldwide with its Global Video Wire.\n       ``We look at them and determine whether we want them to be \n     on the feed,'' David M. Winstrom, director of Fox News Edge, \n     said of video news releases. ``If got one that said tobacco \n     cures cancer or something like that, I would kill it.''\n\n[[Page S3633]]\n\n       In essence, video news releases seek to exploit a growing \n     vulnerability of television news: Even as news staffs at the \n     major networks are shrinking, many local stations are \n     expanding their hours of news coverage without adding \n     reporters.\n       ``No TV news organization has the resources in labor, time \n     or funds to cover every worthy story,'' one video news \n     release company, TVA Productions, said in a sales pitch to \n     potential clients, adding that ``90 percent of TV newsrooms \n     now rely on video news releases.''\n       Federal agencies have been commissioning video news \n     releases since at least the first Clinton administration. An \n     increasing number of state agencies are producing television \n     news reports, too; the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department \n     alone has produced some 500 video news releases since 1993.\n       Under the Bush administration, federal agencies appear to \n     be producing more releases, and on a broader array of topics.\n       A definitive accounting is nearly impossible. There is no \n     comprehensive archive of local television news reports, as \n     there is in print journalism, so there is no easy way to \n     determine what has been broadcast, and when and where.\n       Still, several large agencies, including the Defense \n     Department, the State Department and the Department of Health \n     and Human Services, acknowledge expanded efforts to produce \n     news segments. Many members of Mr. Bush's first-term cabinet \n     appeared in such segments.\n       A recent study by Congressional Democrats offers another \n     rough indicator: the Bush administration spent $254 million \n     in its first term on public relations contracts, nearly \n     double what the last Clinton administration spent.\n       Karen Ryan was part of this push--a ``paid shill for the \n     Bush administration,'' as she self-mockingly puts it. It is, \n     she acknowledges, an uncomfortable title.\n       Ms. Ryan, 48, describes herself as not especially \n     political, and certainly no Bush die-hard. She had hoped for \n     a long career in journalism. But over time, she said, she \n     grew dismayed by what she saw as the decline of television \n     news--too many cut corners, too many ratings stunts.\n       In the end, she said, the jump to video news releases from \n     journalism was not as far as one might expect. ``It's almost \n     the same thing,'' she said.\n       There are differences, though. When she went to interview \n     Tommy G. Thompson, then the health and human services \n     secretary, about the new Medicare drug benefit, it was not \n     the usual reporter-source exchange. First, she said, he \n     already knew the questions, and she was there mostly to help \n     him give better, snappier answers. And second, she said, \n     everyone involved is aware of a segment's potential political \n     benefits.\n       Her Medicare report, for example, was distributed in \n     January 2004, not long before Mr. Bush hit the campaign trail \n     and cited the drug benefit as one of his major \n     accomplishments.\n       The script suggested that local anchors lead into the \n     report with this line: ``In December, President Bush signed \n     into law the first-ever prescription drug benefit for people \n     with Medicare.'' In the segment, Mr. Bush is shown signing \n     the legislation as Ms. Ryan describes the new benefits and \n     reports that ``all people with Medicare will be able to get \n     coverage that will lower their prescription drug spending.''\n       The segment made no mention of the many critics who decry \n     the law as an expensive gift to the pharmaceutical industry. \n     The G.A.O. found that the segment was ``not strictly \n     factual,'' that it contained ``notable omissions'' and that \n     it amounted to ``a favorable report'' about a controversial \n     program.\n       And yet this news segment, like several others narrated by \n     Ms. Ryan, reached an audience of millions. According to the \n     accountability office, at least 40 stations ran some part of \n     the Medicare report. Video news releases distributed by the \n     Office of National Drug Control Policy, including one \n     narrated by Ms. Ryan, were shown on 300 stations and reached \n     22 million households. According to Video Monitoring Services \n     of America, a company that tracks news programs in major \n     cities, Ms. Ryan's segments on behalf of the government were \n     broadcast a total of at least 64 times in the 40 largest \n     television markets.\n       Even these measures, though, do not fully capture the reach \n     of her work. Consider the case of News 10 Now, a cable \n     station in Syracuse owned by Time Warner. In February 2004, \n     days after the government distributed its Medicare segment, \n     News 10 Now broadcast a virtually identical report, including \n     the suggested anchor lead-in. The News 10 Now segment, \n     however, was not narrated by Ms. Ryan. Instead, the station \n     edited out the original narration and had one of its \n     reporters repeat the script almost word for word.\n       The station's news director, Sean McNamara, wrote in an e-\n     mail message, ``Our policy on provided video is to clearly \n     identify the source of that video.'' In the case of the \n     Medicare report, he said, the station believed it was \n     produced and distributed by a major network and did not know \n     that it had originally come from the government.\n       Ms. Ryan said she was surprised by the number of stations \n     willing to run her government segments without any editing or \n     acknowledgement of origin. As proud as she says she is of her \n     work, she did not hesitate, even for a second, when asked if \n     she would have broadcast one of her government reports if she \n     were a local news director.\n       ``Absolutely not.''\n\n\n      Little Oversight: TV's Code of Ethics, With Uncertain Weight\n\n       ``Clearly disclose the origin of information and label all \n     material provided by outsiders.''\n       Those words are from the code of ethics of the Radio-\n     Television News Directors Association, the main professional \n     society for broadcast news directors in the United States. \n     Some stations go further, all but forbidding the use of any \n     outside material, especially entire reports. And spurred \n     by embarrassing publicity last year about Karen Ryan, the \n     news directors association is close to proposing a \n     stricter rule, said its executive director, Barbara \n     Cochran.\n       Whether a stricter ethics code will have much effect is \n     unclear; it is not hard to find broadcasters who are not \n     adhering to the existing code, and the association has no \n     enforcement powers.\n       The Federal Communications Commission does, but it has \n     never disciplined a station for showing government-made news \n     segments without disclosing their origin, a spokesman said.\n       Could it? Several lawyers experienced with F.C.C. rules say \n     yes. They point to a 2000 decision by the agency, which \n     stated, ``Listeners and viewers are entitled to know by whom \n     they are being persuaded.''\n       In interviews, more than a dozen station news directors \n     endorsed this view without hesitation. Several expressed \n     disdain for the prepackaged segments they received daily from \n     government agencies, corporations and special interest groups \n     who wanted to use their airtime and credibility to sell or \n     influence.\n       But when told that their stations showed government-made \n     reports without attribution, most reacted with indignation. \n     Their stations, they insisted, would never allow their news \n     programs to be co-opted by segments fed from any outside \n     party, let alone the government.\n       ``They're inherently one-sided, and they don't offer the \n     possibility for follow-up questions--or any questions at \n     all,'' said Kathy Lehmann Francis, until recently the news \n     director at WDRB, the Fox affiliate in Louisville, Ky.\n       Yet records from Video Monitoring Services of America \n     indicate that WDRB has broadcast at least seven Karen Ryan \n     segments, including one for the government, without \n     disclosing their origin to viewers.\n       Mike Stutz, news director at KGTV, the ABC affiliate in San \n     Diego, was equally opposed to putting government news \n     segments on the air.\n       ``It amounts to propaganda, doesn't it?'' he said.\n       Again, though, records from Video Monitoring Services of \n     America show that from 2001 to 2004 KGTV ran at least one \n     government-made segment featuring Ms. Ryan, 5 others \n     featuring her work on behalf of corporations, and 19 produced \n     by corporations and other outside organizations. It does not \n     appear that KGTV viewers were told the origin of these 25 \n     segments.\n       ``I thought we were pretty solid,'' Mr. Stutz said, adding \n     that they intend to take more precautions.\n       Confronted with such evidence, most news directors were at \n     a loss to explain how the segments made it on the air. Some \n     said they were unable to find archive tapes that would help \n     answer the qustion. Others promised to look into it, then \n     stopped returning telephone messages. A few removed the \n     segments from their Web sites, promised greater vigilance in \n     the future or pleaded ignorance.\n\n\n     Afghanistan to Memphis: An Agency's Report Ends Up on the Air\n\n       On Sept. 11, 2002, WHBQ, the Fox affiliate in Memphis, \n     marked the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks with an uplifting \n     report on how assistance from the United States was \n     helping to liberate the women of Afghanistan.\n       Tish Clark, a reporter for WHBQ, described how Afghan \n     women, once barred from schools and jobs, were at last \n     emerging from their burkas, taking up jobs as seamstresses \n     and bakers, sending daughters off to new schools, receiving \n     decent medical care for the first time and even participating \n     in a fledgling democracy. Her segment included an interview \n     with an Afghan teacher who recounted how the Taliban only \n     allowed boys to attend school. An Afghan doctor described how \n     the Taliban refused to let male physicians treat women.\n       In short, Ms. Clark's report seemed to corroborate, however \n     modestly, a central argument of the Bush foreign policy, that \n     forceful American intervention abroad was spreading freedom, \n     improving lives and winning friends.\n       What the people of Memphis were not told, though, was that \n     the interviews used by WHBQ were actually conducted by State \n     Department contractors. The contractors also selected the \n     quotes used from those interviews and shot the video that \n     went with the narration. They also wrote the narration, much \n     of which Ms. Clark repeated with only minor changes.\n       As it happens, the viewers of WHBQ were not the only ones \n     in the dark.\n       Ms. Clark, now Tish Clark Dunning, said in an interview \n     that she, too, had no idea the report originated at the State \n     Department. ``If that's true, I'm very shocked that anyone \n     would false report on anything like that,'' she said.\n       How a television reporter in Memphis unwittingly came to \n     narrate a segment by the\n\n[[Page S3634]]\n\n     State Department reveals much about the extent to which \n     government-produced news accounts have seeped into the \n     broader news media landscape.\n       The explanation begins inside the White House, where the \n     president's communications advisers devised a strategy after \n     Sept. 11, 2001, to encourage supportive news coverage of the \n     fight against terrorism. The idea, they explained to \n     reporters at the time, was to counter charges of American \n     imperialism by generating accounts that emphasized American \n     efforts to liberate and rebuild Afghanistan and Iraq.\n       An important instrument of this strategy was the Office of \n     Broadcasting Services, a State Department unit of 30 or so \n     editors and technicians whose typical duties include \n     distributing video from news conferences. But in early 2002, \n     with close editorial direction from the White House, the unit \n     began producing narrated feature reports, many of them \n     promoting American achievements in Afghanistan and Iraq and \n     reinforcing the administration's rationales for the \n     invasions. These reports were then widely distributed in the \n     United States and around the world for use by local \n     television stations. In all, the State Department has \n     produced 59 such segments.\n       United States law contains provisions intended to prevent \n     the domestic dissemination of government propaganda. The 1948 \n     Smith-Mundt Act, for example, allows Voice of America to \n     broadcast progovernment news to foreign audiences, but not at \n     home. Yet State Department officials said that law does not \n     apply to the Office of Broadcasting Services. In any event, \n     said Richard A. Boucher, a State Department spokesman: ``Our \n     goal is to put out facts and the truth. We're not a \n     propaganda agency.''\n       Even so, as a senior department official, Patricia \n     Harrison, told Congress last year, the Bush administration \n     has come to regard such ``good news'' segments as ``powerful \n     strategic tools'' for influencing public opinion. And a \n     review of the department's segments reveals a body of work \n     in sync with the political objectives set forth by the \n     White House communications team after 9/11.\n       In June 2003, for example, the unit produced a segment that \n     depicted American efforts to distribute food and water to the \n     people of southern Iraq. ``After living for decades in fear, \n     they are now receiving assistance--and building trust--with \n     their coalition liberators,'' the unidentified narrator \n     concluded.\n       Several segments focused on the liberation of Afghan women, \n     which a White House memo from January 2003 singled out as a \n     ``prime example'' of how ``White House-led efforts could \n     facilitate strategic, proactive communications in the war on \n     terror.''\n       Tracking precisely how a ``good news'' report on \n     Afghanistan could have migrated to Memphis from the State \n     Department is far from easy. The State Department typically \n     distributes its segments via satellite to international news \n     organizations like Reuters and Associated Press Television \n     News, which in turn distribute them to the major United \n     States networks, which then transmit them to local \n     affiliates.\n       ``Once these products leave our hands, we have no \n     control,'' Robert A. Tappan, the State Department's deputy \n     assistant secretary for public affairs, said in an interview. \n     The department, he said, never intended its segments to be \n     shown unedited and without attribution by local news \n     programs. ``We do our utmost to identify them as State \n     Department-produced products.''\n       Representatives for the networks insist that government-\n     produced reports are clearly labeled when they are \n     distributed to affiliates. Yet with segments bouncing from \n     satellite to satellite, passing from one news organization to \n     another, it is easy to see the potential for confusion. \n     Indeed, in response to questions from The Times, Associated \n     Press Television News acknowledged that they might have \n     distributed at least one segment about Afghanistan to the \n     major United States networks without identifying it as the \n     product of the State Department. A spokesman said it could \n     have ``slipped through our net because of a sourcing error.''\n       Kenneth W. Jobe, vice president for news at WHBQ in \n     Memphis, said he could not explain how his station came to \n     broadcast the State Department's segment on Afghan women. \n     ``It's the same piece, there's no mistaking it,'' he said in \n     an interview, insisting that it would not happen again.\n       Mr. Jobe, who was not with WHBQ in 2002, said the station's \n     script for the segment has no notes explaining its origin. \n     But Tish Clark Dunning said it was her impression at the time \n     that the Afghan segment was her station's version of one done \n     first by network correspondents at either Fox News or CNN. It \n     is not unusual, she said, for a local station to take network \n     reports and then give them a hometown look.\n       ``I didn't actually go to Afghanistan,'' she said. ``I took \n     that story and reworked it. I had to do some research on my \n     own. I remember looking on the Internet and finding out how \n     it all started as far as women covering their faces and \n     everything.''\n       At the State Department, Mr. Tappan said the broadcasting \n     office is moving away from producing narrated feature \n     segments. Instead, the department is increasingly supplying \n     only the ingredients for reports--sound bites and raw video. \n     Since the shift, he said, even more State Department material \n     is making its way into news broadcasts.\n\n\n     meeting a need: rising budget pressures, ready-to-run segments\n\n       WCIA is a small station with a big job in central Illinois.\n       Each weekday, WCIA's news department produces a three-hour \n     morning program, a noon broadcast and three evening programs. \n     There are plans to add a 9 p.m. broadcast. The staff, though, \n     has been cut to 37 from 39. ``We are doing more with the \n     same,'' said Jim P. Gee, the news director.\n       Farming is crucial in Mr. Gee's market, yet with so many \n     demands, he said, ``It is hard for us to justify having a \n     reporter just focusing on agriculture.''\n       To fill the gap, WCIA turned to the Agriculture Department, \n     which has assembled one of the most effective public \n     relations operations inside the federal government. The \n     department has a Broadcast Media and Technology Center with \n     an annual budget of $3.2 million that each year produces some \n     90 ``mission messages'' for local stations--mostly feature \n     segments about the good works of the Agriculture Department.\n       ``I don't want to use the word `filler,' per se, but they \n     meet a need we have,'' Mr. Gee said.\n       The Agriculture Department's two full-time reporters, Bob \n     Ellison and Pat O'Leary, travel the country filing reports, \n     which are vetted by the department's office of communications \n     before they are distributed via satellite and mail. Alisa \n     Harrison, who oversees the communications office, said Mr. \n     Ellison and Mr. O'Leary provide unbiased, balanced and \n     accurate coverage.\n       ``They cover the secretary just like any other reporter,'' \n     she said.\n       Invariably, though, their segments offer critic-free \n     accounts of the department's policies and programs. In one \n     report, Mr. Ellison told of the agency's efforts to help \n     Florida clean up after several hurricanes.\n       ``They've done a fantastic job,'' a grateful local official \n     said in the segment.\n       More recently, Mr. Ellison reported that Mike Johanns, the \n     new agriculture secretary, and the White House were \n     determined to reopen Japan to American beef products. Of his \n     new boss, Mr. Ellison reported, ``He called Bush the best \n     envoy in the world.''\n       WCIA, based in Champaign, has run 26 segments made by the \n     Agriculture Department over the past three months alone. Or \n     put another way, WCIA has run 26 reports that did not cost it \n     anything to produce.\n       Mr. Gee, the news director, readily acknowledges that these \n     accounts are not exactly independent, tough-minded \n     journalism. But, he added: ``We don't think they're \n     propaganda. They meet our journalistic standards. They're \n     informative. They're balanced.''\n       More than a year ago, WCIA asked the Agriculture Department \n     to record a special sign-off that implies the segments are \n     the work of WCIA reporters. So, for example, instead of \n     closing his report with ``I'm Bob Ellison, reporting for the \n     U.S.D.A.,'' Mr. Ellison says, ``With the U.S.D.A., I'm Bob \n     Ellison, reporting for `The Morning Show.' ''\n       Mr. Gee said the customized sign-off helped raise \n     ``awareness of the name of our station.'' Could it give \n     viewers the idea that Mr. Ellison is reporting on location \n     with the U.S.D.A. for WCIA? ``We think viewers can make up \n     their own minds,'' Mr. Gee said.\n       Ms. Harrison, the Agriculture Department press secretary, \n     said the WCIA sign-off was an exception. The general policy, \n     she said, is to make clear in each segment that the reporter \n     works for the department. In any event, she added, she did \n     not think there was much potential for viewer confusion. \n     ``It's pretty clear to me,'' she said.\n\n\n   the `good news' people: a menu of reports from military hot spots\n\n       The Defense Department is working hard to produce and \n     distribute its own news segments for television audiences in \n     the United States.\n       The Pentagon Channel, available only inside the Defense \n     Department last year, is now being offered to every cable and \n     satellite operator in the United States. Army public affairs \n     specialists, equipped with portable satellite transmitters, \n     are roaming war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, beaming news \n     reports, raw video and interviews to TV stations in the \n     United States. All a local news director has to do is log on \n     to a military-financed Web site, www.dvidshub.net., browse a \n     menu of segments and request a free satellite feed.\n       Then there is the Army and Air Force Hometown News Service, \n     a unit of 40 reporters and producers set up to send local \n     stations news segments highlighting the accomplishments of \n     military members.\n       ``We're the `good news' people,'' said Larry W. Gilliam, \n     the unit's deputy director.\n       Each year, the unit films thousands of soldiers sending \n     holiday greetings to their hometowns. Increasingly, the unit \n     also produces news reports that reach large audiences. The 50 \n     stories it filed last year were broadcast 236 times in all, \n     reaching 41 million households in the United States.\n       The news service makes it easy for local stations to run \n     its segments unedited. Reporters, for example, are never \n     identified by their military titles. ``We know if we put a \n     rank on there they're not going to put it on their air,'' Mr. \n     Gilliam said.\n       Each account is also specially tailored for local \n     broadcast. A segment sent to a station in Topeka, Kan., would \n     include an interview with a service member from there. If the \n     same report is sent to Oklahoma City, the soldier is switched \n     out for one from Oklahoma City. ``We try to make the \n     individual soldier a star in their hometown,'' Mr. Gilliam \n     said, adding that segments were distributed only to towns and \n     cities selected by the service members interviewed.\n\n[[Page S3635]]\n\n       Few stations acknowledge the military's role in the \n     segments. ``Just tune in and you'll see a minute-and-a-half \n     news piece and it looks just like they went out and did the \n     story,'' Mr. Gilliam said. The unit, though, makes no attempt \n     to advance any particular political or policy agenda, he \n     said.\n       ``We don't editorialize at all,'' he said.\n       Yet sometimes the ``good news'' approach carries political \n     meaning, intended or not. Such was the case after the Abu \n     Ghraib prison scandal surfaced last spring. Although White \n     House officials depicted the abuse of Iraqi detainees as the \n     work of a few rogue soldiers, the case raised serious \n     questions about the training of military police officers.\n       A short while later, Mr. Gilliam's unit distributed a news \n     segment, sent to 34 stations, that examined the training of \n     prison guards at Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri, where some of \n     the military police officers implicated at Abu Ghraib had \n     been trained.\n       ``One of the most important lessons they learn is to treat \n     prisoners strictly but fairly,'' the reporter said in the \n     segment, which depicted a regimen emphasizing respect for \n     detainees. A trainer told the reporter that military police \n     officers were taught to ``treat others as they would want to \n     be treated.'' The account made no mention of Abu Ghraib or \n     how the scandal had prompted changes in training at Fort \n     Leonard Wood.\n       According to Mr. Gilliam, the report was unrelated to any \n     effort by the Defense Department to rebut suggestions of a \n     broad command failure.\n       ``Are you saying that the Pentagon called down and said, \n     `We need some good publicity?' '' he asked. ``No, not at \n     all.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nlaid aside. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd] for himself, Mrs. \n     Clinton, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Dorgan, \n     Mr. Harkin, and Mr. Kennedy, proposes an amendment numbered \n     430.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  Mr. BYRD. I have no objection to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds by any Federal agency to produce \n   a prepackaged news story without including in such story a clear \nnotification for the audience that the story was prepared or funded by \n                           a Federal agency)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. None of the funds provided in this Act or any \n     other Act may be used by a Federal agency to produce any \n     prepackaged news story unless the story includes a clear \n     notification to the audience that the story was prepared or \n     funded by that Federal agency.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I applaud the Senator from West Virginia \nfor his amendment. We have to put a stop to all of the taxpayer-\nfinanced propaganda put out by our government to influence the American \npeople.\n  Over the last year, we have found out that the Bush administration \nhas used taxpayer funds to finance ``fake news reports'' by actors \nposing as reporters, not actual journalists, who read the \nadministration's script on prescription drugs and the No Child Left \nBehind education program. Even more recently, we have found out that a \nnumber of actual real-life journalists have been secretly paid by the \nBush administration to promote its political agenda. This is dangerous \nto our democracy. It's an unethical misuse of taxpayer funds.\n  Senator Lautenberg and I have generated a series of investigations by \nthe Government Accountability Office critical of the Bush \nadministration's propaganda efforts. We have introduced legislation, \nthe Stop Government Propaganda Act, that the Byrd amendment \ncomplements. Our legislation, like the Byrd amendment, specifically \nprevents the administration--any administration, Democratic or \nRepublican--from paying actors to pose as legitimate journalists in \norder to push for a political agenda.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Byrd amendment. Congress cannot \nsit still while the administration corrupts the first amendment and \nfreedom of the press.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I am intrigued by the amendment of the \nSenator from West Virginia. I do not believe taxpayers should be \nfunding propaganda. I think it is totally inappropriate, other than in \nan attempt to promote American policy overseas, for example, where we \nshould be funding communication with other people around the Earth, as \nwe do through Radio Free America, Radio Liberty, and other radio \nstations that have been developed over the years for the purposes of \npresenting the American position in regions of the world where our \naccess is limited.\n  But here in the United States, clearly, if the Government wishes to \nmake a point, that should be disclosed. If taxpayers' dollars are being \nused to make a point, that should be disclosed. I agree with the basic \nconcept of the theme of the Senator's amendment. So I expect that this \namendment must apply to National Public Radio. National Public Radio, \nof course, receives a large amount of tax subsidy. It presents views \nwhich one could argue are propaganda, in many instances. If I read this \namendment correctly, I believe, and I would hope the record would \nreflect, this amendment will apply to National Public Radio so that \nwhen they put out a newscast it will have to be announced that this \nnewscast is put out at the expense of the American taxpayer and that \nthe American taxpayer has paid for this report.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I see my colleague from Maryland is also \nseeking the floor. We both have important meetings at 3 o'clock. I \nwondered how long the Senator from Maryland will take?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Less than a minute.\n  Mr. BOND. I am happy to yield to my colleague from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask for the regular order with respect \nto my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That amendment is now pending.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close the debate on the Mikulski \n     amendment No. 387 to H.R. 1268.\n         B.A. Mikulski, J. Lieberman, J. Corzine, Jeff Bingaman, \n           Byron Dorgan, Ron Wyden, Ken Salazar, Hillary Clinton, \n           Mark Pryor, Dick Durbin, Bill Nelson, Chuck Schumer, \n           Barack Obama, Frank Lautenberg, Patrick Leahy, Debbie \n           Stabenow, Chris Dodd.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I understand that negotiations are \nongoing on all of the immigration provisions. I am sorry I have to do \nthis, and I will be very glad to withdraw this cloture motion if we are \nable to come to an understanding.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 430\n\n  I now ask unanimous consent that the Senate resume consideration of \nthe Byrd amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments raised by the \nSenator from New Hampshire.\n  As chairman of the new Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, \nTreasury, Judiciary, and HUD, I understand this measure would fall \nwithin the general government provisions of this bill. While I think \nall of us share concerns that have been expressed by the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia, I urge my colleagues to oppose this \namendment. We appreciate what the Senator is trying to do, but I don't \nbelieve his amendment provides the appropriate remedy to the problems \nhe has described.\n  Using Federal funds for the purpose of propaganda is already unlawful \nunder section 1913 of title 18 of the United States Code, and the \ngovernmentwide general provisions title of the Transportation, Treasury \nAppropriations Act includes further restrictions from using \nappropriated funds for propaganda.\n  Section 624 of the 2005 Transportation, Treasury Appropriations Act \nstates:\n\n       No part of any appropriations contained in this or any \n     other Act shall be used for publicity or propaganda purposes \n     within the United States not heretofore authorized by the \n     Congress.\n\n  The distinction between educating the public about an issue and \nadvocating a policy is not always obvious.\n\n[[Page S3636]]\n\nIf the Senator's amendment better defined appropriate communications by \nFederal agencies from publicity or propaganda, I would join with the \nSenator in support. The Senator's amendment, however, does not add any \nclarity to the murky waters of advocacy and does not make the line \nbetween education and advocacy any brighter, and in fact may have some \nuntoward consequences that I feel are sufficient to kill the amendment.\n\n  The uniform practice of the Federal Government is and has been to \nprovide full disclosure that video news releases or other matters are \nprepared or funded by a Federal agency. The sponsoring Government \nagency identifies itself at the beginning of a video news release.\n  Just as newspaper reporters and editors parse through their press \nreleases issued by Federal agencies, television news rooms make \neditorial and content decisions about how to use video news releases. \nIt is, in fact, an editorial decision of the broadcast station to air \nor not to air the agency identification.\n  The Senator's amendment, however, would begin the practice of \nallowing the Federal Government to make editorial decisions and \ndictating broadcast content of news reports.\n  Alternatively, it would require that any use of material supplied by \nthe Federal Government must be disclosed in a manner that I believe \nwould have a chilling impact on the freedom of speech and on the \nfreedom of press. Such mandate on the broadcast media may in fact be \nunconstitutional.\n  If this amendment were adopted, it may have the unintended \nconsequence of reducing the use of this important tool, thereby \nundermining the ability of the Federal Government to meet its \nobligation to inform the public of important information.\n  I believe the impact would be felt in rural areas, especially as \nbroadcasters in small and medium markets rely on video news releases \nmore than their big-city colleagues.\n  If we go back and look at the history, we see that video news \nreleases have been used by Government agencies since the beginning of \nvideo. The USDA produced some of the first footage of the Wright \nbrothers' early flight tests in the early 1919s, as well as the highly \nacclaimed Dust Bowl documentary, ``The Plow That Broke the Plains,'' \n1935.\n  In the 1980s, to respond to a changing broadcast environment, USDA \nestablished a weekly satellite feed of material for news and farm \nbroadcasters. This included ready-to-air feature stories, sometimes \ncalled video news releases. The information includes where there are \nsignups for commodity or disaster programs; promoting producer \nparticipation in county committee elections; new farming practices or \ntechnologies; or important crop reports and surveys.\n  From the Department of Health and Human Services, there has been a \nlong list of video news releases such as the Surgeon General's \nOsteoporosis and Bone Health Report; educating the public health \nofficials on how to recognize anthrax; CDC in post 9/11, educating the \npublic on CDC's capabilities; healthy baby news releases, which I have \nbeen very interested in. The Health Resource Services Administration \nput out a video news release educating parents and parents-to-be on the \nhealth care of their newborns.\n  There have been efforts to educate women of childbearing age about \nthe absolute necessity of including 400 micrograms of the appropriate \nvitamins in their diets to prevent tooth defects.\n  The CDC has educated public and health communities about the proper \nuse of antibiotics and the potential problems of overuse of \nantibiotics.\n\n  The IRS has produced VNRs on two topics: how to file electronically, \nand the earned income tax credit. The goal was to generate coverage of \nthe e-filing to help Americans understand qualifications for claiming \nthe EITC.\n  These news releases were produced by an advertising agency, and \npitched in the media outlets by our IRS media specialists who provided \nfull disclosure to the media outlets if they were from the IRS.\n  This amendment goes further, however, and says the entity using this \ninformation must include a clear notice that it was prepared or funded \nby a Federal agency. That is a requirement on not only broadcasters but \non newspapers, which I think steps over the line.\n  As the distinguished Senator from West Virginia pointed out, the FCC \nyesterday unanimously clarified the rules applying to broadcasters, \nsaying they must disclose to the viewer the origin of video news \nreleases, though the agency does not specify what form that disclosure \nmust take.\n  Commissioner Adelstein, a Democrat, said:\n\n       We have a responsibility to tell broadcasters that they \n     have to let people know where the material is coming from. \n     Viewers would think it was a real news story when it might be \n     from government or a big corporation trying to influence how \n     they think. This would be put them in a better position to \n     decide for themselves what to make of it.\n\n  The FCC has already acted in this area.\n  I am very much concerned that the amendment proposed by the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia would go even further in \nattempting to dictate by congressional action what should be reported, \nnot only in video or electronic news stories but in print media stories \nas well. That is objectionable. That would cause many problems for \nmedia of all types.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I rise in support of the Byrd amendment. This amendment \nis important. It is offered at an important time, and it is offered \nduring a period when we have seen so many examples of fake news, or \npropaganda, to use another word.\n  I don't think this is partisan. I think it would apply to a \nRepublican or Democratic administration.\n  The question is, Should the Federal Government be involved in \npropaganda? Should we be observant of fake news and do nothing about \nit?\n  The Senator from West Virginia offers an amendment that is filled \nwith common sense. Let me describe a fake news program. A report \nnarrated by a woman who speaks in glowing terms about an \nadministration's plan and concludes by saying: ``In Washington, this is \nKaren Ryan reporting.''\n  The Department of Health and Human Services spent $44,000 in taxpayer \ndollars on this type of propaganda. Is this what we want to pass for \nnews?\n  I have talked often in the Senate on a subject very important to me, \nthe concentration of broadcasting in this country. Fewer and fewer \npeople owning more and more broadcast properties, controlling what \npeople see, hear, and think by what is presented to them. As more and \nmore companies are bought, they hollow out the newsrooms, get rid of \nthe newsroom staff, and just have a shell left. Then they are \ninterested in filling that shell with cheap media feeds.\n  If you read the discussion about what has prompted these television \nstations to run these prepackaged fake news items, they are looking for \nfillers for a news script because they got rid of their news people. So \nthis, now, passes as news when, in fact, it is fake news.\n  In my judgment, it ought to be labeled exactly what it is. That is \nwhat the Senator is offering with respect to this amendment. This is \nnot an amendment that is in any way radical. It is an amendment that is \nfilled with common sense.\n  A few minutes ago my colleague who talked about Public Broadcasting \nor National Public Radio was clever and funny--and good for him--but \nthis has nothing to do with the issue at hand. Winning debates that we \nare not having is hardly a blue ribbon activity in this Chamber. This \ndebate is not about National Public Radio or anything of the sort. It \nis about the specific subject that my colleague from West Virginia \nbrings to the Senate.\n  The subject, incidentally, has more tentacles attached to it. We \nlearned in January a syndicated columnist, Armstrong Williams, had been \npaid a quarter of a million dollars, actually $240,000, to promote the \nNo Child Left Behind Program on his television show and to urge other \nAfrican-American journalists to do the same. That contract was not \ndisclosed to the public. It was taxpayers' dollars offered to a \njournalist, commentator, television personality, and we only learned \nabout it because USA Today obtained the\n\n[[Page S3637]]\n\ndocument through a Freedom of Information request.\n  That, incidentally, was part of a $1 million deal with the Ketchum \npublic relations firm which was contracted to produce video news \nreleases designed to appear like real news reports.\n  So there is more to do on this issue than just the Byrd amendment. \nThat is why I say this amendment is modest in itself. It is not, as \nsome would suggest, a big deal. It is a modest amendment that addresses \na problem in a very specific way. We really do have more to do dealing \nwith some of the other tentacles--the hiring of public relations firms \nto the tune of tens of millions of dollars.\n  We found out in late January the Department of Health and Human \nServices paid $21,500 to another syndicated columnist to advocate a \n$300 million Presidential proposal encouraging marriage. That contract \nwas not disclosed either.\n  The list goes on. Fake news. We discovered a while back the White \nHouse had allowed a fake journalist, using a fake name, to get a daily \nclearance to come into the Presidential news conference and daily news \nbriefings and to ask questions. Another part of fake news, I guess, a \ndifferent tentacle and a different description.\n\n  The Byrd amendment is simple on its face. The question is, Do we want \nfake news being produced with taxpayers' dollars with no disclosure at \nall; that it is, in fact, propaganda, not news?\n  I support the Byrd amendment. I hope we will address other parts of \nthis issue at some future time. This amendment is modest enough, and my \nhope is to engage a majority of the Senate to be supportive of it.\n  While I have the floor, I might indicate a second time that I intend \nto offer an amendment that would cease or discontinue funding for the \nindependent counsel who is still active, an independent counsel who was \nimpaneled to investigate the payment of money to a mistress by a former \nCabinet official, Mr. Cisneros. That independent counsel has spent now \n$21 million over 10 years. The particular Cabinet official admitted the \nindiscretion. He pled guilty in Federal court and he since left office \nand has since been pardoned by a President in 2001. Yet the independent \ncounsel investigating this is still investigating it, still spending \nmoney.\n  The most recent report showed this independent counsel spent $1.26 \nmillion in Federal funds over the previous 6 months, which brings it to \n$21 million by an independent counsel's office that was launched nearly \n10 years ago to investigate a Cabinet official who left the Government \nvery soon thereafter, who then pled guilty, who then was pardoned. In \n1995, the independent counsel was named. That was 10 years ago. In \n1999, the Cabinet official pled guilty. In 2001, 4 years ago, the \nCabinet official was given a Presidential pardon. Yet we have an \nindependent counsel's office that is still spending money.\n  We ought to shut off that money. I will offer an amendment to do \nthat, telling that independent counsel the money dries up on June 1. \nFinish your report and leave town--at least if your home is elsewhere--\nbut finish up the report and get off the public payroll after 10 years, \n4 years after the subject in question received a Presidential pardon, 6 \nyears after the subject in question pled guilty in court.\n  Some things need addressing on an urgent basis. This one does. I \nunderstand it, too, will not be, perhaps, germane to this bill, but it \nis one that I hope every Senator would understand we ought to shut \ndown.\n  With that, I appreciate the amendment offered by Senator Byrd. I am \npleased to come over in support of that amendment this afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the very distinguished Senator for his support and \nfor his statement. It is a very pertinent statement. In the FCC Public \nNotice 05-84, dated April 13, 2005, on page 2, it says:\n\n       This Public Notice is confined to the disclosure \n     obligations required under Section 317 and our rules \n     thereunder, and does not address the recent controversy over \n     when or whether the government is permitted to sponsor VNRs, \n     which is an issue beyond the Commission's jurisdiction.\n\n  My amendment is simple and clear. Here is what it says:\n\n       None of the funds provided in this Act or any other Act may \n     be used by a Federal agency to produce any prepackaged news \n     story unless the story includes a clear notification to the \n     audience that the story was prepared or funded by that \n     Federal agency.\n\n  Mr. President, it does not create confusion, as a Senator said a \nmoment ago. It creates clarity.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I notice that the distinguished Senator \nfrom New Jersey is on the floor. He is a cosponsor of this amendment. I \nassume he is here to talk on the amendment. I was going to try to bring \nthe discussion to a close so we could vote on the amendment or vote in \nrelation to the amendment, but I am happy to withhold because I do not \nwant to cut off anyone who wants to talk on this subject.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am not sure I heard precisely what \nthe manager was asking. I would help bring this to a close by giving my \nremarks very quickly. I appreciate the opportunity and thank the \nSenator from Mississippi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I salute my colleague and friend, the \nSenator from West Virginia. Senator Byrd is someone I greatly respect \nand admire. I have now been here a long time, even though, according to \nthe rules, I am a freshman or just above a freshman, maybe a \nsophomore--I don't think so--but whenever Senator Robert C. Byrd \nspeaks, it is always worth listening. And I find more often than not it \nis very much worth following the idea that the Senator from West \nVirginia puts forward.\n  So I am pleased to support the Byrd amendment on propaganda. It is an \nissue that has disturbed me over time and something I have worked on. \nThe Byrd amendment is an important step toward preventing the \nGovernment from delivering messages that are, if I can call them, kind \nof incognito. They are hidden from identifying as to what they really \nare. It is a step toward accomplishing a goal that is not clearly \ndefined as being presented as a neutral observer. So we want to stop \nthe spread of covert Government propaganda.\n\n  By the way, I want it to be understood that this is not brand new. \nThis is not something that has only happened since this administration \ntook over; it happened in years past.\n  I was asked the question at a hearing this morning: Well, then why \ndidn't we talk about it in years past? Because there has been a \nproliferation of these things. As a consequence, I think for all \nparties but particularly for the American people, it is a good idea to \nuse this opportunity to clear up the situation.\n  As a result of a request I made with Senator Kennedy, the Government \nAccountability Office ruled that fake television news stories, produced \nby the administration, or produced, period, were illegal propaganda. \nThe fake news accounts that were produced, known as ``prepackaged news \nstories,'' featured a report by Karen Ryan. The news story extolled the \nbenefits of the new Medicare law and ended with a statement:\n\n       This is Karen Ryan, reporting from Washington.\n\n  But Karen Ryan is not a reporter. She is a public relations \nconsultant working for a firm hired by the Government. So it is \ndesigned to fool people into believing that this news reporter had come \non to something really great and wanted to add her view of the efficacy \nof the program.\n  Now, that fake news story made its way onto local news shows on 40 \ntelevision stations across the country. Once again, people thought they \nwere watching news. Americans watched Karen Ryan's report and thought \nthey were hearing the real deal, but what they were watching was \nGovernment-produced propaganda.\n  Think about that for a second. Our Government is sending out news \nreports to television stations across the country by satellite. Many of \nthese news stations had no way of knowing that the reports were \nGovernment propaganda. News stations across the country have run \nGovernment news stories without realizing what they had. This is not \naimed at the broadcasters; it is aimed at clarifying the\n\n[[Page S3638]]\n\nfact that we do not think the Government should be doing this. The \nstations that had this story and did not realize it was not fresh news \nincluded a station in Memphis, TN, WHBQ; KGTV in San Diego; WDRB in \nLouisville, KY. The list goes on and on about producers who were fooled \nby the fact that they were getting a propaganda piece and did not \nrecognize that it was not news.\n  If the news stations did not know the story was produced by the \nGovernment, how would the viewer ever know that? How would a family, \nlet's say, in Covington, TN, watching WHBQ, know that Karen Ryan, the \nperson in this case, is not a reporter? How would they know the news \nstory they just watched was concocted to sell something, actually \nGovernment propaganda? The reality is, they would not know.\n  We had a situation of similar character with a reporter named \nArmstrong Williams. Mr. Williams had a program, a news program, and he \nwas paid a couple hundred thousand dollars, as I remember the number, \nto take this story and talk about it as news when, in fact, it was a \npaid-for story designed to deceive, very frankly. So we have seen it.\n  The GAO said that this practice is not only wrong but illegal. The \nGAO said the fake news stories were illegal because they did not \ndisclose the fact that the Government was behind it. GAO is right. We \ncannot allow covert propaganda to be done by our Government, continued \nby a practice that has been condemned by GAO.\n  The Byrd amendment will give Federal agencies clear direction on this \nissue. It is a simple proposition: The Government needs to disclose its \nrole. I do not think that is a lot to ask; otherwise, every ad that \ngoes on the air has a disclosure on it. It identifies the product, uses \na trademark, all kinds of things. But they make sure people know it is \nbeing done for a mission.\n  For whatever reason, the administration has refused to go along with \nthe GAO ruling. They have said so: Yes, we know it. But so what? The \nOffice of Management and Budget recently sent out a memo saying that \nagencies could continue to produce fake news stories and hide the \nGovernment's role.\n  That is their opinion, but I don't agree with it. Certainly, the Byrd \namendment challenges that view. We need to be straight with the \nAmerican people. When we are running ads, it has to say, ad run by the \nUnited States Government. We need to reject covert government \npropaganda. We can do it today with this amendment. The Byrd amendment \nwill make the rules on this matter crystal clear. I hope we can get the \nsupport to do this, to say to the American people, when you see a piece \nof news, don't let it be biased by Government ads that pay for it. Why \nwould the Government pay for it? Once again, when an ad is run, it is \nto sell someone a bill of goods. That doesn't mean it is a bad piece of \ngoods, but it is designed to sell something. We ought not let that be \nthe product of the United States Government when talking to the people \nacross the country.\n  I hope we will be able to pass this. I commend the Senator from West \nVirginia for offering it. I hope our colleagues will support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from New \nJersey for his comments and support. I thank him profusely.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak on the \npending Mikulski amendment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Reserving the right to object--I, of course, will not \nobject--it is my hope that we can continue to deal with the Byrd \namendment and dispose of the Byrd amendment. Then the Senator can talk \nabout the Mikulski amendment or any other amendment he wants to talk \nabout.\n  I do not have an objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 387\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to talk \nabout the amendment offered by the Senator from Maryland. As a \ncosponsor of that amendment, I rise in support of this amendment to the \nsupplemental appropriations bill.\n  The Save Our Small and Seasonal Business Act, on which this amendment \nis based, is very important to my State of Vermont. This amendment will \nensure the seasonal businesses in our country have the workers they \nneed to support their company, our local economics, and to help the \nU.S. economy flourish. Action on this critical issue is long overdue.\n  In March of last year, the United States Citizenship and Immigration \nServices announced they had received enough petitions to meet the cap \non the H-2B visas. As a result, they stopped accepting petitions for \nthese temporary work visas halfway through the Federal fiscal year. \nThis announcement was a shock to many businesses throughout the country \nthat depend on foreign workers to fill their temporary and seasonal \npositions.\n  Tourism is the largest sector of Vermont's economy and, as a result, \nmany Vermont businesses hire seasonal staff during their summer, \nwinter, or fall seasons. Last year, I heard from many Vermont \nbusinesses that were unable to employ foreign workers for their summer \nand fall seasons because the cap had been reached. Not only was this \nunexpected, but many of the individuals were people who had been \nreturning to the same employer year after year. These employers lost \nessential staff and, in many cases, well-trained, experienced \nemployees.\n  While I am proud to say that Vermont businesses have risen to this \nchallenge with hard work and creativity in the past, the need for these \nworkers has not, and will not, diminish. Congress must act and must act \nnow. The companies I have heard from are proud of the work their staffs \nhave done under these circumstances. Yet they believe their businesses \nand their personnel will suffer if they are not able to employ seasonal \nforeign workers again this year. Many foresee a devastating effect on \ntheir businesses if they are not able to bring in foreign workers soon.\n\n  I have also heard from Vermont businesses that they had to lay off or \nnot hire American workers because they could not find enough employees \nto round out their crews. Without having the sufficient number of \nworkers to complete projects, they could not hire or maintain their \nyear-round staff. They also could not bid on projects and many had to \nscale back their operations. In these instances, the lack of seasonal \nworkers had a detrimental effect on our economy and on the employment \nof American workers.\n  As many may know, I strongly believe American workers must be given \nthe opportunity to fill jobs and that this Nation's strength is in its \nown workforce. However, the companies that have contacted me did their \nutmost to find Americans for positions available. Efforts to find \nAmerican workers included working closely with the State of Vermont's \nEmployment and Training Office, increasing wages and benefits, and \nimplementing aggressive, year-round recruiting.\n  We are lucky in Vermont to count tourism among our chief industries, \nand we have our beautiful rural landscape to thank for the visitors who \nflock to our small State each year. While many Vermont businesses were \nable to survive last year, thanks to that old Yankee ingenuity, I am \nnot optimistic about this year. It is imperative we immediately address \nthis problem in order to prevent further harm to this Nation's small \nbusinesses and the economy.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment by Senator Mikulski.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 430\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Byrd-Lautenberg \namendment. I would like to say a few words. I know we may be moving \nclose to a vote, and the chairman of the committee has been patiently \nawaiting that possibility.\n  Tonight you are going to turn on your nightly news and try to get \nsome information. People do it all the time. You expect when you turn \non your television and turn on a newscast, the information being given \nto you is objective, at least as objective as people can make it. It \nisn't a paid advertisement; it is the news. If you are running a paid \nadvertisement, you would know it. It would have laundry detergent on it \nor some new pharmaceutical drug or a political ad with a disclaimer at \nthe bottom.\n\n[[Page S3639]]\n\n  When you turn on your newscast, you don't expect to get hit by an ad \nthat doesn't look like an ad. That is what the Byrd amendment is all \nabout. The General Accounting Office took a look at some of the ads \nthat were being sent out by the Bush administration for their policies \nand programs and said they went too far. They didn't identify the \nvideos they were sending to these television stations were actually \nproduced by the Bush administration, by these agencies, to promote a \nparticular point of view. They basically said these ads deceived the \nAmerican people. They were propaganda from the Government.\n  We decided a long time ago you couldn't do that. If you were going to \nput that kind of information up to try to convince the American people, \none way or the other, you have an obligation to tell them so. The basic \nrule in this country is people want to hear both sides of the story, \nthen make up their own minds. They want to know what is a fact and what \nis an opinion. Make up your own mind. You can't do it when there is a \ndeception involved.\n\n  It is that deception that Senator Byrd is addressing. The Byrd \namendment is so brief and to the point, it is worth repeating:\n\n       None of the funds provided in this Act or any other Act may \n     be used by a Federal agency to produce any prepackaged news \n     story unless the story includes a clear notification to the \n     audience that the story was prepared or funded by that \n     Federal agency.\n\n  That is pretty simple. Tell us who prepared it. If it was prepared at \ntaxpayer expense by the Senate, it should disclose that. If it was \nprepared by an agency of the Bush administration, disclose it. Then the \nAmerican people decide. They watch the show. They say: That is a pretty \ninteresting point of view. That happens to be what the official \nGovernment point of view is. I wonder what the other side of the story \nis.\n  You have a right to ask that question. But what if it wasn't \ndisclosed? What if what you thought was a news story turned out to be \nan ad, propaganda? That is a deception. It is a deception Senator Byrd \nis trying to end.\n  We sent the General Accounting Office out and we said: Take a look at \ntwo or three Government agencies in the Bush administration. See how \nthey are using these videotapes. According to the GAO, the Office of \nNational Drug Control Policy violated the publicity and propaganda \nprohibition in our law when it produced and distributed fake news \nstories called video news releases as part of its National Youth Anti-\nDrug Media Campaign. There is nothing wrong with fighting drugs.\n  We want to protect our children from that possibility. We want to end \nthe scourge of drug abuse in America. But be honest about it. If it is \na Government-produced program, then identify it. That is all Senators \nByrd and Lautenberg say in their amendment. In a separate report, the \nGAO found that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services violated \npublicity and propaganda prohibition by sending out more fake news \nstories about the benefits of the new prescription drug law for \nseniors. I was on the Senate floor when that was debated. There are \npros and cons--people who are against it and who are for it. There are \ntwo sides to the story. Here came the official Government press release \nsuggesting: Here are the facts for you, Mr. and Mrs. America. It turns \nout they didn't identify that that official news release came from an \nagency of the Bush administration.\n  They used phony reporters, phony news stories, and they told the \nviewers certain things they hoped they would believe. It turns out they \nwere deceiving the American people.\n  Remember the case of Armstrong Williams? Interesting fellow. He was \nhired by the Federal Department of Education to promote the new No \nChild Left Behind law on his nationally syndicated television show and \nurged other journalists to do the same. We paid him taxpayer dollars of \n$240,000 to go on his talk show and say nice things about the Bush \nadministration's No Child Left Behind law. Well, is that fair? Is that \nwhere you want to spend your tax dollars? Would it not have been worth \na few bucks to put the money into the classroom for children, instead \nof putting on contract this man who never disclosed his conflict of \ninterest and went about talking on his syndicated TV show as if he were \nan objective judge? He was so embarrassed by this that the Department \nstopped paying him and he issued something of an apology. The fact is, \nhe used our Federal taxpayer dollars as an incentive to promote a point \nof view and didn't tell the American people, deceiving them in the \nprocess.\n  The Social Security Administration has gone through the same thing \nwhen it comes to the President's privatization plan. They will be \nproducing these fake news stories and video press releases that mislead \npeople about the nature of the challenge of the problem.\n  I have an example. One of the things that went out in the Social \nSecurity Administration's phony news story was the following statement: \n``In 2041, the Social Security trust funds will be exhausted.'' That \nwas put out as an official Government statement--not identified but \nsent out. It turns out it is not true. In 2041, the Social Security \ntrust fund will not be exhausted. If we don't touch the Social Security \ntrust fund, it will make every single payment to every single retiree, \nevery single month of every single year until 2041. Then if we do \nnothing to change it after 36 years, it will continue to pay up to 75 \nto 80 percent. The trust fund is not going to be exhausted. That is a \nmisstatement put out by this administration without identifying the \nfact that they are trying to promote a point of view which, sadly, is \nnot correct and not honest.\n  So what Senator Byrd said is simple. If you want to put out something \nas a Federal Government agency, trust the American people. Tell them \nwho you are. Let them decide whether it is worth believing. Don't pull \nthe wool over their eyes. America is entitled to hear both sides of the \nstory. We are entitled to know what is fact, what is fiction, what is \nbasically news, and what is opinion. I think we can trust the American \npeople to make that judgment. If Members of the Senate cannot trust the \nAmerican people to make a judgment, how do they submit their own names \nfor election? That is what we do regularly in an election year. I trust \ntheir judgment. I trust Senator Byrd's amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the Senator from \nWest Virginia offering the amendment and bringing this issue to the \nattention of the Senate and making the suggestion that is included in \nthis amendment, which would ``prohibit the use of funds by any Federal \nagency to produce a prepackaged news story without including in such a \nstory notification for the audience that the story was prepared or \nfunded by a Federal agency.''\n  That is what the amendment says the purpose is, and that looks \ntotally OK to me--harmless, no reason we should not support it. Then if \nyou read down in the body of the amendment itself as to what it \nactually would provide in law, it says:\n\n       None of the funds provided in this act or any other act may \n     be used by a Federal agency to produce any prepackaged news \n     story, unless the story includes a clear notification to the \n     audience that the story was prepared or funded by that \n     Federal agency.\n\n  This creates a new obligation--not one that is enforced now by the \nFCC, not one that is embraced by Members of Congress or Senators when \nthey send news releases out to news organizations about their \nactivities or their views on a subject, it includes an obligation on \nanyone sending such a news story or statement or video release to \ncommunicate to the audience--the person looking at the television show \nor listening to the radio or reading the newspaper--that it is prepared \nby a Federal agency, or it uses funds to prepare it that are given to a \nFederal agency. It creates a new requirement, one that is almost \nimpossible to meet.\n  Think about it. When we send a news release to a newspaper back home, \nwe don't send it to all of the readers or subscribers of that \nnewspaper. We send it to the newspaper, the address, the name of the \nnewspaper in the town where it does business. So that is the defect in \nthe amendment. That is why Senator Bond, speaking as chairman of the \nsubcommittee that has jurisdiction over the funding and the laws under \nthe jurisdiction of the subcommittee that would be involved and \naffected by\n\n[[Page S3640]]\n\nthis, spoke against the amendment. That is why the Senate should not \nadopt the amendment.\n  We all agree you need to include a disclaimer. We have to do that and \nwe do that. Federal agencies do that. We cannot make the news editor or \nthe producer of the news show include the disclaimer in the broadcast \nthough. Nor should we be held responsible personally or criticized if \nthat news agency didn't disclaim or print or announce where they got \nthe news story. That is an entirely different obligation and one that \nthe FCC will enforce now and that we all support.\n  So what I am suggesting is that these are great speeches. This is a \ngood political issue--to accuse the administration of trying to fool \nthe American people by creating the impression that some of their news \nstories that are produced for the news media are produced by them and \nnot the radio station or the television station or the newspaper that \npublished it or broadcasted it. That is nothing new. But it is not up \nto the agency or the person who writes the story to communicate it to \nthe audience.\n  That is the problem. We cannot support it. So it would be my \nintention to move to table the amendment because of that--not because \nit is not motivated by the right reasons or doesn't carry with it the \nsentiment that is appropriate. Of course, it does. But the wording of \nthe amendment itself--not just the purpose of the amendment--is \ndefective in that it imposes an obligation that should not be imposed \non Federal agencies, the Government, or individual Members of Congress.\n  I am hopeful that--and I am sure the Senator from West Virginia will, \nif he can--the Senator will modify his amendment so it can be accepted. \nBut if that cannot be done, I am prepared to move to table the \namendment. I will not do that and cut off the right of any other person \nto talk about the subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator for his \nwillingness to not move to table at this point. I hope we can take a \nlittle time and see if we might reach a meeting of the minds on \nlanguage that might accomplish the purposes that we hoped to \naccomplish.\n  For that reason, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wonder if I might ask my colleague, the \nchairman of the committee, my understanding is the pending amendment is \nthe Byrd amendment. But I heard my colleague Senator Byrd indicate he \nwas trying to see whether there was some language that could be changed \nso this amendment would be acceptable. I have an amendment I had \npreviously announced I would like to offer. It is an amendment dealing \nwith the independent counsel expenditure of $21 million. I twice before \nmentioned this.\n  I ask the Senator from Mississippi whether it would be appropriate at \nthis point to offer an amendment. My understanding is we would have to \nset aside the Byrd amendment to do so. I ask the chairman and also \nSenator Byrd whether that is possible at this moment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I have no objection.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have no objection. We can reach an \nunderstanding if I am unable to come up with language that is capable \nof being a workable and effective compromise that we might go ahead and \nhave a vote on the Byrd amendment. Might we have a time limit on the \nSenator's proposal?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be mercifully brief. This is not an amendment that \nwill take a long time to explain, and I do not intend to delay the \nproceedings of the Senate at all.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 399\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, with that in mind and with the cooperation \nof the Senator from Mississippi, the chairman of the committee, and my \ncolleague Senator Byrd, as well, I offer an amendment on behalf of \nmyself and Senator Durbin has asked to be a cosponsor as well. I send \nthe amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], for himself and \n     Mr. Durbin, proposes an amendment numbered 399.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To prohibit the continuation of the independent counsel \n   investigation of Henry Cisneros past June 1, 2005 and request an \n                     accounting of costs from GAO)\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n       Sec. __. (a) None of the funds appropriated or made \n     available in this Act or any other Act may be used to fund \n     the independent counsel investigation of Henry Cisneros after \n     June 1, 2005.\n       (b) Not later than July 1, 2005, the Government \n     Accountability Office shall provide the Committee on \n     Appropriations of each House with a detailed accounting of \n     the costs associated with the independent counsel \n     investigation of Henry Cisneros.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this matter deals with something I was \nquite surprised to read about, frankly, in the newspaper, and I have \nsince done some research about it. It was a rather lengthy newspaper \narticle disclosing that an independent counsel who had been appointed \n10 years ago in 1995, a Mr. David Barrett, was still in business and \nwas involved in an investigation that has now cost the American \ntaxpayers $21 million.\n  That was an investigation dealing with a Cabinet Secretary who was \nalleged to have lied, I believe, to the FBI, to authorities, about a \npayment he gave to a mistress. So an independent counsel was impaneled \nand began investigating that charge.\n  That independent counsel has been working for some 10 years, in fact. \nBut the Cabinet officer who was the subject of the investigation pled \nguilty in 1999. That was 6 years ago. That Cabinet officer was also \nsubsequently pardoned in the year 2001.\n  In the most recent 6-month report, the independent counsel who was \nappointed for investigating this transgression is still in business, \nand had spent $1.26 million in just that period. And the costs are \ntrending upward, 10 years after he started, 6 years after the subject \npled guilty, and 4 years after the subject was pardoned. It is \nunbelievable.\n  I do not know anything about the case. I do not really know the \nCabinet official in question. I guess I met him some years ago. But \nthis is not about that official any longer. He has pled guilty, been \npardoned, and here we are years later with an independent counsel's \noffice still spending money.\n  I quote Judge Stanley Sporkin, the presiding judge over Mr. Cisneros' \ntrial:\n\n       The problem with this case is that it took too long to \n     develop and much too long to bring to judgment day . . . [the \n     matter] should have been resolved a long time ago, perhaps \n     even years ago.\n\n  That was a quote from 1999. It is now 2005. The independent counsel \nis still spending money.\n  David Barrett, the independent counsel, said in 1999:\n\n       We are just glad to have this over and done with. That was \n     following the plea agreement of Mr. Cisneros. Here it is 6 \n     years later and the independent counsel is still in business.\n\n  Mr. Barrett said in July 2001:\n\n       I want to conclude this investigation as soon as possible.\n\n  It is now 4 years later, with the counsel spending $1.26 million in \nthe last 6 months.\n  The three-judge panel that is providing oversight to the independent \ncounsel said:\n\n       Whether a cost-benefit analysis at this point would support \n     Mr. Barrett's effort is a question to which I have no answer.\n\n  Judge Cudahy, a member of the three-judge oversight panel said:\n\n       Mr. Barrett can go on forever. A great deal of time has \n     elapsed and a lot of money spent in pursuing charges that on \n     their face do not seem of overwhelming complexity.\n\n  Again, this is someone who is accused of lying to the FBI about \npaying money to a mistress. In the year 1995, the investigation began \nwith Mr. Barrett and the independent counsel. In\n\n[[Page S3641]]\n\n1999, the individual pled guilty. In the year 2001, the individual was \npardoned. And the independent counsel is still in business spending \nmoney. What on Earth is going on?\n  A former Federal prosecutor following the plea agreement, Lawrence \nBarcella, said this:\n\n       This is a classic example of why this independent counsel \n     statute was a problem. You give this person all the resources \n     to go after one person, and the first thing that is lost is \n     perspective.\n\n  Joseph DiGenova, a Republican lawyer and former independent counsel \nhimself, said in the April 1, 2005, Washington Post:\n\n       If this does not prove [the independent counsel's] \n     worthlessness as a governmental entity, I don't know what \n     does.\n\n  I do not come here as a partisan, a member of a political party. I \ncome here as someone outraged to wake up in the morning and read a \nreport about an independent counsel impaneled 10 years ago to \ninvestigate a subject who pled guilty 6 years ago and was pardoned 4 \nyears ago, and the independent counsel is still spending the taxpayers' \nmoney, $1.26 million over the last 6 months.\n  My amendment is painfully simple. I propose we stop the spending on \nJune 1 and tell this independent counsel: Finish your report, finish \nup, move on, and give the taxpayers a break.\n  That is what the amendment is. It is very simple. I hope it might be \nconsidered and supported by my colleagues.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 430, as Modified\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have a proposed modification to the \namendment which I have discussed with the distinguished manager of the \nbill, the chairman of the committee, Mr. Cochran.\n  I send the modification to the desk and ask that it be stated by the \nclerk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 430, as modified:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. Unless otherwise authorized by existing law, none \n     of the funds provided in this Act or any other Act may be \n     used by a Federal agency to produce any prepackaged news \n     story unless the story includes a clear notification within \n     the text or audio of the prepackaged news that the \n     prepackaged news story was prepared or funded by that Federal \n     agency.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification of the \namendment at this time?\n  Without objection, the amendment is so modified.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am prepared now to go to a vote, if the \ndistinguished chairman is also prepared. And I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, may I just be sure that we are clear on this \nlanguage.\n  I understand that the language as read by the clerk is agreed to on \nboth sides.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we have no objection to the modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment has been so modified. The \nquestion is on agreeing to the amendment, as modified. The yeas and \nnays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senator was necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Oklahoma (Mr. Inhofe).\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The Chair wishes to clarify for the record \nthat Senator Murray did not sign the cloture motion on amendment No. \n387, and Senator Leahy did sign that motion.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, what is the regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is amendment No. 399 by \nSenator Dorgan. There are other amendments which are, however, the \nregular order with respect to that amendment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. The Dorgan amendment is the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, for the information of Senators, I have been asked and \nothers have been asking the leadership about the intention of the \nSenate to proceed to votes on other amendments tonight. That is \ncertainly up to the Senate. We are here open for business. We have an \nemergency supplemental appropriations bill pending before the Senate, \nand we need to move with dispatch to complete action on this bill to \nget the money to the Departments of Defense and State for accounts that \nhave been depleted and that we need in the war on terror, that we need \nfor our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. So I hope we can proceed to \nfurther consideration of amendments that are pending. There are \namendments pending. I hope Senators can cooperate with the managers and \nthe leadership in moving this bill ahead.\n  I thank all Senators. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I ask that the quorum call be dispensed \nwith.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 390\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 390 and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendments? Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Obama], for himself, Mr. \n     Graham, Mr. Bingaman and Mr. Corzine, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 390.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide meal and telephone benefits for members of the \nArmed Forces who are recuperating from injuries incurred on active duty \n       in Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

Mr. President, today I am offering an amendment to the \nfiscal year 2005 emergency supplemental which I am pleased to announce \nis being cosponsored by Senators Corzine, Bingaman, and Graham. This \namendment would meet certain needs of our injured service members in \nrecognition of the tremendous sacrifice they have made in defense of \nour country.\n  The other day I had the opportunity to visit some of our wounded \nheroes at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. I know many of you have made \nthe same trip. I heard about their visits, but there is nothing that \ncan fully prepare you for what you see when you take that first step \ninto the physical therapy room.\n  These are kids in there, our kids, the ones we watched grow up, the \nones we hoped would live lives that were happy, healthy, and safe. \nThese kids left their homes and families for a dangerous place halfway \naround the world. After years of being protected by their parents, \nthese kids risk their lives to protect us. Now some of them have come \nhome from that war with scars that may change their lives forever, \nscars that may never heal. Yet they sit there in the hospital so full \nof hope and still so proud of their country. They are the best that \nAmerica has to offer, and they deserve our highest respect, and they \ndeserve our help.\n  Recently, I learned that some of our most severely wounded soldiers \nare being forced to pay for their own meals and their own phone calls \nwhile being treated in medical hospitals. Up until last year, there was \na law on the books that prohibited soldiers from receiving both their \nbasic subsistence allowance and free meals from the military. \nBasically, this law allowed the Government to charge our wounded heroes \nfor food while they were recovering from their war injuries. \nThankfully, this body acted to change this law in 2003 so that wounded \nsoldiers would not have to pay for their meals. But we are dealing with \na bureaucracy here and, as we know, nothing is ever simple in a \nbureaucracy. So now, because the Department of Defense does not \nconsider getting physical rehabilitation or therapy services in a \nmedical hospital as being hospitalized, there are wounded veterans who \nstill do not qualify for the free meals other veterans receive. After \n90 days, even those classified as hospitalized on an outpatient status \nlose their free meals as well.\n  Also, while our soldiers in the field qualify for free phone service, \ninjured service men and women who may be hospitalized hundreds or \nthousands of miles from home do not receive this same benefit. For \nsoldiers whose family members are not able to take off work and travel \nto a military hospital, hearing the familiar voice of mom or dad or \nhusband or wife on the other side of the phone can make all the \ndifference in the world. Yet right now our Government will not help pay \nfor these calls, and it will not help pay for these meals.\n  Now, think about the sacrifices these young people have made for \ntheir country, many of them literally sacrificing life and in some \ncases limb. Now, at $8.30 a meal, they could end up with a $250 bill \nfrom the Government that sent them to war, and they could get that bill \nevery single month. This is wrong, and we have a moral obligation to \nfix it. The amendment I am offering today will do this.\n  The amendment will expand the group of hospitalized soldiers who \ncannot be charged for their meals to include those service members \nundergoing medical recuperation, therapy, or otherwise on ``medical \nhold.'' The number of people affected by this amendment will be small. \nOnly about 4,000 service members are estimated to fall under the \ncategory of non-hospitalized. The amendment is retroactive to January \n1, 2005, in an effort to provide those injured service members who may \nhave already received bills for their meals with some relief from these \ncosts.\n  The amendment will also extend free phone service to those injured \nservice members who are hospitalized or otherwise undergoing medical \nrecuperation or therapy. I am very proud this amendment is supported by \nthe American Legion, and I hope my colleagues will join them in that \nsupport. I ask all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this \namendment. It should be something that is very simple for us to do. \nThese are our children and they risked their lives for us. When they \ncome home with injuries, we should be expected to provide them the best \npossible service and the best possible support. This is a small price \nto pay for those who have sacrificed so much for their country.\n  I want to mention and extend my thanks to the senior Senator from \nAlaska and my colleague from Mississippi for working with me on this \nissue. I am hoping that we can reach an agreement on this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for the explanation \nof his amendment. There is one thing, in looking at the amendment, that \nI am not sure of, and I am wondering if he could advise the Senate. \nDoes the Senator have an estimate from anyone at the Department of \nDefense or in the Hospital Services Agency of the Department of Defense \nas to what the costs of the amendment would be during the balance of \nthis fiscal year?\n  Mr. OBAMA. Yes, I do. DOD currently charges soldiers $8.30 per day \nfor meals at the nondiscounted rate. So if all the eligible soldiers \nate all of their meals at military facilities through the end of this \nfiscal year, the amendment would cost about $10.2 million. Now, that is \nprobably a high estimate because my expectation would be these wounded \nsoldiers would not be eating all of their meals at the hospital. So it \nwould probably end up being lower, but the upper threshold would be \n$10.2 million.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Senator. I think the Senator certainly hits \nupon a subject that we are very sensitive about at this time. We are \nfollowing very closely the situation of the servicemen who are \nparticipating in the war against terror in Iraq, Afghanistan, and \nelsewhere. We are proud of\n\n[[Page S3643]]\n\nthem. We are sorry that any of them have to be in the hospital or have \nto have access to services that are provided under the terms of this \namendment. I would be happy to take the suggestion that is embodied in \nthis amendment to the conference committee and try to work out an \nacceptable provision to be included in the final conference report and \nbring it back to the Senate.\n  So I recommend the Senate accept the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. OBAMA. I thank my colleague, the Senator from Mississippi, for \nthat offer, and I believe all of us feel the same way. These are the \nsoldiers that are most severely wounded. We want to take the very best \ncare of them, and I very much appreciate the consideration of the \nSenator from Mississippi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 390) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Senator and thank the Chair.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

(a) Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States Armed Forces have borne the largest \n     share of the burden for securing and stabilizing Iraq. Since \n     the war's start, more than 500,000 United States military \n     personnel have served in Iraq and, as of the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, more than 130,000 such personnel are \n     stationed in Iraq. Though the Department of Defense has kept \n     statistics related to international troop contributions \n     classified, it is estimated that all of the coalition \n     partners combined have maintained a total force level in Iraq \n     of only 25,000 troops since early 2003.\n       (2) United States taxpayers have borne the vast majority of \n     the financial costs of securing and reconstructing Iraq. \n     Prior to the date of the enactment of this Act, the United \n     States appropriated more than $175,000,000,000 for military \n     and reconstruction efforts in Iraq and, including the funds \n     appropriated in this Act, the amount appropriated for such \n     purposes increases to a total of more than $250,000,000,000.\n       (3) Of such total, Congress appropriated $2,475,000,000 in \n     the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2003 \n     (Public Law 108-11; 117 Stat. 559) (referred to in this \n     section as ``Public Law 108-11'') and $18,439,000,000 in the \n     Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense and for \n     the Reconstruction of Iraq and Afghanistan, 2004 (Public Law \n     108-106; 117 Stat. 1209) (referred to in this section as \n     ``Public Law 108-106'') under the heading ``Iraq relief and \n     reconstruction fund'' for humanitarian assistance and to \n     carry out reconstruction and rehabilitation in Iraq.\n       (4) The Sixth Quarterly Report required by section 2207 of \n     Public Law 108-106 (22 U.S.C. 2151 note), submitted by the \n     Secretary of State in April 2005, stated that $12,038,000,000 \n     of the $18,439,000,000 appropriated by Public Law 108-106 \n     under the heading ``Iraq relief and reconstruction fund'' had \n     been obligated and that only $4,209,000,000, less than 25 \n     percent of the total amount appropriated, had actually been \n     spent.\n       (5) According to such report, the international community \n     pledged more than $13,500,000,000 in foreign assistance to \n     Iraq in the form of grants, loans, credits, and other \n     assistance. While the report did not specify how much of the \n     assistance is intended to be provided as loans, it is \n     estimated that loans constitute as much as 80 percent of \n     contributions pledged by other nations. The report further \n     notes that, as of the date of the enactment of this Act, the \n     international community has contributed only $2,700,000,000 \n     out of the total pledged amount, falling far short of its \n     commitments.\n       (6) Iraq has the second largest endowment of oil in the \n     world and experts believe Iraq has the capacity to generate \n     $30,000,000,000 to $40,000,000,000 per year in revenues from \n     its oil industry. Prior to the launch of United States \n     operations in Iraq, members of the Administration stated that \n     profits from Iraq's oil industry would provide a substantial \n     portion of the funds needed for the reconstruction and relief \n     of Iraq and United Nations Security Council Resolution 1483 \n     (2003) permitted the coalition to use oil reserves to finance \n     long-term reconstruction projects in Iraq.\n       (7) Securing and rebuilding Iraq benefits the people of \n     Iraq, the United States, and the world and all nations should \n     do their fair share to achieve that outcome.\n       (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, not more \n     than 50 percent of the previously appropriated Iraqi \n     reconstruction funds that have not been obligated or expended \n     prior to the date of the enactment of this Act may be \n     obligated or expended, as the case may be, for Iraq \n     reconstruction programs unless--\n\n[[Page S3645]]\n\n       (1) the President certifies to Congress that all countries \n     that pledged financial assistance at the Madrid International \n     Conference on Reconstruction in Iraq or in other fora since \n     March 2003, for the relief and reconstruction of Iraq, \n     including grant aid, credits, and in-kind contributions, have \n     fulfilled their commitments; or\n       (2) the President--\n       (A) certifies to Congress that the President or his \n     representatives have made credible and good faith efforts to \n     persuade other countries that made pledges of financial \n     assistance at the Madrid International Conference on \n     Reconstruction in Iraq or in other fora to fulfill their \n     commitments;\n       (B) determines that, notwithstanding the efforts by United \n     States troops and taxpayers on behalf of the people of Iraq \n     and the failure of other countries to fulfill their \n     commitments, revenues generated from the sale of Iraqi oil or \n     other sources of revenue under the control of the Government \n     of Iraq may not be used to reimburse the Government of the \n     United States for the obligation and expenditure of a \n     significant portion of the remaining previously appropriated \n     Iraqi reconstruction funds;\n       (C) determines that, notwithstanding the failure of other \n     countries to fulfill their commitments as described in \n     subparagraph (A) and that revenues generated from the sale of \n     Iraqi oil or other sources of revenue under the control of \n     the government of Iraq shall not be used to reimburse the \n     United States government as described in subparagraph (B), \n     the obligation and expenditure of remaining previously \n     appropriated Iraqi reconstruction funds is in the national \n     security interests of the United States; and\n       (D) submits to Congress a written notification of the \n     determinations made under this paragraph, including a \n     detailed justification for such determinations, and a \n     description of the actions undertaken by the President or \n     other official of the United States to convince other \n     countries to fulfill their commitments described in \n     subparagraph (A).\n       (c) This section may not be superseded, modified, or \n     repealed except pursuant to a provision of law that makes \n     specific reference to this section.\n       (d) In this section:\n       (1) The term ``previously appropriated Iraqi reconstruction \n     funds'' means the aggregate amount appropriated or otherwise \n     made available in chapter 2 of title II of Public Law 108-106 \n     under the heading ``Iraq relief and reconstruction fund'' or \n     under title I of Public Law 108-11 under the heading ``Iraq \n     relief and reconstruction fund''.\n       (2)(A) The term ``Iraq reconstruction programs'' means \n     programs to address the infrastructure needs of Iraq, \n     including infrastructure relating to electricity, oil \n     production, public works, water resources, transportation and \n     telecommunications, housing and construction, health care, \n     and private sector development.\n       (B) The term does not include programs to fund military \n     activities (including the establishment of national security \n     forces or the Commanders' Emergency Response Programs), \n     public safety (including border enforcement, police, fire, \n     and customs), and justice and civil society development.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 395\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise in support of amendment 395. There \nare many Members on both sides of the aisle with strong objections to \nthe REAL ID Act. Those of us who value our Nation's historic commitment \nto asylum do not want to see severe restrictions placed on the ability \nof asylum seekers to obtain refuge here. Those of us who value states \nrights side with the National Governors Association, the National \nConference of State Legislatures, and the Council of State Governments \nin opposing the imposition of unworkable Federal mandates on State \ndrivers license policies. Those of us who value the environment and the \nrule of law object to requiring the DHS Secretary to waive all laws, \nenvironmental or otherwise, that may get in the way of the construction \nof border fences, and forbidding judicial review of the Secretary's \nactions.\n  To include the REAL ID Act in the conference report for this \nsupplemental would also deprive the Judiciary Committee and the Senate \nas a whole of the opportunity to consider and review these wide-ranging \nprovisions.\n  The majority leader has indicated in recent days that the Senate will \nbe considering immigration reform this year. The provisions in the REAL \nID Act should be considered at that time and in conjunction with a \nbroader debate about immigration. They should not be forced upon the \nSenate by the leadership of the other body.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this resolution, which I am \nproud to cosponsor with Senators Feinstein, Brownback, Alexander, and \nmany others.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST.

Madam President, the United Nations Human Rights \nCommission adopted a resolution expressing concern with the ``ongoing \nsystematic violation of human rights'' of the Burmese people. These \nviolations include: extrajudicial killings, rape and other forms of \nviolence persistently carried out by members of the armed forces, the \ncontinued use of torture, political arrests, forced and child labor, \nand systematic use of child soldiers.\n  While the Commission's action is welcomed, it is not enough. The \nUnited Nations Security Council must discuss and debate the immediate \nregional threats that country poses to its neighbors--whether from \nillicit narcotics, HIV/AIDS, trafficked and internally displaced \npersons, or refugees.\n  I am dismayed that both China and India reportedly objected to an \n``unbalanced approach'' in the Commission's action against Burma.\n  In my view, India can--and should--play a catalytic role in fostering \nchange in Burma. I would remind India that such objections serve only \nto tarnish its image as the world's largest democracy, and send the \nwrong message to Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, Nobel Peace Laureate and \nrecipient of India's Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International \nUnderstanding. India should, as it did in the past, stand firmly with \nBurma's democrats and work to foster reconciliation between the \nNational League for Democracy, ethnic nationalities and the illegal \nmilitary junta.\n  On a separate matter, I want to recognize Ms. Cindy Chang in the \nState Department's Bureau of Legislative Affairs. Cindy works closely \nwith the State/Foreign Operations Subcommittee, which I chair, and I \nwant the Secretary of State to know how ably Cindy represents that \nDepartment's--and the President's--interests on the Hill. She is a star \nin that Bureau.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/14/senate-section/article/S3645-3", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3645-S3646]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       NATIONAL ASSOCIATED ALUMNAE AND ALUMNI OF THE SACRED HEART\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

St. Madeleine Sophie Barat was the foundress of the \nSociety of the Sacred Heart, and she still is a true inspiration to all \nwho seek to follow the call of service.\n  The late Senator Paul Simon was my mentor when I began my political \ncareer in downstate Illinois. His wife, Jean Hurley Simon, graduated \nfrom Barat College in 1944.

Recently, \nSacred Heart alumni have led efforts to provide relief for people in \nIndonesia effected by the devastating tsunami. Funds raised by Sacred \nHeart alumni have allowed for much-needed health and education programs \nin the region, including interfaith projects to house and lead \nactivities for orphaned children.\n  Like Senator Simon before me, I have strongly supported higher \neducation initiatives and access to professional development training \nfor our elementary and secondary teachers. After all, teachers have the \nability to influence, impact, and shape the citizens of tomorrow.\n  I know that my fellow Senators will join me in commending the Sacred\n\n[[Page S3646]]\n\nHeart alumni for their legacy of service. I am confident that this \nproud history and tradition will continue in the spirit of St. \nMadeleine Sophie for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/14/senate-section/article/S3646-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3646]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES, NOT THE GUN INDUSTRY\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, it has been reported that the Senate may \nconsider the misnamed Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act in the \nnear future. I was pleased that this legislation was defeated during \nthe 108th Congress, and I continue to oppose its passage.\n  This bill would rewrite well-accepted principles of liability law, \nproviding the gun industry legal protections not enjoyed by other \nindustries. It would grant broad immunity from liability even in cases \nwhere gross negligence or recklessness led to someone being injured or \nkilled. Enactment of this special interest legislation for the gun \nindustry would also lead to the termination of a wide range of pending \nand prospective civil cases, depriving gun violence victims with \nlegitimate cases of their day in court.\n  It would be all the more irresponsible for the Senate to pass the gun \nindustry immunity legislation while also continuing to ignore many gun \nsafety issues that are critically important to the law enforcement \ncommunity. Recent editorials in major newspapers around the country \nhave highlighted Congress' inability to enact common sense gun safety \nlegislation. An editorial from Monday's edition of the Los Angeles \nTimes stated: Over the last four years, the president and his \ncongressional allies have repudiated or quietly eviscerated key gun \nlaws and regulations. Now they are poised to shield firearms makers and \nsellers from nearly all damage claims when their products kill or maim.\n  Thus far, Congress has failed to act to reauthorize the assault \nweapons ban that expired on September 13, 2004. This inaction allowed \ncriminals and terrorists potential easy access to many of the most \npowerful and deadly firearms manufactured. In addition, Congress has \nfailed to close a loophole that allows individuals on terrorist watch \nlists to buy these weapons and has failed to pass legislation that \nwould, at the very least, require a background check for individuals \nattempting to buy the previously banned assault weapons at gun shows.\n  Rather than considering a bill to protect members of the gun industry \nfrom liability, we should help protect our families and communities by \naddressing the loopholes that potentially allow known and suspected \nterrorists to legally purchase military style firearms within our own \nborders. I again urge my colleagues to take up and pass common sense \ngun safety legislation that will address these loopholes and the \nthreats they pose.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the April 11, 2005 Los Angeles Times \neditorial titled ``Remember Gun Control?'' be printed in the \nCongressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, Apr. 11, 2005]\n\n                         Remember Gun Control?\n\n       After four years of George W. Bush, the notions that some \n     people might be too dangerous or unstable to trust with a \n     firearm or that assault weapons do not belong in civilized \n     society are deader than a wild turkey in hunting season.\n       During Bush's first campaign, a National Rifle Assn. leader \n     quipped, ``If we win, we'll have a president where we work \n     out of their office.'' How right he was.\n       Over the last four years, the president and his \n     congressional allies have repudiated or quietly eviscerated \n     key gun laws and regulations. Now they are poised to shield \n     firearms makers and sellers from nearly all damage claims \n     when their products kill or maim. Not only is this a gift no \n     other industry enjoys, it's a truly bad idea that even gun \n     owners have reason to oppose.\n       Last year, Republican congressional leaders simply ran out \n     the clock on the 10-year-old federal assault gun ban, \n     refusing to even call a vote on renewing it despite steady \n     popular support for the law. Bush, who once claimed that he \n     supported the ban, refused to make so much as a phone call to \n     his House or Senate allies to keep it alive. With it died the \n     ban on domestically made ammunition clips with more than 10 \n     rounds, a boon for any disgruntled employee, terrorist or \n     high school student who wants to mow down a crowd. The \n     president also signed a bill that requires the destruction \n     within 24 hours of all records from background checks of gun \n     buyers. And Congress required the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, \n     Firearms and Explosives to keep secret the data that tracks \n     weapons used in crimes.\n       Meanwhile, a Government Accountability Office study \n     examining FBI and state background-check records found that \n     35 people whose names appeared on terrorism watch lists were \n     able to buy a gun. Incredibly, a would-be buyer's presence on \n     a watch list does not disqualify him or her from buying a \n     firearm. Because background-check data now must be promptly \n     destroyed, it is impossible to know how many more terrorism \n     suspects might be lawfully armed.\n       The immunity bill, introduced by Sen. Larry E. Craig (R-\n     Idaho) and Rep. Cliff Stearns (R-Fla.), would protect gun \n     manufacturers and sellers from damage suits by victims of gun \n     violence. It would even block injury suits from gun owners. \n     That means gun owners can't sue if poorly made handguns \n     explode in their hands or fire unintentionally. In many \n     instances, the bill would shield gun dealers who allow \n     criminals to buy a firearm, by severely weakening the ATF's \n     ability to shut down unscrupulous dealers.\n       This reckless measure, long on the NRA's wish list, has \n     come before Congress before, but enough lawmakers balked. \n     This time, emboldened by last November's GOP victories, there \n     looks to be less resistance. Senate Majority Leader Bill \n     Frist (R-Tenn.) says he's ready to call for a floor vote any \n     time. Unless voters speak up.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/14/senate-section/article/S3646-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3646-S3647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR. MAURICE HILLEMAN\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I rise today to memorialize the life and \naccomplishments of Dr. Maurice Hilleman, a renowned microbiologist and \nnative son of Montana.\n  Dr. Maurice R. Hilleman dedicated his life to developing vaccines for \nmumps, measles, chickenpox, pneumonia, meningitis and other diseases, \nsaving tens of millions of lives. He died on Monday at a hospital in \nPhiladelphia at the age of 85.\n  Raised on a farm in Montana, Dr. Hilleman credited much of his \nsuccess to his boyhood work with chickens, whose eggs form the \nfoundation of so many vaccines. Much of modern preventive medicine is \nbased on Dr. Hilleman's work, though he never received the public \nrecognition of Salk, Sabin or Pasteur. He is credited with having \ndeveloped more human and animal vaccines than any other scientist, \nhelping to extend human life expectancy and improving the economies of \nmany countries.\n  According to two medical leaders, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of \nthe National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Dr. Paul \nA. Offit, chief of infectious diseases at Children's Hospital in \nPhiladelphia, Dr. Hilleman probably saved more lives than any other \nscientist in the 20th century. ``The scientific quality and quantity of \nwhat he did was amazing,'' Dr. Fauci is quoted as saying. ``Just one of \nhis accomplishments would be enough to have made for a great scientific \ncareer. One can say without hyperbole that Maurice changed the world \nwith his extraordinary contributions in so many disciplines: virology, \nepidemiology, immunology, cancer research and vaccinology.''\n  Dr. Hilleman developed 8 of the 14 vaccines routinely recommended: \nmeasles, mumps, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, chickenpox, meningitis, \npneumonia and Haemophilus influenzae bacteria. He also developed the \nfirst generation of a vaccine against rubella, also known as German \nmeasles. The vaccines have virtually vanquished many of the once common \nchildhood diseases in developed countries.\n  In addition, Dr. Hilleman overcame immunological obstacles to combine \nvaccines so that one shot could protect against several diseases, like \nthe MMR vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella. He developed about 40 \nexperimental and licensed animal and human vaccines, mostly with his \nteam from Merck of Whitehouse Station, NJ His role in their development \nincluded lab work as well as scientific and administrative leadership.\n  And as a sign of his humility, Dr. Hilleman routinely credited others \nfor their roles in advances, according to his colleagues.\n  Vaccine development is complex, requiring an artistry to safely \nproduce large amounts of weakened live or dead microorganisms. Dr. \nOffit once said, ``Maurice was that artist: no one had the green thumb \nof mass production that he had.'' The hepatitis B vaccine, licensed in \n1981, is credited as the first\n\n[[Page S3647]]\n\nto prevent a human cancer: a liver cancer, known as a hepatoma, that \ncan develop as a complication of infection from the hepatitis B virus.\n  One of Dr. Hilleman's goals was to develop the first licensed vaccine \nagainst any viral cancer. He achieved it in the early 1970s, developing \na vaccine to prevent Marek's disease, a lymphoma cancer of chickens \ncaused by a member of the herpes virus family. Preventing the disease \nhelped revolutionize the economics of the poultry industry. Dr. \nHilleman's vaccines have also prevented deafness, blindness and other \npermanent disabilities among millions of people, a point made in 1988 \nwhen President Ronald Reagan presented him with the National Medal of \nScience, the Nation's highest scientific honor.\n  Because scientific knowledge about viruses was so limited when he \nbegan his career, Dr. Hilleman said that trial and error, sound \njudgment and luck drove much of his research. Luck played a major role \nin the discovery of adenoviruses. Dr. Hilleman flew a team to Missouri \nto collect specimens from troops suffering from influenza. But by the \ntime his team arrived, influenza had died out. Fearing that he would be \nfired for an expensive useless exercise, Dr. Hilleman seized on his \nobservation of the occurrence of a fresh outbreak of a different \ndisease. His team discovered three new types of adenoviruses among the \ntroops.\n  In the early 1950s, he made a discovery that helps prevent influenza. \nHe detected a pattern of genetic changes that the influenza virus \nundergoes as it mutates. The phenomenon is known as drift--minor \nchanges--and shift--- major changes. Vaccine manufacturers take account \nof drift in choosing the strains of influenza virus included in the \nvaccines that are freshly made each influenza season. Shifts can herald \na large outbreak or pandemic of influenza, and Dr. Hilleman was the \nfirst to detect the shift that caused the 1957 Asian influenza \npandemic. He read an article in the New York Times on April 17, 1957, \nabout influenza among infants in Hong Kong--cases that had escaped \ndetection from the worldwide influenza surveillance systems. At the \ntime, he directed the central laboratory for worldwide military \ninfluenza surveillance and was sure that the cases represented the \nadvent of an influenza pandemic. So he immediately sent for specimens \nfrom Hong Kong and helped isolate a new strain of influenza virus. He \nalso demanded that breeders keep roosters that would otherwise have \nbeen slaughtered so they could fertilize enough eggs to prepare 40 \nmillion doses of influenza to protect Americans against the 1957 \ninfluenza strain.\n  Standing tall at six-foot-one and wearing reading glasses that rested \non the tip of his nose, Dr. Hilleman described himself as a renegade. \nHe often participated in scientific meetings, where he could be \nirascible while amusing his colleagues with profane asides. At one of \nmany meetings with this physician-reporter, a Thanksgiving Day dinner \nduring a conference at the World Health Organization in Geneva in the \n1980s, Dr. Hilleman said he was driven by a goal to get rid of disease \nand by a belief that scientists had to serve society.\n  Maurice Ralph Hilleman was born on Aug. 30, 1919, in Miles City, MT. \nHis mother and twin sister died during his birth. In 1937, he went to \nwork in the local J. C. Penney's store where he helped cowpokes, as he \ndescribed his customers, pick out chenille bathrobes for their \ngirlfriends, and he was well on the way to a career in retailing until \nhis oldest brother suggested that he go to college. After graduating \nfrom Montana State University in 1941, he received his Ph.D. in \nmicrobiology from the University of Chicago and then joined E. R. \nSquibb & Sons. There, he developed a vaccine against Japanese B \nencephalitis to protect American troops in the World War II Pacific \noffensive. In 1948, he moved to the Walter Reed Army Medical Center and \nstayed until 1957, when Vannevar Bush, then chairman of Merck and a \nformer director of the Federal Office of Scientific Research and \nDevelopment in World War II, persuaded him to direct a virus research \nprogram for the drug company.\n  After retiring as senior vice president for Merck research \nlaboratories in 1984, Dr. Hilleman continued to work on vaccines, \nsaying they were needed for at least 20 diseases, including AIDS. Dr. \nHilleman is survived by his wife, Lorraine, a retired nurse; two \ndaughters, Jeryl Lynn of Palo Alto, CA., and Kirsten J. of New York \nCity; two brothers, Victor, of Fontana, CA., and Norman, of Santa \nBarbara, CA.; and five grandchildren. His daughter Jeryl Lynn is at \nleast in part responsible for the mumps vaccine. In 1963, when her \nsalivary glands started to swell with the disease, Dr. Hilleman swabbed \nher throat and went on to isolate the virus. He then weakened it and \nwithin 4 years had produced the now-standard mumps vaccine. The \nweakened strain bears her name.\n  Mr. President, it is an honor for me to pay my respects to such a \ngreat and accomplished man as Dr. Maurice Hilleman. And it is an honor \nfor me to call him a fellow Montanan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/14/senate-section/article/S3647-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3647-S3648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     100 YEARS OF EXEMPLARY SERVICE\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, on April 15, the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers, Honolulu Engineer District, HED, will celebrate 100 years of \nexemplary service to Hawaii, the Pacific region, the U.S. military and \nthe Nation.\n  For an entire century, the District has served with pride and \ndistinction. I have personally witnessed their hard work and dedication \nto improve the lives of our fellow citizens in many ways. They have \nnever failed to answer the call.\n  The District has had a significant impact on the ability of our \nservicemen and women to fight the global war on terror; it has \nbolstered the region's economy and worked to enhance the safety of \ncommunities in and about waterways and the functionability of the many \nmajor harbors in my home State of Hawaii. In everything they do they \nsafeguard the environment.\n  From civil works projects navigation, flood control and shore \nprotection to building and maintaining the infrastructure for our \nmilitary personnel, the Honolulu District is proud of its service.\n  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' missions in the Pacific region have \nexpanded exponentially since the unit's conception in 1905 when LT John \nSlattery was designated as Honolulu District Engineer on the Island of \nOahu.\n  The mission of the Twelfth Lighthouse District was to design and \nconstruct lighthouses for navigation, acquire land for military \nfortifications, improve the harbors and expand the Corps' services to \nother Pacific islands.\n  In its first 100 years, the Honolulu District has supported the \nmilitary in peace and in war, helped protect the island from enemies \nand forces of nature, protected the environment and wetlands, and added \nto Hawaii's economic growth.\n  HED's legacy includes: the creation of Sand Island; the acquisition \nof Fort DeRussy area in Waikiki; the expansion of Honolulu Harbor; the \nrepair of Hickam, Wheeler and Pearl Harbor airfields after the December \n1941 attack; the construction of the National Memorial Cemetery of the \nPacific at Punchbowl, the Tripler Army Medical Center, the Hale Koa \nHotel and numerous military and federal construction projects; and the \ncreation of the Kaneohe-Kailua Dam, as well as a host of disaster \nmitigation and assistance measures.\n  At the beginning of the 20th century, HED constructed six deep-draft \nharbors on the five major Hawaiian Islands and three crucial \nlighthouses for navigation.\n  Under Slattery's command, the District began transforming the swampy \ncoral reef used as a quarantine station in Honolulu Harbor into what is \nnow known as Sand Island. Lt. Slattery's contributions are honored \ntoday with the Lt. John R. Slattery Bridge which connects Sand Island \nwith the City of Honolulu.\n  He later purchased the 74-acre Fort DeRussy area in Waikiki for just \n$2,700 an acre for use as a military fortification. At the time, the \nland was little more than a swampy parcel. Today the area provides a \nvaluable green oasis in the heart of Waikiki.\n  Throughout the 20th century, HED supported Oahu's defense by building \na multitude of coastal fortifications including Pearl Harbor, Forts \nRuger,\n\n[[Page S3648]]\n\nArmstrong, Weaver, Barrette and Kamehameha as well as Batteries \nRandolph, Williston, Hatch, and Harlow.\n  Changes in technology and the approach of World War I changed HED's \nmissions. Batteries and forts were supplemented with artillery fire \ncontrol and submarine mine defense systems.\n  As cars began replacing horse-drawn wagons, HED built new roads and \ntunnels to transport equipment and troops. The District enlarged \nHonolulu Harbor to 1,000 feet long and 800 feet wide--a critical \nproject because the newly-created Panama Canal had transformed Honolulu \ninto a major port-of-call for ships needing coal and supplies.\n  The District's role in the Pacific increased dramatically during \nWorld War II. At the height of the war, HED employed more than 26,000 \npeople. Not only was the District creating the new airfield ferry \nroutes and repairing the damaged airfields at Hickam, Wheeler and Pearl \nHarbor, but the District was also tasked with additional \nresponsibilities beyond its normal realm.\n  The District was suddenly responsible for determining shipping \npriorities in the harbor; converting sugarcane and pineapple \nplantations to vegetable farms; organizing a rationing program for oil \nand other consumer goods; camouflaging equipment and landmarks; \nbuilding trenches and air raid shelters; erecting radar stations and \nexcavating extensive underground rooms and tunnels for ammunition \nstorage.\n  Before war was declared, the District had been creating a new \nAirfield Ferry Route System. The original route from the Philippines, \nMarianas, Wake Island, Midway, Hawaii to California was considered \nvulnerable to Japanese attack. New air ferry routes to the east and \nsouth were necessary to the war effort and the military buildup in \nAustralia.\n  Building seven runways and support facilities on small, remote \nislands presented a number of challenges involving materials, manpower \nand water shortages, communication, transportation and geographical \ntopography. The southern route, from California, Hawaii, Christmas, \nCanton, Fiji, New Caledonia to Australia and the eastern route, from \nChristmas, Penrhyn, Aitutaki, Tongatabu, Norfolk to Sydney, were \nfinished by the 1-year anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor--an \nimpressive accomplishment by any standard.\n\n  When the war ended, HED had constructed 69 miles of runways and \ntaxiways, and 2,700,000 square yards of aircraft parking area.\n  Although the District's workload diminished after the war, the post-\nwar years were anything but quiet as HED continued to supply \nengineering troops overseas and to dispose of real estate on the \nislands.\n  The Corps was also busy with major endeavors including construction \nof Tripler Army Medical Center, the National Memorial Cemetery of the \nPacific at Punchbowl, and flood control and shore protection projects \ncritical to the safety and future enjoyment of many communities.\n  Tripler Army Medical Center, commonly known as the ``Pink Lady,'' was \ncompleted in 1948 at a cost of $40 million. The 14-story, 1,500-bed \nhospital was an extensive project featuring 12 separate buildings--each \nconstructed separately to make the Medical Center earthquake-resistant. \nToday, Tripler continues serving military members and their families \nfrom around the Pacific, as well as Hawaii's veterans and military \nretirees.\n  During the 1960s and 1970s, new Federal policies further expanded \nHED's duties. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 required \nthe Corps to prepare environmental impact statements, EIS, on all \nproposed federal actions affecting the environment. The Clean Water Act \nof 1977 brought changes to the Corps' regulatory mission and required \nthe Corps to issue permits for all dredged or fill material. The Corps \nwas now responsible for all the nation's water and wetlands--a scope \nthat now stretches far beyond navigable waters. This began the Corps' \nmission as ``Stewards of the Environment.''\n  The 1970s were also a time of internal change for the District. In \n1973, the functions of the Pacific Ocean Division and the Honolulu \nEngineer District were merged to form a single operating division. The \nDivision moved from Fort Armstrong to its present location at Fort \nShafter on Oahu.\n  Civil works and capital improvement programs expanded to Guam, \nAmerican Samoa, Kwajalein and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana \nIslands. Main projects on Oahu included building military housing and \nimproving facilities at Hickam AFB, Wheeler, Schofield, Aliamanu and \nFort Shafter.\n  In 1973, HED began construction of the Hale Koa Military Rest and \nRecreational Hotel at Fort DeRussy in Waikiki. The original highrise \nhotel tower has 416 rooms, 15 floors and was built for $15.7 million.\n  Nearby Battery Randolph was transformed into the U.S. Army Museum. \nThe second floor of the museum today houses the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers Pacific Regional Visitors Center.\n  The Corps' responsibilities were further expanded in 1980 with the \naddition of an Emergency Management Division. In July 2002, HED \ndisaster recovery specialists provided support in the wake of Typhoon \nChataan. Just 6 months later, HED responded swiftly in December 2002 \nwhen Pacific Ocean Division disaster recovery specialists were called \nupon and arrived 2 days after Super Typhoon Pongsona devastated Guam \nwith 184-mph winds. Within 2 weeks, more than 100 members from all \neight Corps of Engineers divisions were on the ground to execute a $20 \nmillion in disaster cleanup.\n  In the fall of 2004, HED sent emergency management teams and manpower \nto Florida, Louisiana, Alabama and South Carolina in response to the \ndevastation by Hurricanes Ivan, Charley, and Frances.\n  HED today continues to serve a variety of missions in a region of 12 \nmillion square miles from Hawaii to Micronesia an area of operations \nspanning five time zones, the equator and the international dateline. \nThis they have done with the utmost of professionalism, integrity and \nan unwavering commitment to service.\n  I am truly honored to have the Honolulu Engineer District in my home \nState. They serve as ``America's Engineers in the Pacific.'' I have no \ndoubt that they will continue their service and legacy with pride and \naloha for the next hundred years and beyond. Happy Birthday. \nCongratulations on a job well done. On behalf of a grateful Nation, \nthank you for your service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/14/senate-section/article/S3648-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3648-S3649]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MR.

PATRICK J. SCHLOSS\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to publicly recognize \nthe inauguration of Dr. Patrick J. Schloss as the 15th President of \nNorthern State University in Aberdeen, SD.\n  A dedicated scholar, diligent educator and attentive family man, Dr. \nSchloss certainly deserves this great honor and responsibility. After \nobtaining both his bachelors degree in special education and his \nmasters degree in counseling from Illinois State University, Patrick \nwent on to earn his doctorate in rehabilitation psychology from the \nUniversity of Wisconsin.\n  Dr. Schloss is a man of great scholarship and knowledge. A prolific \nwriter and frequent contributor to professional literature, his \nwritings about special education methods relating to vocational \neducation and community integration are studied in colleges and \nuniversities throughout the Nation.\n  Prior to joining the faculty of Bloomsburg University in \nPennsylvania, Dr. Schloss held numerous administrative and academic \npositions at the University of Missouri and Pennsylvania State \nUniversity. While at Bloomsburg, he served as assistant vice president \nand dean of graduate studies from 1994 until 2000, when he was \nappointed provost and vice president for academic affairs. Under \nPatrick's direction, Bloomsburg's enrollment not only increased 12 \npercent, but the university launched its undergraduate engineering and \ndoctoral programs, as well.\n  In addition to his passion for education, Dr. Schloss served as \npresident of the Pennsylvania Association of Graduate Schools, and also \nheld board, committee, and task force appointments on behalf of the \nCouncil for Exceptional Children and the Association for Retarded \nCitizens.\n  It is an honor for me to share Dr. Schloss's accomplishments with my \ncolleagues and to publicly commend him for his extraordinary academic \ncareer. Serving as president of Northern State University is an honor \nhe richly deserves, and I am certain he will prove to be a tremendous \nasset to the university and the entire Aberdeen community. On behalf of \nall South Dakotans, I would like to congratulate Dr. Schloss and wish \nhim all the best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/14/senate-section/article/S3649-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3649]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    HONORING THE SPEARFISH HIGH SCHOOL PARTICIPANTS IN THE ``WE THE \n                          PEOPLE'' COMPETITION\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, on April 30-May 2, 2005, more than \n1,200 students from across the United States will visit Washington, DC, \nto compete in the national finals of We the People: The Citizen and the \nConstitution Program. This is the most extensive educational program in \nthe country developed specifically to educate young people about the \nConstitution and the Bill of Rights. Administered by the Center for \nCivic Education, the We the People program is funded by the U.S. \nDepartment of Education by act of Congress.\n  I am proud to announce that the class from Spearfish High School will \nrepresent the state of South Dakota in this national event. These young \nscholars have worked conscientiously to reach the national finals by \nparticipating at local and statewide competitions. As a result of their \nexperience, they have gained a deep knowledge and understanding of the \nfundamental principles and values of our constitutional democracy.\n  The 3-day We the People national competition is modeled after \nhearings in the U.S. Congress. The hearings consist of oral \npresentations by high school students before a panel of adult judges on \nconstitutional topics. The students are given an opportunity to \ndemonstrate their knowledge while they evaluate, develop, and defend \npositions on relevant historical and contemporary issues. Their \ntestimony is followed by a period of questioning by the judges, who \nprobe the students' depth of understanding and ability to apply their \nconstitutional knowledge.\n  The We the People program provides curricular materials at upper \nelementary, middle, and high school levels. The curriculum not only \nenhances students' understanding of the institutions of American \nconstitutional democracy, it also helps them identify the contemporary \nrelevance of the Constitution and Bill of Rights. Critical thinking \nexercises, problem-solving activities, and cooperative learning \ntechniques help develop participatory skills necessary for students to \nbecome active, responsible citizens.\n  The class from Spearfish High School is currently preparing for their \nparticipation in the national competition in Washington, DC. It is \ninspiring to see these young people advocate the fundamental ideals and \nprinciples of our Government, ideas that identify us as a people and \nbind us together as a nation. It is important for future generations to \nunderstand these values and principles that we hold as standards in our \nendeavor to preserve and realize the promise of our constitutional \ndemocracy. Congratulations to Bethany Baker, Brandon Bentley, Hannah \nBucher, Meghan Byrum, Joe Cooch, Jenna Eddy, Elise Foltz, Amber Ginter, \nMeggan Joachim, Frankelly Martinez Garcia, Lauren Meyers, Jason Nies, \nEmily Oldekamp, Aly Oswald, Jessica Richey, Lauren Schempf, Lindsay \nSenden, Janette Sigle, Nick Smith, Brent Swisher, Calli Tetrault, \nKaysie Tope, and their teacher, Patrick Gainey. I wish these young \nconstitutional scholars the very best at the We the People national \nfinals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/14/senate-section/article/S3649-3", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3649]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  RECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DENVER REGIONAL COUNCIL OF \n                          GOVERNMENTS (DRCOG)\n\n Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a model \nof intergovernmental cooperation from my home State of Colorado: the \nDenver Regional Council of Governments, known as DRCOG.\n  DRCOG is a nonprofit, cooperative effort of the 51 county and \nmunicipal governments in the Denver metropolitan area, representing two \nand a half million residents, with another million expected by 2030, \nacross eight counties: Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Broomfield, Clear \nCreek, Denver, Douglas, Gilpin and Jefferson. It was founded 50 years \nago as the Inter-County Regional Planning Association, conceived as a \nplace where local officials could work cooperatively to solve the \nregion's problems. And it is a voluntary organization--the members are \nchoosing to work together for mutual benefit.\n  DRCOG champions efforts in a number of areas, including services for \nseniors, transportation and commuter solutions, public safety training \nand testing, where it has repeatedly benefited from the highly \nsuccessful COPS Program, as well as regional growth and water quality \nplans. It has focused on long-term plans to solve these issues, \nincluding developing understandable, fair and objective project \nselection processes for regional projects eligible for Federal, State \nand local funds and a long-term regional growth plan.\n  Last night was DRCOG's Annual Awards Dinner, where it will hand out a \nnumber of awards, including the John V. Christensen Memorial Award. \nNamed after one of DRCOG's cofounders, the late John Christensen was a \ncounty commissioner for Arapahoe County and one of the Denver area's \nbiggest proponents of cooperative problem solving for the metro area. \nThe Christensen award will go tonight to a regionalist who has \ndisplayed outstanding commitment to working for the region's common \ngood. Past award recipients have included Colorado State legislators, \nmayors, county commissioners, as well as county planners, regional \nleaders, and others during the award's 32-year history.\n  DRCOG has strived to speak, as its motto says, ``With One Voice.'' \nIts members have eschewed partisanship and ideological bickering to \nfocus on a single goal: Cooperative problem solving that benefits all \nof the people of the Denver metro area. By coming to the table with the \ncommitment to work towards a common solution, DRCOG has exemplified \nwhat we seek in our leaders: Thoughtful consideration and deliberate \naction.\n  DRCOG is exactly the kind of effort to which we all aspire, a place \nfor ideas and insight, for working in a nonpartisan fashion across \njurisdictional lines. I applaud the accomplishments and efforts of the \nDenver Regional Council of Governments and look forward to its \ncontinued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/14/senate-section/article/S3649-4", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3649-S3650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to\n\n[[Page S3650]]\n\nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/14/senate-section/article/S3650-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/14/senate-section/article/S3650-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:10 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 8.

    \n\n[Pages S3655-S3688]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. KYL (for himself, Mr. Cornyn, and Mr. Coburn):\n  S. 783. A bill to repeal the sunset on the 2004 material-support \nenhancements, to increase penalties for providing material support to \nterrorist groups, to bar from the United States aliens who have \nreceived terrorist training, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Material \nSupport to Terrorism Prohibition Improvements Act of 2005.\n  Mr. Barry Sabin, the Chief of the Counterterrorism Section of the \nJustice Department's Criminal Division, testified as to the importance \nof the material support statute at a September 13 hearing before the \nTerrorism Subcommittee last year. He emphasized that:\n\n     a key element of the [Justice] Department's strategy for \n     winning the war against terrorism has been to use the \n     material support statutes to prosecute aggressively those \n     individuals who supply terrorists with the support and \n     resources they need to survive. The Department seeks to \n     identify and apprehend terrorists before they can carry out \n     their plans, and the material support statutes are a valuable \n     tool for prosecutors seeking to bring charges against and \n     incapacitate terrorists before they are able to cause death \n     and destruction.\n\n  The bill that I introduce today expands current law's exclusion from \nthe United States of persons who give material support to terrorism by \ntraining at a terrorist camp. The bill makes such persons inadmissible \nto the United States, they now only are deportable, and applies these \nexclusions to pre-enactment terrorist training. Mr. Sabin described at \nlast year's hearing the threat posed by persons who have receive \ntraining at a terrorist camp:\n\n       A danger is posed to the vital foreign policy interests and \n     national security of the United States whenever a person \n     knowingly receives military-type training from a designated \n     terrorist organization or persons acting on its behalf. Such \n     an individual stands ready to further the malicious intent of \n     the terrorist organization through terrorist activity that \n     threatens the security of United States nationals or the \n     national security of the United States.\n\n  My bill would ensure that such persons not only are removed from the \nUnited States once they are found\n\n[[Page S3656]]\n\nhere, but also are prevented from entering this country in the first \nplace.\n  Today's bill also repeals a 2006 sunset on several recent \nclarifications that were made to the material-support statute in order \nto address vagueness concerns expressed by some courts. At the \nSeptember 13 Terrorism Subcommittee hearing, George Washington \nUniversity law professor Jonathan Turley said of the original \nlegislative proposal to clarify the statute: ``[t]his proposal would \nactually improve the current federal law by correcting gaps and \nambiguities that have led to recent judicial reversals. In that sense, \nthe proposal can be viewed as a slight benefit to civil liberties by \nremoving a dangerous level of ambiguity in the law.''\n  There is no reason why this important provision, and other \nimprovements to the material-support statute made in last year's 9/11 \nCommission bill, should be allowed to expire at the end of this \nCongress. This bill would make these improvements permanent.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a section by \nsection analysis be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 783\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

BARRING ENTRY TO THE UNITED STATES FOR \n                   REPRESENTATIVES AND MEMBERS OF TERRORIST GROUPS \n                   AND ALIENS WHO HAVE RECEIVED MILITARY-TYPE \n                   TRAINING FROM TERRORIST GROUPS.\n\n       Section 212(a)(3)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act \n     (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(B)) is amended--\n       (1) in clause (i)--\n       (A) in subclause (IV), by amending item (aa) to read as \n     follows:\n\n       ``(aa) a terrorist organization as defined in clause (vi), \n     or''.\n\n       (B) by striking subclause (V) and inserting the following:\n       ``(V) is a member of a terrorist organization--\n\n       ``(aa) described in subclause (I) or (II) of clause (vi); \n     or\n       ``(bb) described in clause (vi)(III), unless the alien can \n     demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the alien \n     did not know, and should not reasonably have known, that the \n     organization was a terrorist organization,''.\n\n       (C) in subclause (VI), by striking ``or'' at the end;\n       (D) in subclause (VII), by inserting ``or'' at the end; and\n       (E) by inserting after subclause (VII) the following:\n       ``(VIII) has received military-type training (as defined in \n     section 2339D(c)(1) of title 18, United States Code) from, or \n     on behalf of, any organization that, at the time the training \n     was received, was a terrorist organization,''; and\n       (2) in clause (vi), by striking ``clause (i)(VI)'' and \n     inserting ``subclauses (VI) and (VIII) of clause (i)''.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Bill Title. ``Material Support to Terrorism \n     Prohibition Improvements Act of 2005.''\n       Section 2. Repeal of Sunset on 2004 Material-Support \n     Enhancements. Section 6603 of the Intelligence Reform and \n     Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (the 9/11 Commission Act) \n     includes important provisions that expand and clarify the \n     material-support statutes (18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec.  2339A & \n     2339B). These provisions clarify the definitions of the terms \n     ``personnel'', ``training'', and ``expert advice or \n     assistance,'' in order to correct void-for-vagueness problems \n     identified by the Ninth Circuit; expand the jurisdictional \n     bases for material-support offenses; clarify the definition \n     of ``material support;'' and clarify that the United States \n     need only show that a defendant knew that the organization to \n     which he gave material support either engaged in terrorism or \n     was designated as a terror group--thus overruling the Ninth \n     Circuit's conclusion that the United States also must show \n     that the defendant knew of the particular terrorist activity \n     that caused an organization to be designated as a terror \n     group. All of these changes are set to expire on December 31, \n     2006, pursuant to subsection 6603(g) of the 9/11 Commission \n     Act. This section of this Act repeals subsection (g), making \n     the 2004 material-support enhancements permanent.\n       Section 3. Barring Entry to the United States for \n     Representatives and Members of Terrorist Groups and Aliens \n     Who Have Received Military-Type Training from Terrorist \n     Groups. This section bars entry to the United States for any \n     alien who has received military-type training from a either a \n     terrorist group that is designated as such by the Secretary \n     of State, or from an undesignated terrorist group. (These \n     groups are defined in 8 U.S.C. Sec.  1182(a)(3)(B)(vi). An \n     undesignated terrorist group is a group that commits or \n     incites terrorist activity with the intent to cause serious \n     bodily injury, prepares or plans terrorist activity, or \n     gathers information on potential targets for terrorist \n     activity.) This section would correct a deficiency in current \n     law, which makes aliens who receive military-type terror \n     training deportable but does not make them inadmissible. \n     Aliens who receive training in violent activity from a \n     terrorist group are not allowed to remain in the United \n     States--they should not be permitted to enter the United \n     States in the first place. This section also bars entry to \n     the United States for aliens who are representatives or \n     members of either designated or undesignated terrorist \n     organizations, though members of undesignated terror groups \n     may avoid exclusion if they can show by clear and convincing \n     evidence that they did not know, and should not reasonably \n     have known, that the organization to which they belonged was \n     a terrorist organization.\n       Section 4. Expanded Removal from the United States of \n     Aliens Who Have Received Military-Type Training from \n     Terrorist Groups. Under current law, an alien is deportable \n     if he has received military-type training from a terrorist \n     group that is designated as such by the Secretary of State. \n     See 8 U.S.C. Sec.  1227(a)(4)(E). This section also makes \n     deportable an alien who has received military-type training \n     from an undesignated terrorist group. (See Section 3 above \n     for definition of undesignated terror group.)\n       Section 5. Barring Entry to and Removing Terrorist Aliens \n     from the United States Based on Pre-Enactment Terrorist \n     Conduct. This section makes clear that the terrorist-alien \n     deportation and exclusion provisions in sections 3 and 4 of \n     this Act apply to terrorist activity that the alien engaged \n     in before the enactment of this Act. Congress indisputably \n     has the authority to bar and remove aliens from the United \n     States based on past terrorist conduct. See Lehmann v. U.S. \n     ex rel. Carson, 353 U.S. 685, 690 (1957) (``It seems to us \n     indisputable, therefore, that Congress was legislating \n     retrospectively, as it may do, to cover offenses of the kind \n     here involved.'' (emphasis added; citations omitted)). Under \n     this section, an alien who received military-type training \n     from a terrorist group in Afghanistan in 2001 would be barred \n     from entering or remaining in the United States.\n       Section 6. Increased Penalties for Providing Material \n     Support to Terrorist Groups. Under current law, providing \n     material support to a terrorist group is a criminal offense \n     that is punishable by zero to 15 years' imprisonment, or zero \n     to life if death results. Receiving military-type training \n     from a terrorist group is punishable by zero to 10\n\n[[Page S3657]]\n\n      years in prison. Under the Supreme Court's recent decision \n     in United States v. Booker, 125 S.Ct. 738 (January 12, 2005), \n     the federal sentencing guidelines' prescriptions no longer \n     are mandatory--district judges now have discretion to impose \n     little or no jail time for material-support offenses. Booker/\n     Fanfan also limits the appellate courts' ability to correct a \n     district judge's failure to impose jail time for a material-\n     support offense. This section increases the penalties for \n     material-support offenses to 5-25 years' imprisonment, with \n     15 years to life if death results, and raises the military-\n     type-training penalty to 3-15 years' imprisonment. These \n     enhanced penalties reflect both the gravity of the offense of \n     providing material support to a terrorist group, and the \n     heightened importance, since the terrorist attacks of \n     September 11, 2001, of deterring individuals from providing \n     aid and comfort to terrorist organizations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THOMAS (for himself and Mrs. Lincoln):\n  S. 784. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for the coverage of marriage and family therapist services and \nmental health counselor services under part B of the medicare program, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to introduce \nthe ``Seniors Mental Health Access Improvement Act of 2005'' with my \ndistinguished colleague from Arkansas, Mrs. Lincoln. Specifically, the \n``Seniors Mental Health Access Improvement Act of 2005'' permits mental \nhealth counselors and marriage and family therapists to bill Medicare \nfor services provided to seniors. This will result in an increased \nchoice of mental health providers for seniors and enhance their ability \nto access mental health services in their communities.\n  This legislation is especially crucial to rural seniors who are often \nforced to travel long distances to utilize the services of mental \nhealth providers currently recognized by the Medicare program. Rural \ncommunities have difficulty recruiting and retaining providers, \nespecially mental health providers. In many small towns, a mental \nhealth counselor or a marriage and family therapist is the only mental \nhealth care provider in the area. Medicare law--as it exists today--\ncompounds the situation because only psychiatrists, clinical \npsychologists, clinical social workers and clinical nurse specialists \nare able to bill Medicare for their services.\n  It is time the Medicare program recognized the qualifications of \nmental health counselors and marriage and family therapists as well as \nthe critical role they play in the mental health care infrastructure. \nThese providers go through rigorous training, similar to the curriculum \nof masters level social workers, and yet are excluded from the Medicare \nprogram.\n  Particularly troubling to me is the fact that seniors have \ndisproportionally higher rates of depression and suicide than other \npopulations. Additionally, 75 percent of the 518 nationally designated \nMental Health Professional Shortage Areas are located in rural areas \nand one-fifth of all rural counties have no mental health services of \nany kind. Frontier counties have even more drastic numbers as 95 \npercent do not have a psychiatrist, 68 percent do not have a \npsychologist and 78 percent do not have a social worker. It is quite \nobvious we have an enormous task ahead of us to reduce these staggering \nstatistics. Providing mental health counselors and marriage and family \ntherapists the ability to bill Medicare for their services is a key \npart of the solution.\n  Virtually all of Wyoming is designated a mental health professional \nshortage area and will greatly benefit from this legislation. Wyoming \nhas 174 psychologists, 37 psychiatrists and 263 clinical social workers \nfor a total of 474 Medicare eligible mental health providers. Enactment \nof the ``Seniors Mental Health Access Improvement Act of 2005'' will \nmore than double the number of mental health providers available to \nseniors in my State with the addition of 528 mental health counselors \nand 61 marriage and family therapists currently licensed in the State.\n  I believe this legislation is critically important to the health and \nwell-being of our Nation's seniors and I strongly urge all my \ncolleagues to become a cosponsor.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 784\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to clarify the duties and responsibilities of the \nNational Weather Service, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the National Weather \nServices Duties Act of 2005 to clarify the responsibilities of the \nNational Weather Service (NWS) within the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Association, NOAA. This legislation modernizes the \nstatutory description of NWS roles in the national weather enterprise \nso that it reflects today's reality in which the NWS and the commercial \nweather industry both play important parts in providing weather \nproducts and services to the Nation.\n  Back in 1890 when the current NWS organic statute was enacted, and \nall the way through World War II, the public received its weather \nforecasts and warnings almost exclusively from the Weather Bureau, the \nNWS's predecessor. In the late 1940s, a fledging weather service \nindustry began to develop. From then until December 2004, the NWS has \nhad policies sensitive to the importance of fostering the industry's \nexpansion, and since 1948 has had formal policies discouraging its \ncompetition with industry. Fourteen years ago the NWS took the extra \nstep of carefully delineating the respective roles of the NWS and the \ncommercial weather industry, in addition to pledging its intention not \nto provide products or services that were or could be provided by the \ncommercial weather industry. This longstanding non-competition and non-\nduplication policy has had the effect of facilitating the growth of the \nindustry into a billion dollar sector and of strengthening and \nextending the national weather enterprise, now the best in the world.\n  Regrettably, the parent agency of the NWS, NOAA, repealed the 1991 \nnon-competition and non-duplication policy in December 2004. Its new \npolicy only promises to ``give due consideration'' to the abilities of \nprivate sector entities. The new policy appears to signal the intention \nof NOAA and the NWS to expand their activities into areas that are \nalready well served by the commercial weather industry. This detracts \nfrom NWS's core missions of maintaining a modem and effective \nmeteorological infrastructure, collecting comprehensive observational \ndata, and issuing warnings and forecasts of severe weather that \nimperils life and property.\n  Additionally, NOAA's action threatens the continued success of the \ncommercial weather industry. It is not an easy prospect for a business \nto attract advertisers, subscribers, or investors when the government \nis providing similar products and services for free. This bill restores \nthe NWS non-competition policy. However, the legislation leaves NWS \nwith complete and unfettered freedom to carry out its critical role of \npreparing and issuing severe weather warnings and forecasts designed \nfor the protection of life and property of the general public. I \nbelieve it is in the best interest of both the government and NWS to \nconcentrate on this critical role and its other core missions. The \nbeauty of a highly competent private sector is that services that are \nnot inherently involved in public safety and security can be carried \nout with little or no expenditure of taxpayer dollars. At a time of \ntight agency budgets, the commercial weather industry's increasing \ncapabilities offer the Federal Government the opportunity to focus its \nresources on the governmental functions of collecring and distributing \nweather data, research and development of atmospheric models and core \nforecasts, and on ensuring that NWS meteorologists provide the most \ntimely and accurate warnings and forecasts of life-threatening weather.\n  The National Weather Service Duties Act also addresses the potential \nmisuse of insider information. Currently, NOAA and the NWS are doing \nlittle to safeguard the NWS information that could be used by \nopportunistic investors to gain unfair profits in the weather futures \nmarkets, in the agriculture and energy markets, and in other business \nsegments influenced by government weather outlooks, forecasts, and \nwarnings. No one knows who may be taking advantage of this information. \nIn recent years there have been various examples of NWS personnel \nproviding such information to specific TV stations and others that \nenable those businesses to secure an advantage over their competitors. \nThe best way to address this problem is to require that NWS data, \ninformation, guidance, forecasts and warnings be issued in real time \nand simultaneously to all members of the public, the media and the \ncommercial weather industry. This bill imposes just such a requirement, \nwhich is common to other Federal agencies. The responsibilities of the \ncommercial weather industry as the only private sector producer of \nweather information, services and systems deserve this definition to \nensure continued growth and investment in the private sector and to \nproperly focus the government's activities.\n  We have every right to expect these agencies to minimize unnecessary, \ncompetitive, and commercial-type activities, and to do the best \npossible job of warning the public about impending flash floods, \nhurricanes, tornadoes, tsunamis, and other potentially catastrophic \nevents. I encourage my colleagues to support this important piece of \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 793.

A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to improve the \nsafety of nonmotorized transportation, including bicycle and pedestrian \nsafety; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  By Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the ``Safe \nand Complete Streets Act of 2005.''\n  This legislation helps put this Nation on the path to a safer and, \nimportantly, healthier America, by making some very modest adjustments \nin how State transportation departments and regional and local \ntransportation agencies address the safety needs of pedestrians and \nbicyclists.\n  This proposal is being introduced today to ensure greater attention \nto the ``SAFETEA'' elements of the surface transportation renewal bill \nthat will come before the Senate in the coming weeks. With some \nselected, but modest, adjustments to this surface transportation \nlegislation, we can improve the safety of pedestrians and bicyclists. \nAnd with that improved safety, we make it easier for Americans to walk \nand use bicycles to meet their transportation needs, whether to work, \nfor errands or for simple exercise and enjoyment.\n  Currently, safety concerns reduce the comfort of many people to move \nby foot and bicycle. Many roadways simply do not have sidewalks. And it \nis a particular problem for our growing elderly population. In many \ncases, the timing of lights makes it difficult for the elderly and \nthose with a disability to simply get from one side of a busy \nintersection to another.\n  There is clearly a need for further progress in this area. Consider \nthat nearly 52,000 pedestrians and more than 7,400 bicyclists were \nkilled in the most recent 10-year period, ending 2003. And, we know \nthat many of these deaths, and thousands of more injuries, are \navoidable, if we commit ourselves to doing those things that make a \ndifference.\n  This bill proposes three important changes to current law. First, it \ninsists that Federal, State and local agencies receiving billions of \ndollars in federal transportation funds modernize their processes--how \nthey plan, what they study and how they lead--so that the safety of \npedestrians and bicyclists are more fully considered. Second, it \nensures that investments we make today don't add to the problems we \nalready have, which is the burden of retrofitting and reengineering \nexisting transportation networks because we forgot about pedestrians \nand bicyclists. Finally, it commits additional resources to a national \npriority need--getting our children to schools safely on foot and \nbicycles through a stronger funding commitment to Safe Routes to \nSchool.\n  The Senate will soon take up a surface transportation renewal plan \nthat already includes key provisions to help us make further progress \non the safety needs of nonmotorized travelers. The ``Safe and Complete \nStreets Act of 2005'' is specifically designed and developed to \ncomplement the efforts in the committee passed measure. Only in two \nareas, pertaining to the Safe Routes to School initiative and a small \nnonmotorized pilot program, does this legislation propose any \nadditional funding commitments. All other aspects of the legislation \nbefore you today build upon existing commitments and existing features \nof current law.\n  Let me speak briefly to the issues of the Safe Routes to School \nprogram specifically. This legislation proposes to raise the Senate's \ncommitment to increased safety for our school age kids by slightly more \nthan $100 million annually over the level in the surface transportation \nbill that the Senate will soon consider.\n  I am proposing this modest increase in spending because there is a \ncrtical need for us to accelerate what we are doing to protect our most \nexposed citizens, our school age children. This Nation has spent the \nlast two generations getting kids into cars and buses, rather than on \nfoot or bicycles.\n  Now, we are reaping the harvest. Billions more in added \ntransportation costs for our schools districts to bus our kids to \nschools. Added congestion on our roadways as families transport their \nkids to school by I private automobile, clogging traffic at the worst \ntime possible, during the morning commute. In Marin County, CA, a pilot \nprogram has demonstrated substantial success in reducing congestion by \nshifting children to walking and riding their bikes to school.\n  In addition, we see rising obesity in our children and looming public \nhealth challenges over the next several generations, and even shortened \nlife expectancy. We need to promote walking for both health and \ntransportation purposes.\n  The ``Safe and Complete Streets Act of 2005'' will not only promote \nthe safety of pedestrians and bicyclists, it also will provide benefits \nto society from smarter use of tax dollars, and by focusing on safety \nfirst. I urge my Senate colleagues to join with me in supporting this \nimportant legislation.\n  I am pleased to announce that it has the support of the following \neleven national organizations: AARP, American Bikes, American Heart \nAssociation, American Public Health Association, American Society of \nLandscape Architects, American Planning Association, League of American \nBicyclists, National Center for Bicycling & Walking, Paralyzed Veterans \nof America, Rail-to-Trails Conservancy and the Surface Transportation \nPolicy Project.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. Warner):\n  S. 795, A bill to provide driver safety grants to States with \ngraduated driver licensing laws that meet certain minimum requirements; \nto the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise with my colleague from Virginia, \nSenator Warner, to introduce the Safe Teen and Novice Driver Uniform \nProtection (STAND UP) Act of 2005--an important piece of legislation \nthat seeks to protect and ensure the lives of the 20 million teenage \ndrivers in our country.\n  We all know that the teenage years represent an important formative \nstage in a person's life. They are a bridge between childhood and \nadulthood--the transitional and often challenging period during which a \nperson will first gain an inner awareness of his or her identity. The \nteenage years encompass a time for discovery, a time for growth, and a \ntime for gaining independence--all of which ultimately help boys and \ngirls transition successfully into young men and women.\n  As we also know, the teenage years also encompass a time for risk-\ntaking. A groundbreaking study to be published soon by the National \nInstitutes of Health concludes that the frontal lobe region of the \nbrain which inhibits risky behavior is not fully formed until the age \nof 25. In my view, this important report implies that we approach \nteenagers' behavior with a new sensitivity. It also implies that we \nhave a societal obligation to steer teenagers towards positive risk-\ntaking that fosters further growth and development and away from \nnegative risk-taking that has an adverse effect on their well-being and \nthe well-being of others.\n  Unfortunately, we see all too often this negative risk-taking in \nteenagers when they are behind the wheel of a motor vehicle. We see all \ntoo often how this risk-taking needlessly endangers the life of a \nteenage driver, his or her passengers, and other drivers on the road. \nAnd we see all too often the tragic results of this risk-taking when \nirresponsible and reckless behavior behind the wheel of a motor vehicle \ncauses severe harm and death.\n  According to the National Transportation Safety Board, motor vehicle \ncrashes are the leading cause of death for Americans between 15 and 20 \nyears of age. In 2002, teenage drivers, who constituted only 6.4 \npercent of all drivers, were involved in 14.3 percent of all fatal \nmotor vehicle crashes. In 2003, 5,691 teenage drivers were killed in \nmotor vehicle crashes and 300,000 teenage drivers suffered injuries in \nmotor vehicle crashes.\n  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports that \nteenage drivers have a fatality rate that is four times higher than the \naverage fatality rate for drivers between 25 and 70 years of age. \nFurthermore, teenage drivers who are 16 years of age have a motor \nvehicle crash rate that is almost ten times the crash rate for drivers \nbetween the ages of 30 and 60.\n  Finally, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety concludes \nthat the chance of a crash by a driver either 16\n\n[[Page S3665]]\n\nor 17 years of age is doubled if there are two peers in the motor \nvehicle and quadrupled with three or more peers in the vehicle.\n\n  Crashes involving teenage injuries or fatalities are often \nhighprofile tragedies in the area where they occur. However, when taken \ntogether, these individual tragedies speak to a national problem \nclearly illustrated by the staggering statistics I just mentioned. It \nis a problem that adversely affects teenage drivers, their passengers, \nand literally everyone else who operates or rides in a motor vehicle. \nClearly, more work must be done to design and implement innovative \nmethods that educate our young drivers on the awesome responsibilities \nthat are associated with operating a motor vehicle safely.\n  One such method involves implementing and enforcing a graduated \ndriver's license system, or a GDL system. Under a typical GDL system, a \nteenage driver passes through several sequential learning stages before \nearning the full privileges associated with an unrestricted driver's \nlicense. Each learning stage is designed to teach a teenage driver \nfundamental lessons on driver operations, responsibilities, and safety. \nEach stage also imposes certain restrictions, such as curfews on \nnighttime driving and limitations on passengers, that further ensure \nthe safety of the teenage driver, his or her passengers, and other \nmotorists.\n  First implemented over ten years ago, three-stage GDL systems now \nexist in 38 States. Furthermore, every State in the country has adopted \nat least one driving restriction for new teenage drivers. Several \nstudies have concluded that GDL systems and other license restriction \nmeasures have been linked to an overall reduction on the number of \nteenage driver crashes and fatalities. In 1997, in the first full year \nthat its GDL system was in effect, Florida experienced a 9 percent \nreduction in fatal and injurious motor vehicle crashes among teenage \ndrivers between 15 and 18 years of age. After GDL systems were \nimplemented in Michigan and North Carolina in 1997, the number of motor \nvehicle crashes involving teenage drivers 16 years in age decreased in \neach State by 25 percent and 27 percent, respectively. And in \nCalifornia, the numbers of teenage passenger deaths and injuries in \ncrashes involving teenage drivers 16 years in age decreased by 40 \npercent between 1998 and 2000, the first three years that California's \nGDL system was in effect. The number of ``at-fault'' crashes involving \nteenage drivers decreased by 24 percent during the same period.\n  These statistics are promising and clearly show that many States are \ntaking an important first step towards addressing this enormous problem \nconcerning teenage driver safety. However, there is currently no \nuniformity between States with regards to GDL system requirements and \nother novice driver license restrictions. Some States have very strong \ninitiatives in place that promote safe teenage driving while others \nhave very weak initiatives in place. Given how many teenagers are \nkilled or injured in motor vehicle crashes each year, and given how \nmany other motorists and passengers are killed or injured in motor \nvehicle crashes involving teenage drivers each year, Senator Warner and \nI believe that the time has come for an initiative that sets a national \nminimum safety standard for teen driving laws while giving each State \nthe flexibility to set additional standards that meet the more specific \nneeds of its teenage driver population. The bill that Senator Warner \nand I are introducing today--the STANDUP Act--is such an initiative. \nThere are four principal components of this legislation about which I \nwould like to discuss.\n  First, The STANDUP Act mandates that all States implement a national \nminimum safety standard for teenage drivers that contains three core \nrequirements recommended by the National Transportation Safety Board. \nThese requirements include implementing a three-stage GDL system, \nimplementing at least some prohibition on nighttime driving, and \nplacing a restriction on the number of passengers without adult \nsupervision.\n  Second, the STANDUP Act directs the Secretary of Transportation to \nissue voluntary guidelines beyond the three core requirements that \nencourage States to adopt additional standards that improve the safety \nof teenage driving. These additional standards may include requiring \nthat the learner's permit and intermediate stages be six months each, \nrequiring at least 30 hours of behind-the-wheel driving for a novice \ndriver in the learner's permit stage in the company of a licensed \ndriver who is over 21 years of age, requiring a novice driver in the \nlearner's permit stage to be accompanied and supervised by a licensed \ndriver 21 years of age or older at all times when the novice driver is \noperating a motor vehicle, and requiring that the granting of an \nunrestricted driver's license be delayed automatically to any novice \ndriver in the learner's permit or intermediate stages who commits a \nmotor vehicle offense, such as driving while intoxicated, \nmisrepresenting his or her true age, reckless driving, speeding, or \ndriving without a fastened seatbelt.\n\n  Third, the STANDUP Act provides incentive grants to States that come \ninto compliance within three fiscal years. Calculated on a State's \nannual share of the Highway Trust Fund, these incentive grants could be \nused for activities such as training law enforcement and relevant State \nagency personnel in the GDL law or publishing relevant educational \nmaterials on the GDL law.\n  Finally, the STANDUP Act calls for sanctions to be imposed on States \nthat do not come into compliance after three fiscal years. The bill \nwithholds 1.5 percent of a State's Federal highway share after the \nfirst fiscal year of non-compliance, three percent after the second \nfiscal year, and six percent after the third fiscal year. The bill does \nallow a State to reclaim any withheld funds if that State comes into \ncompliance within two fiscal years after the first fiscal year of non-\ncompliance.\n  There are those who will say that the STAND UP Act infringes on \nStates' rights. I respectfully disagree. I believe that working to \nprotect and ensure the lives and safety of the millions of teenage \ndrivers, their passengers, and other motorists in this country is \nnational in scope and a job that is rightly suited for Congress. I also \nbelieve that the number of motor vehicle deaths and injuries associated \nwith teenage drivers each year compels us to address this important \nnational issue today and not tomorrow.\n  The teenage driving provisions within the STANDUP Act are both well-\nknown and popular with the American public. A Harris Poll conducted in \n2001 found that 95 percent of Americans support a requirement of 30 to \n50 hours of practice driving within an adult, 92 percent of Americans \nsupport a six-month learner's permit stage, 74 percent of Americans \nsupport limiting the number of teen passengers in a motor vehicle with \na teen driver, and 74 percent of Americans also support supervised or \nrestricted driving during high-risk periods such as nighttime. Clearly, \nthese numbers show that teen driving safety is an issue that transcends \nparty politics and is strongly embraced by a solid majority of \nAmericans. Therefore, I ask my colleagues today to join Senator Warner \nand myself in protecting the lives of our teenagers and in supporting \nthis important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 795\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The National Transportation Safety Board has reported \n     that--\n       (A) in 2002, teen drivers, which constituted only 6.4 \n     percent of all drivers, were involved in 14.3 percent of all \n     fatal motor vehicle crashes;\n       (B) motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death \n     for Americans between 15 and 20 years of age;\n       (C) between 1994 and 2003, almost 64,000 Americans between \n     15 and 20 years of age died in motor vehicle crashes, an \n     average of 122 per week; and\n       (D) in 2003--\n       (i) 3,657 American drivers between 15 and 20 years of age \n     were killed in motor vehicle crashes;\n       (ii) 300,000 Americans between 15 and 20 years of age were \n     injured in motor vehicle crashes; and\n\n[[Page S3666]]\n\n       (iii) 7,884 American drivers between 15 and 20 years of age \n     were involved in fatal crashes, resulting in 9,088 total \n     fatalities, a 5 percent increase since 1993.\n       (2) Though only 20 percent of driving by young drivers \n     occurs at night, over 50 percent of the motor vehicle crash \n     fatalities involving young drivers occur at night.\n       (3) The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has \n     reported that--\n       (A) 6,300,000 motor vehicle crashes claimed the lives of \n     nearly 43,000 Americans in 2003 and injured almost 3,000,000 \n     more Americans;\n       (B) teen drivers between 16 and 20 years of age have a \n     fatality rate that is 4 times the rate for drivers between 25 \n     and 70 years of age; and\n       (C) drivers who are 16 years of age have a motor vehicle \n     crash rate that is almost ten times the crash rate for \n     drivers aged between 30 and 60 years of age.\n       (4) According to the Insurance Institute for Highway \n     Safety, the chance of a crash by a 16- or 17-year-old driver \n     is doubled if there are 2 peers in the vehicle and quadrupled \n     with 3 or more peers in the vehicle.\n       (5) In 1997, the first full year of its graduated driver \n     licensing system, Florida experienced a 9 percent reduction \n     in fatal and injurious crashes among young drivers between \n     the ages of 15 and 18, compared with 1995, according the \n     Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.\n       (6) The Journal of the American Medical Association reports \n     that crashes involving 16-year-old drivers decreased between \n     1995 and 1999 by 25 percent in Michigan and 27 percent in \n     North Carolina. Comprehensive graduated driver licensing \n     systems were implemented in 1997 in these States.\n       (7) In California, according to the Automobile Club of \n     Southern California, teenage passenger deaths and injuries \n     resulting from crashes involving 16-year-old drivers declined \n     by 40 percent from 1998 to 2000, the first 3 years of \n     California's graduated driver licensing program. The number \n     of at-fault collisions involving 16-year-old drivers \n     decreased by 24 percent during the same period.\n       (8) The National Transportation Safety Board reports that \n     39 States and the District of Columbia have implemented 3-\n     stage graduated driver licensing systems. Many States have \n     not yet implemented these and other basic safety features of \n     graduated driver licensing laws to protect the lives of \n     teenage and novice drivers.\n       (9) A 2001 Harris Poll indicates that--\n       (A) 95 percent of Americans support a requirement of 30 to \n     50 hours of practice driving with an adult;\n       (B) 92 percent of Americans support a 6-month learner's \n     permit period; and\n       (C) 74 percent of Americans support limiting the number of \n     teen passengers in a car with a teen driver and supervised \n     driving during high-risk driving periods, such as night.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the National Aquaculture Act of 1980 to \nprohibit the issuance of permits for marine aquaculture facilities \nuntil requirements for such permits are enacted into law; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President. I am today reintroducing a very \nimportant bill on a subject that was not resolved last year, and which \ncontinues to be an outstanding issue for those of us who are dependent \non healthy and productive natural populations of ocean fish and \nshellfish.\n  Simply put, this bill prohibits further movement toward the \ndevelopment of aquaculture facilities in federal waters until Congress \nhas had an opportunity to review all of the very\n\n[[Page S3667]]\n\nserious implications, and make decisions on how such development should \nproceed.\n  Some people are calling for a moratorium on offshore aquaculture. \nFrankly, Mr. President, we need more than a delay--we need a very \ncomprehensive discussion of this issue and a serious debate on what the \nground-rules should be.\n  For years, some members of the federal bureaucracy have advocated \ngoing forward with offshore aquaculture development without that \ndebate. Doing so, would be an extraordinarily bad idea.\n  We are now being told that the Administration is in the final stages \nof preparing a draft bill to allow offshore aquaculture development to \noccur, and that it plans to send a draft to the Hill in the very near \nfuture. The problem is, that draft has been prepared in deep secrecy. \nWe have only rumors about what may be in that draft bill. The \nadministration has had meetings on the general topic of aquaculture, \nbut has done little to nothing to work with those of us who represent \nconstituents whose livelihoods might be imperiled and states with \nresources that might be endangered if the administration gets it wrong.\n  Scientists, the media and the public are awakening to the serious \ndisadvantages of fish raised in fish farming operations compared to \nnaturally healthy wild fish species such as Alaska salmon, halibut, \nsablefish, crab and many other species.\n  It has become common to see news reports that cite not only the \ngeneral health advantages of eating fish at least once or twice a week, \nbut the specific advantages of fish such as wild salmon, which contains \nessential Omega-3 fatty acids that may help reduce the risk of heart \ndisease and possibly have similar beneficial effects on other diseases.\n  Educated and watchful consumers have also seen recent stories citing \nresearch that not only demonstrates that farmed salmon fed vegetable-\nbased food does not have the same beneficial impact on cardio-vascular \nhealth, but also that the demand for other fish to grind up and use as \nfeed in those fish farms may lead to the decimation of those stocks.\n  Those same alert consumers may also have seen stories indicating that \nfish farms may create serious pollution problems from the concentration \nof fish feces and uneaten food, that fish farms may harbor diseases \nthat can be transmitted to previously healthy wild fish stocks, and \nthat fish farming has had a devastating effect on communities that \ndepend on traditional fisheries.\n  It is by no means certain that all those problems would be duplicated \nif we begin to develop fish farms that are farther offshore, but \nneither is there any evidence that they would not be. Yet despite the \nuncertainties, proponents have continued to push hard for legislation \nthat would encourage the development of huge new fish farms off our \ncoasts.\n  Not only do the proponents want to encourage such development, but \nreports indicate they may also want to change the way decisions are \nmade so that all the authority rests in the hands of just one federal \nagency. I believe that would be a serious mistake. There are simply too \nmany factors that should be evaluated--from hydraulic engineering, to \nenvironmental impacts, to fish biology, to the management of disease, \nto the nutritional character of farmed fish, and so on--for any \nexisting agency.\n  We cannot afford a rush to judgment on this issue--it is far too \ndangerous if we make a mistake. In my view, such a serious matter \ndeserves the same level of scrutiny by Congress as the recommendations \nof the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy for other sweeping changes in \nocean governance.\n  The ``Natural Stock Conservation Act'' I am introducing today lays \ndown a marker for where the debate on offshore aquaculture needs to go. \nIt would prohibit the development of new offshore aquaculture \noperations until Congress has acted to ensure that every federal agency \ninvolved does the necessary analyses in areas such as disease control, \nengineering, pollution prevention, biological and genetic impacts, \neconomic and social effects, and other critical issues, none of which \nare specifically required under existing law.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to understand that this is not a \nparochial issue, but a very real threat to the literal viability of \nnatural fish and shellfish stocks as well as the economic viability of \nmany coastal communities.\n  I sincerely hope that this issue is taken up seriously in the context \nof reauthorizing the Magnuson-Stevens Act, which governs fishery \nmanagement, and responding to the recommendations of the U.S. Oceans \nCommission and the Pew Oceans Commission.\n  We all want to make sure we enjoy abundant supplies of healthy foods \nin the future, but not if it means unnecessary and avoidable damage to \nwild species, to the environment generally, and to the economies of \nAmerica's coastal fishing communities.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 796\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and \nManagement Act to clarify the status of certain communities in the \nwestern Alaska community development quota program; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am today reintroducing legislation to \nclarify the status of villages participating in the federally \nestablished Community Development Quota (CDQ) program created to assist \neconomically disadvantaged communities around the edge of the Bering \nSea.\n  The CDQ program is one of the youngest but most successful of a \nvariety of programs intended to improve economic opportunities in some \nof my State's most challenged communities.\n\n[[Page S3668]]\n\n  The CDQ Community Preservation Act is intended to maintain the \nparticipation of all currently eligible communities along the shore of \nthe Bering Sea in Alaska's Community Development Quota program. It is \nnecessary because inconsistencies in statutory and regulatory \nprovisions may require a reassessment of eligibility and the exclusion \nof some communities from the program. This was not the intent of the \noriginal program, nor of any subsequent changes to it. In order to \nclarify that fact, a legislative remedy is needed.\n  Senator Stevens joined me in introducing just such a remedy last \nyear, but work on it was not completed and we were forced to settle for \nonly temporary relief. It is time we dealt with this matter more \nappropriately.\n  Alaska has been generously blessed with natural resources, but due to \nits location and limited transportation infrastructure it continues to \nhave pockets of severe poverty. Nowhere is this more evident than in \nthe villages around the rim of the Bering Sea.\n  The Community Development Quota Program began in 1992, at the \nrecommendation of the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, one of \nthe regional councils formed under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery \nConservation and Management Act. Congress gave the program permanent \nstatus in the 1996 reauthorization of the Act. The program presently \nincludes 65 communities within a 50 nautical-mile radius of the Bering \nSea, which have formed six regional non-profit associations to \nparticipate in the program. The regional associations range in size \nfrom one to 20 communities. Under the program, a portion of the \nregulated annual harvests of pollock, halibut, sablefish, Atka \nmackerel, Pacific cod, and crab is assigned to each of the \nassociations, which operate under combined Federal and State agency \noversight. Almost all of an association's earnings must be invested in \nfishing-related projects in order to encourage a sustainable economic \nbase for the region.\n  Typically, each association sells its share of the annual harvest \nquotas to established fishing companies in return for cash and \nagreements to provide job training and employment opportunities for \nresidents of the region. The program has been remarkably successful.\n  Since 1992, approximately 9,000 jobs have been created for western \nAlaska residents with wages totaling more than $60 million. The CDQ \nprogram has also contributed to fisheries infrastructure development in \nwestern Alaska, as well as providing vessel loan programs; education, \ntraining and other CDQ-related benefits.\n  The CDQ program has its roots in the amazing success story of how our \noffshore fishery resources were Americanized after the passage of the \noriginal Magnuson Act in 1976. At the time, vast foreign fishing fleets \nwere almost the only ones operating in the U.S. 200-mile Exclusive \nEconomic Zone. American fishermen simply did not have either the \nvessels or the expertise to participate.\n  The Magnuson-Stevens Act changed all that. It led to the adoption of \nwhat we called a ``fish and chips'' policy that provided for an \nexchange of fish allocations for technological and practical expertise. \nWithin the next few years, harvesting fell almost exclusively to \nAmerican vessels. Within a few years after that, processing also became \nAmericanized. Today, there are no foreign fishing or processing vessels \noperating in the 200-mile zone off Alaska, and the industry is worth \nbillions of dollars each year.\n  The CDQ program helps bring some of the benefits of that great \nindustry to local residents in one of the most impoverished areas of \nthe entire country. It is a vital element in the effort to create and \nmaintain a lasting economic base for the region's many poor \ncommunities, and truly deserves the support of this body.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 797\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``CDQ Community Preservation \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. WESTERN ALASKA COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT QUOTA PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Eligible Communities.--Section 305(i)(1) of the \n     Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 \n     U.S.C. 1855(i)) is amended adding at the end the following:\n       ``(E) A community shall be eligible to participate in the \n     western Alaska community development quota program under \n     subparagraph (A) if the community was--\n       ``(i) listed in table 7 to part 679 of title 50, Code of \n     Federal Regulations, as in effect on January 1, 2004; or\n       ``(ii) approved by the National Marine Fisheries Service on \n     April 19, 1999.''.\n       (b) Conforming Amendment.--Such section is further amended, \n     in paragraph (B), by striking ``To'' and inserting, ``Except \n     as provided in subparagraph (E), to''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Dayton, Mr. \n        Durbin, Mr. Lautenberg, Ms. Mikulski, and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 798. A bill to amend the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 and \ntitle 5, United States Code, to provide entitlement to leave to \neligible employees whose spouse, son, daughter, or parent is a member \nof the Armed Forces who is serving on active duty in support of a \ncontingency operation or who is notified of an impending call or order \nto active duty in support of a contingency operation, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation on behalf \nof myself and Senators Corzine, Dayton, Durbin, Lautenberg, Mikulski, \nand Murray, that would bring a small measure of relief to the families \nof our brave military personnel who are being deployed for the ongoing \nfight against terrorism, the war in Iraq, and other missions in this \ncountry and around the world. It is legislation that the Senate adopted \nunanimously when I offered it as an amendment to the fiscal year 2004 \nIraq supplemental spending bill and I think it would be very fitting \nfor my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure again during \nthis, the National Month of the Military Child.\n  The men and women of our Armed Forces undertake enormous sacrifices \nin their service to our country. They spend time away from home and \nfrom their families in different parts of the country and different \nparts of the world and are placed into harm's way in order to protect \nthe American people and our way of life. We owe them a huge debt of \ngratitude for their dedicated service.\n  The ongoing deployments for the fight against terrorism and for the \ncampaign in Iraq are turning upside down the lives of thousands of \nactive duty, National Guard, and Reserve personnel and their families \nas they seek to do their duty to their country and honor their \ncommitments to their families, and, in the case of the reserve \ncomponents, to their employers as well. Today, there are more than \n180,000 National Guard and Reserve personnel on active duty.\n  Some of my constituents are facing the latest in a series of \nactivations and deployments for family members who serve our country in \nthe military. Others are seeing their loved ones off on their first \ndeployment. All of these families share in the worry and concern about \nwhat awaits their relatives and hope, as we do, for their swift and \nsafe return.\n  Many of those deployed in Iraq have had their tours extended beyond \nthe time they had expected to stay. This extension has played havoc \nwith the lives of those deployed and their families. Worried mothers, \nfathers, spouses, and children expecting their loved ones home after \nmore than a year of service have been forced to wait another three or \nfour months before their loved ones' much-anticipated homecoming. The \nemotional toll is huge. So is the impact on a family's daily \nfunctioning as bills still need to be paid, children need to get to \nschool events, and sick family members must still be cared for.\n  Our men and women in uniform face these challenges without complaint. \nBut we should do more to help them and their families with the many \nthings that preparing to be deployed requires.\n  During the first round of mobilizations for operations in Afghanistan \nand Iraq, military personnel and their families were given only a \ncouple of days' notice that their units would be deployed. As a result, \nthese dedicated\n\n[[Page S3669]]\n\nmen and women had only a very limited amount of time to get their lives \nin order. For members of the National Guard and Reserve, this included \ninforming their employers of the deployment. I want to commend the many \nemployers around the country for their understanding and support when \ntheir employees were called to active duty.\n  In preparation for a deployment, military families often have to \nscramble to arrange for child care, to pay bills, to contact their \nlandlords or mortgage companies, and to take care of other things that \nwe deal with on a daily basis.\n  The legislation I introduce today would allow eligible employees \nwhose spouses, parents, sons, or daughters are military personnel who \nare serving on or called to active duty in support of a contingency \noperation to use their Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) benefits for \nissues directly relating to or resulting from that deployment. These \ninstances could include preparation for deployment or additional \nresponsibilities that family members take on as a result of a loved \none's deployment, such as child care.\n  But don't just take my word for it. Here is what the National \nMilitary Family Association has to say in a letter of support:\n\n       (The National Military Family Association) has heard from \n     many families about the difficulty of balancing family \n     obligations with job requirements when a close family member \n     is deployed. Suddenly, they are single parents or, in the \n     case of grandparents, assuming the new responsibility of \n     caring for grandchildren. The days leading up to a deployment \n     can be filled with pre-deployment briefings and putting legal \n     affairs in order.\n\n  In that same letter, the National Military Family Association states \nthat, ``Military families, especially those of deployed service \nmembers, are called upon to make extraordinary sacrifices. (The \nMilitary Families Leave Act) offers families some breathing room as \nthey adjust to this time of separation.''\n  On July 21, 2004, then-Governor Joseph Kernan of Indiana testified \nbefore a joint hearing of the Senate Health, Labor, Education, and \nPensions and Armed Services committees that Congress should revise FMLA \nto include activated National Guard families, as recommended by the \nNational Governors' Association. The legislation I introduce today \nwould give many military families some of the assistance Governor \nKernan spoke of.\n  Let me make sure there is no confusion about what this legislation \ndoes and does not do. This legislation does not expand eligibility for \nFMLA to employees not already covered by FMLA. It does not expand FMLA \neligibility to active duty military personnel. It simply allows those \nalready covered by FMLA to use those benefits in one additional set of \ncircumstances--to deal with issues directly related to or resulting \nfrom the deployment of a family member.\n  I was proud to cosponsor and vote for the legislation that created \nthe landmark Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) during the early days \nof my service to the people of Wisconsin as a member of this body. This \nimportant legislation allows eligible workers to take up to 12 weeks of \nunpaid leave per year for the birth or adoption of child, the placement \nof a foster child, to care for a newborn or newly adopted child or \nnewly placed foster child, or to care for their own serious health \ncondition or that of a spouse, a parent, or a child. Some employers \noffer a portion of this time as paid leave in addition to other accrued \nleave, while others allow workers to use accrued vacation or sick leave \nfor this purpose prior to going on unpaid leave.\n  Since its enactment in 1993, the FMLA has helped more than 35 million \nAmerican workers to balance responsibilities to their families and \ntheir jobs. According to the Congressional Research Service, between \n2.2 million and 6.1 million people took advantage of these benefits in \n1999-2000.\n  Our military families sacrifice a great deal. Active duty families \noften move every couple of years due to transfers and new assignments. \nThe twelve years since FMLA' s enactment has also been a time where we \nas a country have relied more heavily on National Guard and Reserve \npersonnel for more and more deployments of longer and longer duration. \nThe growing burden on these service members' families must be \naddressed, and this legislation is one way to do so.\n  This legislation has the support of a number of organizations, \nincluding the Wisconsin National Guard, the Military Officers \nAssociation of America, the Enlisted Association of the National Guard \nof the United States, the Reserve Enlisted Association, the Reserve \nOfficers Association, the National Military Family Association, the \nNational Council on Family Relations, and the National Partnership for \nWomen and Families. The Military Coalition, an umbrella organization of \n31 prominent military organizations, specified this legislation as one \nof five meriting special consideration during the fiscal year 2004 Iraq \nsupplemental debate.\n  We owe it to our military personnel and their families to do all we \ncan to support them in this difficult time. I hope that this \nlegislation will bring a small measure of relief to our military \nfamilies and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 798\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \nthe coordination of Federal Government policies and activities to \nprevent obesity in childhood, to provide for State childhood obesity \nprevention and control, and to establish grant programs to prevent \nchildhood obesity within homes, schools, and communities; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, America is facing a major public health \nproblem because of the epidemic of obesity in the nation's children. \nNine million children today are obese. Over the past three decades, the \nrate of obesity has more than doubled in preschool children and \nadolescents, and tripled among all school-age children. The health \nrisks are immense. If the current rates do not decrease, 30 percent of \nboys and 40 percent of girls born in 2000 will develop diabetes, which \ncan lead to kidney failure, blindness, heart disease and stroke.\n  Obese children are 80 percent likely to become obese adults, with \nsignificantly greater risk for not only diabetes, but heart disease, \narthritis and certain types of cancer. The economic impact of obesity-\nrelated health expenditures in 2004 reached $129 billion, a clear sign \nof the lower quality of life likely to be faced by the growing number \nof the nation's youth.\n  Childhood obesity is the obvious result of too much food and too \nlittle exercise. Children are especially susceptible because of the \ndramatic social changes that have been taking place for many years. \nChildren are exposed to 40,000 food advertisements a year one food \ncommercial every minute--urging them to eat candy, snacks, and fast \nfood. Vending machines are now in 43 percent of elementary schools and \n97 percent of high schools, offering young students easy access to soft \ndrinks and snacks that can double their risk of obesity. Many schools \nhave eliminated physical education classes, leaving children less \nactive throughout the school day. More communities are built without \nsidewalks, safe parks, or bike trails. Parents, who worry about the \nsafety of their children in outside play, encourage them to sit and \nwatch television. Fast food stores are nearby, grocery stores and \nfarmers markets with fresh fruits and vegetables are not.\n  According to the Institute of Medicine, prevention of obesity in \nchildren and youth requires public health action at its broadest and \nmost inclusive level, with coordination between federal and state \ngovernments, within schools and communities, and involving industry and \nmedia, so that children can make food and activity choices that lead to \nhealthy weights.\n  The Prevention of Childhood Obesity Act makes the current epidemic a \nnational public health priority. It appoints a federal commission on \nfood policies to promote good nutrition. Guidelines for food and \nphysical activity advertisements will be established by a summit \nconference of representatives from education, industry, and health \ncare. Grants are provided to states to implement anti-obesity plans, \nincluding curricula and training for educators, for obesity prevention \nactivities in preschool, school and after-school programs, and for \nsidewalks, bike trails, and parks where children can play and be both \nhealthy and safe.\n  Prevention is the cornerstone of good health and long, productive \nlives for all Americans. Childhood obesity is preventable, but we have \nto work together to stop this worsening epidemic and protect our \nchildren's future. Congress must to do its part and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 799\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Prevention of Childhood \n     Obesity Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Childhood overweight and obesity is a major public \n     health threat to the United States. The rates of obesity have \n     doubled in preschool children and tripled in adolescents in \n     the past 25 years. About 9,000,000 young people are \n     considered overweight.\n       (2) Overweight and obesity is more prevalent in Mexican \n     American and African American youth. Among Mexican Americans, \n     24 percent of children (6 to 11 years) and adolescents (12 to \n     19 years) are obese and another 40 percent of children and 44 \n     percent of adolescents are overweight. Among African \n     Americans, 20 percent of children and 24 percent of \n     adolescents are obese and another 36 percent of children and \n     41 percent of adolescents are overweight.\n       (3) Childhood overweight and obesity is related to the \n     development of a number of preventable chronic diseases in \n     childhood and adulthood, such as type 2 diabetes and \n     hypertension.\n       (4) Overweight adolescents have up to an 80 percent chance \n     of becoming obese adults. In 2003, obesity-related health \n     conditions in adults resulted in approximately \n     $11,000,000,000 in medical expenditures.\n       (5) Childhood overweight and obesity is preventable but \n     will require changes across the multiple environments to \n     which our children are exposed. This includes homes, schools, \n     communities, and society at large.\n       (6) Overweight and obesity in children are caused by \n     unhealthy eating habits and insufficient physical activity.\n       (7) Only 2 percent of school children meet all of the \n     recommendations of the Food Guide Pyramid. Sixty percent of \n     young people eat too much fat and less than 20 percent eat \n     the recommended 5 or more servings of fruits and vegetables \n     each day.\n       (8) More than one third of young people do not meet \n     recommended guidelines for physical activity. Daily \n     participation in high school physical education classes \n     dropped from 42 percent in 1991 to 28 percent in 2003.\n       (9) Children spend an average of 5\\1/2\\ hours per day using \n     media, more time than they spend doing anything besides \n     sleeping.\n       (10) Children are exposed to an average of 40,000 \n     television advertisements each year for candy, high sugar \n     cereals, and fast food. Fast food outlets alone spend \n     $3,000,000,000 in advertisements targeting children. Children \n     are exposed to 1 food commercial every 5 minutes.\n       (11) A coordinated effort involving evidence-based \n     approaches is needed to ensure children develop in a society \n     in which healthy lifestyle choices are available and \n     encouraged.\n\n                  TITLE I--FEDERAL OBESITY PREVENTION\n\n     SEC. 101.

A bill to amend the District of Columbia Home Rule Act to \nprovide the District of Columbia with autonomy over its budgets, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Ms. Collins. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nincludes the District of Columbia Budget Autonomy Act of 2005 and the \nDistrict of Columbia Independence of the Chief Financial Officer Act of \n2005. Last Congress, I introduced this legislation, which passed the \nSenate unanimously. This legislation would provide the District of \nColumbia with more autonomy over its local budget and make permanent \nthe authority of the D.C. Chief Financial Officer.\n  Providing the District of Columbia with more autonomy over its local \nbudget will help the Mayor and the Council of the District of Columbia \nbetter manage and run the city. Currently, the District of Columbia \nmust submit its budget through the normal Federal appropriations \nprocess. Unfortunately, this process is often riddled with delays. For \nexample, the average delay for enactment of an appropriations bill for \nthe District of Columbia has been 3 months. The result of this delay is \nclear. For a local community these delays affect programs, planning and \nmanagement initiatives important to the everyday lives of the residents \nof the city.\n  The ability of D.C., like any other city in the Nation, to operate \nefficiently and address the needs of its citizens is of utmost \nimportance. Unlike other budgets that are approved by Congress, the \nlocal D.C. budget has a direct effect on local services and programs \nand affects the quality oflife for the residents of D.C. Congress has \nrecognized the practical issues associated with running a city. As a \nresult, in the 1970s, Congress passed the D.C. Home Rule Act which \nestablished the current form of local government. Congress also \nempowered D.C. to enact local laws that affect the everyday lives of \nDistrict residents. And, now, I believe it is time for Congress to do \nthe same with regard to the local budget.\n  The District of Columbia Budget Autonomy Act of 2005 would address \nthese problems by authorizing the local government to pass its own \nbudget each year. This bill would only affect that portion of the D.C. \nbudget that includes the use oflocal funds, not Federal funds. In \naddition, the bill still provides for congressional oversight. Prior to \na local budget becoming effective, Congress will have a 30-day period\n\n[[Page S3675]]\n\nin which to review the local budget. In addition, the local authority \nto pass a budget would be suspended during any periods of poor \nfinancial condition that would trigger a control year.\n  Having the locally elected officials of those providing the funds \nthat are the subject of the budget process decide on how those funds \nshould be spent is a matter of simple fairness. There are also the \npractical difficulties that the current system causes when the local \nbudget is not approved until well into the fiscal year. By enacting \nthis bill, Congress would be appropriately carrying out its \nconstitutional duties with respect to the District by improving the \ncity's ability to better plan, manage and run its local programs and \nservices. This is what the taxpayers of the District of Columbia have \nelected their local officials to do.\n  The legislation also includes the District of Columbia Independence \nof the Chief Financial Officer Act of 2005 which would make permanent \nthe authority of the District of Columbia Chief Financial Officer. The \ncurrent Chief Financial Officer for the District of Columbia is \noperating under authority it derived from the D.C. Control Board, which \nis currently dormant due to the city's improved financial situation. \nThat authority was set to sunset when the D.C. Control Board was phased \nout; however, the CFO's authority continues to be extended through the \nappropriations process, until such time as permanent legislation is \nenacted.\n  Ensuring continued financial accountability of the D.C. government is \ncrucial for the fiscal stability of the city. The CFO has played a \nsignificant role in maintaining this stability. While providing the \nDistrict with more autonomy over its budgets, it is also important that \nthe CFO's authority is made permanent and that its role is clear.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON of Florida:\n  S. 801. A bill to designate the United States courthouse located at \n300 North Hogan Street, Jacksonville, Florida, as the ``John Milton \nBryan Simpson United States Courthouse''; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a bill \ndesignating a Jacksonville courthouse as the John Milton Bryan Simpson \nUnited States Courthouse.\n  John Milton Bryan Simpson was born in Kissimmee, FL, in 1903. He was \nnominated to the Southern District Court of Florida by President Truman \nin 1950 and to the Federal court of appeals by President Johnson in \n1966.\n  Designating this courthouse after the late Judge Simpson is a fitting \ntribute to a man whose judicial decisions were instrumental in \ndesegregating public facilities in Jacksonville, Orlando, and Daytona \nBeach.\n  It is important that we remember not only his name but also his \nlegacy of courage during that period of our history.\n  I hope that other members of the Senate will join me in honoring \nJudge Simpson, a man who was not only a hero to the state of Florida, \nbut a national hero.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Burns, Mr. Johnson, \n        Mr. Roberts, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Allard, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Smith, \n        Mr. Hagel, and Mr. Brownback):\n  S. 802. A bill to establish a National Drought Council within the \nDepartment of Agriculture, to improve national drought preparedness, \nmitigation, and response efforts, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. DOMENICI1. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce The National \nDrought Preparedness Act of 2005. First off, I would like to thank \nSenator Baucus. As the lead cosponsor, his strong leadership and hard \nwork on this bill has been a tremendous help.\n  Drought is a unique emergency situation; it creeps in unlike other \nabrupt weather disasters. Without a national drought policy we \nconstantly live not knowing what the next year will bring. \nUnfortunately, when we find ourselves facing a drought, towns often \nscramble to drill new water wells, fires often sweep across bone dry \nforests and farmers and ranchers are forced to watch their way of life \nblow away with the dust.\n  We must be vigilant and prepare ourselves for quick action when the \nnext drought cycle begins. Better planning on our part could limit some \nof the damage felt by drought. I submit that this bill is the exact \ntool needed for facilitating better planning.\n  This Act establishes a National Drought Council within the Department \nof Agriculture to improve national drought preparedness, mitigation and \nresponse efforts. The National Drought Council will formulate \nstrategies to alleviate the effects of drought by fostering a greater \nunderstanding of what triggers wide-spread drought conditions. By \neducating the public in water conservation and proper land stewardship, \nwe can ensure a better preparedness when future drought plagues our \ncountry.\n  The impacts of drought are also very costly. According to NOAA, there \nhave been 12 different drought events since 1980 that resulted in \ndamages and costs exceeding $1 billion each. In 2000, severe drought in \nthe South-Central and Southeastern states caused losses to agriculture \nand related industries of over $4 billion. Western wildfires that year \ntotaled over $2 billion in damages. The Eastern drought in 1999 led to \n$1 billion in losses. These are just a few of the statistics.\n  While drought affects the economic and environmental well being of \nthe entire nation, the United States has lacked a cohesive strategy for \ndealing with serious drought emergencies. As many of you know, the \nimpact of drought emerges gradually rather than suddenly as is the case \nwith other natural disasters.\n  I am pleased to be following through on what I started in 1997. The \nbill that we are introducing today is the next step in implementing a \nnational, cohesive drought policy. The bill recognizes that drought is \na recurring phenomenon that causes serious economic and environmental \nloss and that a national drought policy is needed to ensure an \nintegrated, coordinated strategy.\n  The National Drought Preparedness Act of 2005 does the following: It \ncreates national policy for drought. This will hopefully move the \ncountry away from the costly, ad hoc, response-oriented approach to \ndrought, and move us toward a pro-active, preparedness approach. The \nnew national policy would provide the tools and focus, similar to the \nStafford Act, for Federal, State, tribal and local governments to \naddress the diverse impacts and costs caused by drought.\n  The Bill would improve delivery of federal drought programs. This \nwould ensure improved program delivery, integration and leadership. To \nachieve this intended purpose, the bill establishes the National \nDrought Council, designating USDA as the lead federal agency. The \nCouncil and USDA would provide the coordinating and integrating \nfunction for federal drought programs, much like FEMA provides that \nfunction for other natural disasters under the Stafford Act.\n  The Act will provide new tools for drought preparedness planning. \nBuilding on existing policy and planning processes, the bill would \nassist states, local governments, tribes, and other entities in the \ndevelopment and implementation of drought preparedness plans. The bill \ndoes not mandate state and local planning, but is intended to \nfacilitate plan development and implementation through establishment of \nthe Drought Assistance Fund.\n  The bill would improve forecasting & monitoring by facilitating the \ndevelopment of the National Drought Monitoring Network in order to \nimprove the characterization of current drought conditions and the \nforecasting of future droughts. Ultimately, this would provide a better \nbasis to ``trigger'' federal drought assistance.\n  Finally, the bill would authorize the USDA to provide reimbursement \nto states for reasonable staging and pre-positioning costs when there \nis a threat of a wildfire.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 802\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S3676]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of bipartisan \nNational Drought Preparedness Act of 2005. For the last 5 years a \ndevastating drought has forced many families across South Dakota and \nthe United States to make difficult life-changing decisions about their \nfuture in agriculture. Many of our Nation's hard-working producers have \nhad to abandon their farms, and the family farm life has been \nthreatened for too many people.\n  I was hopeful that the drought measures I have helped pass in the \nlast 5 years would assist producers in weathering the current drought. \nWith my support, the Senate, and ultimately Congress, agreed to \nlegislation providing either or agriculture disaster assistance \npackages for 2001-2002 and 2003-2004. While this assistance is greatly \nappreciated by those suffering from this natural disaster, I am \nconcerned for our future prospects for drought aid. Given the \nPresident's reluctance to fund crucial USDA farm bill programs in his \nproposed fiscal year 2006 budget, his insistence on cannibalizing $3 \nbillion from the Conservation Security Program, CSP to fund the 2003-\n2004 package, which should in fact be recognized as an uncapped \nentitlement provision, and a historically high budgetary deficit, I am \nconcerned at our prospects of securing substantive monies for future \ndisasters. I will continue to work with my Senate colleagues to ensure \nadequate dollars for South Dakota, but we must examine more \ncomprehensive measures for addressing drought.\n  That National Drought Preparedness Act will help us better prepare \nfor future droughts and reduce the need for large ad hoc disaster \nprograms that may cannibalize funds from other agricultural programs. I \nam fully prepared to support special disaster assistance when it is \nnecessary, but with this act made law, producers, tribes, States, and \nFederal agencies will be much better prepared for future droughts.\n  This act will do several things that will significantly increase our \nability to deal with drought conditions. The bill establishes, in the \noffice of the Secretary of Agriculture, a National Drought Council to \noversee the development of a national drought policy action plan. This \nplan will be the blueprint for dealing with and preparing for drought. \nThe Federal government has plans for dealing with floods and \nhurricanes, and we need the same kind of plan for the slow, dry \ndisaster that is drought. This bill recognizes drought as the natural \ndisaster it is.\n  The act also creates the National Office of Drought Preparedness. \nThis would be the permanent body that assists the National Drought \nCouncil in the formulation and carrying out of the national drought \npolicy action plan.\n  A drought assistance fund will be established by this act, to assist \nState and local governments in their development and implementation of \ndrought preparedness plans. The act will also provide assistance for \nthe rapid response to wildfires, which is critical to mitigating the \neffects of a prolonged drought in forested areas, like we have in \nwestern South Dakota.\n  Lastly, the act provides for the development of a national drought \nforecasting and monitoring network, that will help forecast the onset \nof droughts better and improve reporting on current droughts.\n\n[[Page S3680]]\n\n  I am encouraged by what the National Drought Preparedness Act of 2005 \nhas to offer to the farmers and ranchers of our great country. We must \ntreat drought like all other disasters are treated, and take an \naggressive stance toward minimizing its effect on communities across \nAmerica. That is why I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of this \nimportant bipartisan piece of legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COLEMAN (for himself and Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 803. A bill to amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act \nof 1974, the Public Health Service Act, and the Internal Revenue Code \nof 1986 to provide parity with respect to substance abuse treatment \nbenefits under group health plans and health insurance coverage; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Help Expand \nAccess to Recovery and Treatment (HEART) Act of 2005 with my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Clinton of New York.\n  By passing this life-saving legislation, Congress would provide \nequitable access to substance abuse treatment services for 23 million \nadults and children who need treatment for the disease of alcoholism \nand other drug dependencies.\n  HEART would put the decision of whether or not consumers are granted \nsubstance abuse treatment services in the hands of doctors and trained \naddiction professionals, and patients. At least 75 percent of \nindividuals who suffer from alcoholism have access to private health \ninsurance.

A bill to amend the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of \n1976 to provide owners of non-Federal lands with a reliable method of \nreceiving compensation for damages resulting from the spread of \nwildfire from nearby forested National Forest System lands or Bureau of \nLand Management lands, when those forested Federal lands are not \nmaintained in the forest health status known as condition class 1; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Enhanced \nSafety from Wildfire Act of 2005. I am joined by my colleagues Mr. \nCrapo and Mr. Smith.\n  The legislation we are introducing would amend the Federal Land \nPolicy and Management Act of 1976 to make it possible for non-federal \nland owners to receive compensation for a loss of property as a result \nof wildfire spreading from Federal land that has not been managed as \nCondition Class 1.\n  As we all know, in recent years, there has been a significant amount \nof injury and loss of property resulting from the spread of wildfire \nfrom Federal forested lands to non-Federal lands. Recent wildfires on \nfederal forested lands have shown that lands managed under approved \nforest health management practices are less susceptible to wildfire, or \nare subjected to less severe wildfire, than similarly forested lands \nthat are not actively managed.\n  There is a continuing and growing threat to the safety of \ncommunities, individuals, homes and other property, and timber on non-\nFederal lands that adjoin Federal forested lands because of the \nunnatural accumulation of forest fuels on these Federal lands and the \nlack of active Federal management of these lands.\n  The use of approved forest health management practices to create \nforest fire ``buffer zones'' between forested Federal lands and \nadjacent non-Federal lands would reduce the occurrence of wildfires on \nforested federal lands or, at least, limit their spread to non-Federal \nlands and the severity of the resulting damage.\n  This legislation requires the agencies to manage a ``buffer zone'' on \nFederal land, greater than 6,400 acres, that is adjacent to non-Federal \nland. When forested Federal lands adjacent to non-Federal lands are not \nadequately managed with a ``buffer zone'' and wildfire occurs, the \nlegislation states the owners of the non-Federal lands are eligible for \ncompensation for damages resulting from the spread of wildfire to their \nlands. The legislation sets minimum criteria for non-Federal land to be \neligible for compensation.\n  Our federal land management agencies need to take responsibility for \nthe impacts that occur on non-Federal land as a result of a lack of \nmanagement on federal land. As a society, we have come to expect that \nour neighbors take responsibility for their actions and I feel the \nfederal land management agencies should not escape this responsibility \neither.\n  In the next few weeks, the weather will heat up, the drought ridden \nWest will become drier, wildfire danger will rise, and I fear we will \nonce again hear reports regarding the loss of property.\n  I know this legislation may not be the answer to solving our Federal \nland management problems and I am willing to discuss other options, but \nI know that until we address the heart of this issue, homes, private \nland, and communities will continue to be at risk because of poor \nFederal land management. Being a good neighbor means being responsible \nfor your actions.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 808. A bill to encourage energy conservation through bicycling; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I rise today to introduce the Conserve \nby Bike Act to promote energy conservation and improve public health. I \nam pleased to be joined by my colleague from Maine, Senator Susan \nCollins, in introducing this measure. This legislation addresses one \npart of our Nation's energy challenges. Although there is no single \nsolution to solve our energy problems, I believe that every possible \napproach must be considered.\n  Our Nation would realize several benefits from the increased use of \nbicycle transportation, including lessened dependence on foreign oil \nand prevention of harmful air emissions. Currently, less than one trip \nin one hundred, .88 percent, is by bicycle. If we can increase cycling \nuse to one and a half trips per hundred, which is less than one bike \ntrip every two weeks for the average person, we will save more than 462 \nmillion gallons of gasoline in a year, worth more than $721 million. \nThat is the equivalent of one full day per year in which the U.S. will \nnot need to import any foreign oil.\n  In addition to fostering greater energy security, this bill will help \nmitigate air quality challenges, which can be harmful to public health \nand the environment. Unlike automotive transportation, bicycling is \nemission-free.\n  The Conserve by Bike Act encourages bicycling through two key \ncomponents: a pilot program and a research project. The Conserve by \nBike Pilot Program established by this legislation would be implemented \nby the U.S. Department of Transportation. The Department would fund up \nto ten pilot projects throughout the country that would utilize \neducation and marketing tools to encourage people to convert some of \ntheir car trips to bike trips. Each of these pilot projects must: (1) \ndocument project results and energy conserved; (2) facilitate \npartnerships among stakeholders in two or more of the following fields: \ntransportation, law enforcement, education, public health,\n\n[[Page S3684]]\n\nand the environment; (3) maximize current bicycle facility investments; \n(4) demonstrate methods that can be replicated in other locations; and \n(5) produce ongoing programs that are sustained by local resources.\n  This legislation also directs the Transportation Research Board of \nthe National Academy of Sciences to conduct a research project on \nconverting car trips to bike trips. The study will consider: (1) what \ncar trips Americans can reasonably be expected to make by bike, given \nsuch factors as weather, land use, and traffic patterns, carrying \ncapacity of bicycles, and bicycle infrastructure; (2) what energy \nsavings would result, or how much energy could be conserved, if these \ntrips were converted from car to bike, (3) the cost-benefit analysis of \nbicycle infrastructure investments; and (4) what factors could \nencourage more car trips to be replaced with bike trips. The study also \nwill identify lessons we can learn from the documented results of the \npilot programs.\n  The Conserve by Bike Program is a small investment that has the \npotential to produce significant returns: greater independence from \nforeign oil and a healthier environment and population. The Conserve by \nBike Act authorizes a total of $6.2 million to carry out the pilot \nprograms and research. A total of $5,150,000 will be used to implement \nthe pilot projects; $300,000 will be used by the Department of \nTransportation to coordinate, publicize, and disseminate the results of \nthe program; and $750,000 will be utilized for the research study.\n  The provisions in this bill enjoy strong, bipartisan support and have \npassed by unanimous consent as an amendment to a previous Senate energy \npackage. The measure is endorsed by the League of American Bicyclists, \nwhich has over 300,000 affiliates, as well as the Association of \nPedestrian and Bicycle Professionals, Rails to Trails Conservancy, \nThunderhead Alliance, Bikes Belong Coalition, Adventure Cycling, \nInternational Mountain Bicycling Association, Chicagoland Bicycle \nFederation, and the League of Illinois Bicyclists.\n  I ask that the text of the legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 808\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague \nfrom Illinois in reintroducing the Conserve by Bike Act to recognize \nand promote bicycling's important impact on energy savings and public \nhealth.\n  With America's dependence on foreign oil, it is vital that we look to \nthe contribution that bike travel can make toward solving our Nation's \nenergy challenges. The legislation we are reintroducing today would \nestablish a Conserve by Bike pilot program that would oversee pilot \nprojects throughout the country designed to conserve energy resources \nby providing education and marketing tools to convert car trips into \nbike trips. Right now, fewer than 1 trip in 100 nationwide is by \nbicycle. If we could increase this statistic to 1\\1/2\\ trips per 100, \nwe could save over 462 million gallons of gasoline per year, worth \nnearly $1 billion.\n  While more bike trips would benefit our energy conservation efforts, \nadditional bicycling activity would also help improve the Nation's \npublic health. According to the U.S. Surgeon General, fewer than one-\nthird of Americans meet Federal recommendations to engage in at least \n30 minutes of moderate physical activity 5 days a week. Even more \ndisturbing is the fact that approximately 300,000 American deaths a \nyear are associated with obesity. By promoting biking, we are working \nto ensure that Americans, young and old, will increase their physical \nactivity.\n  In my home State of Maine, citizen activists have led the way in \nencouraging their fellow Mainers to use bicycling as an alternative \nmode of transportation. Founded in 1992, the Bicycle Coalition of \nMaine, BCM, has grown substantially in its first decade plus of \noperation. In 1996, when BCM hired its current executive director, \nJeffrey Miller, the organization had 200 individual and family \nmemberships. Today, it has over 1,700. For a State of less than 1.3 \nmillion residents--many of them elderly--BCM's broad membership is \nespecially impressive.\n  Over the years, this group has advocated increased bicycle access to \nMaine's roads and bridges, organized the first ``Bike to Work Day'' in \nour State, initiated bicycle safety education in our classrooms--\nteaching more than 60,000 schoolchildren in over 500 Maine schools--and \nproduced ``Share the Road'' public service announcements for television \nstations statewide, among numerous other accomplishments.\n\n  No matter how energetic, committed, and organized BCM and other \nbicycle activists are, however, these groups cannot accomplish their \nmission alone. There is an important role for Government to play in \nencouraging more individuals to make bicycling their alternative mode \nof transportation. In Maine, BCM has built strong, active partnerships \nwith local governments and the State's Department of Transportation. \nThese key relationships have benefitted bicyclists throughout Maine \nand, in doing so, have encouraged more Mainers to ride their bikes on a \nregular basis. Indeed, more than 4 percent of Maine's commuters \ncurrently bike or walk, ranking the State 14th in that category \nnationwide. I believe the Federal Government needs to become more \nengaged in encouraging bicycling as a means of alternative \ntransportation, and the Conserve by Bike Act would contribute to the \nworthy goal of convincing more Americans to travel by bicycle.\n  The Senate is already on record in support of this bill. In the \nprevious\n\n[[Page S3685]]\n\nCongress, during consideration of the Energy bill, identical \nlegislation was accepted by voice vote as an amendment. I urge my \ncolleagues to maintain their support for the Conserve by Bike Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mr. Corzine, and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 809. A bill to establish certain duties for pharmacies when \npharmacists employed by the pharmacies refuse to fill valid \nprescriptions for drugs or devices on the basis of personal beliefs, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Access to \nLegal Pharmaceuticals Act (ALPhA). I want to thank Senators Corzine and \nBoxer for cosponsoring this important piece of legislation.\n  This bill is simple. It ensures timely access to contraception and is \ncrucial to protecting a woman's health and autonomy, and to keeping \npharmacists and politicians out of personal, private matters.\n  This bill would protect an individual's access to legal contraception \nby requiring that if a pharmacist has a personal objection to filling a \nlegal prescription for a drug or device, the pharmacy would be required \nto ensure that the prescription is filled by another pharmacist \nemployed by the pharmacy who does not have a personal objection.\n  I came to the Senate 22 years ago. We've made a lot of progress, in \nwomen's health and women's rights since then. But today it seems like \nwe're fighting to keep from sliding backward in some areas.\n  An individual's fundamental right of access to birth control is being \nattacked. Reports of some pharmacists refusing to fill prescriptions \nhave been documented in twelve states.\n  The women that were denied were young and old; married and single; \nwith children and without. Even women who were using birth control for \nother medical reasons aside from preventing conception have been denied \naccess to the birth control pill.\n  If you told me 10 years ago that a woman's right to use contraception \nwould be in jeopardy, I probably wouldn't have believed it. Today I \nhave to believe it--because it's happening.\n  In Texas last year, a pharmacist refused to fill a legal prescription \nfor the ``morning after'' contraceptive for a woman who had been raped. \nFirst she was assaulted and violated--then her rights were violated by \na self-righteous pharmacist who didn't want to do his job.\n  In Milwaukee, a married woman in her mid-40s with four children got a \nprescription from her doctor for a morning-after pill. A pharmacist \nrefused to do his job. He wouldn't fill the prescription.\n  A handful of pharmacists are saying they have a ``right'' to ignore \nprescriptions written by medical doctors.\n  Well, they do have a right. They have a right to get a new job if \nthey don't want to fill legal prescriptions.\n  But nobody has a right to come between any person and their doctor. \nNot the government . . . not an insurance company . . . and not a \npharmacist.\n  The American Pharmaceutical Association has adopted an ``Oath of \nPharmacists.'' The last part of the oath states: I take these vows \nvoluntarily with the full realization of the responsibility with which \nI am entrusted by the public.\n  People trust pharmacists to fill the prescriptions that are written \nby their doctors. If pharmacists are allowed to pick and choose which \nprescriptions get filled, everyone's health will be at risk. Today they \nmight not fill prescriptions for birth control pills. Tomorrow it could \nbe painkillers for a cancer patient. Next year it could be medicine \nthat prolongs the life of a person with AIDS or some other terminal \ndisease.\n  I'm going to fight to protect all Americans against this radical \nassault on our rights.\n  I'm proud to introduce a bill that will require pharmacists to do one \nsimple thing: their job.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 809\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Access to Legal \n     Pharmaceuticals Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) An individual's right to religious belief and worship \n     is a protected, fundamental right in the United States.\n       (2) An individual's right to access legal contraception is \n     a protected, fundamental right in the United States.\n       (3) An individual's right to religious belief and worship \n     cannot impede an individual's access to legal prescriptions, \n     including contraception.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Res. 12. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States authorizing Congress to prohibit the \nphysical desecration of the flag of the United States; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it is with a sense of honor that my friend \nand colleague, Senator Feinstein, and I rise to introduce a bipartisan \nconstitutional amendment that would allow Congress to prohibit the \nphysical desecration of the American flag.\n  I am proud and privileged to be working again with my California \ncolleague on this important proposal. Among our principal cosponsors \nare our colleagues Senator Thune and Senator Talent. It is heartening \nto us to see some of the Senate's newest Members come to this issue \nwith the same passion that its original supporters still feel.\n  This amendment is truly bipartisan. Today, we count 51 original \ncosponsors of this resolution. And, nearly two-thirds of the Members of \nthis body have indicated their support. Those numbers seem to grow with \neach passing year.\n  No doubt, some will still argue that this amendment is unnecessary. \nFortunately, that refrain is gradually losing its punch.\n  When this amendment eventually passes the Senate, as I believe that \nit will, our victory will not be attributed to the passions of the \nmoment. Rather, it will be due to the tireless efforts of citizens \ncommitted to convincing their elected representatives that this \namendment matters.\n  I have heard from some Utahans who love our country's flag but are \nopposed to amending the Constitution. To them I would say, amending the \nConstitution should never be taken lightly. Yet after serious study of \nthe issue, I have concluded there is no other way to guarantee that our \nflag is protected, as I will discuss in a few minutes.\n  And, indeed, guaranteeing the physical integrity of the flag is a \ncause worth fighting for. The American people seem to understand what \nthe opponents of this amendment fail to grasp. This amendment is a \nnecessary statement that citizens still have some control over the \ndestiny of this Nation and in maintaining the traditions and symbols \nthat have helped to bind us together in all our diversity for over 200 \nyears.\n  Those who oppose protecting the flag through a constitutional \namendment are probably not aware of our constitutional history. Indeed, \nfor most of America's history, our Nation's laws guaranteed the \nphysical integrity of the American flag.\n  These were laws no one questioned. No one every questioned that the \nsimple act of providing legal protection for the flag, a unique symbol \nof our ties as a Nation, could somehow violate the Constitution.\n  We should take a moment and recall what we were taught about the flag \nas schoolchildren. Our flag's 13 stripes show our origins. We started \nas 13 separate colonies that first became separate States and then one \nNation through the Declaration of Independence and the American \nRevolution. The 50 stars on the field of blue represent what we have \nbecome: a Nation unified. And over the past 230 years, we have become \never more united in our commitment to the extension of liberty and \nequality.\n  Among all of our differences, differences frequently reflected in \nthis body, we do remain one Nation undivided and indivisible, and our \nflag is a simple but profound statement of that union. That is why we \nopen the Senate each day by pledging our allegiance to the flag. It is \na reminder of all that we have in common.\n  Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens understood the significance \nof the flag's status when he wrote:\n\n       A country's flag is a symbol of more than nationhood and \n     national unity. It also signifies the ideas that characterize \n     the society that has chosen that emblem as well as the \n     special history that has animated the growth and power of \n     those ideas . . . So it is with the American flag. It is more \n     than a proud symbol of the courage, the determination, and \n     the gifts of a nation that transformed 13 fledgling colonies \n     into a world power. It is a symbol of freedom, of equal \n     opportunity, of religious tolerance, and of goodwill for \n     other peoples who share our aspirations.\n\n  There is a certain wisdom to Justice Stevens' statement that our \nconstituents immediately grasp. Some polls show that over 80 percent of \nthe American people support an amendment to protect the flag.\n  Its unique character is represented in the diversity of the groups \nthat have worked over the years to bring this amendment to fruition. \nVeterans, police, African Americans, Polish Americans, farmers, and so \nmany more diverse groups see in the flag a symbol of our Nation; they \nunderstand that it is perfectly consistent with our constitutional \ntraditions for us to protect it.\n  Unfortunately, in 1989 the Supreme Court intervened and ovrrode every \nState law barring desecration of the American flag.\n  None of these States has restricted first amendment political speech \nin any way.\n  Their laws did not lead us down some slippery slope that would result \nin restraints on political opinions.\n  These States drew reasonable distinctions between political speech \nand inflammatory and frequently violent acts.\n  Yet in Texas v. Johnson, the Supreme Court held that a Texas statute, \nand others like it, that barred desecration of the American flag, \nviolated core first amendment principles. That certainly would have \nbeen news to those who wrote the Constitution and our Bill of Rights.\n  It was news, bad news, to the American people as well.\n  So in response to this imprudent decision, the Senate acted quickly \nand passed The Flag Protection Act. It became law on October 28, 1989.\n  Then, in 1990, the Court struck down even this legislation in United \nStates v. Eichman.\n  And that is why a constitutional amendment has become necessary.\n  With due respect to our courts, and to my colleagues who continue to \nsupport these decisions, these legal arguments against flag protection \njust do not hold water.\n  Detractors of our amendment contend that the first amendment \nguarantees the right to burn the American flag. It does no such thing.\n  They contend it would carve out an exception to the first amendment \nas some say. It would not. Rather, it would reaffirm what was \nunderstood not only by those who ratified the Constitution but also by \ncitizens of today: that the first amendment never guaranteed such \nexpressive conduct. Whether one is an originalist or whether one \nbelieves in a living Constitution, this argument falls short.\n\n[[Page S3687]]\n\n  The American people have long distinguished between the first \namendment's guarantee of an individual's right to speak his or her mind \nand the repulsive expression of desecrating the flag. For many years, \nthe people's elected representatives in Congress and 49 State \nlegislatures passed statutes prohibiting physical desecration of the \nflag, and our political speech thrived. It was just as robust as it is \ntoday.\n  Yet in 1989, the Supreme Court's novel interpretation of the first \namendment concluded that the people, their elected legislators, and the \ncourts are no longer capable of making these reasonable distinctions, \ndistinctions that we frequently make in this body such as when we \nprohibit speeches or demonstrations of any kind, even in the silent \ndisplay of signs or banners, in the public galleries.\n  The American people created the Constitution, and they reserved to \nthemselves the right to amend the Constitution when they saw fit. Is it \nwrong to give the American people the opportunity to review whether the \nSupreme Court got it right in this case? I think not.\n  The fact is, a Senator does not take an oath to support and defend \nthe holdings of the Supreme Court. We take an oath to support the \nConstitution. And, it is entirely appropriate that when we think the \nCourt gets it wrong, we correct it through proper constitutional \ndevices, devices set out in the Constitution itself . . . Though it has \nbeen forgotten over the years, this is hardly a radical idea. It was \none supported by the founders of both the Republican and Democratic \nparties, Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln.\n  As some in this body have noted, our courts are now frequently \nattempting to identify a national consensus to justify contemporary \ninterpretations of our constitutional guarantees. The progress of this \namendment to protect the flag demonstrates to me at least just how such \na consensus is supposed to develop. Through argument, through give and \ntake, through debate--over time the American people, as reflected in \nthe actions of their representatives, have become more sure than ever \nthat they should have the opportunity to protect their flag through \nmoderate and reasonable legislation.\n  After September 11, citizens proudly flew the flag, defying the \nterrorist challenge to our core values of liberty and equality, and \nconfirming its unique status as a symbol of our nation's strength and \npurpose. In the struggle that has followed, our flag stands as a \nreminder of the many personal sacrifices made to protect and strengthen \nour nation.\n  And so, to protect this symbol, I am today introducing this \namendment.\n  I thank my colleagues, Senators Feinstein, Thune, and Talent for \ntheir work on this. I urge those who are not cosponsors of this \namendment to keep an open mind as we debate this resolution.\n  It is my hope that the Judiciary committee will move the resolution \nto the floor.\n  And, in turn, I ask that our leadership ensure this resolution gets a \nvote on the floor.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today, it is my distinct honor and \nprivilege to rise and speak on behalf of Senator Hatch, Senator \nFeinstein, Senator Talent, myself, and 47 other senators, as we \nintroduce bipartisan legislation we believe to be long overdue. It is \nnot reform legislation. It does not authorize new government programs, \ncreate new sources of tax revenue, or provide incentives to stimulate \nour economy. It is none of those things, but it is a matter of great \nimportance. The events of 9/11 have reminded us all of that. It is, \ninstead, legislation that speaks to the core of our beliefs and hopes \nas a Nation, and as a people. It is about a national treasure and a \nsymbol of our country that the vast majority of Americans--and the \nmajority of this great body, I might add--believe is worth special \nstatus and worthy of protection. It is about the American flag.\n  Our American flag is more than mere cloth and ink. It is a symbol of \nthe liberty and freedom that we enjoy today thanks to the immeasurable \nsacrifices of generations of Americans who came before us.\n  It represents the fiber and strength of our values and it has been \nsanctified by the blood of those who died defending it.\n  I rise today to call upon all members of this body to support a \nconstitutional amendment that would give Congress the power to prohibit \nthe physical desecration of the American flag. It would simply \nauthorize, but not require, Congress to pass a law protecting the \nAmerican flag.\n  This amendment does not affect anyone's right to express their \npolitical beliefs.\n  It would only allow Congress to prevent our flag from being used as a \nprop, to be desecrated in some ways simply not appropriate to even \nmention in these halls.\n  This resolution and similar legislation have been the subject of \ndebate before this body before. There is, in fact, a quite lengthy \nlegislative history regarding efforts to protect the American flag from \ndesecration. In 1989, the Supreme Court declared essentially that \nburning the American flag is ``free speech.'' That is a decision the \nAmerican people should make, particularly when this country finds \nitself fighting for democracy and expending American lives for that \ncause, on battlefields overseas.\n  South Dakota veterans and members of the armed forces from my State \nknow exactly what I'm talking about, as I'm sure they do from every \nstate represented in the Senate. In recent months, units of the 147th \nfield artillery and 153rd engineer battalions of the South Dakota \nNational Guard returned home after spending a difficult year in Iraq. \nLikewise, the 452nd ordinance company of the United States Army Reserve \nis preparing to depart for Iraq in September.\n  My father, like many other veterans of World War II, understands the \nimportance of taking this step. Veterans from across South Dakota have \nasked me to step up and defend the flag of this great Nation and today \nI am answering that call.\n  Today, members of both political parties will introduce a proposed \nconstitutional amendment that would give back to the American people \nthe power to prevent the desecration of the American flag. We know the \ngravity of this legislation. There is nothing complex about this \namendment, nor are there any hidden consequences. This amendment \nprovides Congress with the power to outlaw desecration of the American \nflag, a right that is widely recognized by Madison, Jefferson, and \nSupreme Court Justice Hugo Black, one of the foremost advocates of \nfirst amendment freedoms.\n  Most states officially advocate Congress passing legislation to \nprotect the flag. Frankly, I do not see this as a first amendment \nissue.\n  It is an attempt to restore the traditional protections to the symbol \ncherished so dearly by our Government and the people of the United \nStates. Some acts are not accepted as ``free speech'' even in societies \nlike ours where we consider free speech a cherished right. For example, \nan attempt to burn down this Capitol building as a political statement \nwould never be viewed as someone's right of free speech. Our laws would \nnot tolerate the causing of harm to other's property or life as an act \nof ``free speech.'' This flag happens to be the property of the \nAmerican people, in my opinion, and this question should be put before \nthe States and their people to decide how and if to protect it. I think \nthe answer will come back as a resounding ``yes''.\n  There is little doubt that the debate over state ratification will \ntrigger a tremendous discussion over our values, beliefs and whether we \nwill ultimately bestow a lasting honor on our traditions. Importantly, \nit will be an indication of how we recognize our servicemen and women \nwho are sacrificing--right now--in Iraq and Afghanistan, to protect \nthose traditions and values for us. Will we honor them, and all the \nveterans who served and died in wars for this country and our flag over \nthe last 200 years? That's not a question which a court should hold the \nfinal answer.\n  I believe the time has finally come. I believe our country wants this \ndebate. The majority of this Senate, I believe, wants this amendment. \nWe begin it here, and we begin it now. Let the debate begin.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to voice my \nsupport for the flag amendment.\n  The flag of the United States of America is a symbol of freedom. The \nflag of the United States of America\n\n[[Page S3688]]\n\nhas been sanctified by the blood of thousands of U.S. soldiers who have \nfought across the world, and it must be protected from desecration. \nThis proposed constitutional amendment would overturn the 1989 U.S. \nSupreme Court's 5-4 ruling which held that laws banning desecration of \nthe U.S. flag were unconstitutional infringements on free speech and \ntherefore a violation of the first amendment.\n  I am proud of the first amendment right to free speech and will \nalways ensure all Americans maintain that right. I am also proud of the \nAmerican flag and the values behind it. The American flag flies over \nthis great country as a symbol of liberty and patriotism. Desecration \nof the flag would be destruction of the core principles on which this \ngreat Nation was founded. I will continue to be an advocate on behalf \nof the American flag and the values the flag represents.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this measure and join me in \nensuring the everlasting integrity of the American flag.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/14/senate-section/article/S3688-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3688-S3689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 107--COMMENDING ANNICE M.

Mr. President, today I am submitting a Senate resolution \nto commend Chief Judge Annice M. Wagner of the District of Columbia \nCourt of Appeals for more than 32 years of public service. As the \nChairman of the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs, which has oversight jurisdiction of the District of Columbia \ncourts, I believe that it is important to recognize the contributions \nof Chief Judge Wagner who will be retiring this year. As chief judge of \nthe D.C. Court of Appeals, she has worked closely with the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs on various issues related to \nthe D.C. courts and the justice system in the District.\n  Chief Judge Wagner entered Federal Government service in 1973 as the \nfirst woman to be appointed General Counsel of the National Capital \nHousing Authority, then a Federal agency. Subsequently, she served as \nPeople's Counsel for the District of Columbia, an office created by \nCongress to represent the interests of utility consumers before the \nDistrict of Columbia Public Service Commission and the District of \nColumbia Court of Appeals.\n  Chief Judge Wagner was twice confirmed by the Senate. First, in 1977, \nwhen she was nominated by President Jimmy Carter to serve as an \nAssociate Judge of the Superior Court for the District of Columbia and \nagain when she was nominated by President George H. W. Bush, in 1990, \nto serve as an Associate Judge of the D.C. Court of Appeals. She was \nlater appointed, in 1994, to serve as chief judge. During her 28 years \nof service in the D.C. courts, she served in every division of the D.C. \nSuperior Court, and served for two years as presiding judge of the \nProbate and Tax divisions. She also served on various commissions and \ncommittees, including serving as chairperson of the Committee on \nSelection and Tenure of Hearing Commissioners, Chair of the Joint \nCommittee on Judicial Administration in the District of Columbia, and \nas a member of the Superior Court Rules Committee and the Sentencing \nGuidelines Commission.\n\n[[Page S3689]]\n\n  Chief Judge Wagner has also demonstrated a commitment to improving \naccess to justice. To this end, she served as chairperson of the \nCourt's Advisory Committee on Probate and Fiduciary Rules and was \nlargely responsible for the implementation of new rules intended to \nstreamline and clarify procedures regarding the affairs of missing, \nprotected, and incapacitated individuals. She also served as \nchairperson of the Task Force on Gender Bias in the Courts, which \nconducted a comprehensive study of bias in the courts and, under her \nleadership, the District of Columbia courts established the Standing \nCommittee on Fairness and Access to the Courts to ensure racial, \ngender, and ethnic fairness.\n  More recently, under her leadership, the Court of Appeals, along with \nthe District of Columbia Bar, the District of Columbia Bar Foundation, \nand the District of Columbia Consortium of Legal Service Providers, \nestablished the D.C. Access to Justice Commission, a commission that \nwill propose ways to make lawyers and access to justice more available \nfor poor individuals in the District of Columbia.\n  Chief Judge Wagner's work at the D.C. courts also extends beyond \nlegal issues. As the space needs of the District of Columbia courts \ncontinued to grow beyond their current building, Chief Judge Wagner led \nthe effort to examine solutions to resolve the courts continued space \nproblems. Her efforts led the D.C. courts to plan and initiate the \nrenovation of the Old Courthouse/City Hall in Judiciary Square, a \nNational Historic Landmark, for the future use by the D.C. Court of \nAppeals. In addition, as Congress enacted new legislative mandates on \nthe courts which further increased their space needs, under her \nleadership, the District of Columbia courts initiated the master \nplanning process for the renovation and use of all court properties in \nJudiciary Square. This effort will result not only in the improvement \nof court operations, but is expected to lead to the revitalization of \nthe Judiciary Square area in the Nation's Capital.\n  Chief Judge Wagner's service also extends beyond the boundaries of \nthe District. She has served as President of the Conference of Chief \nJustices, an organization of chief justices and chief judges of the \nhighest court of each of the fifty states, the District of Columbia, \nand the territories, as chairperson of the Board of Directors of the \nNational Center for State Courts, and as one of eleven members of the \nAmerican Bar Association's Section on Dispute Resolution's Drafting \nCommittee on the Uniform Mediation Act which collaborated with the \nNational Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in \npromulgating the Uniform Mediation Act, which, in 2001, was approved \nand recommended for enactment in all the States, to foster prompt, \neconomical, and amicable resolution of disputes through mediation \nprocesses which promote public confidence and uniformity across state \nlines.\n  Chief Judge Wagner's dedication and service to the District of \nColumbia and to the judicial system are highly commendable and warrant \nour recognition.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/14/senate-section/article/S3689-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3689-S3690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 108--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT PUBLIC \nSERVANTS SHOULD BE COMMENDED FOR THEIR DEDICATION AND CONTINUED SERVICE \nTO THE NATION DURING PUBLIC SERVICE RECOGNITION WEEK, MAY 2 THROUGH 8, \n                                  2005\n\n  Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Voinovich, Ms. Collins, Mr. Lieberman, \nMr. Coleman, Mr. Levin, Mr. Coburn, and Mr. Carper) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs:\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S3689, April 14, 2005, under ``SENATE RESOLUTION 108'', \nthe resolution was referred to the following committee: to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  \n  The online version has been corrected to read: to the Committee \non Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n\n                              S.

As the ranking member of the Senate Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight of \nGovernment Management, the Federal Workforce, and the District of \nColumbia, I am pleased to submit a resolution honoring these employees \nand celebrating Public Service Recognition Week. I am delighted to be \njoined by the leadership of the Senate Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, Senators Voinovich, Collins, Lieberman, \nColeman, Levin, Coburn, and Carper.\n  The 21st anniversary of Public Service Recognition Week, which takes \nplace the week of May 2, 2005, showcases the talented individuals who \nserve their country as Federal, State and local government employees, \nboth civilian and military. From Hawaii to Maine, throughout the \nNation, and around the world, public employees use the week to educate \ntheir fellow citizens on Government services make life better for all \nof us and the exciting challenges of a career in public service.\n  Public servants are teachers, members of the Armed Forces, civilian \ndefense workers, postal employees, food\n\n[[Page S3690]]\n\ninspectors, law enforcement officers, firemen, social workers, crossing \nguards, and road engineers. They deliver essential Government services; \ndefend our freedom; go above and beyond the call of duty to notify the \npublic of Government waste, fraud, abuse; and respond with \nprofessionalism and honor during emergencies. They deserve our respect \nand gratitude for their dedication and service to this country.\n  As the conflict in Iraq continues, as well as the global war on \nterrorism, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the brave men \nand women who have given their lives for their country. Over 1,500 \nAmericans have lost their lives in defense of freedom since the \nbeginning of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Members of the Federal civilian \nworkforce work side-by-side with members of the Armed Services and are \ncrucial to our Nation's defense, security, and general welfare. Like \nthose who came before them and those who are yet to come, our military \nand civilian support staff show courage in the face of adversity and \ndeserve our admiration and respect.\n  Public Service Recognition Week provides an opportunity to honor and \ncelebrate the commitment of individuals who serve the needs of the \nNation as Government and municipal employees. It is also a time to call \non a new generation of Americans to consider public service. Through \njob fairs, special exhibits, and agency sponsored education programs, \nPublic Service Recognition Week provides an opportunity for individuals \nto gain a deeper understanding of the exciting and challenging work in \nthe Federal Government.\n  I encourage my colleagues to recognize Federal employees in their \nStates, as well as State and local government employees, and to let \nthem know how much their work is appreciated. I invite my colleagues to \njoin in the annual celebration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/14/senate-section/article/S3690-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 109--COMMENDING THE UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA SOONERS \n  MEN'S GYMNASTICS TEAM FOR WINNING THE NATIONAL COLLEGIATE ATHLETIC \n          ASSOCIATION DIVISION I MEN'S GYMNASTICS CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n  Mr. INHOFE (for himself and Mr. Coburn) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

In 2004, multiple hurricanes in rapid \n     succession decimated the people and natural barriers of \n     Florida, the southeast Atlantic seaboard, and most of the \n     Gulf south. These annual extremes of mother nature make \n     critical the need to reinvest in the natural barriers of the \n     United States.\n       (b) It is the sense of Congress that the head of the United \n     States Geological Survey should study the role of natural \n     barriers in the coastal areas of the United States to assess \n     the vulnerabilities of such areas to extreme conditions, the \n     possible effects such conditions could have on coastal \n     populations, and the means, mechanisms, and feasibility of \n     restoring already deteriorated natural barriers along the \n     coast lines of the United States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 413.

The region most affected by HIV/AIDS \n     is sub-Sahara Africa, where an estimated 12,300,000 millions \n     orphans of HIV/AIDS live.\n       (3) To survive and thrive, children need to be raised in a \n     family that is prepared to provide for their physical and \n     emotional well being.\n       (4) The institutionalization of a child, especially during \n     the first few years of life, has been proven to inhibit the \n     physical and emotional development of the child.\n       (5) Large numbers of orphans present dire challenges to the \n     economic and social structures of affected countries, and \n     such countries that ignore such challenges at their peril.\n       (b) It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the United States Agency for International Development \n     should develop and fund a comprehensive, long-term agenda for \n     reducing the number of orphans;\n       (2) the strategy under paragraph (1) should include \n     policies and programs designed to prevent abandonment, reduce \n     the transmission of HIV/AIDS to parents and their children, \n     and connect orphaned children with permanent families through \n     adoption; and\n       (3) humanitarian assistance programs funded with amounts \n     appropriated in this Act should be required to promote the \n     permanent placement of orphaned children, rather than long-\n     term foster care or institutionalization, as the best means \n     of caring for such children.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 420.

Mr. REID proposed an amendment to the bill H.R. 1268, making \nemergency supplemental appropriations for the fiscal year ending \nSeptember 30, 2005, to establish and rapidly implement regulations for \nState driver's license and identification document security standards, \nto prevent terrorists from abusing the asylum laws of the United \nStates, to unify terrorism-related grounds for inadmissibility and \nremoval, to ensure expeditious construction of the San Diego border \nfence, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       On page 183, after line 23, add the following new section:\n\n\n            INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS FOR RECONSTRUCTION IN IRAQ\n\n       Sec. 2105. (a) Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States Armed Forces have borne the largest \n     share of the burden for securing and stabilizing Iraq. Since \n     the war's start, more than 500,000 United States military \n     personnel have served in Iraq and, as of the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, more than 130,000 such personnel are \n     stationed in Iraq. Though the Department of Defense has kept \n     statistics related to international troop contributions \n     classified, it is estimated that all of the coalition \n     partners combined have maintained a total force level in Iraq \n     of only 25,000 troops since early 2003.\n       (2) United States taxpayers have borne the vast majority of \n     the financial costs of securing and reconstructing Iraq. \n     Prior to the date of the enactment of this Act, the United \n     States appropriated more than $175,000,000,000 for military \n     and reconstruction efforts in Iraq and, including the funds \n     appropriated in this Act, the amount appropriated for such \n     purposes increases to a total of more than $250,000,000,000.\n       (3) Of such total, Congress appropriated $2,475,000,000 in \n     the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2003 \n     (Public Law 108-11; 117 Stat. 559) (referred to in this \n     section as ``Public Law 108-11'') and $18,439,000,000 in the \n     Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense and for \n     the Reconstruction of Iraq and Afghanistan, 2004 (Public Law \n     108-106; 117 Stat. 1209) (referred to in this section as \n     ``Public Law 108-106'') under the heading ``Iraq relief and \n     reconstruction fund'' for humanitarian assistance and to \n     carry out reconstruction and rehabilitation in Iraq.\n       (4) The Sixth Quarterly Report required by section 2207 of \n     Public Law 108-106 (22 U.S.C. 2151 note), submitted by the \n     Secretary of State in April 2005, stated that $12,038,000,000 \n     of the $18,439,000,000 appropriated by Public Law 108-106 \n     under the heading ``Iraq relief and reconstruction fund'' had \n     been obligated and that only $4,209,000,000, less than 25 \n     percent of the total amount appropriated, had actually been \n     spent.\n       (5) According to such report, the international community \n     pledged more than $13,500,000,000 in foreign assistance to \n     Iraq in the form of grants, loans, credits, and other \n     assistance. While the report did not specify how much of the \n     assistance is intended to be provided as loans, it is \n     estimated that loans constitute as much as 80 percent of \n     contributions pledged by other nations. The report further \n     notes that, as of the date of the enactment of this Act, the \n     international community has contributed only $2,700,000,000 \n     out of the total pledged amount, falling far short of its \n     commitments.\n       (6) Iraq has the second largest endowment of oil in the \n     world and experts believe Iraq has the capacity to generate \n     $30,000,000,000 to $40,000,000,000 per year in revenues from \n     its oil industry.

Res. 109\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I rise today to recognize the University \nof Oklahoma Sooners men's gymnastics team for winning the 2005 NCAA \nDivision I men's gymnastics championship on April 8, 2005 at West \nPoint, NY. This historic achievement is an enormous source of pride for \nthe university that they represent as well as for the people of my \nentire State.\n  This championship achieved by the Sooners, under the outstanding \nleadership of NCAA Coach of the Year Mark Williams, is OU's sixth \noverall national title and their third in the past 4 years. It was \nundoubtedly an accomplishment that they earned and grittily sweated \nout.\n  The Sooners' dramatic victory over second-place Ohio State came down \nto the wire with the competition narrowly being determined by the final \nrotation on the vault. Freshman Jonathan Horton delivered a heroic \nperformance, which secured OU's winning score of 225.675 over the \nBuckeyes' 225.450.\n  The tremendous success of the 2005 Sooners gives support to the \nSports Illustrated cover's designation of Oklahoma as ``America's \nGymnastics Hotbed'' that notably included the International Gymnastics \nHall of Fame, the Bart Conner Gymnastics Academy, Nadia Comaneci, \nShannon Miller, and the world's largest gymnastics magazine, \nInternational Gymnast.\n  In addition to the national championship, the Sooners boasted six \nteam members who attained a total of 13 All-America honors for OU at \nthe individual event finals. The 13 honors of 2005 added to an already \nsubstantial collection of 141 honors garnered by the university over \nthe 39 years of the men's gymnastics program's existence. Moreover, \nsenior David Henderson's 2005 NCAA title on the still rings, gave OU \nits 18th all-time individual national champion, capping off a brilliant \n4 years for this extraordinary young man.\n  The Sooners' victory is a product of the heart, determination, and \nteamwork of these exceptional student athletes, and I extend my heart-\nfelt congratulations to the entire team for a job truly well done and \nwell deserved.\n\n\n                              S. Res. 110\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam. President, I also rise today to extend my \ncongratulations to the Oklahoma State University's wrestling team for \nwinning the 2005 National Collegiate Athletic Association's Division I \nWrestling Championship on March 19, 2005, at St. Louis, MO.\n  The Cowboys' historic victory this year contributes to an already \nexceptional legacy of achievement that makes the OSU wrestling program \na touchstone for all others. In fact, the Collegiate Wrestling Hall of \nFame is at OSU.\n  The 2005 Championship title is the 33rd overall title in the storied \nhistory of wrestling at OSU, and also represents the most possessed by \nany school in the history of Division I wrestling. Moreover, this \nyear's win marks the Cowboys' third consecutive championship under the \ndynasty of Coach John Smith, an accomplishment that had not occurred at \nOSU since the 1954 to 1956 seasons.\n  Indeed, the Cowboys' dominance was in full display not only during \nthe season in which they went undefeated but also in the finals where \nthey continued to remain perfect. The Cowboys swept all five of its \nmatches and clinched the national championship, getting titles from \nSteve Mocco, Zack Esposito, Johny Hendricks, Chris Pendleton, and Jake \nRosholt and tying the record of five championships set by Iowa in 1997. \nIn all, OSU finished with an all-time high of 153 points and far \nsurpassed second-place Michigan by 70 points, which was the second \nhighest winning margin in NCAA wrestling history.\n  Much credit for this amazing achievement undoubtedly goes to coach \nJohn Smith, who was named Big 12 Wrestling Coach of the Year for the \nsixth time in his career. Finally I would be remiss, if I did not \nrecognize the extraordinary effort, commitment, and grit of these \nstudent athletes. They are a tremendous source of pride for their \nuniversity and community, and I offer them my sincere congratulations \nfor all that they have achieved.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolutions be agreed to, the preambles be agreed to, and the motions \nto reconsider be laid upon the table, all en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
