We will try to \nreach an agreement for debate and a time certain for a vote on that \nemergency spending bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/12/senate-section/article/S5687-7", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5687-S5688]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO SENATOR ROBERT C. BYRD\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, today marks an extraordinary--\nextraordinary--milestone in the history of the Senate and in the life \nof one of our most distinguished colleagues.\n  Today, Robert C. Byrd, the senior Senator from West Virginia, becomes \nthe longest serving Senator in the history of the United States.\n  Today, he will have served 17,327 days in office, and outlasted 1,885 \nSenators who have graced this Chamber since 1789. He has cast more \nvotes than any other Senator. And this year, Senator Byrd is running \nfor an unprecedented ninth term.\n  Our distinguished colleague has amassed an astonishing record of \nservice, and it is my privilege and honor to pay tribute to the Dean of \nthe Senate--one of the greatest orators in the grand tradition of this \naugust institution.\n  Senator Byrd won his first election to the Senate back in 1958. \nLyndon Johnson was the majority leader. Dwight Eisenhower was \nPresident. And the Soviets had won the space race with the launch of \nSputnik.\n  Senator Byrd joined the Appropriations Committee and quickly got to \nwork learning the ins and outs of parliamentary procedure.\n  Senator Byrd has been called a walking encyclopedia of Congress. \nIndeed, in his career he has authored a four-volume history of the U.S. \nSenate.\n  In 1971, Senator Byrd was chosen Senate Democratic whip. In 1977, he \nwas elected Democratic leader, a position held for six consecutive \nterms.\n  He led the Senate as majority leader for 6 years, and served as \nminority leader for another 6.\n  Senator Byrd has twice been elected President pro tempore.\n  All told, Robert C. Byrd has held more leadership positions in the \nSenate than any other Senator in history.\n  But even having attained this extraordinary influence, Senator Byrd \nhas never forgotten where he came from or who sent him here.\n  From early on in his career, he demonstrated his deep commitment to \nthe people of West Virginia. His loyalty, closeness, and respect have \nbeen rewarded. Senator Byrd has won overwhelming majorities in each of \nhis reelection campaigns, winning with 78 percent in 2000.\n\n[[Page S5688]]\n\n  He is known across his State for his unflagging support for his \nconstituents and the future and welfare of those people of West \nVirginia. In 2001, he was named by his State ``West Virginian of the \n20th Century.''\n  Today marks a great achievement for the senior Senator, but in some \nways it is also bittersweet.\n  Today, Erma Byrd, the Senator's wife of nearly 7 decades, would have \nturned 89 years old. The Senator has said that his love for Erma was \ngreater than anything in his life. Without her, he could not have \nreached such great heights, nor could he have endured the inevitable \nrough patches of political life.\n  On the occasion of their 65th wedding anniversary, the Senator paid \nan eloquent tribute to his high school sweetheart. His words:\n\n       Erma and I are complete and whole, a total that is more \n     than the sum of its parts. In my life, Erma Byrd is the \n     diamond. She is the priceless treasure, a multifaceted woman \n     of great insight and wisdom, of quiet humor and common sense.\n\n  Senator Byrd has said that, for him, today's achievement will pass \nwith little fanfare or pride. Today, he will do what he has always done \non June 12. He will honor his dear wife Erma, remember her and pray for \nher.\n  So we will celebrate on his behalf and pay honor to them both--\nSenator Byrd for his lifelong service to his country, and Erma for her \nquiet and steady support for the country gentleman from West Virginia.\n  When history is written, I am certain that Senator Byrd will hold a \nprominent place as a Senate legend--and in no small part because of the \nlove of a kind and gentle lady, Erma Ora Byrd.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/12/senate-section/article/S5688-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5688]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

BYRD\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is Monday. The Galleries do not have many \npeople in them. We have a new batch of pages. Others graduated \nrecently. But everyone here--pages and those in the Gallery--should \nrecognize that today is a day of history in America.\n\n       Public service is about personal sacrifice for the greater \n     good. It is about reaching for the better angels of our human \n     nature.\n\n  That quote is a great quote for today, but that quote is from Robert \nByrd, which should come as no surprise because the description fits him \nto a tee.\n  As we have heard from the distinguished majority leader, Senator Byrd \npasses Strom Thurmond, who I had the good fortune to serve with, and \nbecomes the longest serving Senator in American history, with 17,327 \ndays--17,327 days--of service in the Senate.\n  You add that to his 6 years in the House of Representatives, and \nRobert Byrd has served in the Congress 25 percent of the time we have \nbeen a nation. Seventy-five percent of the time other people served in \nthe Congress. But this one man has served 25 percent of the time we \nhave been a country. This gives us some perspective of what a \nsignificant day this actually is. The U.S. Senate first met in New York \nCity in 1789.\n  Robert C. Byrd has served a distinguished career. His career in the \nSenate is significant, important, and impressive. But his life is \nimpressive.\n  America is a place where everyone has a chance. It does not matter \nthat you are an orphan at age 1. It does not matter that you are raised \nwith an aunt and uncle. It does not matter that your new parents work \nvery, very hard in the coal mines of West Virginia. Because, you see, \nin America people can succeed no matter what the status of their \nparents.\n  Robert Byrd is testimony to that. He graduated valedictorian of his \nhigh school class. He went to work in the depths of the Great \nDepression because he had no way of paying to go to college. He worked \nat a number of different jobs. He worked odd jobs wherever he could \nfind them, pumping gas, selling produce, working as a meat cutter, a \nbutcher, and even during World War II doing some welding on ``Liberty'' \nand ``Victory'' ships.\n  After the war, he returned to West Virginia and began his \ndistinguished career of public service.\n  The West Virginia House of Delegates was his first elected position. \nThen he was elected to the West Virginia Senate. Then he was elected to \nthe U.S. House of Representatives in the early 1950s. In 1958, he was \nelected to the U.S. Senate.\n  His career of leadership is unsurpassed and will always be \nunsurpassed. He has been a mentor to me for all these many years and a \nleader for whom all of us in this body have the highest respect.\n  But as we have already heard, for all of his accolades--and there \nhave been many--Senator Byrd himself will tell you his greatest success \ntruly came on a late day in May, 1937, when he put on his best suit, \ntraveled to the nearby town of Sophia, WV, and married his high school \nsweetheart, Erma. Today is her birthday.\n  Now, I had the good fortune to travel, on a couple of occasions, with \nErma Byrd and the Senator. We had work to do around the world. What a \nwonderful, wonderful woman. She was kind, thoughtful, and quiet, but \nwith a great presence about her. I remember having the honor, really--\nand it was that--of Senator Byrd asking me to go to West Virginia. We \nhad a parliamentary exchange with the British Parliament.\n  I had heard this song, ``West Virginia Hills,'' but it never meant \nanything to me until that occasion in a mesa in West Virginia where we \ngathered with those British parliamentarians for an evening event to \nlisten to some bluegrass music, to watch the Sun go down in those West \nVirginia hills. That is something I will always remember of Robert Byrd \nand his lovely wife Erma.\n  There has been no greater advocate in the almost 18,000 days this man \nhas served in the Senate, and the more than 18,000 days he has served \nin the Congress, no greater advocate for the State of West Virginia \nthan Senator Robert Byrd.\n  He has fought to improve access to education and health care. The \nthings he has done for transportation in West Virginia are legend. He \nhas brought jobs there. He has done things to protect pensioners.\n  We just passed on May 24 an example of what Senator Byrd does for \nWest Virginia. The Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of \n2006 was passed on May 24. President Bush will sign this into law. \nAgain, it is important legislation for miners across the country. It \nmeans a lot to me. I have spoken to Senator Byrd about miners. My \nfather was a miner. And I am proud of the work Senator Byrd has done \nfor West Virginia because it helps all miners.\n  I asked, as I was coming here, my long-serving personal assistant \nJanice Shelton: What do you want me to say about Senator Byrd? She has \nworked with me all the time I have been in the Senate.\n  She said: No Senator comes and talks to the country like Senator \nByrd.\n  The Fourth of July you prepare your own speech; you read your own \nspeech about the Fourth of July. Thanksgiving, if we are here, you give \na speech on Thanksgiving. Christmas, Mother's Day, wonderful--I can \nstill remember your speeches on Mother's Day. The reason those speeches \nare so important to every one of us--of course, they are important to \nyou; they reflect upon your mother, the woman who raised you--is \nbecause it causes us to reflect on our own mothers. Every time you gave \none of those speeches, I thought of my red-haired mother working so \nhard, taking in wash so that I could have clothes like the other kids. \nSo every speech you give is not only for the people of West Virginia. \nIt is for the country. It is for the people who work here with you.\n  I have had the good fortune--in fact, I visited with one of my \nfriends who I practiced law with for 12 years. A brilliant man, he is \nso smart. He reads books, has from the time he was a boy until now, \nmany books each week. I have always admired Rex Jemison and how smart \nhe is. But Senator Byrd, to those of us who have worked with you, you \nhave no peer.\n  I can remember as if it were yesterday when you decided you were \ngoing to take over the Appropriations Committee and no longer have a \nleadership position. We had an event in the Russell Building, the \ncaucus room. There was no press, Senators, very limited staff. You \nstood and talked to us a little bit. You told us things we thought\n\n[[Page S5689]]\n\nwe always knew, and I have retold this story so many times. I am going \nto retell it again. You told us you could get in your car in Virginia, \ndrive to West Virginia and back--and it takes about 8 hours--reciting \npoetry over and back without stopping and never recite the same poem \ntwice. Think about that. Calculate it for a minute. How many people \nhave read the Encyclopedia Brittanica from cover to cover? Senator \nRobert Byrd. How many people have sat down when we have a break and \nread the dictionary? This man has done this. How many people can recite \npoetry as he did? I have just talked about this. How many people can \nrecite Shakespeare verse after verse, passages out of Scripture?\n  Senator Byrd gave a series of speeches here, 10 speeches, each \nlasting for 1 hour. The subject was the line-item veto was going to \nruin the Senate. The comparison was to the Roman Empire, the rise and \nfall of the Roman Empire. Senator Byrd gave 10 speeches. When I was not \nable to listen personally, I listened to the recording. So tremendous \nwere those speeches that the head of the political science department \nat UNV-LV, Dr. Randy Tuttle, taught a course on Robert Byrd based on \nthese 10 speeches.\n  I asked Senator Byrd: You gave those speeches, you quit right on \ntime, you had an hour set aside. How did you know when to stop?\n  He said: It was easy. I memorized all 10 of them.\n  When we met with the British parliamentarians, as I just recounted, \nin West Virginia, the blue grass music stopped, and Senator Byrd had \nstaff pass out a little tablet and pencil to everybody. He said: If I \nmake a mistake, write it down. And he proceeded to give us a \ndemonstration of memory that I have never seen before, starting with \nthe first ruler in Great Britain, the years the person served, the \nname, how to spell it, and very briefly what was accomplished during \nthat period of time, from the beginning to the present Queen Elizabeth. \nThose parliamentarians were dumbfounded. How could an American do \nsomething they had never even thought about without a note?\n  There are some professors, I am sure, who are experts on ancient \nRome, but I would tell all those academics, they don't have anything on \nthe Senator from West Virginia as far as knowledge of the Roman Empire.\n  I consider myself so fortunate to have been able to serve in the \nSenate with Robert Byrd. And not only serve in the Senate with Robert \nByrd, but all the time I have been here, I had the good fortune of \nserving on his Appropriations Committee.\n  The great Senator Daniel Webster said that ours:\n\n     . . . is a Senate of equals, of men of individual honor and \n     personal character, and of absolute independence. We know no \n     masters, we acknowledge no dictators. This is a hall for \n     mutual consultation and discussion; not an arena for the \n     exhibition of champions.\n\n  The prayer that was uttered today by Reverend Black, our Chaplain, \nsays exactly what Daniel Webster said. That was a wonderful prayer, \ntremendously well done for this occasion. But I would say in response \nto the great Daniel Webster, there are champions among us. There are \ngiants as well. I have served in public office a long time, but no one \ncan dispute the fact, as far as I am concerned, that Robert Byrd is a \ngiant.\n  I want him to know how much I appreciate all he has done for me. I \ncare a great deal about this man. I love Robert Byrd. I love Robert \nByrd. He is a person who sets a standard for all of us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/12/senate-section/article/S5689-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5689-S5701]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Under the previous order, there \nwill be a period for the transaction of morning business until 3 p.m., \nwith each Senator permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to pay \ntribute to our distinguished colleague from West Virginia who, as the \nmajority leader and the Democratic leader pointed out, celebrates today \ntruly a momentous occasion, becoming the longest serving U.S. Senator \nin the history of our country.\n  Senator Byrd's record and achievements have been covered by the \nmajority leader and the Democratic leader. I would like to make a few \ndifferent observations.\n  When Senator Byrd came to this body in 1959, he was a member of a \nvery large Democratic class. His party had had a very good day. It was \nthe second term of President Eisenhower. In his class were such people \nas Eugene McCarthy and Tom Dodd and Phil Hart. Lyndon Baines Johnson \nwas the leader of his party in the Senate at the time. In fact, Senator \nByrd was accompanied to the well on his first day in office not by the \nsenior Senator from his State, as is tradition, but by Majority Leader \nJohnson, his future mentor.\n  Shortly before the distinguished Senator from West Virginia got here, \nMajority Leader Johnson had appointed a committee to pick out the five \ngreatest United States Senators in history. John F. Kennedy was \nappointed to be the head of that committee. After due deliberation, \nthey picked out five Senators: Henry Clay from my State of Kentucky, \nDaniel Webster, John C. Calhoun, Robert La Follette, and Robert Taft. \nThose five Senators, who were designated as the five greatest Senators \nof all time, are depicted out here off the Senate Chamber in the \nwaiting room.\n  Six or 8 years ago, we decided to consider adding two more to the \nlist. I had the opportunity to be on a committee that reviewed the \npossibility of adding two more. We concluded there were two more who \nshould be added, one Democrat and one Republican.\n  Our colleagues on the Democratic side picked Robert Wagner of New \nYork, who was the author of most of President Roosevelt's New Deal \nlegislation. After due deliberation, the Republicans on the committee, \nof which I was one, concluded that Arthur Vandenberg was the \nappropriate selection for us, based upon his willingness in the late \n1940s to make the Truman containment policy, the Marshall plan, and \nother initiatives at the beginning of the Cold War that basically set \nout the strategy that we followed until the Berlin Wall came down in \n1989. We thought that Arthur Vandenberg would be the appropriate one \nfor us. So two more Senators were added--Arthur Vandenberg and Robert \nWagner.\n  Today I think it is safe to predict that some day in the future, some \nSenate will decide to revisit the issue of what other great Senators \nmight be added to this pantheon off the Senate floor that now includes \nseven United States Senators in our history. I think I can confidently \npredict that near the top of the list, if not at the top of the list, \nsome day down the road will be the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. President, today, June 12, 2006, is our good friend from West \nVirginia's 17,327th day in the Senate, making him the longest-serving \nSenator ever.\n  Senator Robert C. Byrd's first day as a Senator was January 3, 1959, \nwhen he was 41 years old. He is the 1,579th Senator. Some of his \ncontemporaries were John Sherman Cooper, Hubert Humphrey, Everett \nDirksen, John F. Kennedy, and Richard Russell.\n  Over his nearly 50 years of service here--he has been elected to \neight full terms--Senator Byrd has served with 405 Senators, out of a \ntotal of 1,885 Senators who ever served. That is 21.5 percent of the \ntotal number. Over a fifth of all Senators who ever served can say they \nserved with Senator Byrd.\n  And I add that Senator Byrd is only the second Senator ever to be \nelected to eight full terms.\n  As the Senators from two coal-producing States, Senator Byrd and I \nhave worked together on a number of issues over the years to ensure \nthat coal remains a safe, cheap, and plentiful source of energy, and \nthat coal miners and their families can continue in this industry. \nTogether we ensured that the Capitol complex would continue to be \nheated by coal. And we work together as members of the Appropriations \nCommittee. I thank the Senator for his friendship over the years.\n  As astounding as the Senator from West Virginia's service in this \nbody is, I must point out that he has even more experience representing \nthe people of West Virginia. Senator Byrd served in the West Virginia \nHouse of Delegates from 1947 to 1950, the West Virginia Senate from \n1951 to 1952, and the U.S. House of Representatives from 1953 to 1959. \nHe was elected to his first office in 1946.\n\n[[Page S5690]]\n\n  He was also elected assistant majority whip here in the Senate in \n1965. In 1971, he was elected majority whip. I have heard that can be a \ntough job.\n  In 1977, Senator Byrd succeeded Senator Mike Mansfield as majority \nleader. He has also served as minority leader and Senate President pro \ntempore, meaning he has held every major position in the Senate.\n  After serving as majority and minority leader, Senator Byrd became \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee in 1989, and has been chairman \nor ranking member ever since. Our colleague from Alaska, the current \nSenate President pro tempore, has served with him on that committee \nsince 1973.\n  Senator Byrd set the record for number of Senate votes cast at 12,134 \non April 27, 1990, breaking a record set by Senator William Proxmire. \nHe cast his 17,000th vote in March 2004, and continues to set the \nrecord every time he votes. As of the opening of the Senate today, he \nhas cast 17,666 votes.\n  As his constituents in West Virginia know so well, Senator Byrd is \nthe son of a coal miner. Before government service, he worked as a \nwelder in wartime shipyards and as a meat cutter in a coal company \ntown.\n  Senator Byrd is also an expert on Senate history. He wrote, with the \nassistance of Senate historian Richard Baker, a four-volume collection \nof history, speeches and statistics titled ``The Senate'' 1789-1989. He \nalso wrote a history called ``The Senate of the Roman Republic,'' and a \n2005 autobiography titled ``Child of the Appalachian Coalfields.''\n  And my good friend from West Virginia is an accomplished fiddle \nplayer as well. He has performed on the television variety show ``Hee \nHaw,'' at the Grand Ole Opry, and at the John F. Kennedy Center for the \nPerforming Arts. He even recorded an album called ``Mountain Fiddler.''\n  Senator Byrd earned his law degree from American University in 1963, \nwhile serving in the Senate. He attended night school while doing a \nfull day's work here. President Kennedy presented him with his diploma \nand gave the commencement address.\n  President Kennedy received an honorary degree from American \nUniversity at the ceremony. So he began his commencement address with \nthese words:\n\n       President Anderson, members of the faculty, Board of \n     Trustees, distinguished guests, my old colleague Senator Bob \n     Byrd, who has earned his degree through many years of \n     attending night law school while I am earning mine in the \n     next thirty minutes, ladies and gentlemen . . .\n\n  In 1994, Senator Byrd was awarded his B.A. summa cum laude by \nMarshall University, which he had attended for one semester in 1951. He \nhad earned A's in all his classes, but could not afford to continue. So \nhe actually received his law degree before his bachelor's.\n  Senator Byrd is the first West Virginian in history to win all 55 of \nthat State's counties in a statewide race. I am sure many of his fellow \nWest Virginians know of his knowledge and reverence for the \nConstitution, and that he always carries a copy in his left breast \npocket.\n  Senator Byrd's legacy in this body is felt every day. Martin Gold, \nauthor of ``Senate Procedure and Practice,'' wrote:\n\n       Senator Robert Byrd (D-WV) is a giant in the field of \n     parliamentary history and law. No Senator has had a greater \n     impact on Senate rules and precedents.\n\n  And Michael Barone, in The Almanac of American Politics, said this of\n  Senator Byrd:\n\n       Robert Byrd, the senior member of the United States Senate, \n     may come closer to the kind of senator the Founding Fathers \n     had in mind than any other.\n\n  Now, these comments from scholars are certainly to be respected. But \nI think Senator Byrd said it best at a spirited rally near the end of \none of his recent campaigns for office. Senator Byrd said:\n\n       West Virginia has always had four friends: God Almighty, \n     Sears Roebuck, Carter's Liver Pills and Robert C. Byrd.\n\n  Mr. President, Senator Byrd would be the first to tell us he could \nnot have accomplished all he has without the love of his life, his \npartner, and his best friend--his wife, Erma Ora James Byrd. Erma \npassed away this March, 2 months shy of what would have been their 69th \nwedding anniversary.\n  The daughter of a coal miner, today would have been her 89th \nbirthday. I am sure she is watching down on us from Heaven today as we \nhonor her husband, the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Stories of enduring love are part of the history of any nation. \nRobert and Erma were made for each other, and were together for nearly \n69 years. Mr. President, I believe they are one of our Nation's great \nlove stories.\n  I say to my friend and colleague from West Virginia, no one has had a \ngreater career here. Your service is of great distinction. We all \nadmire you very much, and we are here today to honor you on this most \nimportant occasion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  The President pro tempore.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I join those who honor my great friend, \nour great friend, the Senator from West Virginia. This has been a \ntradition. Each time a Senator has reached the position where he has \nserved longer than anyone else before, we have had tributes such as \nthis. It is my honor to be here with my good friend today.\n  Having known Carl Hayden and Strom Thurmond, both of whom have the \ndistinction that Senator Byrd has had in my lifetime and my service in \nthe Senate, I believe he joins a small but distinguished group of \ndedicated public servants, people who have devoted their lives to \nserving our country.\n  I had the honor of being the whip for 8 years, 4 years in the \nminority and 4 years in the majority. I remember so well what I called \nthe Byrd history lessons. Maybe Senator Byrd didn't call them that, but \neach evening in those days Senator Byrd would come to the floor and \ngive another statement about the history of the Senate. I believe those \nbecame the framework for the volumes he has written on the history of \nthe Senate. I didn't need to read them; I listened to them. As a matter \nof fact, I think I listened to every one the Senator made because the \nthen majority leader, Howard Baker, would say to me: Teddy, it is your \nturn. I would be in the chair listening to Senator Byrd.\n  Winston Churchill once said:\n\n       We make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what \n     we give.\n\n  I don't know anyone in my lifetime that I would say has given so much \nas Senator Byrd.\n  Others have talked about what he did before he came into public life. \nI know he attended college while he was in the West Virginia House of \nDelegates and State Senate and finished law school as a working Member \nof the Senate.\n  He has truly given more than he ever received. But, really, I would \nsay of my friend from West Virginia that I know of no man who has done \nso much to make the Senate a family. When I first came here, that was \none of the first things that Senator Mike Mansfield said to me--that \nyou have to realize you are living in a family. This is a family. \nSenator Byrd has made that his sort of mantra, and to be the person who \nrepresents the family, reminding us that we are part of a family.\n  I remember so well, Senator Byrd, when you made such kind remarks \nabout my wife Ann after she passed away in an aircraft accident. I also \nrecall the days that you congratulated me on getting remarried, and \nthen on the birth of our daughter Lily when, again, Senator Byrd took \nthe floor. I will never forget the time you came to the floor and \ntalked about the fact that my first grandchild had been born. Senator \nByrd told me at that time that I had my first taste of immortality. Now \nthat I have become the grandfather of 11 children, I have touched \nimmortality a little bit more than most people perhaps. I stand in awe \nof the honor of being a grandfather. I will never forget what he said. \nThat means you are going to go one generation beyond the generation you \nhelped bring into the world. You have seen your children produce \nchildren, and that really matches your love for the Senate family.\n  I don't know of anybody here who has had a sorrow or an achievement \nwhen Senator Byrd hasn't taken the time to seek us out and either \ncommiserate with us in our sorrow or tell us what a great achievement \nit was. It is a great achievement to be part of the Senate family and \nto be nurturing our own families.\n  Others have spoken about your dear wife Erma. I know how close the \ntwo of\n\n[[Page S5691]]\n\nyou were. I know that because of conversations we have had about Erma. \nWe were all saddened when she passed away earlier this year, but I know \nshe is looking down on you today, Senator Byrd. I know she is proud of \nyour service and, if she were here, she would be right up there in the \ngallery. But she is up there somewhere looking at all of us.\n  Actually, many of you may not know this, but I met Senator Byrd \nduring the Eisenhower administration. I remember sitting in the gallery \nthe day you were sworn into the Senate in 1959. You were already in the \nHouse. When I got to the Senate, I was talking to the wife of Bob \nBartlett, my predecessor, the Senator's good friend. I was told that \nthe one person in the Senate I could trust would be Bob Byrd. Coming \nfrom her, that meant a great deal to me personally. We have worked \ntogether for 35 years now on the Appropriations Committee. I wish I \ncould count the days when we were chairmen; when Senator Byrd was \nchairman, I would wander over to his room, and when I was chairman, he \nwould come to my room. I remember one day--and he will not like this--\nhe came over and said someone had given him some cigars, and he \nsuggested that we ought to smoke a cigar. I had not smoked a cigar in \n20 years, but I said it would be a good idea. When Senator Byrd makes a \nsuggestion, it is a good idea. I joined him then. About 6 months later, \nI had somebody give me a couple of cigars, and I wandered over to \nSenator Byrd's office and said, ``Let's share a cigar again.'' Senator \nByrd said, ``I have quit.''\n  I was on that trip to London, too, at the British Parliamentary \nConference, and in West Virginia when Senator Byrd was the host. I \ndon't know if you know this, Senator.\n  I have a video of you when we were in London when we sat around, \nthose Members of the American Senate who were there, after meeting with \nour colleagues from Britain, and we talked and you told us about your \nown history. I remember that so well. I remember asking you to recite \nthe poem about your dog. We talk about this prodigious memory of \nSenator Byrd. I have never known anything that I could ask him to \nrecite that he didn't have the ability to recite.\n  Having been here so long together, I come back to where I started. \nYou have kept alive the spirit of family in this Senate. I think \nwithout the spirit of family, we would lose the essence of what it is \nto be here. I tell people that sometimes I sort of pinch myself to \nrealize that I really am a Member of the Senate. Others can talk about \ntheir backgrounds. I don't talk about mine very much, but I certainly \nnever had any reason to believe I would ever be standing here, and I \nthink Senator Byrd could say the same thing.\n  We are here to honor the son of West Virginia, the patriarch of our \nSenate family. He is, as Senator McConnell said, a symbol of our \nhistory. I am here to thank you, Senator, for being a good friend. I \nthink you have been one of the best friends I have had in the Senate, \nand you have really sustained me in times of sorrow and encouraged me \nin times of joy. I am here to honor you for your service; it is a great \nservice. But mostly I am here because I am honored to be able to call \nyou my friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this is truly a unique day in the life of \nthe Senate, with the spotlight shining on Senator Robert Byrd in \nrecognition of an enormous achievement, being the longest serving \nSenator in the history of the body. It is a remarkable achievement.\n  Senator Byrd started his political career with an election in 1946, \n60 years ago, and is still going strong. He served in the Senate at the \nsame time that Harry S. Truman was President of the United States.\n  Just think about that for moment. This is a man whose service has \nspanned the Presidencies of President Truman, President Eisenhower, \nPresident Kennedy, President Johnson, President Nixon, President Ford, \nPresident Carter, President Reagan, President Bush, President Clinton, \nand President Bush. It is quite an accolade. And Senator Byrd \naccurately states that he hasn't served under any President, however, \nhe has served with Presidents. He is a scholar and devotee of the \ndoctrine of separation of powers, something which seems to have been \nforgotten lately. But when the issue arose as to the line-item veto and \nthe constitutional amendment for the balanced budget, Senator Byrd has \nbeen vociferous in defending the prerogatives of the Congress of the \nUnited States. He even goes so far from time to time to remind people \nthat article I of the Constitution is for the Congress. You don't get \nto the executive branch until you get to article II. You don't get to \nthe judicial branch until article III. In many ways the Supreme Court \nhas rewritten the sequence of the Constitution taking primacy. There is \nan effort on the expansion of Executive power, but Senator Byrd is the \nbulwark for separation of powers. To think that he was here when Jack \nKennedy was here, as well as when Lyndon Baines Johnson was here--about \nwhom so much has been written as the master of the Senate. There will \nbe a sequel to that, and it will be about Bob Byrd. Senator Byrd was \nhere when great men like Lyndon Johnson and Jack Kennedy strode these \ncorridors for so many years. It is an enormous slice of history.\n  As a newcomer to the Senate, I watched Senator Byrd very closely. \nThere is a lot to be learned from Senator Byrd. Senator Byrd was \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee when I was one of the younger \nmembers of the Appropriations Committee. One day, I thought Senator \nByrd's allocations didn't match the budget resolution and I told him. \nIt is sort of untoward to disagree with the chairman. I saw a \nmagnanimity in Senator Byrd to listen to one of the younger Senators. I \neven called for a vote. The vote was 26 to 3. People said it was a \ngreat accomplishment to get two other Senators to join me, Alfonse \nD'Amato and Bob Kasten. We only lost 26 to 3, but it was considered a \nvictory, which is a testament to Senator Byrd's power.\n  Senator Byrd said to me on that day: Some day, you will be chairman \nof the Appropriations Committee and you can make the allocations. I \nthought it entirely farfetched at that time that I would ever be \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, but it may happen. I am next \nin line behind Senator Thad Cochran. It will be quite a formidable \nchallenge because Senator Byrd continues to be ranking Democrat on the \ncommittee. To come up against this titan, this legend, he will probably \ndo more to make the allocations if, as, and when I become chairman.\n  Senator Byrd has been a master tactician. I recall one early morning, \nabout 3 a.m., when we Republicans were carrying on a filibuster. I \nbelieve it was on campaign finance reform. Senator Dole gathered us all \ntogether in a remote spot and said: Guys, don't show up on the Senate \nfloor. Make Senator Byrd maintain a quorum.\n  For those who don't know the Senate rules, they are sufficiently \ncomplicated and we would not expect C-SPAN II watchers to know, if \nanybody is watching on C-SPAN II. But you have to have a quorum on the \nfloor to conduct business, or somebody can suggest the absence of a \nquorum, and it just stops. So Senator Byrd had this idea about having \nsome Republicans on the floor. Knowing the rules as he did, he directed \nthe Sergeant at Arms to execute warrants of arrest for absent Senators. \nI have never seen this in my long tenure. Remember that, Senator Byrd?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I do.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Now we have confirmation. I have called a witness here. \nThe Sergeant at Arms was a little fellow, Henry Giugni. He started to \npatrol the halls. He came upon Senator Lowell Weicker. Now, Henry was \nabout 5-foot-4, and Lowell Weicker was 6-foot-4. Lowell was at his \nfighting weight of about 240 at the time. It was about 3:30 in the \nmorning. Do you know what happens with Senators at 3:30 in the morning? \nI won't say on the Senate floor. The Sergeant at Arms decided not to \narrest Lowell Weicker. He made a very wise judgment. Instead, he went \nknocking on Senate doors. Senator Robert Packwood made the mistake of \nanswering the door. Senator Packwood compelled them to carry him out of \nhis office. He agreed to walk here, but he insisted on being carried \ninto the Senate Chamber. I don't think Senator Byrd got his quorum, but \nhe got his man, Senator Packwood.\n  I once had the temerity to engage Senator Byrd in a debate. I have\n\n[[Page S5692]]\n\nwatched Senator Byrd very closely when he would control the floor with \nthe parliamentary maneuver of getting unanimous consent before yielding \nthe floor, which gave him the right to the floor.\n  I had read the rule book, and Senator Byrd contended that he could do \nthat without unanimous consent if there had been no objection. I \nthought I had watched him with the rules to the contrary and engage him \nin a lengthy debate. I did not win that debate, but it was a great \nlearning experience.\n  Senator Byrd commanded the floor with great authority. In the old \ndays, we used to have sessions that went all night. Senator Byrd was \nsitting in that chair, and he rose at about 12:18 a.m.--this is another \ntrue story; you get very few true stories out of Washington. We were \nall enervated. Some of us were even tired, but not Bob Byrd. He rose \nfrom his chair and he said: I ask unanimous consent that I may speak as \nlong as I choose.\n  A Senator in this chair, whom I will not identify, rose as if to \nobject. Senator Byrd looked at him as if his eyes like were laser \nbeams, and the Senator sat down. Past midnight, Senator Byrd had \nunanimous consent to speak as long as he chose. It wasn't too long, but \nit was a great display of fortitude and authority.\n  My final comment about Senator Byrd is about the debates we have had \non constitutional law. His scholarship on the institution is \nunparalleled, and that is a record which will never be broken. It is \npretty hard to say ``never,'' but when one looks at the volumes of his \nwork, when one looks at the magnitude of his speeches--he used to speak \nevery Friday afternoon for as long as he liked. He spoke to an empty \nChamber, but he spoke to a full history book.\n  Senator Byrd once said to me that if he became President, he would \nmake me his Attorney General. May the Record show that Senator Byrd is \nnodding in the affirmative, and Senator Byrd, if you become President, \nI expect you to live up to that promise.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate my good friend, \nSenator Robert Byrd, on becoming the longest serving Senator in the \nhistory of our great Nation. Senator Byrd has now served as Senator for \n17,327 days. That is almost as long as I have been alive. I fully \nexpect to continue serving with him for many more days.\n  I know that during those 17,000-plus days in the Senate, Senator Byrd \nhas inspired many. I also know that as we continue to witness his \nservice in the days ahead in the Senate, he will continue to provide \ninspiration to this body and to all of my colleagues and to me. I am \nsure that in those days, just as he has in the past, Senator Byrd will \ncontinue to implore our colleagues to respect the wisdom of the \nFounders and the brilliance of our Constitution, which he so proudly \ncarries as a symbol on his lapel every day, and during those days in \nthe future, he will continue to remind us all in the Senate of how much \nwe can and should learn from the history of our great country and the \nexperience of this democracy.\n  He will continue, as he always has, fighting for the hard-working \npeople of his beloved West Virginia, and he will, as he always has, \ncontinue to provide generous counsel to those of us who have far less \nexperience than he does, for Senator Byrd truly has been and continues \nto be a mentor to all of us, and always, with his grace and with his \ndignity, setting an example for all Senators to act with that dignity, \nwith that courtesy, and with that eloquence which is truly a legacy of \nRobert Byrd in the Senate. For me, as the No. 99 Senator and as one of \nthe most junior in this body today, I am personally inspired and \ngrateful to Senator Byrd for his achievements and for his example.\n  Just as my family has given me strength in my life, I know Senator \nByrd's remarkable service would not have been possible without the love \nand support of his own family. I have often been moved by Senator \nByrd's words about the power of the love and the bond he and his late \nwife Erma shared for decades. So as we honor Senator Byrd today, as we \nhonor this institution, we also honor the memory of Erma, and we honor \nthe rest of Senator Byrd's family as well.\n  It is a great privilege for me to represent the people of Colorado in \nthis great Chamber. It is also a true honor to be a colleague to a \nhistoric figure in the name of Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia.\n  Once again, I congratulate him.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues who came to \nthe floor earlier today to mark a historic milestone. It isn't just a \nmilestone for one man, it is a milestone for our Senate and our Nation.\n  Today our colleague, Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, who just left \nthe Chamber, becomes the longest serving Senator in the history of the \nUnited States of America. Today marks Senator Byrd's 17,327th day in \noffice; that is 47 years, 5 months, 1 week, and 2 days spent in service \nin the Senate on behalf of his beloved people of the State of West \nVirginia.\n  Many of us know Senator Byrd's impressive official biography. He has \nheld more leadership positions in the Senate than any other Senator in \nour history, including 6 years as Senate majority leader, 6 years as \nminority leader, twice Senator Byrd has served as chairman of the \nSenate Appropriations Committee, and twice he has been elected by his \ncolleagues as President pro tempore, a position that places him third \nin line to the Presidency of the United States.\n  In many ways, Senator Byrd's life is the story of the 20th century of \nAmerica. He started from the most humble origins and has risen to the \ngreatest heights, and he has done this not on the backs of others but \nby the sweat of his brow and the power of his massive intellect.\n  To me, one of the most impressive facts about Senator Byrd is that he \nstudied for his law degree while he was serving as a Member of \nCongress. He would make law by day and study it at night. True to form, \nSenator Byrd not only earned his doctorate of jurisprudence from \nAmerican University in 1963, it was awarded cum laude.\n  Senator Byrd may also be one of the last great orators in the U.S. \nSenate, and whether the topic is the war in Iraq or the Peloponnesian \nWar, the basic ingredients of a great speech are always present in \nSenator Byrd's address: clear, substantive thinking and the rhetorical \nskills to effectively express it.\n  For Senator Byrd, noble purposes are foremost as his motive and \nobjective. He doesn't take the easy road, and he doesn't pander. When \nPresident Bill Clinton signed the line-item veto into law in 1996, it \nwas immediately challenged in court by a group of six Senators, the \nfirst of whom, of course, was Senator Robert C. Byrd. Senator Byrd, \nthough loyal to his party and loyal to his President, was loyal first \nto his view of the Constitution. He believed the law was \nunconstitutional and concentrated too much power in the executive \nbranch of Government. Ultimately, the Supreme Court agreed with Senator \nByrd and disagreed with the Congress and the President who enacted the \nlaw.\n  Almost 10 years later, Senator Byrd took to the floor of the Senate, \nspeaking out and facing the wrath of popular sentiment in opposing the \ninvasion of Iraq. At the time, it wasn't easy for him to vote no, nor \nwas it a comfortable decision to defend at home, but Senator Byrd \ndidn't shrink from the challenge--he never has--and he did something \nwhich has become quite rare in American politics: He stood up and led. \nHe said that of all the thousands of votes he has cast--more than \n17,000 to be exact--that vote opposing the war in Iraq is the one in \nwhich he takes the greatest pride.\n  I might add just parenthetically, I share that sentiment. In this \ncase, too, I believe ultimately history will prove all of us right who \nvoted no on the use of force in Iraq.\n  Senator Byrd has an unquenchable willingness to serve, a willingness \nto lead and carry the burdens and responsibilities of leadership. Above \nall else,\n\n[[Page S5693]]\n\nhe has done these things while continuing to be a truly honorable man. \nWhen all is said and done, the most important words that will be spoken \nabout Robert C. Byrd will not be that he was a great speaker or great \nstatesman or great U.S. Senator--he is certainly all of that--the true \nmeasure of this man will not be found in recounting the number of days \nhe has served in this body; rather, it will be found in his strength of \ncharacter and in his integrity.\n  That character and integrity are evidenced in so many ways: his love \nof his beloved late wife Erma. He was such a devoted husband and \npartner. Even as she suffered serious illness in the last years and \nmonths of her life, he never left her side. To his children and \ngrandchildren, he remains a loving father, a caring grandfather, and a \nwise teacher. To his friends, he is a man whose word can always be \ncounted on. To his country, he is a leader who found power only in the \ncommitment to service. And to his State, he is a shining example of the \nvery best that is in all of us.\n  I am honored to be counted as one of those who call Robert C. Byrd a \nfriend, and I know this about my friend: Today he marks a milestone \nthat no other Senator in the history of the United States has marked, \nbut his success will be measured in terms of his faithfulness to the \npeople who placed him here and the trust of the people of West \nVirginia. They have never been betrayed by this great man.\n  Although he has risen to the highest levels of power, he has never \nforgotten where he comes from, who sent him, and what his mission is.\n  If my colleagues will allow me two personal observations about \nSenator Byrd and to tell two stories that I think really are symbols of \nhis view of the world and the great power of his intellect. One of the \nfirst involved a debate on the floor of the U.S. Senate about the \nNational Endowment for the Arts. It occurred a few years ago. A Senator \non the other side of the aisle offered an amendment to eliminate the \nNational Endowment for the Arts with the argument that there were art \ndisplays or exhibits that were being funded with Federal dollars that \nwere embarrassing. This Senator went on to argue that it really made no \nsense for us to subsidize the arts in America because they were out of \nthe reach of the common man and we should allow the patrons of the \narts, those private benefactors, to take care and not our Government.\n  I came to the floor to argue against that position, telling the story \nof how my immigrant mother used to take me in the car across the bridge \nto the art museum in St. Louis, this woman with an eighth grade \neducation, to show me works of art and talk about artists she knew very \nlittle about but wanted to learn more about. As I was telling my story, \nI saw Senator Byrd come on to the floor, and I assumed he was coming to \ntalk about some other issue, but he asked for recognition. He stood \nhere at his desk, as he has so many times, and completely enthralled \nthis Chamber as he told the story of his simple life in West Virginia \nwhere he was orphaned and raised by other members of the family and how \none fine day, his new stepfather took him out and bought him a fiddle. \nWith that fiddle, he started taking music lessons and developed a \npassion for music. He talked about what music and the arts meant to him \ngrowing up as a poor boy in a small town in West Virginia. It was a \nclassic Robert C. Byrd moment, taking a chapter in his life from many \nyears ago and bringing it to application today.\n  The second experience I recall is one that I have told over and over \nto friends in Illinois. If I hadn't been there to see it, I would not \nhave believed it. It goes back to the days when I was a Member of the \nHouse of Representatives on the Appropriations Committee. Senator Byrd, \na leader in the Senate, had a Transportation appropriations bill that \npassed the Senate that had several noteworthy projects for his State of \nWest Virginia. A Republican Senator across the Rotunda took exception \nto these earmarks for the State of West Virginia and vowed that when he \ncame to conference between the Senate and the House, he would take out \nthese projects for the State of West Virginia. They were excessive, in \nhis view. He was interviewed by several news media, including The \nWashington Post.\n  The day of the great confrontation took place just a couple floors--\none floor below us in the appropriations conference room. It is a long \nroom with a huge table. The Senate conferees sit on one side of the \ntable. Senator Mark Hatfield was then chairman of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, of which Senator Byrd was a member, and I sat \non the other side of the table with House Appropriations Committee \nmembers, waiting for this classic, historic confrontation between \nSenator Robert C. Byrd and his critic from the House of \nRepresentatives. It was interesting because as we all sat down, there \nwas one chair that was left empty. Directly across the table from his \nHouse critic was the empty chair Senator Byrd would occupy. The moment \ncame when finally the House member was recognized, and he stood up and \nwith a lengthy speech took exception to the fact that Senator Byrd was \nputting these projects in for the State of West Virginia. When he \nfinished and had exhausted himself--no one interrupted him--and sat \ndown, Senator Byrd asked for recognition in this appropriations \nconference room.\n  I am going to get a few of these facts wrong because I didn't write \nthem down. Senator Byrd would never get them wrong. But I trust that at \nthe end of the story, you will understand what happened that day.\n  Senator Byrd reflected for a moment, as he often does, looking to the \nceiling, and then he spoke. He said: In 1830, Daniel Webster wrote his \nfamous letter to Mr. Hayne. And then he paused, and Senator Byrd said: \nIf my memory serves me, it was January that he wrote the letter. \nJanuary the 28th, Senator Byrd said. And if I am not mistaken, he said, \nit was a Thursday. And he went on to explain how Webster wrote the \nletter to Hayne explaining the basics of our Constitution, explaining \nthat in the House of Representatives, a State as small as West Virginia \ndoesn't stand a chance with a limited population and very little \npolitical power to get things done; the State of West Virginia has to \nrely on the Senate, where every State has two Senators. And if he, \nRobert C. Byrd, didn't stand up for his small State of West Virginia in \nthe Senate, who would? What chance would a small State have?\n  It was the classic argument that really was the foundation for the \ncreation of Congress. Senator Byrd that day won the argument, won his \ncase before the conference committee.\n  I thought at the time, years before I was elected to the Senate, I \nwish I had a videotape of that moment. That was one of those great \nmoments which I have seen here in the Congress. So when I came to the \nSenate a few years later, I went up to Senator Byrd and I said to him: \nI will never forget that day when you had the debate in the \nappropriations conference committee about the projects for West \nVirginia and how you not only recalled the exchange between Daniel \nWebster and Mr. Hayne and the historical and constitutional \nsignificance, you not only recalled the year and the day, but you \nrecalled the day of the week it occurred. I said: When you said, ``I \nbelieve it was a Thursday,'' I was just absolutely amazed. Senator Byrd \nreflected for a moment, and he said: Well, I believe it was a Thursday. \nI said: I am not questioning you; no, I am not questioning you; I am \njust telling you that I thought that detail brought more to that debate \nthan anyone could imagine.\n  So as luck would have it, 2 hours later, we had a vote on the floor \nhere, and Senator Byrd at this desk called me over. I came over to his \ndesk, and he said: Senator Durbin, I was almost certain it was a \nThursday, and I asked my staff to pull out a perpetual calendar, and if \nyou will look here, January 28, 1820, was, in fact, a Thursday. I said: \nI never doubted you for a moment.\n  I have heard him stand on the floor reciting poetry at length. I have \nheard him recount the debates of this Senate and the history of this \nNation in the type of detail that puts all the rest of us to shame. He \nis truly not just an institution of West Virginia, not just an \ninstitution of the Senate; he is a national treasure. He brings to \ndebate in this Chamber--what little debate we have anymore--a certain \ngravity, a certain importance that reminds us\n\n[[Page S5694]]\n\nwhy we are here, that we have been fortunate enough to be called by the \npeople who vote in our States to be one of the few men and women to \nserve in this great Chamber, and in serving, we not only represent \nthem, we represent a long line of history, of great men and women who \nhave had this opportunity to serve in the U.S. Senate.\n  Today, of course, is recognition of his special place in the history \nof our Nation and in the history of the Senate: 17,327 days in office--\n47 years, 5 months, 1 week, and 2 days--not only witnessing the parade \nof history but being such a major part of it.\n  Senator Byrd, I salute you and your service to the people of West \nVirginia and this Nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have been very much looking forward to \nthis moment.\n  First, I ask unanimous consent that an article which appeared in the \nCharleston Gazette on June 12, 2006, be printed in the Record following \nmy remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this article embraces the comments of many \ndear friends of the Senator, and I say with some humility, a few of my \nown comments as well.\n  I think back to reminisce on the 28 years that I have been privileged \nto have represented the Commonwealth of Virginia in this Chamber.\n  There is no single individual for whom I have greater reverence or \nrespect than my dear friend, the senior Senator from West Virginia. We \nwere bonded together early on. When I arrived here, he sought me out, \nand I sought him out because our two great States at one time, were one \nState, the State of Virginia. But now, even though we are two States, \nour states have so many issues in common.\n  How many times Senator Byrd and I have come to this floor with regard \nto the subject of the coal miners, their safety, their ability to \noperate and provide that essential component to America's energy needs, \ncoal; how dangerous is the profession, how much we respect their \nfamilies and other ones who share the risk that the miners take every \nday.\n  Then, more specifically, I remember so well how we have worked \ntogether all of these many years in support of clean-coal-burning \ntechnology.\n  Coal is the largest single reserve of energy that this Nation \npossesses--the largest, far beyond petroleum, far beyond natural gas, \nfar beyond the other renewables, and so forth. Coal is there. Our \nresearch and industrial base works year after year to try to see how we \ncan consume these vast coal reserves and thereby become less and less \ndependent on importing our energy needs, but burning it in such a way \nthat it does the least possible harm to the environment, be it the air \nwe breathe or the problems associated with acid rain, and so forth.\n  I commend my dear friend for all the work that he has done and will \ncontinue to do for years on clean coal technology.\n  Virginia and West Virginia also share a common border that is \nbasically established by the Appalachian Mountains. This part of \nVirginia and West Virginia has its own magnificent qualities, \nparticularly the sturdy lifestyle of the people who choose purposefully \nto live in those hills and valleys and those mountains which are so \noften ravaged by heavy floods and so often ravaged by other natural \ndisasters, such as snowstorms.\n  Senator Byrd and I many times have gone to visit those regions in the \naftermath of a natural disaster. We find no desire on the part of those \npeople to leave those regions, only to remain.\n  Senator Byrd was instrumental in passing legislation which provides \nrecognition for those geographic areas of the Appalachian range that \nare deserving of financial assistance and other forms of assistance \nbecause of the rigorous, challenging lifestyle in these regions. He has \nseen that funding has remained these many years equitably allocated \nbetween the several States.\n  I think of him foremost as one who is a family man. How often he has \nreminisced about the members of his family. He speaks with a great \nsense of pride and humility on how his family, much like every Member \nof this Senate, is closely involved in the life of the Senate, closely \ninvolved because of the commitments the families make: the many long \nhours Senators are required to either be in the Chamber or traveling \nthroughout their States, traveling throughout the 50 States, or, \nindeed, around the world. It is a challenge for the families, and Bob \nByrd is a family man, along with his beloved wife Erma.\n  I remember so well early on in my career, I had the privilege to be \ninvited by Senator Byrd, to join him on a number of codels to various \nparts of the world. We served together on the Senate Committee on Armed \nServices these many years. So often we would visit the troops and \nothers throughout the world.\n  One trip I remember ever so vividly, he took the first congressional \ncodel to the then-Soviet Union to visit with Gorbachev, who had risen \nto a powerful position in the Soviet Union after a lot of strife and \nturmoil. That man exhibited extraordinary courage. I so looked forward \nto our important visit, as did every member of that codel--I think \nthere were about a dozen of us who joined Senator Byrd to go over to \nthe Soviet Union.\n  Senator Strom Thurmond, whose record Senator Byrd, with a sense of \nhumility, passes today, was on that codel. And as we flew to the Soviet \nUnion, I had the privilege--and maybe with one or two others--of \nworking with Bob Byrd on remarks he wanted to make. That was an \nimportant set of remarks. Strom Thurmond represented the Republican \nside of that delegation. We were basically equally divided. I remember \nworking through that statement well into the wee hours of the night as \nthat plane was traversing that long distance.\n  The following day, Gorbachev announced he was going to allocate an \nhour and a half time to meet this delegation. The time was carefully \nallocated by Senator Byrd and Senator Thurmond to members of the \ndelegation.\n  I recall that I was the junior man on that delegation. When he got to \nme, I had 2 minutes. I was proud to get 2 minutes. Our dear colleague \nand friend, the retiring Senator this year, Senator Sarbanes, senior, \nof course, to me at that time, turned to me and said: I will give you \nmy 3 minutes so you can have 5 minutes because you are on that \nCommittee on Armed Services, and there is nothing more important to be \ncovered today than the issues relating to national defense. I will \nnever forget that act of courtesy by Senator Sarbanes.\n  Senator Byrd delivered his remarks flawlessly. Gorbachev listened \nvery carefully. Gorbachev made a few notes on a pad. He was followed, \nthen, by Strom Thurmond, who delivered one of his thunderous, heartfelt \nremarks, beginning with how he stormed the shore on D-Day and how the \nSoviet Army was pressing on Germany from another direction. It was a \nconfluence of primarily those two forces and Great Britain and, of \ncourse, their allies and the free French who brought a conclusion to \nthe war. Gorbachev's father had been in the war. Strom reminisced, \njokingly saying that he hoped he had not hurt his father. I recall \nGorbachev very much was moved by that comment.\n  That was the type of thing for which Senator Byrd was so famous: \nputting together those delegations, going to those places in the world \naround which the axle of history was evolving at that time, or the \nspokes of history around that axle. What a privilege it was to travel \nwith this great man.\n  I think of him as a historian. This Senator does not have the \ntemerity, and I don't know of anyone who would challenge Bob Byrd on \nthe history of this great institution. No man hath greater love for \nthis Senate than Robert Byrd. He has expressed that with a sense of \nhumility many times in speeches in the Senate.\n  When he reaches into his pocket and pulls out a copy of the \nConstitution--he almost knows it by heart--he always opens that little \nbook. He can, as quickly as anyone in this Senate, find those passages \nthat are relevant to the debate at hand or the issues at hand. Those \nare things we remember about him with such great respect.\n  He is a humorist. He can be tough. He can be firm. But, oh, can he \nbring a chuckle about in the hearts of all of us.\n\n[[Page S5695]]\n\nSometimes in this Senate when things hit the high point of stress, I \nhave seen Bob Byrd take to the floor with his very soft voice, dispel \ntension, dispel some of the rancor, and inject a note of humor.\n  Bob Byrd is also, it might surprise Members, an artist. One painting \nhe did many years ago, some of us through the years have been \nprivileged to get a copy of that painting. He has an eye for art. He \nalso has an eye for music. I do recall the times when he played the \nfiddle, the music that he loved and still loves. I think he composed a \nlittle bit on the side from time to time.\n  I can recount so many things where he is far more capable than I. I \nhave never considered myself a poet, but Bob Byrd can recall from \nmemory hundreds of poems and recite them at times when it seems most \nappropriate.\n  He is a family man, historian, humorous, artist, musician, composer, \npoet, and then we think back always to his respect for the Bible, and \nsecond only to the Bible, his respect and love for the United States \nConstitution.\n  I went back and checked a little history. This Chamber honored me the \nother night after I cast my 10,000th vote, a very modest accomplishment \nin the face of Bob Byrd's accomplishment, my 28 years. He has been here \njust short of twice as long.\n  Also, someone thoughtfully said that I was the second longest serving \nSenator from Virginia. Lo and behold, who was the longest serving \nSenator from Virginia? None other than Bob Byrd's close friend of years \npast, Harry F. Byrd, Sr. I repeat, senior, because when I came to the \nSenate, Harry F. Byrd, Jr., was the Member of the Senate with whom I \nwas privileged to serve as his junior Senator. But it is interesting, \nHarry F. Byrd, Sr., was born in Martinsburg, Berkeley County, WV. There \nyou have it. He was the longest serving Senator and remains with that \nrecord at 32 years and 8 months for the Commonwealth of Virginia. Now \nBob Byrd takes it not only for the State but for the whole of the \nhistory of the Senate.\n  There has to be something, I say most respectfully, in the water down \nin West Virginia, or the lifestyle, the hardiness, or the courage of \nthe people that enabled these two distinguished Virginians, Robert C. \nByrd and Harry Flood Byrd, Sr., to become the longest serving in their \nrespective States.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n           [From the Charleston (WV) Gazette, June 12, 2006]\n\n  The Pillar of the Senate: 10 Presidents Later, Byrd Longest-Serving \n                                Senator\n\n                           (By Paul J. Nyden)\n\n       Sen. Robert C. Byrd becomes the longest-serving member of \n     the U.S. Senate today, having represented West Virginians for \n     17,327 days in the chamber.\n       Byrd began serving in the Senate more than 47 years ago, on \n     Jan. 3, 1959, after spending six years in the House of \n     Representatives and six years in the West Virginia \n     Legislature.\n       He also has cast more votes by far than any member of the \n     Senate: 17,662 times, as of last Friday.\n       ``I consider him to be the pillar of the Senate,'' says \n     Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md. ``His commitment to the United \n     States Senate and its history, customs and procedures is \n     equaled only by his commitment to the state of West Virginia, \n     our nation and our Constitution.''\n       Byrd's impact on fellow senators personally rivals his \n     institutional role, some of his colleagues said.\n       ``Senator Byrd has been a very, very important figure in my \n     life,'' said Sen. John Warner, a Virginia Republican. ``He is \n     such a magnificent teacher of the history the Senate.''\n       Warner recalls a conversation he had with Byrd when Warner \n     was new to the Senate. ``He said, `At one time, our states \n     were together. I don't want to put them back together, but I \n     want to work together as full and equal partners,' '' Warner \n     said.\n       ``I enjoy the man, ``Warner said. ``He is wonderful.''\n       Up to now, the Senate's longest-serving member had been the \n     late Strom Thurmond, R-S.C. The third- and fourth-longest-\n     serving members are Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., and Daniel K. \n     Inouye, D-Hawaii, both of whom have been there more than 43 \n     years.\n       ``Byrd epitomizes the role that the framers of our \n     Constittion envisioned for the legislative branch,'' Sarbanes \n     said.\n       In fact, The Almanac of American Politics, a widely \n     consulted volume on federal politics, describes Byrd as the \n     politician who ``may come closer to the kind of senator the \n     Founding Fathers had in mind than any other.''\n       Since President Bush took office, Byrd has been one of the \n     Senate's leading voices on challenging the war in Iraq, \n     preserving Social Security and protecting workers' jobs and \n     safety.\n       Despite his strong positions, however, Byrd said he regrets \n     the increasing animosity in both legislative bodies. He said \n     he has always worked to be bipartisan.\n       ``I thank the people of West Virginia for having repeatedly \n     expressed their faith in me,'' Byrd said. ``I never lose \n     sight of that. Every morning of every day of my life, my \n     first thought is, `What can I do today for West Virginia?' ''\n       Byrd's contribution to the state has been immense, said \n     Gov. Joe Manchin and members of West Virginia's congressional \n     delegation.\n       ``I don't know of a person in West Virginia who has not \n     been touched, or benefited in a most positive way, by Senator \n     Byrd's service,'' Manchin said. ``I mean, Democrats, \n     Republicans, independents and people who don't vote--they all \n     benefit.''\n       Byrd has long been known as a ``legend'' in West Virginia, \n     said Jay Rockefeller, Byrd's junior Democratic colleague for \n     the state. ``But now he has surpassed even the great legends \n     of the Senate to become the longest serving senator in U.S. \n     history.''\n       He can take credit for ``highways, dams, bridges, federal \n     facilities and jobs, health centers and educational \n     institutions,'' Rockefeller said. ``And the best part is, \n     he's not finished.''\n       ``What do you get when you multiply the power of the beacon \n     by the strength of a workhorse by the steadiness of an \n     anchor? Robert C. Byrd,'' said Rep. Nick J. Rahall, D-W.Va.\n       Byrd's ``ability to deliver for our state'' is awe-\n     inspiring, said David Hardesty, the president of West \n     Virginia University. ``His votes are guided by his \n     understanding of the Constitution and by his dedication to \n     the people of this state.``\n       Manchin also emphasized Byrd's future.\n       ``People also need to know that Senator Byrd has a lot of \n     years of service left in him,'' he said. ``When people ask \n     about what he has done, he says, `I want to talk about people \n     who can help me do what we still need to do.' ''\n       Born in Wilkesboro, N.C., in 1917, Byrd grew up in a coal \n     mining family in Sophia, Raleigh County.\n       Nearly 20 years later, he married Erma Ora James, who \n     passed away on March 25 of this year. Today, Mrs. Byrd would \n     have turned 89. \n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is an extraordinary honor to be able \nto speak a few words about my friend, the senior Senator from the State \nof West Virginia, as he makes history yet again.\n  There are precious few opportunities in life to recognize greatness \nin our midst, but today we have that opportunity. We honor our friend \nnot simply because he's become the longest-serving Senator in our \nhistory, but also because there's no doubt that he's earned his \nrightful place besides Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, John Calhoun, and \nother giants in Senate history.\n  Bob Byrd's life is a tribute to the power of the American dream--\nrising from humble beginnings, this son of the Appalachian coal fields \nreached the pinnacle of power and accomplishment through decades of \nhard work and unwavering dedication.\n  His life is also a tribute to the power of love and commitment. Bob \nByrd's commitment and love for the Senate and the country is total and \ncomplete, just as they are for the people of West Virginia and his \nbeloved Erma, with whom he shared one of America's great love stories.\n  Erma and Bob would have celebrated her birthday today--and we're \nsaddened that she could not be here to share this extraordinary moment. \nBut we know she's looking down from heaven with a smile for the young \nboy who once shared his chewing gum with her more than 70 years ago.\n  This is a special day for me as well, because it's a time to tell my \nfriend how much he means to me, and how much I believe his service \nmeans to our Nation.\n  For longer than I've been in public life, I've known Robert C. Byrd. \nI first came to know him during the famed West Virginia Presidential \nprimary of 1960.\n  Bob was a new Senator and moving up through the ranks as a protege of \nSenate Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson. My brother Jack and Bob were \ncolleagues in the Senate, but Jack knew it was inevitable that Bob \nwould be looking out for LBJ in the Mountain State, and hoping to deny \nus the victory we needed.\n  Jack had won the Wisconsin primary, and the stakes were high in West \nVirginia.\n  It was a spirited campaign in which all of us in the Kennedy family \ngot to see the extraordinary qualities of the people of West Virginia--\nkindness, compassion for their fellow citizens, and perseverance even \nin the face of enormous obstacles--the qualities that Bob Byrd knew and \nloved. Jack campaigned extremely well in the state and\n\n[[Page S5696]]\n\ncame love the people too, and he never forgot the boost they gave him \nduring that hard-fought campaign.\n  President Kennedy and Robert C. Byrd formed a powerful partnership, \nand one of Jack's first official acts in office was to authorize the \nshipment of emergency rations to help the people of Appalachia recover \nfrom a disaster.\n  They worked together to create the Appalachian Regional Commission, \nwhich lifted thousands out of poverty, and eliminated many of the \nbarriers that had isolated the region from the economic mainstream of \nthe Nation. They invested in the people, and it worked. President \nKennedy and Senator Robert C. Byrd understood that if you give \nAmericans opportunity and hope, there is no limit to what they can \naccomplish.\n  For me personally, it's impossible to imagine the Senate without \nSenator Byrd. He defeated me for Majority Whip in 1971. We both thought \nwe had the votes lined up to win, and it was Bob who taught me how to \ncount votes as he went on to become an outstanding Whip and later an \noutstanding Majority Leader. My consolation prize was being set free to \nfocus on the legislative issues I care most about.\n  Over the years in the Senate together, we've all come to rely on \nSenator Byrd as the great defender of this institution and the champion \nof the Constitution.\n  He doesn't defend the Constitution simply when it's in fashion to do \nso. He doesn't yield when political convenience suggests that the \nLegislative Branch should demur for the sake of comity or to accomplish \na popular goal.\n  Bob Byrd understands that the founders intended each branch of \ngovernment to have powers that could place them in conflict, and that \nthe powers Congress cedes to the executive today may have dire \nconsequences for the Nation tomorrow.\n  In this role, he is the guardian of the Senate and the ideals that \nWashington, Adams, Jefferson, Madison, and Hamilton fought to enshrine \nwhen they created our government.\n  I have many warm memories of Bob Byrd as leader, as friend, and as \nscholar. One that comes to mind now is our barnstorming trip through \nWest Virginia during the 2004 Presidential campaign.\n  We traveled by bus around the state from Charleston to Mingo and \nLogan counties and wherever we stopped, you could feel the love and \nrespect that the people of West Virginia had for Bob Byrd. At one stop, \nhe even jumped up onto the back of a flatbed truck to deliver a \nstemwinder. I was committed to the campaign as well, but that was a \ntactic I thought best be left to Bob.\n  In the end we came up short in the West Virginia on election day, but \nI'll never forget the fun we had those last few weeks of October, and \nI'm eternally grateful to Bob for inviting me. I'll cherish the memory \nforever.\n  Of all the remarkable attributes of Senator Byrd, few have impressed \nmore than his ability to memorize and recite poetry. As a child, this \nwas always one of my greatest challenges at school and I'm awed by \nBob's extraordinary talent.\n  His mind must hold hundreds of verses that he can recite at a \nmoment's notice. One of my favorites describes the responsibilities we \nhave as public servants to address the causes of the problems that \nconfront us, not just the consequences of those problems.\n  It's about whether it's better to build a fence around the edge of a \ncliff, or keep an ambulance ready in the valley below.\n  I can't recite it from memory like he can, but this is how it goes. \nIt was written by Joseph Malins in 1895:\n\n     Twas a dangerous cliff, as they freely confessed,\n     Though to walk near its crest was so pleasant;\n     But over its terrible edge there had slipped\n     A duke, and full many a peasant.\n\n     The people said something would have to be done,\n     But their projects did not at all tally.\n     Some said ``Put a fence 'round the edge of the cliff,''\n     Some, ``An ambulance down in the valley.''\n\n     The lament of the crowd was profound and was loud,\n     As the tears overflowed with their pity;\n     But the cry for the ambulance carried the day\n     As it spread through the neighbouring city.\n\n     A collection was made, to accumulate aid,\n     And the dwellers in highway and alley\n     Gave dollars or cents--not to furnish a fence--\n     But an ambulance down in the valley.\n\n     ``For the cliff is all right if you're careful,'' they said;\n     ``And if folks ever slip and are dropping,\n     It isn't the slipping that hurts them so much\n     As the shock down below--when they're stopping.''\n\n     So for years (we have heard), as these mishaps\n     occurred Quick forth would the rescuers sally,\n     To pick up the victims who fell from the cliff,\n     With the ambulance down in the valley.\n\n     Said one, to his pleas, ``It's marvel to me\n     That you'd give so much greater attention\n     To repairing results than to curing the cause;\n     You had much better aim at prevention.\n\n     For the mischief, of course, should be stopped at its source;\n     Come, neighbours and friends, let us rally.\n     It is far better sense to rely on a fence\n     Than an ambulance down in the valley.''\n\n     ``He is wrong in his head,'' the majority said;\n     ``He would end all our earnest endeavour.\n     He's a man who would shirk this responsible work,\n     But we will support it forever.\n\n     Aren't we picking up all, just as fast as they fall,\n     And giving them care liberally?\n     A superfluous fence is of no consequence,\n     If the ambulance works in the valley.''\n\n     The story looks queer as we've written it here,\n     But things oft occur that are stranger.\n     More humane, we assert, than to succour the hurt\n     Is the plan of removing the danger.\n\n     The best possible course is to safeguard the source\n     By attending to things rationally.\n     Yes, build up the fence and let us dispense\n     With the ambulance down in the valley.\n\n  That's the principle Bob Byrd has followed throughout his brilliant \ncareer in the Senate. He's a Senator for the ages, and it's an \nextraordinary honor and privilege to know him, to serve with him, and \nto learn from him.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will soon have been here 34 years. \nThat is not very long compared to the man about whom I rise to say a \nfew words. I understand this was the day. I was in my office and, \nhaving heard the eloquence that was spoken today to my good friend, \nSenator Byrd, I figured that I couldn't do him justice just coming down \nat this very moment, as I am. But everybody knows why we speak today \nwhen we attempt to honor him for his devotion to his colleagues, to the \ninstitution, to the Constitution, and to the United States of America.\n  The distinguished Senator knows what each of us thinks of him. He \nknows, better than we each do, what we think of him. He could tell me \nwhat Pete Domenici thinks about Bob Byrd, and probably be close to \nright. And vice versa. He has occasionally spoken about what he thinks \nof me. I don't think he takes it lightly. I think what he says he \nmeans. He has been far too generous in what he has said. But I will \nchoose, among all the things, for just a moment, to say what I think \nmostly about him, as I think about his time here and revere it.\n  First, there is something about learning to appreciate what the \nSenate is as a place, as a house, as an institution. Woe be it any man \nor woman who is elected to this place and who serves for any length of \ntime and doesn't feel it, doesn't understand it, doesn't quite grasp \nwhat a rare place this Senate is. It is hard to say why it is. One \ncould talk about the men and women who made it like this. We could talk \nabout the rules of the Senate that made it like this. We could talk \nabout the two or three great qualities, the fact that you can offer \namendments freely--which has been known as one of those real attributes \nof this place. You can come down here on an afternoon while something \nis being debated on health, and if you can get the floor you can offer \nan amendment about Iraq. Somehow or another, you get the feel of the \nplace, the limitation on trying to get things done that this threat to \nfilibuster offers, and how that plays, and the minority and majority \nand what it means in this place.\n  You know at some point in time if you have ever had to make a \ndecision on the floor of the Senate that was important just because it \nwas important to the Senate, then Robert Byrd would be there to stand \nup and congratulate you. That is, if as chairman of the Budget \nCommittee I had to get up and say to the Senate: I want to ad-\n\n[[Page S5697]]\n\nmonish you that if you do this or that you are challenging the rules of \nthe Senate--if I would look around and expect some help, the walls \nwould give me help. And it would be Robert Byrd saying: Listen \ncarefully, if you are talking about the Senate.\n  That is why I came here because, of all the qualities, I think he \nwill best be known as a man of the Senate, as a man who understood the \nSenate--what made it great and different, unique. He is noted for his \ngreat ability to manifest so many great historic concepts, of modern \ntimes and ancient times, and today debate them, deliver them, state \nthem from memory, and truly inform us what they mean.\n  His understanding of freedom is legendary, what American freedom is. \nBut today I chose to congratulate him for not letting up, in all his \nyears--never letting up on the proposition that the Senate is a special \nplace. He will go down in history because he has regularly, habitually, \nwithout hesitance informed us of what a special place the Senate is by \nvirtue of what we have been given, what was bestowed upon us in the \nConstitution, how our Founding Fathers have accredited this place, what \nits rules have become through its leaders of the past, and how the \nhalls just reek with all of that past and just keep making it the \nSenate.\n  That is what he is; that is what he has done. He is the Senate. The \nlonger he is here, the more he is that. I don't know how many years it \ntook him to become it, to know it, to relish it as he has passed it on \nto each of us. Certainly, by the time I came in 1972, and I have been \nhere 33 going on 34 years, he already was there and was preaching that \nto all of us. Some of us began to understand it to where we could stand \nup and say: Hey, don't forget, fellow Senators, this is the Senate. \nLet's not do an injustice to it. Let's not violate it.\n  I won't state names, but I remember very young Senators who wouldn't \nthink of talking that way. But 10 years later, that is the way they \ntalked, that is the way they behaved. I venture to say each and every \none who comes to my mind, if you ask them where they got that feeling, \nthat rapture for this place, probably among the very few things they \nwould mention, they would mention Robert C. Byrd.\n  Congratulations for all the times spent in breaking all the records \nfor the time, but most of all congratulations from me, to a Senate man, \na man who makes the Senate what it is and likes to tell everybody else \naround what it is, and in particular likes to make sure Senators grow \nup and begin to relish it as he has, and never forgets what it is.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I first came to the U.S. Senate 40 \nyears ago next year, not as a Senator but as a legislative assistant. \nSenator Kennedy was here then in his second term. Senator Byrd had been \nin the Congress since 1953. I was working for Howard Baker, the first \nRepublican Senator to be elected from Tennessee.\n  I noticed over the years how he and Senator Byrd became good friends. \nThe strength of that friendship was demonstrated in 1980 when the \nRepublicans gained control of the Senate--which surprised virtually \neveryone, gaining 12 seats. Among the shocks that would occur is that \nHoward Baker, who was then the Republican leader--he refused to call \nhimself the minority leader, but the Republican leader--was to become \nmajority leader and Robert Byrd, who was the Democratic leader, would \nhave to be the minority leader.\n  I remember two stories Senator Baker tells about that incident which \nhad a lot to do with shaping what happened in the Senate shortly after \nthat.\n  Senator Baker went to see Senator Byrd, and as I have been told, he \nsaid: Bob, I wonder if you would be willing to keep your office. Well, \nthat got him off to a good start with Bob Byrd. I am sure that incident \nmust have caused the Senate to work much more smoothly over the next \nfew years. Senator Baker kept the minority leader's office and expanded \nit, and Senator Byrd kept the majority leader's office even though he \nwas the minority leader.\n  But the second thing that happened was this: The new majority leader, \nHoward Baker, said to the stepping down majority leader, Bob Byrd: Bob, \nI would like to make an arrangement with you. Senator Byrd said to \nSenator Baker: What is that, Howard? He said: I would like to make an \narrangement about surprises. I will not surprise you if you won't \nsurprise me. According to Senator Baker, Senator Byrd replied: Let me \nthink about it. They got back together the next day, and Bob Byrd gave \nHoward Baker his word: No surprises. According to Senator Baker, that \nword was never broken during the entire time Senator Baker was the \nmajority leader and Senator Byrd was the minority leader. I am sure the \nSenate and this country benefitted greatly because of the trust those \ntwo men, who usually had very different opinions on issues, had with \none another.\n\n  The other thing I would like to say about Senator Byrd is this: I \ncame to the U.S. Senate as a Senator many years later, the same year \nthe Presiding Officer came from Texas. It was in 2003 when we were \nsworn in, and that was exactly a half century after Bob Byrd came to \nthe Congress. Each of us in our class made what I believe we still call \nmaiden speeches--our first speech on the subject that was most \nimportant to us. The subject that was most important to me--and still \nis--is what it means to be an American, concepts that unify our \ncountry. I find it absolutely remarkable how our country, among all \nothers, has accumulated this magnificent diversity but has found a way \nto bind it into a single country based on a few fragile principles that \nare found in our founding documents and by our common language and by \nour saga of American history.\n  There is no one in the Senate--even though many of us try--no one in \nthe Senate who understands and expresses that better than Senator \nRobert C. Byrd. He understands what it means to be an American. He \nvotes that way. For example, when the No Child Left Behind Act came up \nin the Senate before I was elected to this body, the legislation \nfocused on reading and math. Senator Byrd insisted that the Senate bill \ninclude a $100 million authorization for the teaching of what he called \ntraditional American history. Our seniors in high school are scoring \nlower on U.S. history than on any other subject. In other words, our \nhigh school seniors don't score lowest on math or science; they score \nlowest on U.S. history. Those are the worst scores our seniors have. In \nfocusing on the need to do a better job of teaching history to young \nAmericans, Senator Byrd is making an effort to make sure we remember \nwhere our country came from.\n  When I made my maiden speech and then introduced a modest bill to try \nto create summer academies for outstanding teachers and students of \nAmerican history in 2003, Senator Byrd came to the floor. Senator Byrd \ncosponsored the bill, and then he showed the great compliment to me of \nshowing up at the hearing before the Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions Committee to testify for the bill. As I said, it was my first \nyear in the Senate; it was his 50th year in Congress.\n  So I congratulate him for his service. I congratulate him for his \nrelationship with other Senators, his word being his bond, as it was in \nthe example with Senator Baker, and I admire his work in helping to \nremind us in this body and all of us in this country of what it means \nto be an American. That will be one of his lasting legacies.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I cannot be in the Chamber on this \nsomewhat historic day without recognizing the fact that one of our \ncolleagues today becomes the longest serving Member of the U.S. Senate. \nSenator Bob Byrd is a special Member of this body and has been a good \nfriend to all 99 current Members, as well as all the previous Members \nof the Senate who have had the pleasure of serving with him.\n  I will never forget the first week I was here making my rounds of the \nother Senators I did not know. When I came to Senator Byrd, he, of \ncourse, knew immediately who I was and engaged in a conversation about \nsome facts regarding my service in the House and some other issues that \nwere personal that let me know how much he cared about the Senate by \ntaking the\n\n[[Page S5698]]\n\ntime to research the background of individuals who become Members of \nthe Senate.\n  I will always cherish the fact that during that conversation and in \nsubsequent conversations I have had with him, he shared with me the \nfact that his favorite Member of the Senate has always been Senator \nRichard B. Russell of my home State. Senator Russell served in this \nbody for 34 years, and I happen to hold the class of the seat of \nSenator Russell. I have an office in the Senate Russell Building. So I \nhave a number of ties to Senator Russell, and I also have such great \nrespect and admiration for him. To hear Senator Byrd talk in such \nglowing terms about a man from my State for whom I have such respect \ngave me a warm feeling about this man with whom I was about to engage \nin service in the Senate.\n  He is a remarkable man. He is a man who, without question, believes \nin the Constitution of the United States and thinks we ought to be more \nbold in our adherence to that Constitution.\n  In that respect, again, in that same first week I was here, I \nreceived in my office mail a copy of the U.S. Constitution from Senator \nByrd, along with a letter from him saying that as a Member of the \nSenate, I should always remember that this has been our guiding light \nand has served us well during every single day that our country has \nbeen free and democratic.\n  As we help share and celebrate with him on this historic day, I \nextend my congratulations to him on his service to our country and his \nservice in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, before the distinguished Senator departs, \nI thank him for his kind remarks and thank him for his service on the \nArmed Services Committee.\n  He mentioned Richard Russell. Indeed, he had many years of service on \nthe Armed Services Committee. I know he would be very proud of what \nSenator Chambliss has done to carry on the traditions which he \ninstituted.\n  I earlier shared my respect for Robert Byrd and that great class of \nSenators with whom he worked in this institution, among them Harry F. \nByrd, Sr., Richard B. Russell, and John Stennis. They were quite a \nteam, and we have all learned from them. I must say, Senator Chambliss \ncarries on those traditions with his great State.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I congratulate my good friend, Robert C. \nByrd, on becoming the longest serving Senator in American history. \nSenator Byrd is an institution within this institution that we all \ndearly love. For more than 47 years in the Senate, he has served \nAmerica and his beloved West Virginia with firm purpose, confident that \nhis work is to do their work. He has done it extraordinarily well.\n  Senator Byrd's place in history was assured long before this \nmilestone. He is distinguished more by his love for the Senate than by \nthe length of his service. Senator Byrd knows the history and rules of \nthe Senate better than any of us serving today--perhaps better than \nanyone who has ever served this body. He has defended the traditions \nand prerogatives of the Senate as strongly as any Senator ever has. \nSenator Byrd reveres our Constitution, a copy of which he always \ncarries in his pocket, and is as firmly committed to our Constitution \nas any American ever has been.\n  To just give one example, I saw that commitment in our work together \nagainst the line-item veto, which Congress passed and President Clinton \nsigned into law in 1996. In the floor consideration of that bill, \nSenator Byrd illuminated the debate, as he so often does, by reaching \nback into history. He quoted the 18th century English jurist, Sir \nWilliam Blackstone, who wrote:\n\n       In all tyrannical governments, the supreme magistery, or \n     the right of both making and enforcing the laws, is vested in \n     one and the same man, or one and the same body of men. And \n     wherever these two powers are united together, there can be \n     no public liberty.\n\n  After the bill became law, despite that opposition, I joined Senator \nByrd and Senator Moynihan in filing an amicus brief at the Supreme \nCourt, arguing that the line-item veto was an unconstitutional \nsurrender of legislative power to the executive branch. In June 1998, \nthe Supreme Court agreed in a 6-to-3 decision. Senator Byrd came to the \nSenate floor, and he declared:\n\n       This is a great day for the United States of America, a \n     great day for the Constitution of the United States. Today we \n     feel that the liberties of the American people have been \n     assured. God save this honorable Court.\n\n  Well, we are honored to have this giant in the Senate--a true living \nlegend--among us and guiding us in our daily work.\n  The determination with which Senator Byrd approaches his work in \nWashington is born of his devotion to the people of West Virginia.\n  Through his arduous work, he has brought needed infrastructure to an \narea that has lacked for economic development. He has fought, first and \nforemost, for the working people and particularly the coal miners of \nWest Virginia. Just last week--I guess the week before now--the Senate \npassed the mine safety bill that he championed along with his \ncolleague, Senator Rockefeller. West Virginia has had no finer advocate \nin its history than Robert Byrd, a fact the State recognized when it \nselected him ``West Virginian of the 20th century.''\n  In addition to his service in the Senate, Senator Byrd has lived, and \nhopefully will continue to lead for many years, an amazing and an \namazingly full life. He is a man of great abilities and many passions. \nHe plays the fiddle, he reads the classics, he is a master orator, he \nhas worked as a butcher and welder, he is a writer and historian, he \nhas lived in a shack with no electricity, and now keeps the company of \nPresidents and of Kings.\n  He has known true and deep love with his cherished wife Erma whose \nbirthday they would have celebrated today. His life and his love for \nthe Senate and for the Constitution is exceeded only by his love for \nErma.\n  When I was elected to the Senate in 1978, Robert Byrd was majority \nleader. The first vote I cast was on a Robert Byrd motion. And since \nthat day, I have learned more about this institution from Robert Byrd \nthan I have from anyone or from anywhere else. The greatest tribute we \ncan pay to Robert Byrd is to stand firm for Senate procedures which \nhave made the Senate the most notable place in the world of democratic \ninstitutions where the protection of minority rights to debate and to \namend legislation are the most protected. There is no other place like \nthe Senate in the world. It is here where the right to debate is given \na privileged position, a protected position so that minority views can \nbe aired fully and so that, hopefully, consensus can be arrived at \nrather than just simply adopted by prompt majority votes.\n  So that is the tribute we can all pay to Robert Byrd: to defend this \ninstitution, to stand for its procedures, and to carry, as he does, at \nleast in our hearts, the Constitution, as he carries the Constitution \non his body.\n  Congratulations to Senator Byrd on this historic milestone in his \nlifetime of service to our Nation and his now record length of service \nto the Senate of the United States.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to come to the floor today \nto pay my personal tribute and the tribute of all Georgians to the \nservice of Robert Byrd in the U.S. Senate. Today marks the 48th year of \nhis service, and now, today, he is the longest serving U.S. Senator in \nhistory.\n  I am distinctly honored to be in Senate and to have been elected \nhere, and there are many reasons why I am honored. But one of the most \nwonderful experiences since my election has been the chance to come to \nknow Robert Byrd. He, obviously, is a legend. He, obviously, is a great \norator. But he is also a wonderful human being.\n  On Fridays it is my occasion to preside over the U.S. Senate for 3 \nhours. As the other Members of the Senate know, on Friday mornings we \nare not always in business. Therefore, Friday is the day where a lot of \nMembers come to make speeches about issues of importance to them and \ntheir constituents.\n  On occasion, I have had the chance to hear Robert Byrd make one of \nhis famous Friday morning speeches, probably the most enjoyable of \nwhich took place three Fridays ago when I was presiding over the \nSenate. Senator Byrd arrived in the Chamber, asked for recognition, and \nthen spoke, basically without notes, for 48 minutes. I remember \ncounting the minutes because I did\n\n[[Page S5699]]\n\nnot want it to be over because he gave his famous Mother's Day speech. \nHe paid tribute to his mom and all moms in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Robert Byrd is a wonderful, unique institution, a man of great honor, \ngreat intellect, and great capacity.\n  One of my other great experiences since coming to the Senate has been \nto work with him on the bill we recently passed and is now on the \nPresident's desk, the mine safety bill. As chairman of the Subcommittee \non Occupational Safety, it fell my lot to deal with the tragedies of \nthe Sago mine disaster and subsequent disasters that took place in \nKentucky.\n  Obviously, the Sago mine is in West Virginia, and I traveled to West \nVirginia and met with those mine families. But I also met with Robert \nByrd on numerous occasions, talking about what we as the U.S. Senate \ncould do to try to see to it that we reacted to where there might be \nshortcomings in the mine safety laws and to help institutionalize \nbetter practices not only in our inspections but in the operations of \nthose mines.\n  With all the energy of a teenager, love and compassion for those \nwidows, and with great effort on his own part, Senator Byrd worked \nclosely with us over the last 6 months since that disaster, and a \ncouple weeks ago we passed in this body--and the House passed 2 days \nlater--the mine safety bill.\n  Today, mining is a safer profession because of Robert Byrd and his \ncompassionate love for the people of West Virginia and the coal miners \nwho work there.\n  I could go on and on telling personal stories, but I will not do \nthat. I simply close by saying, of all the great distinctions and \nhonors I have had to serve in this body, none is greater than to get to \nknow the great man of great capacity and great compassion, the \nhonorable Robert Byrd from the State of West Virginia--now the longest \nserving Senator in the history of the U.S. Senate.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record).\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, on January 3, 1959, Robert \nCarlyle Byrd entered his first term as West Virginia's junior Senator. \nToday, June 12, 2006, after serving 17,327 days representing West \nVirginians, Robert C. Byrd is now the longest serving U.S. Senator in \nour Nation's great history. He has surpassed giants and legends of the \nSenate to be in a class by himself. Although his 47 plus years and \n17,666 votes are what we celebrate today, we also know that he is just \nas much West Virginia's future as he has been part of its past.\n  During his tenure, Senator Byrd has brought over $1 billion to West \nVirginia's highways, dams, educational institutions, and more--earning \nhim the moniker of West Virginia's billion-dollar industry. Senator \nByrd has also created a number of other health care and educational \nopportunities across the State such as the Robert C. Byrd Center for \nRural Health, based at Marshall University, the Robert C. Byrd Health \nSciences Center at West Virginia University, and the Scholastic \nRecognition Award for West Virginia's public and private school \nvaledictorians. Senator Byrd's projects are so numerous it would take \nme hours to name them all; however, the improvements he has brought to \nWest Virginia are immeasurable. And West Virginia's future is much \nbrighter as a result of his years of service and his continued desire \nto work for our State.\n  His dedication to the people of West Virginia is unmatched, and in \nthe years to come, we all look to Senator Byrd to continue to fight for \na State that would have much less without him. Today he is working to \nsecure a Federal prison in McDowell County, continuing to improve our \nState's highways, updating the safety laws for our miners, protecting \nthe checks and balances in our government structure, securing our \nborders, and creating opportunities for the youth of West Virginia.\n  Sadly, this year, Senator Byrd lost a pillar of strength and the most \nbeloved person in his life--his wife Erma Ora Byrd. When Senator Byrd \nearned his law degree while serving in Congress, Erma and his children \nsacrificed time with him for the betterment of our Nation. Erma served \nas a spiritual companion and as an emotional support for him. When \nelected as Majority Leader, many said that his life was the Senate, but \nthose who know him, know that the love of his life and his eternal \ncompanion truly was Erma. Her values and strengths are those of all \nWest Virginians. She was a coal miner's daughter and a daughter of \nAppalachia. She provided Senator Byrd with everything he needed \nthroughout his life, and provided unfailing support during his lifetime \nof public service.\n  Senator Byrd's love for West Virginia and its people is \nextraordinary. Throughout his unprecedented public service in the West \nVirginia House of Delegates, the U.S. House of Representatives, and the \nU.S. Senate, Robert C. Byrd has never lost an election--a tribute to \nhis resounding support in our State of West Virginia and something very \nfew of his colleagues can say. One reason for this perfect record is \nthat he never fails to work for the future of our State--he is on the \ncutting edge of West Virginia's needs, and he is fast to respond to new \nproblems, such as border security, and homeland security, with new \nsolutions.\n  Senator Byrd's contributions to this country extend far past West \nVirginia's mountains. He has served as a leader on the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, worked to create a Federal compensation \nsystem for black lung victims, worked to secure passage of the Panama \nCanal treaties, led the effort to pass legislation keeping the Social \nSecurity system solvent, worked to ratify the INF treaty with the \nSoviet Union, went to court to block the recently passed line-item \nveto, among many other historic pieces of legislation, treaties, \nnominations, and resolutions. Most recently, Senator Byrd has worked \ntirelessly to help pass the MINER Act in light of the tragedies at the \nSago and Alma mines.\n  In addition to his stellar legislative record, Senator Byrd has been \na proven leader in the Senate, holding more leadership positions in the \nSenate than any other Senator of any party in Senate history. He has \nheld leadership positions including secretary of the Democratic \nConference, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senate \nDemocratic whip, Democratic leader, majority leader, and minority \nleader. On three occasions Senator Robert C. Byrd has served as \nPresident Pro Tempore of the Senate, demonstrating the tremendous \namount of respect that the Senator has from his colleagues and placing \nhim in direct line of succession to the Presidency.\n  Throughout his career, Senator Robert C. Byrd has remained a \ndedicated husband, father, grandfather, great- grandfather, and friend. \nA man of deep faith, his dedication to our country and our State is \nexceeded only by his dedication to his family. I ask my colleagues to \njoin me in congratulating Senator Robert C. Byrd for the incredible \namount of time and effort he has given to our Nation and to the State \nof West Virginia. I know my colleagues join me in hoping that he will \ncontinue to serve West Virginia for many more years to come.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to add my voice in tribute and \nrecognition of the continuing service of our distinguished colleague, \nthe senior Senator from West Virginia, Senator Robert C. Byrd. Today he \nbecomes the real dean of the Senate, the longest serving of all the \n1,855 men and women who have served in this body.\n  It will not surprise any of my colleagues that others will make more \nof this remarkable milestone than the Senator from West Virginia \nhimself. For him, Day 17,327 is just another day serving the people of \nWest Virginia and the United States here in the Senate. But for the \nrest of us, this milestone recognizes not simply the length of Senator \nByrd's tenure, but what he has done with that tenure.\n  The Senator from West Virginia brings a sense of history and \nperspective to the politics of the moment. He is as determined as \nanyone here to achieve his political goals, but his emphasis on the \ninstitution's history and prerogatives helps us place the immediate in \na larger context. In that sense, he is not just a Senator, not just a \ncolleague, but he is a teacher for the many Senators who have walked on \nthis floor for the first time since he came here so long ago.\n  The Senator from West Virginia is truly an original. I ask my \ncolleagues:\n\n[[Page S5700]]\n\ndo you know anyone else who feels equally comfortable, giving a \ndiscourse on the Roman Senate and appearing on the television show \n``Hee Haw''?\n  Many Senators, for example, receive academic degrees during their \nservice in this body. Most, however, are honorary degrees. The Senator \nfrom West Virginia received a law degree from American University in \n1963, but he earned it after taking night classes for a decade.\n  Senators have written books during their service in this body. The \nSenator from West Virginia, however, has written books about this body. \nHe is widely known as the author of a four-volume work on the history \nof the U.S. Senate, published in 1987 for the Senate's bicentennial. \nThose are not simply history books. The project began as a series of \nspeeches about this institution and its history, delivered right here \non this Senate floor. A book about Senate history arising while \nparticipating in that history.\n  They say a picture is worth a thousand words. Inside the front cover \nof volume two of his work on the Senate is a photograph of the Senator \nfrom West Virginia and his wife, whom he has so often simply called \n``my dear Erma,'' standing on a staircase in the Senate. We all mourned \nErma Byrd's passing just a few months ago and today would have been her \nbirthday. That photograph was on the occasion of their 50th anniversary \nin 1987. I do not doubt that in his left breast pocket was that \nfamiliar copy of the U.S. Constitution which, I might add, was \ncelebrating its own bicentennial that same year. How fitting that one \nphotograph would capture these loves of his life, the institutions to \nwhich he was so committed: his marriage, the Constitution, and the \nSenate.\n  So much more could be said, but I just want to pay tribute and honor \nto my colleague of nearly 30 years, a man of character and integrity, a \ncaring man passionately devoted to his faith, his family, and his \ncountry, a good man, a great Senator.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the Senate's most \nenduring figure, Senator Robert Byrd, of West Virginia. Today marks the \nday that Senator Byrd becomes the longest serving member in the history \nof the U.S. Senate, with almost 50 years of senatorial experience. I \nextend to Senator Byrd my congratulations on this momentous occasion.\n  Born in 1917, Senator Byrd had a hardscrabble childhood. After the \ndeath of his parents when Senator Byrd was just 1 year old, he was \nraised by his aunt and uncle in various communities in West Virginia. \nHe graduated at the top of his high school class in the 1930s, in the \nmidst of the Great Depression. Taking work wherever he was able to find \nit, Senator Byrd pumped gas, sold produce, and cut meat. These jobs \ngrounded Senator Byrd in the realities of the working world. During \nWorld War II, he became a welder and worked on the Liberty and Victory \nships.\n  After the war, Senator Byrd began his political life with a \nsuccessful run for the West Virginia House of Delegates. After serving \ntwo terms, Senator Byrd was elected to the West Virginia Senate, then \nto the U.S. House of Representatives. Finally, in 1958, Senator Byrd \nwas elected to the U.S. Senate. He has subsequently been reelected by \nlarge margins again and again. In numerous elections, he has carried \nall 55 counties in West Virginia and in 2000 carried nearly every \nprecinct in the State, an unheard of achievement. Additionally, Senator \nByrd has held more positions in the Senate leadership than any other \nSenator in the history of the institution, including 12 years as \nDemocratic Leader.\n  While outside of the Senate Chamber, Senator Byrd became the first \nmember to initiate and complete the courses needed for a law degree \nwhile simultaneously serving in Congress by taking night classes from \nAmerican University over the course of 10 years. In May 2001, Senator \nByrd was named ``West Virginian of the 20th Century'' by Gov, Bob Wise \nand both houses of the West Virginia Legisature. He is also blessed \nwith two daughters, six grandchildren, and five-great granddaughters.\n  I am pleased to recognize my colleague, Senator Byrd, on this \nhistoric day. The work he has done throughout his life has bestowed \ncountless benefits to the people of West Virginia and to the Nation. It \nis a pleasure to work with such a creative and dedicated lawmaker, and \nI once again congratulate Senator Byrd on reaching this milestone.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate my longtime \nfriend and colleague, Senator Robert C. Byrd, on his landmark \naccomplishment of becoming the longest serving member of the U.S. \nSenate. Today is Senator Byrd's 17,327th day in office--that is 48 \nyears. And he is still going strong--gearing up for his race for a \nninth term this fall.\n  Senator Byrd's life shows the power of America's unique opportunity \nstructure. His mother died when he was a baby. He was raised by his \naunt and uncle, a coal miner, during the Great Depression. In his early \nlife, he worked pumping gas, cutting meat, and even welding war ships \nin various ports--including in my own hometown of Baltimore. Yet \nSenator Byrd never forgot his roots, and he never forgot those miners. \nIn fact, his new mine safety legislation--the MINER Act--just passed \nthe Senate last week. Like me, he stands up for the little guy.\n  Senator Byrd and I have a long history together. When I first came to \nthe Senate in 1986, one of the people who was most welcoming to me was \nSenator Byrd. I reached out to him. I told him I not only wanted to be \na fighter--I wanted to be an effective player. I wanted to be there not \nonly to change the law books. I wanted to be sure there was money in \nthe Federal checkbook for my State and for the national priorities that \nwould help ordinary families. Robert Byrd said to me, ``You should come \non my Appropriations Committee.''\n  Senator Byrd helped me become the first woman on the Appropriations \nCommittee and one of the first freshman members of the Senate on the \nAppropriations Committee. With Senator Byrd as the ranking member of \nthe Appropriations Committee and I as a member, we have been working \ntogether ever since to build coalitions to get things done.\n  Senator Byrd's home State of West Virginia is right next door to \nMaryland. We share a common border--with Allegheny, Garret, and parts \nof Washington Counties just across the State line in Western Maryland. \nBut we share more than a common border. We share a common set of \nvalues--rooted in faith, family commitment and patriotism.\n  Senator Byrd is no stranger to breaking records. He has done this \nbefore. He has already cast more votes and held more leadership \npositions--including serving as minority leader for 6 years and serving \ntwo stints as President pro tempore--than any other U.S. Senator in \nhistory. Today's record is further evidence of Senator Byrd's \nunwavering dedication to his State. When asked about this \naccomplishment, Senator Byrd told the press: ``Records are fine. But \nwhat's important is what I do for the people of West Virginia. They are \nthe ones who sent me here 48 years ago.'' It is this dedication that \nkeeps the people of West Virginia voting for Senator Byrd. I like to \nsay that I am the ``Senator from Maryland and for Maryland,'' and it is \nthis kind of shared value that makes me feel so close to Senator Byrd.\n  So today--June 12, 2006--we congratulate Senator Robert C. Byrd for \nhis historic contributions to his State and to our Nation.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a longtime friend \nand colleague, the esteemed senior Senator from West Virginia, Senator \nRobert Byrd. This is a historic day in his career and a historic day in \nthe history of the Senate. Today Senator Byrd adds to his many \naccomplishments and honors the distinction of becoming the longest-\nserving Member in Senate history.\n  Senator Byrd's years of service to this country are an inspiration to \nall of us. His lifelong devotion to the institution of the Senate sets \nan example that we can only try to emulate. For almost half a century, \nhe has been a tireless advocate for the people of West Virginia and the \nNation. He believes that government can improve the lives of the \ncitizens that it serves, and that we can all be advocates for justice. \nWe are better Senators and better citizens when we attempt to live up \nto the legacy that he has established.\n  I first worked with Senator Byrd during the early days of my \nhusband's\n\n[[Page S5701]]\n\nadministration. At the time, he had already served in the Senate for 34 \nyears. I remember him being stately and silver-haired when we met. He \nwas already the unofficial historian of the Senate, famous for standing \nin the well of the Chamber and dazzling his colleagues with quotations \nfrom the classics. I also learned then that he was a strict \ndisciplinarian when it came to procedural rules and decorum, a quality \nthat he retains to this day.\n  It is his devotion to the institution of the Senate that has made him \na mentor to so many of us, and I am honored to include myself among the \nranks of those who he has counseled.\n  When I was elected to the Senate, it took me only a minute to \nconclude that I should start my preparation by going to see the great \nsage and historian of the Senate, Senator Byrd.\n  To this day I still very fondly remember the visit that I paid to \nSenator Byrd's office in the Capitol in late November of 2000. I will \nbe forever indebted to him for the guidance that he provided when I \nfirst came to the Senate.\n  Of course, I am not the only recipient of his kind advice and \nguidance. In fact, Senator Byrd has codified his vast knowledge of the \nhistory of the Senate into a multi-volume book. The four volumes \npublished in 1989, 1991, 1993 and finally in 1995 were a labor of love \nfor Senator Byrd. They will continue to be a resource and a treasure \nfor many generations to come.\n  And let me tell you what Senator Robert Byrd did for the people of \nNew York in the aftermath of the attack on lower Manhattan in 2001.\n  After that terrible day, the White House sent up a supplemental \nspending bill to finance the war, and there was not a single penny in \nit for New York. I told the President of the United States in the Oval \nOffice that we were going to need at least $20 billion to rebuild \nGround Zero.\n  And thanks to the leadership and dedication of Senator Byrd, who \nchaired the Appropriations Committee at that time, we got that funding \nfor New York. Thanks to his commitment, our firefighters, police \nofficers, first responders, and volunteers who came to the rescue that \nday will have some help as they continue to cope with the health \neffects of exposure to the site.\n  Because of Senator Byrd's efforts, where once a pile of rubble stood, \none day a tower will stand.\n  Because of Senator Byrd, our businesses and homeowners who lost \neverything are on the road to recovery.\n  As Senator Byrd has himself said, New York gained a third Senator on \nthat day, and we are unquestionably better off for it.\n  Robert Byrd was born in North Wilkesboro, NC, and raised in West \nVirginia by his aunt and uncle. He is an avid fiddler, steeped in the \nrich musical traditions of the Appalachian folk life. He grew up in the \ncoal mining community that he proudly defends today. As a member of the \nHELP Committee, I continue to be impressed by his vigilance on behalf \nof the coal miners of West Virginia and elsewhere in the Nation.\n  He was first elected to this Senate in 1958. He became a member of \nthe Senate leadership in 1967, when he was selected to be secretary of \nthe Democratic Conference. He was chosen to be Senate Democratic whip \nin 1971 and Democratic leader in 1977. He has held more leadership \npositions in the Senate than any other Member in Senate history.\n  Through all of his years of Senate service, there was one person who \nwas always by his side, as his partner, friend, and as he said on many \noccasions, his teacher.\n  Erma Ora James was born in Floyd County, VA, and moved from there to \nthe coal mines of West Virginia with her family. It was there that she \nmet Robert Byrd at Mark Twain High School over 70 years ago. He first \ntried to woo her with gifts of bubble gum that he took from a classmate \nand stored up for her. And apparently it worked, because they became \nhigh school sweethearts and were married on May 29, 1937. Over the \nyears, their family grew to include two daughters, six grandchildren \nand six great-grandchildren.\n  It is a tradition of Senator Byrd's to go to the floor of the Senate \neach Mother's Day and pay tribute to the Nation's mothers. When he does \nthat he has often mentioned Erma and the joy that they shared together \nfor so many years.\n  They had been married nearly 69 years when she passed away 3 months \nago on March 15, 2006, after a long illness. Theirs has been called one \nof the great American love stories.\n  On his 63rd wedding anniversary he went to the Senate floor and said \nof her, ``I have to frankly say that what little I have amounted, if it \nis anything much, I owe for the most part to [Erma.]'' I know that \ntoday, as his colleagues who respect and admire him so very much come \nto the floor to praise his service in the Senate, Erma is looking down \non us as well.\n  It is truly an honor to serve in the Senate with Senator Byrd. I wish \nhim all the best on this day and I look forward to continuing our work \ntogether on behalf of the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/12/senate-section/article/S5701-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5701]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bond).

Under the previous order, the hour of 3 \no'clock having arrived, the Senate will proceed to the consideration of \nS. 2766, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2766) to authorize appropriations for fiscal \n     year 2007 for military activities of the Department of \n     Defense, for military construction, and for defense \n     activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe \n     personnel strengths for such fiscal year for the Armed \n     Forces, and for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if there is no one seeking recognition, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we are now on the bill. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent if I may depart \nfrom the bill to speak as if in morning business regarding our \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Warner are printed in the Record under ``Morning \nBusiness.'')\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, to accommodate Members, we will be on the \nbill for some period of time. I will be joined by the distinguished \nranking member, Mr. Levin, shortly after 5 o'clock today. In the \nmeantime, we are open for statements.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I appreciate this.\n  I rise today to discuss several noteworthy provisions in the fiscal \nyear 2007 Defense authorization bill. I will provide an overview of a \ncouple of amendments I will offer.\n  First, I commend the managers of this bill, Senators John Warner and \nCarl Levin, for the work they have put into this legislation. I also \nrecognize in a public way the fine work Chairman Warner has done. I \nhave had an opportunity to work with the chairman both as a member of \nthe Committee on Armed Services, and after leaving that committee to \nserve on the Committee on Appropriations. I found Senator Warner \ncertainly has been very gracious and helpful on many issues and has \ncertainly kept the men and women of the Armed Forces primary in his \nmind.\n  It is comprehensive and addresses many of the issues important to our \nArmed Forces. Indeed, many of the provisions in this bill are essential \nto the health and well being of our soldiers and are needed in order to \ndefeat terrorism and defend our Nation from future attacks.\n  In the missile defense arena, for example, the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee took several steps to encourage the Department of Defense to \nfocus on near-term missile defense systems over longer-term next \ngeneration\n\n[[Page S5702]]\n\nsystems. I support this direction and agree that MDA is not investing \nenough time and money in those systems that may be able to provide \nlimited defense capability in the near term.\n  I personally believe we need to be conducting more tests within the \nmissile defense mid-course intercept program. Although the Missile \nDefense Agency will be conducting two flight intercepts later this \nyear, the agency only requested funding for one intercept in fiscal \nyear 2007. This test plan is insufficient in my eyes and should be \ngreatly expanded. \n  We need to conduct many more flight intercepts, much more often. We \nneed to be challenging the system with our tests and working on the \nareas we need improve upon. I do not expect perfection. In fact, I \nexpect some failures. But, in the context of several missile defense \nintercepts tests per year, one or two failures only means that we are \npushing to find out the real capabilities of the system. They do not \nmean missile defense is not possible.\n  The bottom line here is that I do expect for the Missile Defense \nAgency to try. We all know that hit-to-kill technology works. We have \nused it successfully in the Patriot and Aegis Programs. We now need to \nfurther develop the mid-course system and introduce greater capability \nto that system.\n  Let me turn to another provision in the Senate version of the defense \nauthorization bill that I thought was appropriate and deserved mention. \nThat provision pertained to the Department's request for $127 million \nfor the development and procurement of Trident conventional submarine \nlaunched ballistic missiles. Under the Pentagon's proposal, the Navy \nwould equip several of its Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines with \nTrident missiles tipped with conventional warheads.\n  These missiles are intended to give the President a real option for a \nresponsive, global strike capability in the short term.\n  I support the concept of developing a conventional ballistic missile \ncapable of reaching almost any target in the world in under an hour. In \nan era when targets of opportunity shift rapidly, there is a real need \nfor systems that can reach these targets within narrow time frames. A \nconventional ballistic missile is perhaps the best option for this \npurpose in the near term.\n  That being said, this is still a very new concept, and the Department \nof Defense has yet to work out all the details. Of particular concern \nis the fact that the Department is still developing a variety of \ntransparency, confidence building, and operational measures to ensure, \nthere is no confusion about our intentions.  The last thing we want is \nfor Russia or China to think we are launching a nuclear strike when we \nuse one of these submarine-launched conventional missiles.\n\n  To address this concern, the Senate Armed Services Committee included \na provision in this bill that prohibits the expenditure of this funding \nuntil the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State submit a \njoint report that discusses potential alternatives, describes the \ndiscrimination capabilities of other nations, and states how the United \nStates would work with other nations to prevent an inadvertent nuclear \nattack by another country.\n  I believe this provision is a reasonable approach to this issue and \nstill allows the Department of Defense to go forward with the \ndevelopment and procurement of this system. I think there might be \nother less challenging global strike options available, such as land-\nbased conventional ballistic missiles in California or Guam, so I look \nforward to the Department's discussion about possible alternatives.\n  I next wish to address the Senate Armed Services Committee's decision \nto increase by $30 million the Department of Defense buffer zone \nconservation projects account. These projects help military bases \naround the country address the growing problem of encroachment from \nresidential and industrial development. At Fort Carson, CO, we have \nseen the fruits of conservation projects such as those funded under \nthis account.\n  Fort Carson's southeastern and southern borders are now protected \nwith money from this account. I believe as more conservation projects \ncome on line, competition for the funding in this account will grow \nexponentially. We needed extra money to meet this demand, and the \nfunding provided by this bill is a step in the right direction.\n  Now let me turn to another provision in the bill that I think should \nbe highlighted. Section 372 provides the Secretary of Defense with \nauthority to include incentivized clauses in contracts for the \ndestruction of chemical weapons within the U.S. stockpile.\n  To my extreme disappointment, the Department of Defense announced \nlast April that it most likely would not be able to comply with our \ntreaty obligations under the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention. I was \ndispleased by this announcement because the way the Department had \nmanaged its chemical demilitarization program virtually assured our \nNation's noncompliance.\n  Nevertheless, I still believe if we use the incentivized contracts \nthis section provides, we might be able to complete the destruction of \nour chemical weapons stockpile earlier than what is currently expected. \nThose contractors who can meet a more aggressive schedule should be \nrewarded for their effort. At the same time, I believe that the \npenalties for safety or environmental violations should also be \nincreased.\n  At Rocky Flats, a former Department of Energy plutonium pit \nproduction facility located just outside of Denver, we have seen the \nvalue of these contracts. This facility was initially expected to cost \nas much as $70 billion and take over 30 years to clean up. The \nDepartment of Energy was able to find a contractor who was willing to \naccelerate the contract in return for a huge incentive. I am pleased to \ntell you today that the contractor safely completed the cleanup of \nRocky Flats last December, over a year ahead of schedule and several \nhundred million dollars under budget.\n  This incentive provision puts the Department of Defense in position \nto use similar contracts to encourage contractors to finish earlier and \ncheaper than expected while protecting the environment and ensuring \nsafety. I strongly support it and commend the managers of the bill for \nincluding it in the bill before us.\n  The last provision I would like to discuss is section 911. This \nprovision creates an office for the management and acquisition of \noperationally responsive space capabilities. I support this provision \nbecause the Department of Defense has not done enough to investigate \nthe value of operationally responsive space.\n  One of the reasons why this has occurred is because of the absence of \na dedicated office to manage our operationally responsive space, known \nas ORS, efforts. The GAO recently reported that the absence of a \nstrategic direction within the Department on operationally responsive \nspace activities was hindering the program. This provision solves that \nproblem and should encourage the Department to move forward with ORS \ntypes of systems.\n  Over the next couple of days, I plan to offer several amendments \nwhich I hope will be accepted by the managers of this bill. Most of \nthese amendments should be noncontroversial and helpful but are \nimportant to the global war against terror and to helping the families \nof our servicemembers. I look forward to working with Chairman Warner \nand Senator Levin so we can get these amendments cleared as quickly as \npossible.\n  Again, I thank the chairman of the Armed Services Committee for his \nexceptionally good work on this bill. I know he has put in hours of \nthought and deliberation on this bill, and his committee, working with \nhim, has done a good job.\n  So, I say to the Senator, I want to recognize that I believe this is \nyour last year as the chairman of the Armed Services Committee because \nof our term limits, and I am sorry to see you have to step down because \nI think you have done a tremendous job as chairman. Again, I appreciate \nthe opportunity to work with you as chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, before the Senator parts the floor, I say \nthank you for your kind remarks.\n  Yes, I do graciously and willingly step down. It is the rules of our \ncaucus, and I respect that. But it has been a marvelous opportunity for \nme to have\n\n[[Page S5703]]\n\nthis 6 years, and, indeed, a year or 2 before that as chairman. But I \nwant to particularly comment on the long association and continued \nassociation of the senior Senator from Colorado with respect to issues \nof national security. The Senator has served on our committee, I think, \nabout 8 years.\n  How many years?\n  Mr. ALLARD. Six years, I believe, yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct. And you are distinguished in your \nsteadfastness on the subject of missile defense and how to protect this \ncountry. How many times have you taken the floor and asked and received \nsilence from the Senate: Do we have one--one--system that can knock \ndown an intercontinental ballistic missile should we have the \nmisfortune, be it accidental or otherwise, to have it targeted against \nour country? There has been silence in this Chamber until we started \nthe missile defense program, and you steadfastly fought for that.\n  I say to the Senator, I also commend you for Rocky Flats. Year after \nyear after year, you shepherded through the Senate, in the \nappropriations cycle, the funds to do that because of not just the \nimportance of Rocky Flats but the importance of the overall program, \nwhat we call the cleanup program, the environmental program, in the \nDepartment of Defense to clean up a lot of the former military \ninstallations and particularly those associated with the production of \nfissionable material.\n  So I commend the Senator.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the chairman. We do these things by working \ntogether as a team, and the Senator is a great team leader. I \nappreciate all the support of my efforts in trying to get some of these \nthings done. The Chairman has always set a good example for the rest of \nus by way of his diligence and working through legislation. So I want \nto thank him publicly for a job well done.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague.\n  Mr. President, it is my privilege to bring forward on behalf of the \nArmed Services Committee, and now on behalf of all of our colleagues, \nthe annual Defense authorization bill. I do so with my longtime \ncolleague and dear friend of 28 years serving on this committee, the \nsenior Senator from Michigan, Mr. Carl Levin, who is currently the \nranking member of the committee. He has been a working partner of mine, \nand I have been a working partner of his. He was once chairman of this \ncommittee. We have always been able to put aside such differences that \nwe may have. I respect his difference of views, and he respects mine. \nWe work as a team on behalf of our committee and all of our colleagues \nin producing this annual bill, and in all of these 28 years we have \nbeen together.\n  I thank all members of the Armed Services Committee. We have one of \nthe larger committees. I thank our senior staff, particularly Mr. \nCharles Abell, my current chief of staff, and Rick DeBobes, the current \nchief of staff of the minority, and each and every one of their team, \nbecause it is a team effort. Our committee, I think almost more so than \nany others I know of, relies on this professional staff. It is really a \nprofessional staff that we have, in many respects, to put together this \nbill.\n  The bill before the Senate was unanimously reported out of the \ncommittee on May 9 after holding 36 hearings and receiving numerous \npolicy and operational briefings on the President's budget request for \nfiscal year 2007 and related Defense issues. I commend my colleagues \nfor their hard work and the swift manner in which they contributed to \ndeveloping and writing this important legislation, not only at the \nhearings we had but in the subcommittee structure that worked so \neffectively to produce this bill.\n  Since the Armed Services Committee reported out this legislation, the \nUnited States remains engaged in the global war on terrorism, now in \nits fifth year.\n  Currently, the central battlegrounds in the war on terrorism are in \nIraq and Afghanistan. But there are many, many other areas throughout \nthe world where quietly, yet no less effectively, the men and women of \nthe Armed Forces are stationed and joining in this collective effort of \nall uniformed personnel to perform the duties necessary to let this \ncountry remain free and those of our allies in the face of this \nterrorist threat.\n  It is so important, as we go through this bill, to pay our respects \ncollectively to the men and women in uniform and their many civilian \ncounterparts. There is an enormous cadre of civilians in the Department \nof Defense and serving elsewhere who are alongside the uniformed men \nand women throughout the world. But I want to pay particular respect to \nthe Guard and Reserve who have risen to the call far beyond \nexpectations in these conflicts of terrorism and have done their duties \ntime and time again with great honor and distinction.\n  For each of the countries, the road to peace and stability and \ndemocracy has been marked by historical milestones, including a \nreferendum in both Iraq and Afghanistan that adopted a constitution, \nelections that chose a democratically elected representative \ngovernment, the formation of a unity government, and progress in \nbuilding security forces capable of protecting their nation's freedom. \nThose are landmark and historical accomplishments in the course of \nworld history, and they would not have been achievable without the \nsacrifices--regrettably, the loss of life, the loss of limb--by so many \nmen and women in the Armed Forces and the support their families, by \ntheir side, have given them.\n  These accomplishments in Iraq, Afghanistan, and the global war on \nterrorism are a tribute to the dedication and skills of our uniformed \nmen and women who are willing to respond to the call of duty, and to \nthe military leaders who lead them.\n  The successes achieved in Iraq and Afghanistan have come at a great \nsacrifice, as I said, in life and limb. These sacrifices and service of \nour men and women in uniform have also removed obstacles to freedom and \ndemocracy in regions of the Middle East and elsewhere in Asia.\n  Throughout my many years of service I have never seen--and I repeat, \nI go back some 60 years, to the closing year of World War II, when I \nwas a young 17, 18-year-old sailor--but I have had the privilege of \nbeing associated with the men and women in uniform in these 60-plus \nyears, and we have never as a nation witnessed a finer, more dedicated \nprofessional force, both Active and Guard and Reserve, than we have \ntoday.\n  As I look back over the history of the U.S. Armed Forces, the \nchallenges and responsibilities have never been greater than those that \nrest upon the shoulders of today's generation of the military--their \nleaders, their civilian leaders in the Department of Defense, with the \nSecretary of Defense and others, the Secretary of State, the Secretary \nof Energy--all of this team that puts together our national security.\n  As such, we must take our responsibilities equally as serious to \nensure that those who serve have the resources and authorities they \nneed to win the global war on terrorism.\n  Again, drawing on my modest contribution in active service during \nWorld War II and again in Korea and time in the Reserve, I must say, it \nis so different, in this span of over a half century that I have had \nthe privilege to be associated with these men and women, the challenges \nthat face them today. In World War II we knew precisely who the enemy \nwas. We knew the nations that sponsored the aggression. We knew \ngenerally the capabilities of their military, and we knew with greater \nspecificity what we needed to do in America to arm ourselves, first and \nforemost, with the finest trained men and women--16 million responded \nin World War II to serve in uniform--and the equipment that they \nneeded.\n  But today's war on terrorism is largely nonstate-sponsored. We do not \nknow the origins of the hatred that is in the minds of those people who \nproudly claim the role of terrorist, what it is that engenders that \nhate such that they wish to strike out, often sacrificing their own \nlife to do harm to those who love and cherish freedom. That is a \nparticular challenge that our young men and women face today, unlike \nany other conflict of the magnitude we are now engaged in in \nAfghanistan and Iraq principally, unlike any other conflict in the \nhistory of our country. Therefore, we ask much of that individual in \nuniform today.\n  It is our privilege as Members of this venerable and distinguished \nSenate to,\n\n[[Page S5704]]\n\nat least once each time every year, and then, of course, in the \nsubsequent appropriations process, provide nothing but the finest \nequipment obtainable, fair pay and allowances and health care and other \nrequirements that the young men and women and their families of the \nArmed Forces so richly deserve. What a privilege it is to do that.\n  With our Armed Forces deployed in distant battlefields and countless \nothers standing watch at home, we are committed to providing the \nnecessary resources and authorities for each of them and their \nfamilies.\n  Accordingly, this bill provides $467.7 billion overall in budget \nauthority for fiscal year 2007--that is an enormous sum of money--an \nincrease of $26.2 billion or 4.1 percent in real terms over the amount \nauthorized by Congress for fiscal year 2006; additionally, $50 billion \nin emergency supplemental funding for fiscal year 2007 for activities \nin support of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and elsewhere in the \nglobal war on terrorism.\n  That is a new concept unlike any I have experienced in the early \nyears in this Chamber, where we literally put in a block sum of money. \nSince we cannot anticipate with full specificity the needs and special \nrequirements that flow from these operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, \nit is prudent and a necessary plan.\n  The bill further includes many important legislative provisions that \nwould set forth critical policies for the Department of Defense. I \nwould like to highlight a few provisions that would continue to support \nthe modernization and transformation of the Armed Forces and highlight \nother provisions that would strengthen interagency operations abroad \nand at home.\n  The Secretary of Defense, Mr. Rumsfeld, is to be commended. When he \nfirst came to office we had no way of envisioning the magnitude of the \nwar on terrorism. But he set in place the transformation, particularly \nof the United States Army but other areas of the Department of Defense. \nAnd that same transformation and modernization has gone ahead largely \nparallel to the efforts that we have undertaken in the actual combat of \nthe world war on terrorism.\n  First of all, my colleagues and I on the committee and others in the \nSenate remain particularly concerned about the size of the Navy's \nfleet. In the past 15 years, there has been a declining trend in \nshipbuilding and a diminishing capacity in the shipbuilding industrial \nbase. The fleet has been reduced to its smallest size since before \nWorld War II in terms of number of ships. There are fewer ships today \nthan before World War II. That is an accurate statistic. But it would \nbe incorrect if I didn't say that the smaller number of ships that we \nhave today far exceeds the capabilities of the ships that we had when \nwe entered World War II. So it is not just a numbers game. But it is \ninteresting to point out that statistic in terms of the numbers.\n  The fleet has been reduced as a result of budget necessities and the \nextraordinary cost of the individual ships. That has dictated fewer \nships, regrettably. But the current Chief of Naval Operations and the \ncurrent Secretary of the Navy are determined to try, together with the \nsupport of the Congress, to turn that curve around and begin to \nincrease the number of ships in the Navy. The time has come to reverse \nthat current trend, and I commend the Secretary of Defense, the \nSecretary of the Navy, Chief of Naval Operations, and all others \nworking to try to reverse the trend. Indeed, the Deputy Secretary of \nDefense, Gordon England, former Secretary of the Navy, has been at the \nhelm in trying to increase the size and number of the United States \nNavy. Each of those individuals is mindful of what the Constitution \nsays. It is the duty of the Congress to maintain--I repeat, maintain--\nat all times a United States Navy, and then an Army and the size of the \nArmy in accordance with what the needs are. We raise that Army \ndepending upon the threats facing the country. But it is interesting \nthat the Framers clearly recognized the importance of this Nation \nhaving maritime supremacy, which we do have today.\n  In many respects, we are an island nation--yes, bordered by our \nfriends to the north, Canada, and our neighbors to the south. But \nnevertheless, with two mighty oceans on either side, it is imperative \nthat this country maintain maritime superiority. So we worked \ndiligently to strengthen the shipbuilding program and the industrial \nbase which provides us those ships.\n  We fund the construction this year of eight warships, one above the \nPresident's request, and two new warship classes, the DDX destroyer and \nLHA(R) amphibious assault ship. We implement a long-range plan for the \nprocurement of three ships of the future aircraft carrier class CVN-21 \nto improve the affordability of the future aircraft carrier class by \nauthorizing multiple ship material procurements over 4-year increments. \nSo that ship, indeed, is coming to life. The parts are being brought \ntogether to build that mighty warship of the future, the CVN-21.\n  We lay the groundwork to increase the submarine build rate to ensure \nour continued underseas superiority and increase our investment in the \nNational Shipbuilding Research Program. The bill also includes a \nprovision that would increase investment in unmanned systems to provide \nmore flexible capabilities to the warfighter by requiring the Secretary \nof Defense to develop a departmentwide policy for development and \noperation of unmanned systems.\n  I am very proud of the record of our committee in encouraging the use \nhere year after year of great numbers of unmanned platforms and to \nprovide the research and development to achieve more new platforms. The \nrecent extraordinary military accomplishment of, at long last, putting \nto rest the threat from Zarqawi was made possible by the use of an \nunmanned system in part, together with all elements of our intelligence \ncollection, both military and civilian, and, indeed, finally the \nexecution of a plan with great professionalism by those flying aircraft \nand those manning ground responsibilities. We will have further to say \nabout that operation as this bill proceeds.\n  The bill further includes a provision that would continue the \ndevelopment and sustainment of the Joint Strike Fighter Program. After \nholding 2 days of hearings, I remain concerned that relying on a sole \nengine supplier for single-engine aircraft to do multiple missions for \nmultiple services and multiple nations presents, indeed, a very serious \nchallenge to the industrial base, the designers, and the manufacturers \nand all involved. I felt that we could not take the risk of this \nimportant program by limiting the engine base to but one single \nconsortium of companies; rather, that we should have the two.\n  This concern is not a new one that I share, nor is it a concern of \nmine alone. Ten years ago, a decade ago, I and other colleagues on the \nArmed Services Committee expressed concern regarding the lack of engine \ncompetition for aircraft. In response to that concern, the committee \nincluded a provision in the National Defense Authorization Act for \nfiscal year 1996 that directed the Secretary of Defense to ``evaluate \nat least two propulsion concepts from competing engine companies.'' Now \na decade later, my colleagues and I on the committee continue to have \nthat same concern, and we want to have competition for this engine, in \nthe development of this engine and eventually in the manufacture, \nbecause competition historically has produced a better product.\n  Competition requires both competitors to constantly try to improve \nthe technology of the engine, constantly to try to find means to reduce \nthe cost of the engine. This is an enormously expensive program. \nHopefully, we will procure more than several thousand airframes of \ndifferent types, some to operate on carriers, some from land, some a \nmix, some with destall capabilities.\n  It is essential that the magnitude and complexity of this program \nrest on a solid foundation of propulsion, propulsion provided by two \nvery competent and capable industrial base consortiums competing not \nonly in cost but the continuing competition of design to perfect the \nbest engine man and woman can make for this complicated aircraft. I am \nproud of what the committee has achieved on this program.\n  Therefore, the bill includes a provision that would add $400.8 \nmillion--that is not in the President's budget but in the committee's \nmark, now the bill before the Senate--for the development of the \ninterchangeable engine during fiscal year 2007. Two models will\n\n[[Page S5705]]\n\ncontinue to strongly compete, one by one consortium, another by a \nsecond consortium of manufacturers. Indeed, I think by doing that we \nbetter serve those nations which have signed up and committed their \ndollars to the development of this aircraft, nations that are dependent \nupon this aircraft being designed and built and at a cost that they can \nafford.\n  We direct the Secretary of Defense to continue the development and \nsustainment of the Joint Strike Fighter Program with two competitive \npropulsion systems throughout the life of the aircraft or enter into a \none-time, firm-fixed price contract for a single propulsion system \nthroughout the life of the aircraft.\n  In addition to modernizing and transforming the Armed Forces to meet \ncurrent and future threats, we must also strengthen interagency \noperations abroad and at home. The challenges posed by the Second World \nWar led to increasingly more joint and combined operations within the \nU.S. military.\n  Now operations have become more interagency and coalition in nature \nand will be for the foreseeable future. The success of the U.S. efforts \nin Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere in the global war on terrorism will \ndepend on coordinating all instruments of our national power to achieve \npeace and security in troubled regions around the world.\n  This will include deploying civilian personnel of each agency of our \nGovernment with expertise in the areas of rule of law and \nadministration of justice, economic development, and civil \nadministration to partner with U.S. military forces in Iraq, \nAfghanistan, and other locations to secure hard-won military successes \nand to preserve peace and freedom.\n  To strengthen interagency operations and to provide greater \nflexibility in the U.S. Government's ability to partner with nations in \nfighting terrorism, the bill includes provisions that would require the \nPresident to develop a plan to establish interagency operating \nprocedures for Federal agencies to plan and conduct stabilization and \nreconstruction operations; provide to the heads of all executive branch \nagencies the same authorities the Secretary of State has with respect \nto providing allowances, benefits, and death gratuities for Foreign \nService or civilian personnel serving in Iraq and Afghanistan; expand \nauthorities for geographic combatant commanders to train and equip \nforeign military forces, and to provide urgent humanitarian relief and \nreconstruction assistance to foreign nations; expand authority to the \nDepartment to lease or lend equipment for personnel protection and \nsurvivability to our allies and coalition partners; and expand \nauthority to provide logistics support, supplies, and services to our \nallies and coalition partners.\n  With the increased role of the Armed Forces in homeland security, I \nalso remain concerned about whether current authorities on the use of \nthe Armed Forces are adequate to deal with a serious or widespread \nbreakdown in public order caused by a terrorist attack or natural \ndisaster. The bill includes a provision that would update the provision \nin title 10 known as the Insurrection Act to clarify the President's \nauthority to use the Armed Forces to restore order and enforce Federal \nlaws in cases where, as a result of a terrorist attack, epidemic, or \nnatural disaster, public order has broken down beyond the ability of \nlocal law enforcement or the State Guard, or a combination thereof, to \neffectively bring about law and order.\n  To more effectively support local, state, Federal agencies in \nresponse to manmade or natural disasters, the bill includes provisions \nthat would authorize the Secretary of Defense to approve the deployment \nof Weapons of Mass Destruction Civil Support Teams to Canada and \nMexico, if requested.\n  We have perfectly equipped teams--at least one for each State--to \ndeal with these problems. We should share them with our neighbors to \nthe north and to the south, if so requested.\n  It would expand the types of emergencies for which the Secretary of \nDefense may prepare or employ Weapons of Mass Destruction Civil Support \nTeams; and add $13.5 million to provide for the training and equipment \nof the Weapons of Mass Destruction Civil Support Teams.\n  They were a concept developed in the Armed Services Committee, and I \nam very proud. It has taken us many years to get the funding stream to \nprovide these teams so they cover adequately the best we can equally \nall 50 States.\n  These are just a few of the essential authorities among the more than \n300 provisions included in this year's bill. I believe the National \nDefense Authorization Bill for Fiscal Year 2007 sustains the advances \nmade in recent years, and provides the necessary investments to prepare \nfor the security of our Nation in the future.\n  I urge my colleagues to debate this bill in a constructive manner and \nto bring forth those amendments which you believe would further \nstrengthen this bill. They will be fairly considered, I assure you. \nTherefore, I am anxious that this bill be established and passed by the \nSenate, having been amended where it is necessary. It has been the \ntradition of the Senate for 45 years to pass this bill each year.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to offer opening remarks \non the 2007 National Defense Authorization bill. Chairman Warner and \nRanking Member Levin, as well as the entire committee, worked very hard \nduring the markup process to produce a bill that would support our \ntroops and would provide what our military needs to fight and win the \nglobal war on terrorism, and I am pleased to say this bill does just \nthat. This bill provides our service men and women with the resources \nnecessary to continue the war on terrorism, keep our country safe, and \nwill greatly improve the quality of life for our soldiers, sailors, \nairmen, and marines, as well as their families.\n  Despite what one reads or hears in the news sometimes, it is \nabsolutely clear to me that we are winning this war on terrorism; \nspecifically, that we are winning the war in Iraq. I have heard \nrecently from soldiers of the Third Infantry Division at Fort Benning, \nGA, about the great progress they made during their recent deployment \nto Diyala Province in Iraq. Over the course of their year there, the \nsecurity situation in Diyala Province improved dramatically, as did the \nrule of law and the presence and capability of Iraqi security forces \nand police.\n  As we all know today, Diyala Province was where U.S. forces found and \nkilled the leader of the anti-Iraqi insurgence, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, \nand I believe it was the hard work that the Third ID did in improving \nthe security and developing relationships with the Iraqis in Diyala \nProvince that allowed for the intelligence and network of information \nthat allowed our forces to track Zarqawi down. I am very proud of the \nsituation of the members of the Third ID in that effort.\n  We need to realize this is hard work that all of our troops are doing \nin Iraq and that successes often take a long time. But if we stick with \nit and follow the course we are on, that success will come, and this \noperation against Zarqawi proves this is the case.\n  Mr. President, having been briefed in the Intelligence Committee at \nthe end of last week on the takedown of Zarqawi, I think it is one of \nthe great successes, without question, we have seen in this war. \nMilitary operations are often sophisticated. The planning is very \ndetailed, and that was exactly the case in this situation. It was a \nperfectly executed plan that was carried out by our military that \nallowed Zarqawi--one of the meanest, nastiest killers ever to inhabit \nthis Earth--to be taken down.\n  We absolutely must stay the course and finish the job because the \nfuture of the Middle East, as well as our own future security, lies in \nthe balance. I believe there might be some amendments filed to this \nbill that seek to immediately withdraw troops or set a timetable for \ntroop withdrawal. Clearly, both these approaches are extremely unwise, \nand I hope my colleagues will join me in voting down those amendments \noverwhelmingly.\n\n[[Page S5706]]\n\n  Related to some specific issues in the bill, I have received numerous \nletters and phone calls from both Active-Duty soldiers and retirees who \nare concerned with the proposed increases in TRICARE premiums. So I am \npleased to see that the Senate bill does not approve DOD's proposed \nincreases in TRICARE Prime enrollment fees. In my home State of \nGeorgia, there are a large number of military personnel and retirees \nliving in rural areas where quality health care is often not as readily \navailable as in more urban areas. This bill will help to improve health \ncare access for those individuals by authorizing incentive payments for \ncivilian health care providers who provide services to TRICARE \nbeneficiaries in rural and medically underserved areas. This is a good \nprovision, and I commend the chairman and ranking member for its \ninclusion.\n  This legislation will authorize $45 million in supplemental education \nfunding for local school districts that are heavily impacted by the \npresence of military personnel and families, including $30 million for \nimpact aid, $5 million for educational services to severely disabled \nchildren, and an additional $10 million for districts experiencing \nrapid increases in the number of students due to rebasing, activation \nof new military units, or base realignment and closure.\n  This provision is of particular importance to my State. As a result \nof the 2005 base closure and realignment round, Fort Benning and the \nschool systems in the surrounding area will experience an influx of \napproximately 10,000 students into their school systems over the next \nseveral years as new troops arrive.\n  This funding will ensure that areas such as Fort Benning have the \nfacilities and teachers in place to provide the children of our Armed \nForces members with a top-notch education when they do arrive.\n  This bill also requires DOD to report to Congress on their plan for \nworking with other Federal agencies and local school districts to \naccommodate this growth. Unfortunately, DOD has been slow to recognize \nthe burden that such unprecedented growth places on small communities, \nand it is important that DOD do the necessary planning and coordination \nin advance to ensure that military families are taken care of when they \nmove to a new installation.\n  During the war in Iraq, our intra- and inter-theater airlift assets \nhave gone above and beyond the call of duty and have been used at a \nmuch greater rate than we ever planned to use them. These airplanes \nplayed the critical role of airlifting supplies, vehicles, and other \nequipment to our troops. In order to recapitalize some of the losses \nand overuse of these airlift assets, this bill authorizes $2.6 billion \nfor strategic airlift capability, including an increase of two C-17 \naircraft above the budget request and advance procurement for continued \nC-17 production. These are superb airplanes and have proven to be \nextremely reliable and, along with the C-130, have become the backbone \nof the airlift fleet.\n  This bill also provides a well-deserved pay raise of 2.2 percent for \nall military personnel effective January 1, 2007, and approves targeted \npay raises for midcareer and senior enlisted personnel and warrant \nofficers effective April 1, 2007. I have heard directly from troops in \nthe field and personnel at Georgia military installations about how \nimportant these targeted pay raises are to retaining our men and women \nin uniform in the service and taking advantage of their hard-to-replace \nskills. So I commend the chairman and ranking member for including this \nprovision in the bill.\n\n  In order to clarify the role and use of the Armed Forces for domestic \nuse during natural disasters or other events, the bill also includes a \nprovision that would update the Insurrection Act to make explicit the \nPresident's authority to use the Armed Forces to restore order and \nenforce Federal law in cases where public order has been broken. In \nlight of Hurricane Katrina and other hurricanes along the gulf coast \nlast year, this provision is especially important in clarifying the \nrole that Federal troops have in these situations.\n  I am also pleased that the committee adds $1.4 billion for the F-22A \naircraft in order to fully fund procurement of 20 aircraft, as well as \nfully fund the C-130J multiyear contract which this committee has \nworked so hard to support, even as the contract is restructured from a \ncommercial to a traditional contract.\n  This is a good bill that the Chairman and ranking member have crafted \nwith the needs of our troops and the national security of our Nation \nforemost in their minds. I hope my colleagues will join me in \nexpeditiously considering this legislation so that our men and women in \nuniform can get the equipment, the benefits, and the support they need \nand deserve.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Chambliss and Mr. Warner are printed in today's \nRecord under ``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to comment on the F-22. It is a \nmagnificent aircraft. It is absolutely essential for our inventory of \nweapons.\n  Stop to think that any use of our Armed Forces, wherever they may be \nin the world, is dependent on air superiority. The United States has \nthat air superiority, but there are nations night and day trying to \nfashion airplanes or instruments that could take away that air \nsuperiority. This Nation is banking its future on that aircraft.\n  I am very pleased that our committee has marked up a strong bill on \nthat issue. The Senator from Georgia may have some additional thoughts \non it, which we will turn to in the course of the deliberations on this \nbill.\n  I salute the Senator from Georgia, Mr. Chambliss, for doing \neverything he can to ensure that the United States of America maintains \nits air superiority so that the men and women of the other Armed \nForces, be they at sea, on the land--wherever they may be--have the \nsense of confidence that the skies above will not become some \ninstrument of war in harm's way to them.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his comments \nand for his leadership. It is a pleasure to serve with him in this \nbody. It is a pleasure to serve with him as a member of the Armed \nServices Committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we have before the Senate the extremely \nimportant Defense authorization bill, led in the Armed Services \nCommittee by my friend, the Senator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, and the \nSenator from Michigan, Mr. Levin. I look forward to these next several \ndays debating this issue. I commend them, as we begin this debate, for \nthe way they considered the various recommendations and suggestions \nthat have been made by the members of the committee in developing this \nbill.\n  I ask unanimous consent to proceed for a few minutes in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Kennedy are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President: Is it appropriate \nthat I ask for 5 minutes as in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Domenici are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am pleased, once again, to join the chairman of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, Senator Warner, in bringing the \nNational Defense Authorization Act to the Senate floor. This bipartisan \nbill was favorably reported by unanimous vote of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee on May 4, 2006, as our distinguished Presiding \nOfficer is well aware, since he had an important role bringing this \nbill to the floor.\n  This is the sixth Defense authorization bill that Senator Warner has \nbrought to the Senate floor as chairman of our committee. Under the 6-\nyear term limitation imposed on committee chairmen under the Republican \nConference, it will also be his last.\n  Senator Warner served this country as an enlisted man in the Navy in \nWorld War II, as an officer in the Marine Corps in the Korean war, and \nas Secretary of the Navy during the Vietnam war. He has continued that \nservice as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee since his \nelection to the Senate in 1978.\n\n[[Page S5707]]\n\n  As Senator Warner has pointed out on many occasions, he and I came to \nthe Senate together. We have now served side by side on the Senate \nArmed Services Committee for more than 27 years.\n  As chairman of our committee, Senator Warner is unfailingly patient, \ncourteous, and thoughtful. He has always been willing to listen. He has \nalways tried to work out constructive solutions to even the most \ndifficult problems. And when he is unable to work out those solutions, \nhe is always up front and is always protecting the opposition's \nprocedural rights. Senator Warner has consistently shown his dedication \nto providing the resources that are needed for our national defense and \nmeeting the needs of our men and women in uniform.\n  Senator Warner has served in the finest tradition of our committee, a \ntradition of bipartisan dedication to the national defense established \nby previous giants such as Richard Russell, John Stennis, and Sam Nunn, \nand we thank him for it. He is now and will, hopefully for a long time, \nbe on that list of giants--but after this year and after this bill, not \nas chairman of our committee.\n  Every Senator in this body trusts John Warner. Perhaps this is the \nhighest of all the tributes that one can pay. The unanimous vote of the \ncommittee on the bill we bring before the Senate today is a fitting \nstatement about Senator Warner's chairmanship.\n  This bill contains many important provisions that will improve the \nquality of life of our men and women in uniform.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I wish to say \nwith a deep sense of humility how much I appreciate his comments. To \nthe extent I have had achievements as chairman of this committee, and \nbefore that as ranking member, it was largely due to the long-term \nfriendship and confidence we share in each other's decisions.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Again, we all thank the Senator. His service on the \ncommittee is not over, and his service as chairman is not over. We \nstill have a long way to go, through the floor of the Senate and \nthrough conference, but we have no doubt about the outcome of either \nthe floor debate or the conference. He will pull this bill through \nagain, as he invariably has.\n  This bill contains many important provisions that will improve the \nquality of life of our men and women in uniform. It will provide needed \nsupport and assistance to our troops in Iraq, Afghanistan, and around \nthe world, and make the investments that we need to meet the challenges \nof the 21st century.\n  First and foremost, the bill before us continues the increases in \ncompensation and in quality of life that our service men and women and \ntheir families deserve as they face the hardships that are imposed by \ncontinuing military operations. For example, the bill contains \nprovisions that would prohibit increases proposed by the administration \nin TRICARE Prime enrollment fees and require the Comptroller General to \nconduct a comprehensive analysis of Department of Defense health care \ncosts and savings proposals.\n  The bill rejects cuts proposed by the administration for the National \nGuard budget, ensuring that National Guard end strength will be fully \nfunded.\n  The bill would repeal provisions of the Survivor Benefit Plan that \nreduces military retirement payments by amounts received for dependency \nand indemnity compensation, and the bill would require an audit of pay \naccounts of wounded soldiers and actions to correct erroneous payments, \nincluding a toll-free hotline for military personnel and next-of-kin \nwho are experiencing pay problems.\n  The bill also includes important funding authorities needed for our \ncontinuing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and our efforts to secure \nour Nation against terrorism.\n  For example, the bill contains provisions that would authorize over \n$2 billion for the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Fund to \nfacilitate the rapid development of new technology and tactics and the \nrapid redeployment of equipment to counter the IED threat.\n  The bill authorizes an additional $950.5 million for force protection \nequipment including $559.8 million for up-armored High Mobility Multi-\npurpose wheeled vehicles and $100.0 million for counter-IED engineer \nvehicles:\n  The bill provides $115.2 million over the President's budget request \nfor combating terrorism and enhancing domestic preparedness:\n  The bill authorizes $50.0 billion supplemental to cover the cost of \nongoing military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and the global war on \nterrorism in fiscal year 2007, and it provides expanded authorities for \nregional combatant commanders to train and equip foreign military \nforces, provide logistics support, supplies and services to allies and \ncoalition partners, and lease or lend equipment for personnel \nprotection and survivability to foreign forces participating in \ncombined military operations with U.S. forces.\n  I am pleased that the bill contains a provision requiring that \nCongress be provided a coordinated U.S. Government legal opinion on \nwhether certain specified interrogation techniques would constitute \ncruel, inhuman or degrading treatment under the Detainee Treatment Act \nof 2005 and other applicable provisions of law. This provision is \nnecessary because the administration has refused to provide Congress \nexisting legal opinions on the conduct of interrogations and detainee \noperations and failed to live up to its responsibility to provide clear \nguidance to our troops in the field on these issues.\n  Finally, the bill contains a number of provisions that will help \nimprove the management of the Department of Defense and other Federal \nagencies. For example, the bill contains provisions that would improve \nthe management of major defense acquisition programs by increasing the \nauthority and responsibility of program managers and linking the \npayment of award and incentive fees directly to program outcomes; help \nidentify and address problems with major information technology \nprograms by establishing cost, schedule and performance requirements \nsimilar to those applicable to the acquisition of major weapon systems; \nensure that the public receive accurate information on the department's \nbudget requirements by prohibiting the ``parking'' of funds in one \nbudget account when the funds are intended for a different purpose; \ncontinue the committee's oversight of interagency contracting by \nextending the current series of joint DOD inspector general audits to \ninclude interagency contracts managed by the National Institutes of \nHealth and the Veterans' Administration; and address abusive \ncontracting practices by requiring the Secretary of Defense to \nprescribe regulations prohibiting excessive pass-through fees charged \non contracts and subcontracts: \n  For example, recent press articles have described a process in which \nwork was passed down from the Army Corps of Engineers to a prime \ncontractor, then to a subcontractor, then to another subcontractor--\nwith each company charging the government for profit and overhead \nbefore finally reaching the company that would actually do the work.\n  In one such case, the Army Corps reportedly paid a prime contractor \n$1.75 per square foot to nail plastic tarps onto damaged roofs in \nLouisiana. The prime contractor paid another company 75 cents per \nsquare foot to do the work; that subcontractor paid a third company 35 \ncents per square foot to do the work; and that subcontractor paid yet \nanother company 10 cents per square foot to do the work.\n  In other words, we paid the prime contractor $1.75 per square foot \nfor their work. He used a sub, who used a sub, who used a sub, who \nended up paying the people who actually did the work 10 cents per \nsquare foot to do the work that we and the taxpayers paid $1.75 per \nsquare foot to accomplish.\n  In a second such case, the Army Corps reportedly paid prime \ncontractors $28 to $30 per cubic yard to remove debris. The companies \nthat actually performed the work were paid only $6 to $10 per cubic \nyard. A representative of one of the companies was quoted as saying:\n\n       Every time it passes through another layer, $4 of $5 is \n     taken off the top. These others are taking out money, and \n     some of them aren't doing anything.\n\n  We have many important issues to address as we consider this bill \nover the next few days. For example, I am sure that we will deal with \namendments addressing the way forward for\n\n[[Page S5708]]\n\nour forces in Iraq. My own view, consistent with the long-held advice \nof our senior military commanders, is that there will be no military \nsolution to the violence in Iraq and no way to defeat the insurgency \nuntil a political solution is achieved and accepted by the Iraqis \nthemselves.\n  And we must find ways to press the Iraqis to make those political \naccommodations.\n  The good news that we received about the death of Abu Musab al-\nZarqawi, and perhaps the more important news that the Iraqi parliament \nhad approved the nominees for ministers of defense, national security, \nand the interior will hopefully foster greater cooperation among the \nvarious Iraqi parties.\n  The Iraqis must now turn to the difficult but critical task of making \ntheir constitution a unifying and inclusive document. The \nadministration needs to be pressing the Iraqis to complete this \nessential task within the timeline which is provided by the \nconstitution itself. Only the Iraqis can reach a political settlement \nthat unifies their country.\n  Among the amendments that we will deal with in the coming days is one \nI intend to offer to reduce funding provided in the bill for ballistic \nmissile interceptors and related deployment sites for the Ground-based \nMidcourse Defense--GMD--program. The GMD system has yet to have a \nsingle successful intercept test, yet this bill would provide funding \nfor the final 10 operational interceptors requested by the Department \nof Defense. The flight tests that have occurred to date have shown the \nprogram to be immature and developmental in the test failures and \nnumerous problems remaining to be solved, The Department's proposal to \ncomplete the acquisition of operational missiles before these missiles \nhave been successfully tested puts us at risk of spending hundreds of \nmillions of dollars on the deployment of a system that may not work.\n  I look forward to debating these and other issues as we move forward \nwith this bill over the next few days.\n  As of today, more than 130,000 U.S. soldiers, sailors, airmen and \nmarines are engaged in taking on an aggressive insurgency and helping \nthe Iraqi security forces to prevent civil war in Iraq, almost 20,000 \nremain in harm's way in Afghanistan, and tens of thousands more are \nsupporting the war effort through deployments thousands of miles from \nhome. Our Armed Forces have also played a critical role in responding \nto the devastation left by Hurricane Katrina and other disasters both \nat home and overseas.\n  Senate action on this bill will improve the quality of life of our \nmen and women in uniform. It will give them the tools that they need to \nremain the most effective fighting force in the world. Most important \nof all, it will send an important message that we, as a nation, stand \nbehind them and appreciate their service--and that is true regardless \nof one's position on the wisdom of our Iraq policy.\n  I again congratulate our chairman, Senator Warner, for bringing forth \nthis bill in a unanimous way, as he has and always does. I look forward \nto working with our colleagues to pass this important legislation as \npromptly as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I again thank my long-time friend, the \nranking member of this committee.\n  We shall now be available for amendments. The bill is open for \namendment. I intend to remain here for a while this evening. I think \nthere is a strong likelihood that I will have an amendment to be \noffered on behalf of colleagues on our side very shortly relating to \nthe military operation which resulted in the extinguishing of the life \nof al-Zarqawi.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We look forward to that amendment. I am sure there will be \na lot of support for that operation on both sides of the aisle. We \nhaven't seen the language, but I am sure we will support it.\n  Mr. WARNER. I anticipate that. The Senator from Michigan will have it \nas soon as it is in final form.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. ISAKSON are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. CORNYN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from Georgia withdraw his \nsuggestion of the absence of a quorum?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I withdraw my suggestion of the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, thank you.\n  Mr. President, I express my gratitude to the Senator from Georgia for \nhis remarks.\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak on the National Defense Authorization \nAct for 2007, the bill that is on the floor. Passage of the bill is \ncritical to ensuring that our military has the resources necessary to \naccomplish the demanding missions we have asked them to undertake \naround the globe.\n  I am privileged to chair, on the Senate Armed Services Committee, the \nSubcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, and to work closely \nwith my colleague on the other side of the aisle, the ranking member, \nSenator Jack Reed. Together, we ensured that this year's National \nDefense Authorization Act would make a number of important \ncontributions in the areas of combating terrorism, homeland defense, \nnonproliferation, and investments in defense science and technology.\n  I want to spend a few minutes highlighting the subcommittee's work as \npart of this larger Defense authorization bill. But before addressing \nthose specifics, I commend Chairman Warner for his outstanding \nleadership of the Armed Services Committee in the time I have been in \nthe Senate.\n  This markup, as has already been noted, is his last markup as \nchairman of the committee. But I am confident that Senator Warner will \ncontinue to contribute in many ways and play a key role in the work of \nthe committee, even after he no longer is chairman. We are fortunate to \nhave his expertise in the Senate, particularly on the Senate Armed \nServices Committee. And I congratulate him for a job well done.\n  This bill builds on the President's budget request of $11.1 billion \nfor science and technology by adding $362 million in authorization \nlanguage to these important programs. This year's additional science \nand technology investment is focused on unmanned systems, energy and \npower, information assurance, combat medicine, force protection, \ntransformational technologies, and basic research.\n  The bill sustains the committee's investment in research and \ntechnology to defeat improvised explosive devices, otherwise known as \nIEDs, that are having such a devastating effect on our troops and \ncivilians in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  Reflecting a focus on transformational technologies, the bill directs \nthe Secretary of Defense to develop a Department-wide unmanned systems \npolicy, and to give preference to unmanned systems and vehicles in \ndevelopment of these new systems. The bill also directs the Secretary \nof Defense to establish a joint technology office to coordinate, \nintegrate, and manage hypsersonic research, development and \ndemonstration projects and budgets.\n  To support the Department's commitment to combat terrorism and to \nprotect our homeland, this bill authorizes nearly $150 million above \nthe President's budget request in this area. The bill adds $13.5 \nmillion for homeland defense research, equipment and operations, and \n$17.3 million to meet unfunded priorities of the Northern Command \nresponsible for the area, including the continental United States.\n  The bill provides additional resources and authorities for the \nWeapons of Mass Destruction--Civil Support\n\n[[Page S5709]]\n\nTeams, including adding $8.5 million for the development of a \nsustainment training program for the 55 congressionally authorized WMD-\nCSTs--Weapons of Mass Destruction--Civil Support Teams--and an \nadditional $5 million to address equipment upgrades for the first 32 of \nthose teams to ensure standardization of equipment for all teams.\n  The bill authorizes the Secretary of Defense to approve the \ndeployment of these teams to Canada and Mexico, with the consent of \nappropriate authorities in each of those countries, and expands the \ntypes of emergencies for which the Secretary may prepare or employ \nthese civil support teams.\n  The recent arrests of terrorists in Canada make it all too easy to \nimagine a circumstance in which we might want to employ these Weapons \nof Mass Destruction--Civil Support Teams beyond our borders when \nrequested by our neighbors either to the north or to the south.\n  Reflecting the importance the committee places on information \nassurance and cyber-security, the bill requires the Department to \nreport to Congress on progress in addressing a list of identified \ndeficiencies in the area of cyber-security, information assurance, and \nnetwork protection.\n  In recognition of the critical and growing role of Special Operations \nForces in the global war on terrorism, this bill adds $102.4 million \nfor Special Operations Command to address unfunded priorities, and \nincludes a provision to enhance acquisition oversight for the Special \nOperations Command to make sure the dollars it does spend are spent \nwell.\n  Our troops must be prepared for the possibility of a chemical or \nbiological attack by terrorists at home or on the battlefield. \nAccordingly, the bill adds $68 million for chemical-biological defense, \nincluding $30 million to procure equipment to address shortfalls in \nNational Guard units for chemical agent detection equipment and \nmonitors, and $38 million for chemical and biological defense research, \ndevelopment, test, and evaluation programs to counter the threat of \nchemical and biological weapons.\n  In the area of nonproliferation and weapons of mass destruction \nthreat reduction, this bill fully supports the President's budget \nrequest, authorizing $1.7 billion for the Department of Energy nuclear \nnonproliferation programs and more than $372 million for the Department \nof Defense Cooperative Threat Reduction Program. These important \nprograms are preventing weapons of mass destruction from getting into \nthe hands of terrorists.\n  Finally, the bill includes several provisions to extend and expand \nthe Department of Defense counterdrug authorities, including those \nrelating to support of Colombian efforts against terrorist \norganizations involved in narcotics activity; DOD support of the \ncounterdrug activities of other U.S. Government agencies; and \nDepartment of Defense support of the counterdrug activities of other \ncountries.\n  Before I conclude, I would like to spend just a couple minutes on a \nsection of the bill with which I strongly disagree. The committee bill \nrecommends a 1-year delay in the production of the Joint Strike \nFighter. I share my colleagues' concerns and commitment to acquisition \nreform, and I am pleased that the committee bill contains many \nprovisions to improve our acquisition process. We have to get \nacquisition costs under control if we are going to be able to procure \nthe weapons systems our Nation needs to meet the threats of the 21st \ncentury. But I am deeply concerned that the committee's recommendation \nwill undermine the Joint Strike Fighter Program in terms of cost \nincreases and schedule slips.\n  The Joint Strike Fighter Program is the largest acquisition program \nin the history of the Department of Defense. There are legitimate \nquestions regarding the level of concurrency between research and \ndevelopment and procurement in this program that have been subject to \ncriticism by the General Accounting Office. The committee \nrecommendations closely follow those recent GAO reports on the Joint \nStrike Fighter. But I would note that the GAO recommendations have not \nbeen subject to a business-case analysis. In fact, implementation of \nthe General Accounting Office recommendations could likely cost more \nand result in further delays of the program.\n  In short, I am concerned that the committee recommendation of a 1-\nyear production delay may be penny-wise and pound-foolish. For example, \ndo we know how the proposed 1-year delay in production will affect the \noverall cost of the Joint Strike Fighter program? Do we know how the \nproposed 1-year delay in production will affect the Initial Operational \nCapability of the Joint Strike Fighter? And, finally, do we know how \nthe proposed 1-year delay in production will affect our international \npartners?\n  These are questions raised at the committee level and I think still \nare deserving of good, solid answers. I strongly believe we need the \nanswers to these questions before undertaking major changes in this \nimportant program. I am hopeful that as we move forward we can get the \nanswers Congress needs in order to help, and not hurt, this important \nprogram.\n  I have highlighted those elements of the fiscal year 2007 national \nDefense authorization bill that were developed by the Subcommittee on \nEmerging Threats and Capabilities. There are, of course, many other \nimportant provisions in this bill which my colleagues on the committee \nwill have the opportunity to describe.\n  I urge all Senators to support the legislation and, in doing so, send \na resounding signal of support to our men and women in uniform.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, before I begin talking about the \nlegislation before us today, I would like to thank Chairman Warner and \nRanking Member Levin who have continued their tradition of strong \nbipartisan leadership of the Senate Armed Services Committee. In \nparticular, I want to commend my dear friend and colleague, Senator \nJohn Warner, for his service to this distinguished committee. As chair, \nhe has been a true statesman and shown how Congress should work. He \nunderstands the issues that come before this committee are ones that \nshould not be caught in party bickering. It has truly been an honor to \nwork with him to ensure that our men and women in the armed services \nhave the tools necessary to successfully meet the challenges of today \nand into the future. While this will be the last Defense Authorization \nbill that he will oversee as the chairman of the committee, it surely \nwill not be the last one where his expertise will be felt. Again, I \nthank him and look forward to working with him in the future on issues \nbefore this committee.\n  This bill exemplifies what can be achieved through the spirit of \nbipartisan cooperation to address a number of important defense \npriorities. For example, this bill makes sure the Department of Defense \nhas the resources it needs to combat terrorism by authorizing an \nadditional $115.2 million over the President's budget request. And it \nincludes a number of provisions designed to protect the quality of life \nof our service members.\n  But I have several concerns related to this bill. First and foremost, \nI am concerned that the administration continues to fund this war \nthrough emergency supplemental appropriations. While I support our \nsoldiers currently serving overseas in Iraq and Afghanistan and I am \npleased that this committee has authorized an additional $81.9 billion \nfor ongoing operations, I believe that the administration's current \npolicy is fiscally irresponsible. Unlike true national emergencies and \nnatural disasters such as Hurricane Katrina, the funds required for \nthese ongoing operations can be assessed, identified and included in \nthe regular budget process. It is time for this administration to make \nthe true cost of war transparent to both the Congress and the American \npublic.\n  Just today, I returned from Iraq where I had an opportunity to meet \nand speak with our brave men and women in the Armed Forces in Iraq. \nThey are truly doing an excellent job in a difficult and often \ndangerous environment. Thanks to the efforts of our soldiers, the \npeople of Iraq are better equipped to begin the task of self-\ngovernance. During this trip, I spoke to the new Iraqi Minister of \nDefense and Iraq's National Security Advisor who are both optimistic \nabout Iraq's progress toward democracy. I, myself,\n\n[[Page S5710]]\n\nwitnessed the advances made by the Iraqi people who are building a \nstrong democratic foundation for the future of their nation. However, \nmore needs to be done. While I do not believe that we should leave \nbefore the Iraqi people are equipped with the tools necessary to \nsupport a stable democratic society, we must ensure that the progress \nalready started with the recent election of the Iraqi Minister of \nDefense and the Minister of Interior continues. At the same time, \nwhether we leave Iraq tomorrow, or in 6 months, or longer, it is \nimportant for the President to inform Congress and the American people \nas to when and how our troops will be coming home.\n  I am also disappointed that this year's authorization bill reduced \nthe amount of funding for corrosion prevention and control programs. \nCorrosion is a costly problem. In fact, it is one of the largest costs \nin the life cycle of weapons systems. In addition, corrosion reduces \nmilitary readiness as the need to repair or replace corrosion damage \nincreases the downtime of critical military assets. Consequently, I \nfirmly believe that cohesive corrosion control programs are integral to \nmaintaining military readiness. This critical maintenance activity \nincreases the life of multimillion dollar weapons systems and ensures \ntheir availability during times of crisis. Effective corrosion control \nshould be made a key component of the Department of Defense's resetting \nstrategy and funds should be allocated accordingly.\n\n  Despite these concerns, I feel that this year's authorization \nincludes a number of significant provisions that will greatly benefit \nour military personnel. I am particularly pleased to see provisions \nthat address issues related to the quality of life of military members \nand their families. I believe that it is our responsibility, as \nGovernment leaders, to guarantee that our men and women in uniform are \nappropriately compensated. Consequently, I support the committee's \napproval of a 2.2 percent pay raise for all military personnel and \ntargeted pay raises for mid-career and senior enlisted personnel and \nwarrant officers. I am also encouraged that the committee prohibited \nincreases in TRICARE Prime enrollment fees in fiscal year 2007 and \nauthorized $10 million for pilot projects related to the treatment of \npost traumatic stress disorder. In addition, I am glad to see a number \nof provisions that directly benefit the children of our Nation's \nsoldiers such as the authorized $45 million in supplemental education \naid to local school districts that are affected by a large increase of \nstudents due to base realignments or the activation of new military \nunits. I also support a 3-year pilot education program on parent \neducation to promote early childhood education for military children \nwho have been affected by their parent's deployment or relocation.\n  As the ranking member of the Readiness Subcommittee, my colleagues \nand I included a number of provisions in the bill that are vital to the \nnear-term readiness of our Armed Forces. Most notably, this bill \nincludes several provisions designed to address problems related to the \nDOD's acquisitions policies. One key provision would give DOD program \nmanagers more authority while at the same time holding them accountable \nfor results--a best practice currently employed in the private sector. \nA provision requiring DOD officials to certify that the cost estimate \nfor programs are reasonable and funding is available prior to \ninitiating a major defense acquisition program was included as well. \nThis bill also makes provisions that address DOD contracting policies \nand practices. For example, the DOD would be required to track and \nreport cost overruns and schedule delays on major information \ntechnology purchases.\n  I am also encouraged by our ability to provide support for programs \nand projects funded through the operation and maintenance account which \ndirectly impact the readiness of our troops. These include an \nadditional $52.9 million for force protection, including combat \nclothing and field medical equipment and $97.3 million for training \nresources. In addition, the Readiness Subcommittee included an increase \nof $400 million for critical military construction projects that were \nidentified by military installation commanders as top priorities.\n  I am pleased that the bill also contains my legislation to establish \na National Language Council to develop a long-term and comprehensive \nlanguage strategy and oversee the implementation of that strategy. In \n2004 the Department of Defense hosted a conference on foreign language \neducation and the development of such a council and strategy was the \nnumber one recommendation of those in attendance--including \nadministration officials. Without a comprehensive strategy addressing \nall of our language needs, combined with a real investment in language \neducation, the strength and security of the United States remains at \nrisk. It is imperative that our education system produce individuals in \na broad spectrum of occupations who are able to effectively communicate \nand understand the cultures of the people with whom they interact. This \nincludes scientists, lawyers, doctors, and educators, in addition to \ndiplomats, law enforcement officers, and intelligence analysts. \nMoreover, I believe that we must focus on more than just the languages \ndeemed ``critical'' today. Rather, we should learn all languages in \norder to develop long-term relationships with people all across the \nworld. To do this, we need a cross-cutting and comprehensive plan that \nstates where we are today, where we want to be, and how we are going to \nget there. My legislation that establishes a National Language Council \ngoes a long way toward providing a national language strategy that \nreflects the views of all stakeholders--academia, industry, language \nassociations, heritage communities, and governments at all levels--\nbecause this is an issue that impacts every segment of society and is \ntoo big for only one sector to handle.\n  I believe that the Senate Armed Services Committee has created a bill \nthat will provide the necessary funds required to support our \nservicemen and women and that allows the military to continue to meet \nour Nation's future defense needs.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, by previous agreement between the \ndistinguished majority leader and the Democratic leader, the chairman \nand ranking member of the committee will, for the remainder of this \nevening, as well as tomorrow morning, follow this protocol.\n  I will put forth an amendment momentarily on behalf of myself, Mr. \nFrist, Mr. Reid, and Mr. Levin, and it is a joint, hopefully \nbipartisan, accepted amendment to be debated further in the morning.\n  The military operation that resulted in the death of Zarqawi was a \nstunning accomplishment for U.S. forces. It displayed the precision, \nperseverance and professionalism of our Armed Forces supported by a \nsophisticated and superb intelligence apparatus that included U.S, \nIraqi, and Coalition intelligence organizations. Behind the details \nthat were made public, I can tell you, were months of coordinated, hard \nwork by analysts, human intelligence operatives, and military planners.\n  The death of Zarqawi will hopefully lessen, but not end the violence \nin Iraq, but it is certainly a significant blow to the terrorist \nnetwork in Iraq, to Osama bin Laden, and the al-Qaida organization.\n  Zarqawi was the most prominent insurgent in Iraq and the most active \nof bin Laden's affiliates. While bin Laden hides in mountain caves, \ncapable of making occasional audio tapes, Zarqawi was working to \ntrigger a civil war, disrupt the democratic process of the new unity \ngovernment in Iraq, and then use Iraq as a base to launch attacks \nthroughout the region. There is proof of that intent.\n  He had eluded capture for 3 years, he was indeed cruel, cunning, and \ncagey--and now gone.  \n  I proudly salute the brave and professional work of our military \nforces as well as the formidable efforts of our military, civilian, and \nallied intelligence operations. This success is one that the entire \nintelligence community\n\n[[Page S5711]]\n\nshould find very satisfying. The combined efforts of the Directorate of \nNational Intelligence, the Central Intelligence Agency, and all of our \ndefense intelligence capabilities, and our military forces in Iraq, \ncollaborated on this effort. I believe this success displays that \nreforms are working.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4208\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this amendment is regarding the successful \noperation by our military forces, the coalition forces, the civilian \nand military intelligence both abroad in Iraq, as well as those teams \nhere in the United States, in the successful elimination of what is \nregarded as the No. 1 terrorist in all Iraq, Zarqawi. He is no longer \nable to operate as he once did.\n  At this time, I send this amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], for Mr. Frist, for \n     himself, Mr. Reid, Mr. Warner, and Mr. Levin, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4208.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of Congress that the Armed Forces, the \n intelligence community, and other agencies, as well as the coalition \npartners of the United States and the Security Forces of Iraq should be \ncommended for their actions that resulted in the death of Abu Musab al-\nZarqawi, the leader of the al-Qaeda terrorist organization in Iraq and \n                   the most wanted terrorist in Iraq)\n\n       At the end of subtitle I of title X, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1084. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE COMMENDABLE ACTIONS OF \n                   THE ARMED FORCES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) on June 7, 2006, the United States Armed Forces \n     conducted an air raid near the City of Baquba, northeast of \n     Baghdad, Iraq, that resulted in the death of Ahmad Fadeel al-\n     Nazal al-Khalayleh, better known as Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the \n     leader of the al-Qaeda in Iraq terrorist organization and the \n     most wanted terrorist in Iraq;\n       (2) Zarqawi, as the operational commander of al-Qaeda in \n     Iraq, led a brutal campaign of suicide bombings, car \n     bombings, assassinations, and abductions that caused the \n     deaths of many members of the United States Armed Forces, \n     civilian officials of the United States Government, thousands \n     of innocent Iraqi civilians, and innocent civilians of other \n     nations;\n       (3) Zarqawi publicly swore his allegiance to Osama bin \n     Laden and al-Qaeda in 2004, and changed the name of his \n     terrorist organization from the ``Monotheism and Holy War \n     Group'' to ``al-Qaeda in Iraq'';\n       (4) in an audiotape broadcast in December 2004, Osama bin \n     Laden, the leader of al-Qaeda's worldwide terrorist \n     organization, called Zarqawi ``the prince of al-Qaeda in \n     Iraq'';\n       (5) 3 perpetrators confessed to being paid by Zarqawi to \n     carry out the October 2002 assassination of the United States \n     diplomat, Lawrence Foley, in Amman, Jordan;\n       (6) the Monotheism and Holy War Group claimed \n     responsibility for--\n       (A) the August 2003 suicide attack that destroyed the \n     United Nations headquarters in Baghdad and killed the United \n     Nations envoy to Iraq Sergio Vieira de Mello along with 21 \n     other people; and\n       (B) the suicide attack on the Imam Ali Mosque in Najaf that \n     occurred less than 2 weeks later, which killed at least 85 \n     people, including the Ayatollah Sayed Mohammed Baqr al-Hakim, \n     and wounded dozens more;\n       (7) Zarqawi is believed to have personally beheaded \n     American hostage Nicholas Berg in May 2004;\n       (8) in May 2004, Zarqawi was implicated in a car bombing \n     that killed Izzadine Salim, the rotating president of the \n     Iraqi Governing Council;\n       (9) in November 2005, al-Qaeda in Iraq attacked 3 hotels in \n     Amman, Jordan, killing at least 67 innocent civilians;\n       (10) Zarqawi and his terrorist organization were directly \n     responsible for numerous other brutal terrorist attacks \n     against the American and coalition troops, Iraqi security \n     forces and recruits, and innocent Iraqi civilians;\n       (11) Zarqawi sought to turn Iraq into a safe haven for al-\n     Qaeda;\n       (12) to achieve that end, Zarqawi stated his opposition to \n     the democratically elected government of Iraq and worked to \n     divide the Iraqi people, foment sectarian violence, and \n     incite a civil war in Iraq; and\n       (13) the men and women of the United States Armed Forces, \n     the intelligence community, and other agencies, along with \n     coalition partners and the Iraqi Security Forces, should be \n     commended for their courage and extraordinary efforts to \n     track down the most wanted terrorist in Iraq and to secure a \n     free and prosperous future for the people of Iraq.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     Congress--\n       (1) commends the United States Armed Forces, the \n     intelligence community, and other agencies, along with \n     coalition partners, for the actions taken through June 7, \n     2006, that resulted in the death of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the \n     leader of the al-Qaeda in Iraq terrorist organization and the \n     most wanted terrorist in Iraq;\n       (2) commends the United States Armed Forces, the \n     intelligence community, and other agencies for this action \n     and their exemplary performance in striving to bring freedom, \n     democracy, and security to the people of Iraq;\n       (3) commends the coalition partners of the United States, \n     the new government of Iraq, and members of the Iraqi Security \n     Forces for their invaluable assistance in that operation and \n     their extraordinary efforts to secure a free and prosperous \n     Iraq;\n       (4) commends our civilian and military leadership for their \n     continuing efforts to eliminate the leadership of al-Qaeda in \n     Iraq, and also commends the new government of Iraq, led by \n     Prime Minister Jawad al-Maliki, for its contribution to that \n     achievement;\n       (5) recognizes that the death of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi is a \n     victory for American and coalition forces in the global war \n     on terror and a blow to the al-Qaeda terrorist organization;\n       (6) commends the Iraqi Prime Minister Jawad al-Maliki on \n     the finalization of the new Iraqi cabinet;\n       (7) urges the democratically elected government in Iraq to \n     use this opportunity to defeat the terrorist enemy, to put an \n     end to ethnic and sectarian violence, and to achieve a free, \n     prosperous, and secure future for Iraq;

Blakley\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave man from Avon. Richard \nBlakley, 34-years-old, was killed on June 6 from small arms fire while \non patrol near Al Khalidiyah, Iraq. With so much of his life before \nhim, Richard risked everything to fight for the values Americans hold \nclose to our hearts, in a land halfway around the world.\n\n[[Page S5712]]\n\n  Richard was killed while serving his country in Operation Iraqi \nFreedom. He was a member of Company E, 38th Main Support Battalion, \nIndianapolis. This brave soldier leaves behind his wife Patricia and \ntwo children, Whitney, 11, and Richard Jr., 9. He also leaves behind \nhis mother, Janice Schauwecker, and father, James Blakley.\n  A medic in the Indiana National Guard, Richard's devotion to duty had \nbeen commemorated just months before his death, when he was presented \nwith a Purple Heart following a wound from an enemy sniper in January. \nBecause of his injury, Richard was offered a trip home and was urged to \ntake time off to recuperate. Instead, he chose to return to active duty \nthe same day.\n  Richard joined the Indiana Guard out of high school in 1989 and \nvolunteered to serve in the Persian Gulf war and at U.S. ports in 2003 \nand 2004. In civilian life, Richard was a journeyman millwright, \nputting together machinery and heavy equipment. An avid Colts fan, \nRichard always wore a team shirt on game days, even if he was on \npatrol. He was wearing one on the day he was shot in January, and the \nColts had planned to sign the bloodstained shirt and return it to him. \nRichard was also known for being a devoted father who was driven by a \ndesire to help others! A friend and fellow Indiana National Guard \nmember recalled to the Indianapolis Star Richard's dedication to those \naround him, saying ``It was just who he was. He wanted to be where the \naction was. He wanted to help people . . . '' His wife called her \nhusband ``the strongest person I've ever known in my life.''\n  Today, I join Richard's family and friends in mourning his death. \nWhile we struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take \npride in the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer \nplace. It is his courage and strength of character that people will \nremember when they think of Richard, a memory that will burn brightly \nduring these continuing days of conflict and grief.\n  Richard was known for his dedication to his family and his love of \ncountry. Today and always, Richard will be remembered by family \nmembers, friends, and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero and we \nhonor the sacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Richard's sacrifice, \nI am reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the \nfamilies of the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we \ncannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living \nand dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor \npower to add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember \nwhat we say here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This \nstatement is just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am \ncertain that the impact of Richard's actions will live on far longer \nthat any record of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Richard Blakley in the \nofficial Record of the Senate for his service to this country and for \nhis profound commitment to freedom, democracy, and peace. When I think \nabout this just cause in which we are engaged and the unfortunate pain \nthat comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that families like \nRichard's can find comfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah, who \nsaid, ``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe \naway tears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Richard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/12/senate-section/article/S5712-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5712]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE HUNGARIAN REVOLUTION\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I honor the 50th anniversary of the \nHungarian Revolution. In 1956, the people of Hungary stood in the face \nof adversity and expressed their passion for democracy and \nindependence. They had a vision of what a free and democratic Hungary \nwould look like--a vision that finally came to fruition after nearly 35 \nyears. Only 10 years prior the revolution, Hungarians participated in \nfree elections. Through those elections, the people felt the hope and \npromise of democracy. The perseverance of these strong people can be \nseen in their remarkable journey toward freedom.\n  On October 23, 1956, tens of thousands of Hungarians stood in the \nstreets, demanding independence from the Soviets. The revolt began as a \npeaceful gathering of student protesters that spread to the general \npopulation, and the first day ended with clashes between the police and \nthe demonstrators. Those on the streets were advocating for basic \nprinciples of liberty--free elections, freedom of the press, withdrawal \nof Soviet troops from Hungary, and the return of their Prime Minister \nImre Nagy, who had been forced out of office because of his democratic \npolicies.\n  In an attempt to calm the uprising, on October 26, 1956, the Central \nCommittee of the Communist Party reinstated Nagy as Prime Minister. He \npromised the people of Hungary political freedom and vowed to revive \nthe democratic process. He began by vowing to withdraw Hungary from the \nWarsaw Pact and declaring neutrality on November 1, 1956. As Nagy was \nworking to satisfy those revolting, the Soviets were working on a plan \nto counter the revolution. Even though some members of the Hungarian \nArmy defected and worked against the Soviets, ultimately it was not \nenough to fight off the ever-powerful Soviet regime.\n  Only 12 days after the revolution began, the Soviet Air Force started \na counterrevolution, bombing parts of Budapest on November 4, 1956. The \nhope of the Hungarian people for freedom quickly slipped away. In the \ndays and weeks following the revolution, many of those involved fled to \nother countries. Prime Minister Nagy tragically, however, was tried in \nsecret and executed in June 1958, paying the ultimate price for his \ninvolvement in the revolution.\n  Today, we reflect with Hungarians around the world, including many \nproud Hungarian Americans, 50 years after this significant time period \nand celebrate the promise it held for the future of Eastern Europe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/12/senate-section/article/S5712-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5712-S5713]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DECOMISSIONING OF THE UNITED STATES COAST GUARD CUTTER ``MACKINAW''\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the U.S. Coast \nGuard cutter Mackinaw--WAGB 83--and her crew for their years of service \nto the United States, the State of Michigan, and the Great Lakes. \nToday, after 62 years of service, the Mackinaw's commissioning pennant \nwill be lowered, and the Coast Guard will pass the honor of keeping the \nGreat Lake's shipping lanes open to her namesake and legacy, the new \nU.S. Coast Guard cutter Mackinaw--WLBB-30.\n  On March 20, 1943, construction of the Mackinaw began at the Toledo \nShip Building Company. When commissioned on December 20, 1944, the \nMackinaw was the most powerful icebreaker in the world. The ship \nmeasures 269 feet from bow to stern, and it is still the largest cutter \nin the Great Lakes. The ``Big Mac,'' as it is affectionately known, set \nthe standard for other icebreakers to live up to.\n  The Mackinaw began her service at the end of 1944 breaking ice and \nkeeping the shipping lanes open to ensure the flow of steel during \nWorld War II. The cutter's design was state of the art and gave her the \nability to break channels 70 feet wide through 4 feet of ice. The \nMackinaw once broke through an astonishing 37 feet of ice. During her \nfirst season she made 17 passes through the Straits of Mackinac.\n  While the Big Mac's primary mission was to keep the shipping lanes \nopen during the winter months, she also conducted search and rescue, \naid to navigation, law enforcement, and public relations missions. On a \ntragic day in 1965, the U.S. Cedarville and Norwegian Topdalsfjord \ncollided in Lake Huron, and the Mackinaw rushed to aid survivors and \ntake on casualties. When performing its primary mission from December \nto April, the Mackinaw's motto is ``we move ships when no one else \nwill.'' In 1948, the Mackinaw freed 12 ice-locked ships in Buffalo, \nN.Y., and in 1984 opened a channel through the St. Clair River Ice Jam \nfreeing 13 vessels stuck in the ice and opening a passage for 75 other \nfreighters waiting for passage. For these and other feats, the Mackinaw \nalso became know as the ``Great White Mother.''\n\n[[Page S5713]]\n\n  Today, I also pay tribute to the men and women, past and present, who \nhave served on the Mackinaw. The Big Mac and its crew spent many months \naway from home from home in the bitter cold navigating the frigid \nwaters of the Great Lakes. This was often lonely duty for her crew, but \nthe Big Mac's efforts were crucial to keep Great Lakes commerce moving \nduring the winter months.\n  The ``Big Mac'' is being replaced but not forgotten. I am pleased \nthat the Big Mac will remain in Michigan as an attraction and \neducational experience so that everyone can enjoy the wonders of this \nlegendary ice breaker. The new Mackinaw will perform as an icebreaker \nand will also maintain navigational aids. I am sad to see the Big Mac \nretired but am excited the torch will pass on to such a fine ship.\n  The U.S. Coast Guard cutter Mackinaw and its crew have done a \nremarkable job over the years. I thank them for their service to their \ncountry, Michigan and the Great Lakes. Finally, I say thank you and \ngoodbye to the Big Mac.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/12/senate-section/article/S5713-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5713]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    COMMEMORATING THE 39TH ANNIVERSARY OF JERUSALEM'S REUNIFICATION\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am honored to join my colleagues in \nthe submittal of S. Res. 98 congratulating the Israeli people on their \ncelebration of the 39th anniversary of the reunification of Jerusalem \nand calling for the United States to relocate its embassy in Israel \nfrom the city of Tel-Aviv to the recognized capital city of Jerusalem.\n  This year, Israel celebrates the 39th anniversary of the \nreunification of Jerusalem. Starting in 1948 Jerusalem was a divided \ncity. Under Jordanian rule, many of the holy areas were off limits to \nIsraelis of any religion and to Jews of any nationality. In 1967, \nduring the Six Day War, Israeli troops reunified the city of Jerusalem. \nThen, people of all religious faiths have been guaranteed full access \nto holy sites within the city, and the rights of all faiths have been \nrespected and protected.\n  In 1995, the U.S. Congress declared that Jerusalem should remain the \nundivided capital of Israel. I was proud to cosponsor the Jerusalem \nEmbassy Act of 1995, and I am proud today to join my colleagues in \nurging the administration to move our Embassy to Israeli's rightful \ncapital. The President of Israel, Israel's Parliament and the Israeli \nSupreme Court are all located in Jerusalem. What is not located in \nJerusalem is the Embassy of the United States. Every sovereign country \nhas the right to designate its own capital and the United States \nmaintains its Embassy in the functioning capital of every country. The \none exception is Israel, a great friend and ally to the United States.\n  Israel is a steadfast strategic ally of the United States. The United \nStates conducts official meetings and other business in the city of \nJerusalem in de facto recognition of its status as the capital of \nIsrael. It is time for the U.S. Embassy to be relocated to Jerusalem, \nthe recognized capital of Israel. With this resolution, the Senate \ncalls on President Bush to discontinue the waiver contained in the \nJerusalem Embassy Act of 1995, relocate the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, \nand reaffirm U.S. policy that Jerusalem must remain the undivided \ncapital of Israel.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/12/senate-section/article/S5713-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5713]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      RECOGNIZING JAMES D.

Alison wrote a touching essay illustrating her father's \ncommitment to helping her achieve her God-given potential, by \nencouraging her to excel in school and teaching her how to be a good \ncitizen.\n  As a nation, we have far to go to reverse the trend of absentee \nfathers, but there are millions of men, including Dennis, who are \nalready going the extra mile for their children, and they deserve our \nthanks this Father's Day. By holding men like Dennis up as responsible \nfathers, I also hope to encourage other men to play a bigger role in \ntheir children's lives.\n  Despite holding a demanding job in a hospital emergency room, Dennis \nalways makes time for his daughter and has instilled in her the value \nof helping others. There is no question that the world would be a far \nbetter place if every child was able to have the support of a father \nlike Dennis. By building strong family bonds, he has earned not only \nhis daughter's love but serves as a role model for the community as \nwell.\n  Today, I thank Dennis for his devotion to his daughter and for \nsetting an example for all of us of what it means to be an outstanding \ndad. It is my honor to read Alison's essay into the Congressional \nRecord of the United States:\n\n       I think my dad is outstanding for three reasons. First, he \n     is always there for me. Even when he is busy, Dad can always \n     find time to do something fun with me.\n       Second, Dad has taught me many important things. He has \n     been a great teacher from riding a bike, to being a good \n     citizen, to medical terminology and good character.\n\n[[Page S5714]]\n\n       Third, Dad is also a good role model. He works in the \n     emergency room and sometimes has to work at night and sleep \n     during the day. I think it would be very stressful to handle \n     emergencies and keep a calm demeanor, but he always does. Dad \n     does this because he wants to help people. I admire him for \n     that.\n       Dad is outstanding because he is there for me, has fun with \n     me, teaches me, helps others and because he is simply a great \n     dad!--Alison R.

Mr. President, it is with great honor that I rise \ntoday to congratulate the Brookings chapter of Disabled American \nVeterans on their 25th anniversary, which will be celebrated on July 1, \n2006.\n  Disabled American Veterans, an organization with over 1.2 million \nmembers, is focused on building better lives for disabled veterans and \ntheir families. The organization strives to meet this goal by providing \nfree assistance to veterans in an attempt to obtain benefits and \nservices earned through their military service. Because it is not a \ngovernmental agency, Disabled American Veterans is fully funded by \nmembership dues and public contributions.\n  At the conclusion of World War I, Disabled American Veterans was \ncreated to help ease the suffering caused by the effects of World War \nI. Since the beginning, Disabled American Veterans has continually \ngrown and adapted to the needs of disabled veterans. Today, Disabled \nAmerican Veterans is committed to making sure the veterans of Iraq and \nAfghanistan are well cared for upon their return from service.\n  In 1986, the Disabled American Veterans transportation program was \ninitiated in South Dakota. The following year, this program quickly \nexpanded to become nationwide. This program is designed to provide free \nrides for all veterans to VA facilities so that they may attend \nscheduled appointments. In 2005, the South Dakota program alone \ntransported over 20,000 veterans to VA hospitals.\n  On July 1, 2006, the Brookings chapter of Disabled American Veterans \nwill celebrate their 25th anniversary.

Mr. President, this year we celebrate the 100th \nanniversary of the Detroit Salt Mine, and I would like to take this \nopportunity to congratulate them on reaching this important milestone.\n  In 1906, the Detroit Salt and Manufacturing Company began \nconstructing the Detroit Salt Mine. The first few years were \ntumultuous, as the construction itself was so challenging and\n\n[[Page S5715]]\n\ncostly that the company went bankrupt before it began to mine salt. \nFortunately, the company quickly rebounded and completed its first \nmining shaft in 1910. The mine has passed through many hands over the \nyears but is currently operated by the Detroit Salt Company, which has \nowned it since 1997.\n  Today, the Detroit Salt Company solely produces highway deicing salt, \nthe salt that is used to melt the ice that covers roadways during the \nwinter. It provides this salt not only for Michigan roadways but for \nother roads throughout the Midwest. Without this valuable product, our \nroadways would be repeatedly crippled during the winter months, causing \nmassive and regular shutdowns of schools and businesses.\n  It is also important to recognize the Detroit Salt Company's efforts \nto keep its mine safe for its many workers.

Additionally, the company is part of the Detroit \nLocal Emergency Planning Committee, taking an active role in keeping \nnot only its employees, but also the citizens of its community safe and \nsecure.\n  I know my colleagues join me in recognizing the historical \nsignificance of the Detroit Salt Mine and congratulate all of those who \nhave contributed to its success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/12/senate-section/article/S5715-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HONORING ALABAMA'S PRESIDENTIAL SCHOLARS\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I commend four students from my \nhome State of Alabama who have been named members of the 42nd class of \nPresidential scholars. Since its creation in 1964, the Presidential \nScholars Program has honored over 5,000 graduating high school seniors \nfor academic excellence, artistic accomplishments, and civic \ncontributions. These remarkable young people have proven to meet \nrigorous standards of academic excellence and leadership. This year, I \nam proud to announce that Alabama has three Presidential scholars and \none Presidential scholar in the arts.\n  Students designated as Presidential scholars are among only 121 \nselected for this high honor out of over 2,700 applicants invited to \napply. Alabama students selected this year include Amanda R. Long of \nOxford High School in Anniston, AL; Adam M. Trettel of Briarwood \nChristian School in Birmingham, AL; and, Kelly M. McConnaughey of \nVirgil I. Grissom High School in Huntsville, AL.\n  I am also very pleased to share that Sarah C. Campbell, of the \nAlabama School of Fine Arts in Birmingham, AL, has been named one of \nonly 20 Presidential scholars in the arts. These recipients are \nselected from a pool of over 6,500 students for accomplishments in the \nvisual, literary, and performing arts, in addition to their \nscholarship, leadership, and public service.\n  The Presidential Scholars Program not only seeks to honor Our \nNation's finest students but also recognizes the teachers who have been \ninfluential in these students' lives. Each student had the opportunity \nto nominate one exceptional teacher to receive the program's Teacher \nRecognition Award. Teachers play an essential role in our society and \ngive of themselves selflessly in aiding the development of their \nstudents. I applaud the work of these fine teachers: Mrs. Angela L. \nDickert, nominated by Amanda R. Long; Mr. Barry Walker, nominated by \nAdam M. Trettel; Ms. Suzanne Bailey, nominated by Kelly M. \nMcConnaughey; and, Mr. D. Bradford Hill, nominated by Sarah C. \nCampbell.\n  It is fitting and appropriate that we recognize these fine students \nfor their accomplishments and to recognize the teachers that have meant \nso much to their success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/12/senate-section/article/S5715-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HONORING MARY HAND AND PHILIP HOLLEY\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to make some remarks \ntoday about two remarkable educators, Mary Hand and Philip Holley, \nrecipients of the 2005 Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics \nand Science Teaching. This is the Nation's highest honor for teaching \nin mathematics and science. Only 100 7th to 12th grade teachers across \nthe Nation are chosen for this remarkable award, which was established \nby Congress in 1983.\n  Ms. Mary Hand, mathematics teacher at Liberty Middle School in \nMadison, AL, aims to make students comfortable in her classroom and \nencourages them to work in groups. Ms. Hand establishes a classroom \nenvironment that is optimal for student learning, and she aims to equip \nher students with teamwork skills that are essential in the workplace.\n  Mr. Philip Holley, science teacher at Mountain Brook Junior High \nSchool in Birmingham, AL, strives to let students experience science \nand apply what they learn. He uses real-world examples to bring science \nto life in his classroom, which undoubtedly motivates his students and \nenhances their understanding of the importance of science.\n  As a former educator and the father of three children, I realize the \nimportant role teachers play in our society. I am proud to know that \nteachers such as Ms. Hand and Mr. Holley are striving to develop \nstudents' math and science abilities. These skills will surely take \nstudents far in the workplace where math and science are increasingly \nin demand.\n  I commend Ms. Hand and Mr. Holley for their leadership and \nprofessional excellence in education. Their work has impacted the lives \nof many students, and their influence will surely spread for years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/12/senate-section/article/S5715-3", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HONORING MARK LEVIN\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Mark \nLevin, who is celebrating his 25th year with the NCSJ.\n  In his time with NCSJ, Mark Levin has accomplished a great deal. A \nconsummate professional, Mark has spent 25 years moving through the \nranks from a professional staffer all the way to executive director.\n  As the mandated central coordinating agency of the organized Jewish \ncommunity on behalf of the estimated 1.5 million Jews of the former \nSoviet Union, the NCSJ comprises nearly 50 national organizations and \nover 300 local federations, community councils, and committees.\n  Mark has represented NCSJ at conventions, summits, and also here in \nthe Halls of Congress.\n  A distinguished scholar and policy expert, Mark is unmatched in his \nknowledge of the Soviet Jewry, and he was instrumental in restructuring \nNCSJ's tactics following the breakup of the Soviet Union.\n  But while Mark's resume is overflowing with remarkable \naccomplishments, it is the relationships that he has forged over the \nyears that are his finest achievements.\n  For 25 years, Mark has been more than an advocate--he has been a \nfriend.\n  It is those friendships that have made his time with NCSJ special. \nThey are what have taken him from merely influencing policy to \nsignificantly impacting people's lives.\n  And it is those friendships that have brought us all together to \nhonor Mark for 25 outstanding years of service.\n  With that, I would like to thank NCSJ for an opportunity to speak on \nbehalf of Mark, and I would like to offer my thanks and my \ncongratulations to an outstanding colleague and an even better friend, \nMark Levin.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/12/senate-section/article/S5715-4", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5715-S5716]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING HOWARD E. LEFEVRE\n\n Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nlife and achievements of Howard E. LeFevre, entrepreneur, \nphilanthropist, and the founder of The Works: Ohio Center for History \nArt & Technology in Newark, Ohio.\n  Founded in 1996, The Works is a remarkable center of discovery that \nhelped introduce an appreciation for industry, innovation, and the \ncreative process for students and learners of all ages, including the \n45,000 who visited the facilities last year alone. Through a unique \nblend of traditional museum programs, computer labs, art galleries, \ncraft demonstration areas, and interactive classrooms, The Works \nstrives to stimulate analytical thinking and enhance the quality life \nin Licking County and beyond.\n  Through Mr. LeFevre's leadership, The Works has been a catalyst for \nrestoration of downtown Newark, rescuing\n\n[[Page S5716]]\n\nin its first decade four historic buildings that formed the heart of \nNewark's oldest manufacturing area. The Works has been an invaluable \nresource for students of Licking County and the community as a whole.\n  Mr. LeFevre has been an exemplary leader in his community. He is a \npast president of Newark Area and Licking County Chamber of Commerce, \npast president of the Newark Rotary Club, past chairman of the United \nWay Annual Campaign, and past president of the board of directors of \nthe Licking County United Way. Mr. LeFevre is trustee emeritus of and \npast chairman of Governing Committee of Licking County Foundation. He \nis director of the Ohio Chamber of Commerce and a former member of the \nOhio State Development Advisory Council.\n  He was honored by a Distinguished Service Award at the Ohio State \nuniversity in 1976 for his efforts in connection with establishing the \nNewark campus of the university. He was also honored by Licking \nMemorial Hospital with their Lifetime Achievement Award in 1990. In \n2002, Mr. LeFevre was awarded the ``Man of the Century'' by the city of \nNewark during its 2002-2003 bicentennial summer festivities.\n  Mr. President, thanks to LeFevre's dedication, The Works will \ncelebrate its 10th anniversary on June 17, 2006.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing and commending Howard \nE. LeFevre on his lifetime of commitment to the residents of Licking \nCounty as well as people all over the State of Ohio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/12/senate-section/article/S5716-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5716]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/12/senate-section/article/S5716-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5716]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/12/senate-section/article/S5716-3", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5716]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:03 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 5252.

A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to initiate \nand complete\n\n[[Page S5719]]\n\nan evaluation of land and water located in northeastern Pennsylvania \nfor future acquisition and inclusion in a potential Cherry Valley \nNational Wildlife Refuge, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nrequiring the Secretary of the Department of the Interior to conduct a \nstudy evaluating a pristine area in the northeastern part of \nPennsylvania, called Cherry Valley, for its potential designation as a \nnational wildlife refuge. Known for its unspoiled wetlands and riparian \nforests, Cherry Valley provides an important habitat for one of the \nlargest known populations of the threatened bog turtle, as well as for \na plethora of endangered and rare species. Also, due to its location \nalong the Kittatinny Ridge Migration Corridor, Cherry Valley is \ncentrally located along an important migration route for eagles and the \nbroad-winged hawk.\n  Recognized as an environmental treasure by local officials and \nresidents, there is widespread support for Cherry Valley's designation \nas a wildlife refuge. Some landowners have, however, expressed private \nproperty concerns with the proposed designation. It is my hope that by \nrequiring a study, during which the Secretary must consult with \nlandowners and other interested parties, we can fully understand the \nvalue of the Cherry Valley area, as well as address any concerns \nlandowners may have.\n  Representative Paul Kanjorski introduced similar legislation in the \nHouse. I ask for the support of my colleagues in authorizing this study \nto determine whether beautiful Cherry Valley should be preserved and \ndesignated a national wildlife refuge.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. VOINOVICH:\n  S. 3491. A bill to establish a commission to develop legislation \ndesigned to reform tax policy and entitlement benefit programs and to \nensure a sound fiscal future for the United States, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Budget.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the Securing \nAmerica's Future Economy Commission Act, which I am introducing today. \nI ask unanimous consent that my statement and bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  This legislation stems from the need to address our Nation's current \nand future fiscal health. The fact is, we are in dire straits. In the \nsimplest terms, the Federal Government continues to spend more than it \ntakes in. In case anyone has forgotten, the deficit for fiscal year \n2005 was $318 billion--the third largest deficit in our Nation's \nhistory. If we were to take out the Social Security surplus, the \ndeficit would be nearly $500 billion. And if we were to use accrual \naccounting, the accounting method used by American businesses, the \ndeficit would be approximately $760 billion.\n  These deficits only continue to add to our national debt. When I came \nto the Senate in 1999, the national debt stood at $5.6 trillion. Since \nthen, it has increased 50 percent to $8.4 trillion. As a percentage of \nGross Domestic Product, GDP, our national debt has grown from being 58 \npercent of GDP at the end of 2000 to an estimated 66.1 percent of GDP \nby the end of 2006.\n  In fact, the debt continues to grow so quickly that the House of \nRepresentative's fiscal year 2007 budget resolution raises the Federal \ndebt ceiling to nearly $10 trillion. This is only a few months after \nCongress was forced to raise the debt ceiling.\n  These ongoing deficits, coupled with the expected tidal wave of \nentitlement spending, will soon put our Nation in a very unenviable \nposition if thoughtful action is not taken. Moreover, the trust funds \nfor Medicare and Social Security will be exhausted even earlier than \npreviously thought. According to the most recent trustees' report, the \ncost of Social Security and Medicare will grow from nearly 7.4 percent \nof the economy today to 12.7 percent by 2030, consuming approximately \n70 percent of all Federal revenues, crowding out all other \ndiscretionary spending and some other mandatory programs.\n  While entitlements are a major component of our Nation's future \nfiscal health, it is not the only portion. Just as we must look at how \nwe must reform our entitlement programs to maintain our nation's \ncompetitiveness, we must also review our arcane Tax Code.\n  What we should be doing is spending our time on tax reform. We all \nknow that fundamental tax reform is critical. Just as we know the \nentitlement tidal wave is coming, we know that more and more middle \nclass American families are being swept up in the AMT. So I simply \ncannot understand why some of my colleagues want to make so many \nprovisions of the current Tax Code permanent or add new tax cuts when \nwe very well may be eliminating precisely the same provisions as part \nof fundamental tax reform. No homeowner would remodel their kitchen and \nbathroom right before tearing down the house to build a newer and \nbetter one.\n  Simplifying the code to make it more fair and honest could, by some \nestimates, save taxpayers over $265 billion in costs associated with \npreparing their taxes. That would be a real tax reduction, and it would \nnot cost the Treasury one dime. It would be a tax cut that would \nguarantee that people are paying their fair share and would bring more \nmoney into the Federal Treasury.\n\n  Anyone in the know who is watching us has got to wonder about our \ncharacter, our intellectual honesty, our concern about our national \nsecurity, our Nation's competitiveness in the global marketplace now \nand in the future, and last but not least, our ``don't-give-a-dam'' \nattitude about the standard of living and quality of life of our \nchildren and grandchildren. We know the long-term fiscal challenges \nthat are facing our nation. We know that if we continue to move forward \nblindly, we will walk off a cliff.\n  The simple fact is that we can't have it all--we need to set \npriorities and make hard choices--otherwise our children will end up \npaying for it. Last week I voted against the repeal of the estate tax \nand called on Congress to heed Americans' demand for fundamental tax \nand entitlement reform. The SAFE Act shows that I am serious about \nmaking this a priority for Congress.\n  The legislation will establish a commission comprised of 15 voting \nmembers, 3 of which will be appointed by the President, 3 by the Senate \nmajority leader, 3 by the Senate minority leader, 3 by the Speaker of \nthe House and 3 by the House minority leader. The Director of the \nCongressional Budget Office and the Comptroller General of the United \nStates will be appointed as nonvoting ex-officio members of the \nCommission to lend their expertise.\n  The Commission will bring together the best minds associated with \nbudget and economic policies to examine the long-term fiscal challenges \nfacing the United States and recommend reforms. A minimum of six public \ntown hall meetings will be held throughout the country within year to \ndetermine the scope of the problem and consider solutions.\n  At the conclusion of the town meetings, the Commission will present a \nreport to Congress detailing the fiscal problems facing future \ngenerations as well as a framework of long-term solutions. Within 60 \ndays of the presentation of their report to Congress, the Commission \nwill transmit to Congress a legislative proposal designed to: address \nthe imbalance between long-term Federal spending commitments and \nprojected revenues; increase net national savings to spur domestic \ninvestment and economic growth; and improve the budget process to place \ngreater emphasis on long-term fiscal issues.\n  The administration and Congress will each have 120 days to review the \nproposal and develop equivalent proposals if they deem necessary. \nCongress would then be required to vote on the proposals.\n  America's fiscal situation is dire. Nothing is off the table when it \ncomes to ensuring our longterm prosperity and increasing our \ncompetitiveness in the global marketplace. The task is daunting, but \nnow is the time to act. I am thinking not only about the present, but \nabout our children and grandchildren and the legacy--or burden--we will \nleave them.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3491\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S5720]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

Con. Res. 99\n\n       Whereas whales have very low reproductive rates, making \n     many whale populations extremely vulnerable to pressure from \n     commercial whaling;\n       Whereas whales migrate throughout the world's oceans and \n     international cooperation is required to successfully \n     conserve and protect whale stocks;-\n       Whereas in 1946 a significant number of the nations of the \n     world adopted the International Convention for the Regulation \n     of Whaling, which established the International Whaling \n     Commission to provide for the proper conservation of whale \n     stocks;-\n       Whereas in 2003 the Commission established a Conservation \n     Committee, open to all members of the Commission, for the \n     purpose\n\n[[Page S5722]]\n\n     of facilitating efficient and effective coordination and \n     development of conservation recommendations and activities, \n     which are fully consistent with the conservation objectives \n     stated in the 1946 Convention;\n       Whereas the Commission adopted a moratorium on commercial \n     whaling in 1982 in order to conserve and promote the recovery \n     of whale stocks, many of which had been hunted to near \n     extinction by the commercial whaling industry;\n       Whereas the rights of indigenous people to whale for \n     subsistence purposes has been specifically recognized under \n     the 1946 Convention;\n       Whereas the Commission has designated the Indian Ocean and \n     part of the ocean around Antarctica as whale sanctuaries to \n     further enhance the recovery of whale stocks;-\n       Whereas many nations of the world have designated waters \n     under their jurisdiction as whale sanctuaries where \n     commercial whaling is prohibited, and additional regional \n     whale sanctuaries have been proposed by nations that are \n     members of the Commission;\n       Whereas two member nations that lodged objections to the \n     Commission's moratorium on commercial whaling when it was \n     adopted continue to hold such objections, a third member \n     nation asserted a reservation to the moratorium on rejoining \n     the Commission, and one member nation is currently conducting \n     commercial whaling operations in spite of the moratorium and \n     the protests of other nations;\n       Whereas the Commission has adopted several resolutions at \n     recent meetings asking member nations to halt commercial \n     whaling activities conducted under reservation to the \n     moratorium and to refrain from issuing special permits for \n     research involving the killing of whales;\n       Whereas one member nation of the Commission has taken a \n     reservation to the Commission's Southern Ocean Sanctuary and \n     also continues to conduct unnecessary lethal scientific \n     whaling in the Southern Ocean and in the North Pacific Ocean;\n       Whereas one member nation is conducting unnecessary lethal \n     scientific whaling in the Atlantic;\n       Whereas whale meat and blubber is being sold commercially \n     from whales killed pursuant to such unnecessary lethal \n     scientific whaling, further undermining the moratorium on \n     commercial whaling;\n       Whereas the Commission has repeatedly expressed serious \n     concerns about the scientific need for such lethal research \n     and recognizes the importance of demonstrating and expanding \n     the use of non-lethal scientific research methods;\n       Whereas more than 9,150 whales have been killed in lethal \n     scientific whaling programs since the adoption of the \n     commercial whaling moratorium and the lethal take of whales \n     under scientific permits has increased both in quantity and \n     species, and a new program would take minke, Bryde's, sei, \n     fin, humpback, and sperm whales;\n       Whereas, one member nation is harvesting whales on an \n     unprecedented scale in the name of scientific research, and \n     plans to take up to 935 minke whales, 50 humpback whales, and \n     50 fin whales in the Antarctic, and 220 minke whales, 50 \n     Bryde's whales, 100 sei whales and 10 sperm whales in the \n     North Pacific. Sei, sperm, humpback, and fin whales are all \n     endangered species;\n       Whereas engaging in commercial whaling under reservation \n     and lethal scientific whaling undermines the conservation \n     program of the Commission;\n       Whereas discussions are taking place within the Commission \n     on a Revised Management Scheme (RMS) that would regulate any \n     possible future commercial whaling;\n       Whereas any decision to lift the moratorium against \n     commercial whaling, or to allow commercial whaling in any \n     other form, must be taken independently from negotiations and \n     adoption of an RMS;\n       Whereas any RMS must include or be conditioned on the \n     concurrent adoption of provisions similar to those in other \n     international agreements related to fisheries and marine \n     mammals, including transparent and neutral observer \n     mechanisms, and effective compliance and dispute settlement \n     mechanisms;\n       Whereas to be effective, if an RMS is adopted, any future \n     commercial whaling must take place pursuant to the RMS, and \n     without reservation to any of its substantive provisions; and\n       Whereas any decision to lift the moratorium against \n     commercial whaling must be conditioned on the immediate \n     cessation of lethal scientific whaling: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring) That it is the sense of the Congress that--\n       (1) at the 58th Annual Meeting of the International Whaling \n     Commission the United States should--\n       (A) remain firmly opposed to commercial whaling and any \n     linking of adoption of a Revised Management Scheme (RMS) to \n     the lifting of the commercial whaling moratorium or allowing \n     commercial whaling in any other form;-\n       (B) initiate and support efforts to ensure that all \n     activities conducted under reservations to the Commission's \n     moratorium or sanctuaries are ceased;-\n       (C) seek to ensure that any RMS includes, or is conditioned \n     on the concurrent adoption of provisions similar to those in \n     other international agreements related to fisheries and \n     marine mammals, including transparent and neutral observer \n     mechanisms, and effective compliance and dispute settlement \n     mechanisms;-\n       (D) insist that any future commercial whaling must take \n     place pursuant to the RMS without reservations to any of its \n     substantive provisions, and that lethal scientific whaling \n     must immediately cease upon the commencement of any \n     commercial whaling;\n       (E) uphold the rights of indigenous people to whale for \n     subsistence purposes, and firmly reject any attempts to \n     compromise such rights or to equate commercial whaling with \n     such rights;-\n       (F) initiate or support efforts to end the lethal taking of \n     whales for scientific purposes, seek support for expanding \n     the use of non-lethal research methods, and seek to end the \n     sale of whale meat and blubber from whales killed for \n     unnecessary lethal scientific research;-\n       (G) support proposals for the permanent protection of whale \n     populations through the establishment of whale sanctuaries \n     and other zones of protection in which commercial whaling is \n     prohibited;-\n       (H) support efforts to expand data collection on whale \n     populations, monitor and reduce whale bycatch and other \n     incidental impacts, and otherwise expand whale conservation \n     efforts;-\n       (I) support the adoption of an active program of work by \n     the Conservation Committee to address the full range of \n     threats to whales, and otherwise expand whale conservation \n     efforts;-\n       (J) call upon the Contracting Parties to the Convention to \n     submit to the Commission for discussion within the \n     Conservation Committee national approaches, including laws, \n     regulations and other initiatives, that further the \n     conservation of cetaceans; and\n       (2) the United States should make full use of all \n     appropriate diplomatic mechanisms, Federal law, relevant \n     international laws and agreements, and other appropriate \n     mechanisms to implement the goals set forth in paragraph (1).\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution that \nis vital to the protection of our oceans' large whale populations. \nRepresentatives from 69 nations will gather this month in St. Kitt's \nfor the 58th meeting of the International Whaling Commission. The \ndebates in which they will engage will address the future of the \nmoratorium on commercial whaling and other limitations on worldwide \nwhale hunting. For many years, the United States and our allies in the \nfight to conserve whales have held a majority position in this body, \nbut indications suggest that this year our majority may be lost. In \nlight of this, it is more imperative than ever that the United States \nclearly expresses its adamant opposition to any resumption of \ncommercial whaling and continues to set an example as a leader in the \nfight to uphold whale conservation policies.\n  Before the current commercial ban was instituted in 1982, member \nstates attempted to manage whaling with a quota system. Due to \nineffective reporting of catches by whaling nations, this program was \nan abject failure, and it directly necessitated implementation of the \ncommercial ban. Yet over the past year, countries that favor lifting \nthe ban on commercial whaling have continued their efforts to convince \nnations with no inherent interest in whaling to join the IWC and \nsupport measures to reduce whaling restrictions. The ultimate goal of \nthese member states is to lift the moratorium on commercial whaling. \nWhile it appears that the prowhaling states may have a majority at this \nyear's meeting, they likely lack the three-quarters majority required \nto lift the ban. However, a majority would enable these states to make \nprocedural changes that could facilitate their efforts in years to \ncome. Any efforts to remove or weaken the prohibition would set whale \nconservation efforts back decades and fly in the face of the United \nStates and other like-minded countries' well-established position in \nsupport of sound, effective whale conservation.\n  My colleagues and I introduce this resolution to express our ardent \nsupport for the U.S. negotiators as they work to prevent prowhaling \nstates from lifting the ban, and as our delegates attempt to enhance \nexisting conservation methods. Even now, with commercial whaling \nprohibited, certain IWC member states plan to continue to expand their \nkilling of large numbers of whales--including some endangered species--\nfor so-called scientific purposes. However, the IWC and leading marine \nmammal scientists have found that lethal whaling is no longer necessary \nto advance scientific research. In addition, some member states \ncontinue to whale commercially, harvesting an increasing number of \nwhales with every passing year, by taking reservations to the \nmoratorium.\n\n[[Page S5723]]\n\nSuch activities directly undermine the effectiveness of the IWC as a \nwhole and weaken our hard-fought conservation efforts.\n  Although opponents of the commercial whaling ban are unlikely to \noverturn the moratorium this year, we understand that such a ban is \nunlikely to last forever. To this end, the IWC may again consider a \nmovement towards a revised management scheme, or RMS, to govern future \nwhaling conservation and management decisions, including a framework \nfor a sustainable harvest. But certain provisions must be part of any \nRMS if the United States is to support such an action. We must ensure \nthat any RMS contains an increased reliance on sustainability of \npopulations and legitimate scientific knowledge and research. It must \nalso close any existing loopholes--such as the scientific exception--\nthat allow take of whales outside the scheme, had include appropriate \ncompliance, enforcement, and transparency measures.\n  I thank my colleagues who have signed on as cosponsors of this \nresolution for their ongoing support of marine conservation: Senators \nCantwell, Kerry, Dole, Boxer, Feingold, Reed, Lautenberg, McCain, \nLieberman, Collins, Wyden, Dodd, Feinstein, Menendez, Levin, Biden, \nDayton, Jeffords, and Landrieu. Their actions will help ensure that \nwhale populations, so critical to our marine ecosystems, continue to \ngrace our oceans for generations to come.\n  We must continue to support and strengthen the international \nagreements that govern activities detrimental to the well-being of some \nof the world's most threatened large mammals. Changes in the political \nclimate have made our commitment to the protection of these species \nmore vital than ever before, and I urge my colleagues to support swift \npassage of this resolution.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, as ranking member of the Fisheries and \nCoast Guard Subcommittee of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation, I am pleased to join the chairwoman of the \nsubcommittee, Senator Snowe, in submitting a resolution regarding the \npolicy of the United States at the upcoming 58th Annual Meeting of the \nInternational Whaling Commission, IWC. I wish to also thank my Senate \ncolleagues Mr. Kerry, Mrs. Dole, Ms. Boxer, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Reed, Mr. \nLautenberg, Mr. McCain, Mr. Lieberman, Ms. Collins, Mr. Wyden, Mr. \nDodd, Ms. Feinstein, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Levin, Mr. Biden, Mr. Dayton, \nMr. Jeffords, Ms. Landrieu, and Mr. Kennedy for cosponsoring as well.\n  The resolution we introduce today comes at a time when the United \nStates and other like-minded nations are facing new and intensifying \nchallenges within the IWC to adopt policies detrimental to our stated \nopposition to commercial and lethal scientific whaling.\n  In 1982, due to the severe impacts of whaling on the populations of \nlarge whale species, the IWC adopted an indefinite moratorium on all \ncommercial whaling. Although Japan, Iceland, Norway, and other \ncountries in favor of commercial whaling do not yet have the necessary \nthree-quarters majority on the IWC to lift the moratorium, for the \nfirst time they may have the simple majority needed to control \nprocedure and to adopt resolutions contrary to the longstanding \npositions of the IWC. Policies that the United States has opposed in \nthe past, such as secret ballots and statements supporting lethal \nscientific whaling, could be adopted under a simple majority.\n  As Japan and Iceland have gained support for their prowhaling \nposition within the IWC, they have become even more aggressive in their \nutilization of a provision in the convention that allows countries to \nissue themselves permits for ``scientific whaling''. These permits are \ncurrently being used to justify killing whales in the name of science \nand then later selling the meat commercially. More than 9,150 whales \nhave been killed in lethal scientific whaling programs since the \nadoption of the commercial whaling moratorium, and Japan has plans for \na major new program that would more than double its takes of minke \nwhales and expand such whaling to Byrde's, sei, fin, sperm and humpback \nwhales. Furthermore, Japan plans to hunt in the commission's designated \nSouthern Ocean Sanctuary, an area set aside off Antarctica to \nfacilitate whale conservation and recovery.\n  The IWC has repeatedly stated that such lethal takes are not \nnecessary for scientific research. Sei, sperm, humpback, and fin whales \nare all endangered species, and hunting these species undermines the \nIWC's whale conservation program.\n  As was the case last year, discussions are ongoing in the IWC to \nestablish a framework, or ``revised management scheme,'' RMS, for any \nfuture commercial whaling, should it ever occur. In this resolution, we \nurge the U.S. delegation to the IWC to insist that any RMS negotiations \nare distinct from decisions on whether to lift the moratorium on \ncommercial whaling and that an RMS contain provisions on \naccountability, transparency, and compliance. As part of any RMS \nlanguage, lethal scientific whaling must immediately cease upon the \ncommencement of any commercial whaling. The resolution also recognizes \nthe rights of indigenous people to whale for subsistence purposes and \ndirects the U.S. delegation to reject any attempts to compromise or \nequate such rights to commercial whaling.\n  I thank Chairwoman Snowe for her collaboration on this resolution. I \nwill continue to work with my colleagues on this issue to ensure that \nwhales are protected under the International Whaling Commission.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/12/senate-section/article/S5723-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5723-S5724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 100--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT \nAN ARTISTIC TRIBUTE TO COMMEMORATE THE SPEECH GIVEN BY PRESIDENT RONALD \n   REAGAN AT THE BRANDENBURG GATE ON JUNE 12, 1987, SHOULD BE PLACED \n                    WITHIN THE UNITED STATES CAPITOL\n\n  Mr. ALLARD submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Rules and Administration:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 100\n\n       Whereas the people of the United States successfully \n     defended freedom and democracy for over 40 years in a global \n     Cold War against an aggressive Communist tyranny;\n       Whereas President Ronald Wilson Reagan's demonstration of \n     unwavering personal conviction during this conflict served to \n     inspire millions of people throughout the United States and \n     around the world to seek democracy, freedom, and greater \n     individual liberty; and\n       Whereas Ronald Wilson Reagan's determined stand against the \n     Soviet empire during his eight years as President served as \n     the catalyst for the end of that regime: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that an \n     artistic tribute to commemorate the speech given by President \n     Ronald Reagan at the Brandenburg Gate on June 12, 1987, \n     during which he uttered the immortal lines ``Mr. Gorbachev, \n     tear down this wall!'', should be placed within the United \n     States Capitol.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, last Monday was a somber anniversary for \nour Nation--it marked the second anniversary of President Ronald \nReagan's passing. I did not come to the floor last Monday, because I \nknew that today, just a week later, would be another important \nanniversary in Reagan's life, and one I would rather note.\n  Nineteen years ago, on this day in 1987, President Ronald Reagan \nstood at the Berlin Wall, at the Brandenburg Gate and issued his--\nissued liberty's--famous challenge to Soviet tyranny:\n\n       General Secretary Gorbachev, if you seek peace, if you seek \n     prosperity for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, if you \n     seek liberalization: Come here to this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, \n     open this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!\n\n  I believe the power and significance of this quote has been \nacknowledged. I believe history recognizes what President Reagan's \nsteadfast determination to resist communist expansion and even the \ncommunist status quo meant to that great struggle. Many spoke on this \nfloor 2 years ago on his contributions, and most have acknowledged the \nsignificance of those contributions.\n  I am submitting legislation today because President Reagan's \ncontributions to winning the cold war, defending liberty, strengthening \nAmerica and brightening our future can, in my mind, be adequately \nsummarized by the moment he went to Berlin, stood in the shadow of a \ncommunist tyranny, summoned up the force of the American spirit, and \ncalled for the removal of the infamous wall.\n\n[[Page S5724]]\n\n  My resolution calls for an artistic rendering of that moment in time \nto be painted into the Capitol, along with the other significant scenes \nof our Nation's past. As we walk through the building today, we can see \nscenes from the Nation's founding, from the Civil War, our westward \nexpansion, even the Moon landing and Challenger astronauts. I would \nlike to also see Reagan at the Brandenburg Gate. I think it would be \nentirely appropriate to have this image added. It would be an important \nreminder of the struggle this Nation undertook. It would stand for the \nmillions of Americans who did their part for nearly half a century in \nthat struggle, military and civilian. And it would testify to the \ngreatness of our Nation, and the greatness of our 40th President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/12/senate-section/article/S5724-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4196.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON REDEPLOYMENT OF ARMED FORCES \n                   FROM IRAQ.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States Policy in Iraq Act (section 1227 of \n     Public Law 109-163) states that ``calendar year 2006 should \n     be a period of significant transition to full Iraqi \n     sovereignty, with Iraqi security forces taking the lead for \n     the security of a free and sovereign Iraq, thereby creating \n     the conditions for the phased redeployment of United States \n     forces from Iraq''.\n       (2) Congress, through such Act, declared its policy that \n     ``United States military forces should not stay in Iraq any \n     longer than required'' and the people of Iraq should be so \n     advised.\n       (3) In such Act, Congress also stated that ``the \n     Administration should tell the leaders\n\n[[Page S5727]]\n\n     of all groups and political parties in Iraq that they need to \n     make the compromises necessary to achieve the broad-based and \n     sustainable political settlement that is essential for \n     defeating the insurgency in Iraq, within the schedule they \n     set for themselves''.\n       (4) Congress also said, the Executive Branch needs to \n     explain to Congress and to the people of the United States \n     the strategy of the United States for the successful \n     completion of its mission in Iraq.\n       (5) Since March 2003, Congress has appropriated \n     approximately $300,000,000,000 for combat operations in Iraq.\n       (6) The nature of violence in Iraq has changed in the last \n     6 months from insurgent and terrorist conducted attacks to \n     sectarian and ethnic killings, increasing the prospect of a \n     broader civil war and the involuntary involvement of the \n     Armed Forces of the United States in this internal conflict.\n       (7) Trained and equipped security forces of Iraq have \n     increased in number to roughly 250,000 troops, and there are \n     now more than 70 battalions capable of taking the lead in \n     some form.\n       (8) Moqtada al-Sadr and other radical religious leaders \n     control and direct death squads and militia forces, fomenting \n     internecine warfare and the expansion of religious and ethnic \n     tensions that are a major destabilizing factor in Iraq.\n       (9) Iraq has now completed historic elections resulting in \n     the creation of a permanent 275 member assembly and a \n     Constitution, and the recent selection of Prime Minister-\n     designate Nuri al-Maliki will further solidify a governing \n     structure for the country.\n       (10) The establishment of a Parliament and a working \n     government signals an opportunity for the people of Iraq to \n     take control of their own destiny.\n       (11) An open-ended major military presence of the United \n     States in Iraq will continue to inspire efforts by Al Qaeda, \n     Iran, and other state sponsors of terrorism to target \n     directly soldiers of the United States throughout Iraq.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) following 3 years of military operations in Iraq, the \n     United States should transition its missions to a mission \n     that focuses on logistical suppo; and training of the \n     military and police forces of Iraq;\n       (2) the United States should begin to downsize the Armed \n     Forces of the United States in Iraq with the goal of ending \n     the presence of the Armed Forces of the United States in Iraq \n     within 18 months from the date of the enactment of this Act, \n     except for logistical and training personnel;\n       (3) a plan to redeploy the Armed Forces of the United \n     States either to the United States or to other critical areas \n     of potential terrorist conflict such as Afghanistan should be \n     prepared immediately; and\n       (4) a schedule and timeline for the downsizing and \n     deployment of the Armed Forces of the United States in Iraq \n     should be prepared and sent to Congress for review within 60 \n     days from the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Report.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, and once every 3 months \n     thereafter, until all members of the Armed Forces of the \n     United States have redeployed from Iraq, the President shall \n     submit to Congress an unclassified report on the policy of \n     the United States regarding Iraq and the strategic downsizing \n     of the structure of the Armed Forces of the United States in \n     Iraq.\n       (2) Contents.--Each report shall include, to the extent \n     practicable, the following unclassified information:\n       (A) The diplomatic, military, and economic steps being \n     taken to commence the immediate, phased redeployment of Armed \n     Forces from Iraq.\n       (B) Actions being taken by the United States to strengthen \n     the capacity of the Interior, Defense, and other related \n     ministries of Iraq to provide for nationwide security and a \n     stable living environment for all of the people of Iraq.\n       (C) Efforts of the United States to train and logistically \n     support the military, police and other security units of Iraq \n     for purposes of completing the transfer of the duties and \n     responsibility for maintaining peace in Iraq, and providing \n     for a civil and just society in Iraq.\n       (D) Activities of the United States designed to sustain and \n     strengthen a broad-based political settlement among all \n     ethnic and religious groups in Iraq that is essential for \n     defeating the insurgency, successfully combating death squads \n     and militia groups, and restoring law and order across the \n     country.\n       (E) A detailed, substantive overview of implementation \n     plans for a balanced, strategic downsizing and repositioning \n     of Armed Forces in Iraq at the earliest possible date.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 4208.

and\n       (13) the men and women of the United States Armed Forces, \n     the intelligence community, and other agencies, along with \n     coalition partners and the Iraqi Security Forces, should be \n     commended for their courage and extraordinary efforts to \n     track down the most wanted terrorist in Iraq and to secure a \n     free and prosperous future for the people of Iraq.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     Congress--\n       (1) commends the United States Armed Forces, the \n     intelligence community, and other agencies, along with \n     coalition partners, for the actions taken through June 7, \n     2006, that resulted in the death of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the \n     leader of the al-Qaeda in Iraq terrorist organization and the \n     most wanted terrorist in Iraq;\n       (2) commends the United States Armed Forces, the \n     intelligence community, and other agencies for this action \n     and their exemplary performance in striving to bring freedom, \n     democracy, and security to the people of Iraq;\n       (3) commends the coalition partners of the United States, \n     the new government of Iraq, and members of the Iraqi Security \n     Forces for their invaluable assistance in that operation and \n     their extraordinary efforts to secure a free and prosperous \n     Iraq;\n       (4) commends our civilian and military leadership for their \n     continuing efforts to eliminate the leadership of al-Qaeda in \n     Iraq, and also commends the new government of Iraq, led by \n     Prime Minister Jawad al-Maliki, for its contribution to that \n     achievement;\n       (5) recognizes that the death of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi is a \n     victory for American and coalition forces in the global war \n     on terror and a blow to the al-Qaeda terrorist organization;\n       (6) commends the Iraqi Prime Minister Jawad al-Maliki on \n     the finalization of the new Iraqi cabinet;\n       (7) urges the democratically elected government in Iraq to \n     use this opportunity to defeat the terrorist enemy, to put an \n     end to ethnic and sectarian violence, and to achieve a free, \n     prosperous, and secure future for Iraq;
