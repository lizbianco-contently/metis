Mr. President, today the Senate will continue to debate \nthe nomination of Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court. Yesterday, the \nmajority leader, Senator Bill Frist, was forced to file a cloture \nmotion to stop a filibuster from Senators on the other side of the \naisle. That cloture vote will occur at 4:30 p.m. on Monday. It is our \nexpectation that cloture will be invoked and that the Senate will then \nproceed to a vote, a final up-or-down vote, on the confirmation of \nJudge Alito on Tuesday at 11 a.m.\n  I have some remarks I wish to make on the Alito nomination, but \nbefore I do, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, it is very distressing and disappointing \nthat we are now looking at a filibuster of the nomination of Samuel \nAlito to be a member of the U.S. Supreme Court. He has served as a \nFederal appellate judge--outside of Washington, DC, not involved in any \nof the political issues here--for 15 years and during that time has \nassembled an incredibly strong group of admirers who have testified on \nhis behalf to a degree that exceeds almost anything I have had the \npleasure to see as a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee where we \nhad hearings on this matter.\n  The American Bar Association interviewed 300 of his colleagues--\nlawyers who have litigated against him; lawyers who have worked with \nhim; judges who have heard him, whom he practiced before; and his \ncolleagues on the bench.\n  An African-American member of that ABA team--who represented the \nUniversity of Michigan in defending their admissions policy that some \ncalled a quota policy--that individual said, quote: He was held in \nincredibly high regard. In fact, I am not aware of anyone who was \ninterviewed that said anything bad about this nominee.\n  He was at the top of his class at Princeton, and the top of his class \nat Yale Law School where he served on the Law Review. He argued 12 \ncases before the U.S. Supreme Court. There is not more than a handful \nof lawyers in\n\n[[Page S236]]\n\nthis country who have argued even a single case before the Supreme \nCourt, much less 12.\n  Then he was U.S. attorney, prosecuting criminal cases for the United \nStates of America in New Jersey, where he prosecuted Mafia groups and \ndrug dealers and people such as that. He has spent 15 years on the \nbench, demonstrating day after day the judgment, the intellectual \nintegrity, and honesty it takes to be an outstanding judge.\n\n  He is a remarkable nominee. His father was an immigrant from Italy. \nHe grew up in New Jersey, and has had the great honor to be one of \nthose sons of immigrants who got to go to the great University of \nPrinceton. He in every way represents the best there is in American \nlaw. And more than that, he understands what a judge's role is. He has \nexpressed this in so many good ways. Without notes, he talked to us in \nthat committee from his heart.\n  He summed up, time and again, question after question, his view that \na judge has a responsibility to decide the case that is before them, \nnot to set grand policy for America, but to try the case of the \nlitigants that are before them. Somebody has a complaint, and they are \ncomplaining that the law or the Constitution has not been properly \nfollowed, and they are asking for relief. The judge decides each case \nbased on the facts.\n  First, a judge must, with intellectual honesty, find out what the \nfacts are, and, then, after the facts are determined, apply the \nestablished law to that fact situation and render a decision without \nregard to any personal or political views--whether he is a Republican \nor a Democrat, a liberal or a conservative--without regard to any \npersonal, social, religious, or other views he may have. Then he \nrenders that opinion.\n  As Alito said, he learned as a judge you should delay making up your \nmind. It is a habit of mind a judge learns. He hears those facts, he \nthinks about those facts, and considers those facts and makes up his \nmind--only after the full matter has been brought before him and has \nreached its full, ripe point to make a decision. I thought that was a \nvery insightful and wise comment he made.\n  We had a unanimous highest possible rating from the American Bar \nAssociation. As I read last night, one can easily see the tremendous \nadmiration and respect his colleagues on the Third Circuit Court of \nAppeals have for him. They were so impressive in the committee. Several \nof these judges were senior judges. Most of them had served the full 15 \nyears with him on the bench. They have known him. They have seen him in \nprivate conferences. They said he is a man of intellectual honesty. He \nis a man who is fair, unbiased. He never raised his voice, never \nproselytized for his view, but is a man with incredible analytical \nability to get to the heart of a matter and make a just decision.\n  What more could you ask for on the bench? Many of these judges were \nDemocratic appointees. The Third Circuit is not a conservative circuit. \nIt is probably one of the more liberal circuits. It sits in \nPhiladelphia. And to say this man is extreme, outside the mainstream, \nunworthy of serving on the Supreme Court is in itself an extreme \nstatement. It is not justified.\n  The President made a simple promise in this last election that he \nrepeated at every stop he made: I want a judge who will show restraint, \nwho will follow the law and not make law, who does not see it in their \nbailiwick to reset the social policy of America. And we have been \nseeing that type of judgement time and time again. Our colleagues who \nlike what these judges are doing, our Democratic colleagues, \napparently, are not happy with Alito's philosophy of judicial \nrestraint.\n  Now let me tell you, President Bush--this Senator does not believe we \nshould put a conservative activist on the bench, a judge who will \nutilize his opportunity on the bench to promote a conservative agenda. \nThat is politics. That is what we do here in the legislative branch. \nThat is what we are supposed to fight out in this Chamber. The American \npeople have a role to play in it because they can vote us out of \noffice. But if a judge on the Supreme Court of the United States uses \nthat power to interpret the meaning of words in the Constitution to \nundermine the plain meaning of those words, undermine the meaning that \nthe ratifiers and drafters had in mind, to make it say something they \nwant it to say, then they are legislating, they are in this branch.\n\n  It is more dangerous than that because they do not legislate like we \ndo. If we legislate, the next Congress can come in and change it. We \ncan be voted out of office, and they can reverse it by 51 votes out of \nthe 100 Senators. But what if a Supreme Court judge declares that no \nlonger can States define marriage as a union between a man and a woman, \nthat we are going to declare that any association of people can call \nthemselves a marriage and say the Constitution says it? They have a \nlifetime appointment. They never have to answer to the public. They can \nstay on that bench as long as they desire.\n  What recourse do the American people have for that? Only a \nconstitutional amendment, and that takes a two-thirds vote in the House \nof Representatives and the Senate and three-fourths of the State \nlegislatures to overturn it--an incredibly huge task.\n  So it is critically important we have judges who are not activists on \nthe bench, that we have judges who will faithfully apply the law \naccording to the way the constitutional drafters and ratifiers intended \nit, and to follow faithfully the laws of the Congress, and respect \nthose laws as long as the laws passed by the Congress or the States do \nnot conflict with the Constitution, and show some respect to the \nStates.\n  We have had so many of these activities that have gone on in our \nCourt that show a lack of discipline. I pointed out last night that we \nare at the point where one of the courts of appeals that represents 20 \npercent of the people in the United States, the Ninth Circuit, has \nruled that the Pledge we recited which says ``under God'' in it is \nunconstitutional. The U.S. Supreme Court did not reverse it. The U.S. \nSupreme Court simply said that the father who brought that case did not \nhave standing because he did not have custody of the child. Now he has \ngone back and found somebody else and apparently has a plaintiff who \ndoes have standing. I am not sure what the Supreme Court is going to \nrule.\n  Will they next come in here with a chisel and take those words right \nup there on this wall--``In God We Trust''--off the wall of the Senate? \nIt is not such an impossible suggestion. Our Presiding Officer came \nhere shortly after Senator Byrd--but he was here in the Congress, I \nbelieve, as a Member of the House when we put ``under God'' in the \nPledge. And we ratified that again, when this case first came out, in \nthe Senate that we intend that remain the law. But the Court has the \nability--just like that--to strike it down.\n  That is what this issue is about. We talk about the takings case, the \nKelo case, where they redefined the meaning of words that a property \ncan only be taken for a public use. Now they say it can be taken for a \npublic purpose--a big change. It is one thing for the government to \ntake your land to build a dam, or a highway or a public park, but to \ntake your land to build a private shopping center was not what the \nFounding Fathers had in mind. But this is what the Supreme Court ruled, \napparently believing that was too restrictive. It would be better if \nyou could take land for private purposes as long as it had a public \nbenefit and they approved that. Not good.\n  Regardless of what you think of the merits of that takings issue, it \nrepresented a lack of discipline, an activist trend on the Court by \nwhich the judges declared that their personal views would allow them to \nactually bend the plain meaning of the Constitution to have it say what \nthey wanted it to say, not what it actually did say, not what was meant \nfrom the beginning.\n  I am disappointed that we have an objection, any objection to this \nfabulous nominee. President Bush in his campaign promised a judge who \nwould show restraint, that he would be highly qualified and a man or \nwoman of integrity. That is what he submitted. But now we are looking \nat a filibuster. I am not kidding. I thought we had settled that issue. \nBut now we are facing a filibuster. They have put it in their news \nreleases, Democratic Senators. Apparently, the former Presidential \ncandidate for the Democratic Party in the last election, who obviously \ndid not\n\n[[Page S237]]\n\nwin, called back from Davos, Switzerland, to say that they ought to \nfilibuster. Count him in. He urged a filibuster. The assistant \nDemocratic leader in the Senate, Senator Durbin, apparently is \nsupporting a filibuster of this nomination. It is not right. This is a \nsolid, mainstream judge who was rated, unanimously, the highest rating \nthe American Bar Association gives. He has the unanimous support of his \nfellow judges on the Third Circuit, Democrats and Republicans. He has \nan extraordinary record and resume in every respect. They want to \nfilibuster this nomination. I know the People for the American Way want \nit. I know the National Abortion Federation and other abortion groups \nwant it.\n  We are Senators. We have to ask ourselves: Is this where we are \nheading? Is this what we are about, that we are now going to take \nnominees with the kind of respect Judge Alito has and subject them to a \nfilibuster? It was discussed in this past election. The American \npeople, I am convinced, strongly support the kind of judge Judge Alito \nwill be. They don't want an activist judge setting social policy. They \nabsolutely understand this issue.\n  I had the pleasure to follow one of our most outstanding young \nSenators last night, Mr. John Thune of South Dakota. He made a \nremarkable speech. He concluded it by saying he campaigned on this \nissue in South Dakota. He promised to vote for this kind of judge. I am \nthinking, whom did he beat? He beat the former Democratic leader of the \nSenate, the former majority leader for a short time, Senator Tom \nDaschle, who was leading filibusters to obstruct up-and-down votes on \nhighly qualified nominees. I submit to the Members of this body that \nthe people of South Dakota were not happy with that. In large part, \nSenator Thune is here today because of the obstruction of the Democrats \nover the last several years of highly qualified nominees who simply \nbelieve a Federal judge should show restraint and follow the law. That \nis all we want. That is all the American people want. That is what we \nhave a right to expect in Federal judges.\n  What kind of filibuster is this we are seeing? It is almost amusing. \nWhere are the Senators? I was here last night. I followed three \nRepublicans talking. We were supposed to be in session until 8. Nobody \nfrom the other side of the aisle showed up to talk. I am not sure there \nare any around today to complain. They are supposed to be telling us \nwhy this man should not be on the bench. We have been here for 2 days, \nand fewer than 25 Democratic Senators have come to the Senate floor. It \nhas been a pretty vacant situation. Republicans shut down the Senate \neach night. Nobody seems to want to come and raise the issues and \ndebate them. If they want to filibuster, if they have serious concerns, \nI suggest they come down and express it. Let's talk about it.\n  My colleague, Senator Specter, during the Judiciary Committee \nhearings gave the Democratic Senators every opportunity they desired to \nraise, for as long as they wanted to, any issues they had with Judge \nAlito. He allowed them to call a whole host of witnesses who would be \ncritical. The truth is, I don't think any of them knew Judge Alito. \nMost of them had axes to grind one way or the other from some political \nagenda they had. Even out of that group, I don't think but one or two \nactually said they were against him. Laurence Tribe raised some \nconcerns, but he never said he was against the nominee or that he \nshould not be confirmed. He is a professor himself, and he knows the \nlegal expertise Judge Alito brings to the court.\n  If you have something to filibuster about, come on down. Why put us \nthrough this? Senator John Cornyn has called this effort needless and \nstrange. That is a good definition. Other words come to mind: \npointless, political.\n  The Democratic leader, Senator Harry Reid, went before the Democratic \ncaucus, according to the New York Times, just last week and urged his \ncolleagues to vote against this nomination. They made it a political \nagenda item to block this nomination. Is it Presidential politics or \npolitics in general? I submit both. Senator Reid's spokesperson, when \nasked, said: Well, they want to get as many votes as they can against \nhim to make it an issue in the election--for politics, not a question \nof whether the judge is ready, qualified, and able to serve.\n  Maybe this is some sort of theory that, We can reward our base--the \nNational Abortion Rights Action League, the People for the American \nWay, the Alliance for Justice, some of those leftwing groups that have \nbeen driving the process for years. Maybe it will keep them happy. \nMaybe they will keep sending money. Maybe they will keep attacking \nGeorge Bush and saying he is appointing extremists to the bench. Maybe \nthat is what they are trying to do.\n  There is no basis to object to this nominee. There is absolutely no \njustification for denying him an up-or-down vote, which is what the \nfilibuster attempts to do. We can all agree, I suppose, that it is an \ninternational filibuster because it was apparently hatched in Davos, \nSwitzerland, where Senator Kerry now is with those masters of the \nuniverse trying to figure out the world economy. Maybe they ought to \nspend more time trying to get gasoline prices down than worrying about \nconjuring up a filibuster of a judge as able as Judge Alito. They are \nnot here in the Chamber, and that is what we have every right to \nexpect.\n\n  Maybe, since they are abroad, they are worried about Judge Alito's \nposition on foreign law. We have seen a trend with members of the U.S. \nSupreme Court. Recently, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg went to New York \nand made a speech in some great detail--shocking, to me; I have \nrecently read the speech--in which she defended the citation and \nconsideration of foreign law to determine how to interpret American \nlaw. This is contrary to our American legal system. A judge's duty is \nto apply the plain meaning of the words, if there is some dispute about \nit, to look to the legislative history or maybe the background of the \nbill from an American perspective, not a European perspective.\n  For example, in Roper v. Simmons in 2005, the case held that the \nexecution of individuals who were under the age of 18 at the time they \ncommittee a capital crime violates the 8th and 14th amendments, \noverruling a previous precedent of the Supreme Court. Our liberal \ncolleagues have been very strong in claiming that we should stick to \nprecedent, particularly when they talk about abortion. But in that \ncase, the court reversed Stanford v. Kentucky.\n  The majority of the Supreme Court, trying to interpret the \nConstitution of the United States, spent almost 20 percent of its legal \nanalysis discussing the laws of Britain, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Iran, \nNigeria, and China.\n  We have a lot of complaints. People are not happy with rulings of the \nCourt. Many times, those rulings are justified and we are simply \nunhappy with the result. We are concerned about it. Maybe it is not \njustified. But I believe the American people understand that this is a \ndangerous trend by the Court that they would seek to interpret American \nlaw by looking to Nigeria and China--red China, last I heard--Yemen, \nwhere there are terrorists, and Iran, a pariah to the international \ncommunity. They are quoting them, discussing what their views of our \nConstitution are relative to cruel and unusual punishment. Regardless \nof what one believes about the merits of the case, legislatures \nabsolutely should discuss the age at which an execution should occur, \nbut what does the Constitution say about it? That is what the Supreme \nCourt is supposed to be deciding, not what they think ought to be done.\n  In Grutter v. Bollinger in 2003, Justice Ginsburg looked outside the \nConstitution to make her decision, noting with approval that the \nInternational Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial \nDiscrimination allowed for such discriminatory practices or \n``maintenance of unequal or separate rights for different racial \ngroups.''\n  This is a question under our Constitution which says that every \nAmerican, whether they are of minority or majority ancestry or \nbackground, is entitled to equal protection of the law. That raises \nsome questions about quotas and matters of that nature. So in her \ndecision, did Justice Ginsburg look at our Constitution, which \nguarantees every citizen, regardless of their race, equal protection of \nthe law? What did she look at? She considered the\n\n[[Page S238]]\n\nInternational Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial \nDiscrimination. That is not a basis for an American Justice to lay an \nopinion. We have seen a lot of that.\n  Let me briefly cite what Judge Roberts said about that:\n\n       If we're relying on a decision from a German judge about \n     what our Constitution means, no President accountable to the \n     people appointed that judge and no Senate accountable to the \n     people confirmed that judge, and yet he's playing a role in \n     shaping a law that binds the people in this country. I think \n     that's a concern that has to be addressed.\n\n  Absolutely, he is correct. He goes on to say:\n\n       In foreign law, you can find anything you want. If you \n     don't find it in the decisions of France or Italy, it's in \n     the decisions of Somalia or Japan or Indonesia or wherever. \n     As somebody said in another context, looking at foreign law \n     for support is like looking out over a crowd and picking out \n     your friends. You can find them, they're there. And that \n     actually expands the discretion of the judge. It allows the \n     judge to incorporate his or her own personal preferences, \n     cloak them with the authority of precedent because they're \n     finding precedent in foreign law, and use that to determine \n     the meaning of the Constitution. I think that's a misuse of \nprecedent, not a correct use of precedent.\n\n  I say to the President pro tempore that if he chooses to speak at \nthis time, I would be glad to yield if he would like.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair is happy to accept that offer.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Before I yield, I have been making humor here about \nSenator Kerry over in Davos, Switzerland, calling for a filibuster back \nhere. One of the issues we have with regard to the confirmation of \njudges is that judges show restraint and be faithful to our law, not \n``foreign law.'' There is no doubt that Judge Alito and Justice Roberts \ndo not agree that we ought to be quoting foreign law to justify legal \nopinions in the United States. Judge Alito said this:\n\n       I don't think we should look to foreign law to interpret \n     our own Constitution.\n\n  Amen to that.\n  He said this:\n\n       Our Constitution does two basic things. It sets out the \n     structure of our Government and it protects fundamental \n     rights. The structure of our Government is unique to our \n     country, and so I don't think that looking to decisions of \n     supreme courts of other countries or constitutional courts in \n     other countries is very helpful in deciding questions \n     relating to the structure of our Government.\n\n  Amen to that.\n  He went on to say:\n\n       As for the protection of individual rights, I think we \n     should look to our own Constitution and our own precedents. . \n     . . Our country has been the leader in protecting individual \n     rights.\n\n  Are we going to look to China, Yemen, or Iran on that issue? He goes \non to say:\n\n       I don't think that it's appropriate or useful to look to \n     foreign law in interpreting the provisions of our \n     Constitution. . . . I think the Framers would be stunned by \n     the idea that the Bill of Rights is to be interpreted by \n     taking a poll of the countries of the world.\n\n  That is the kind of judge we need on the bench. That is the kind of \njudge President Bush promised to nominate. That is the kind of judge he \nsent up here, and he deserves confirmation.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson). Without objection, so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have spoken before, of course, on this \nnomination. I want to emphasize some of the points I have made.\n  The Constitution, as we know, gives the Senate a central role in the \nconfirmation of a Supreme Court Justice. Nothing in our makeup, nothing \nin the history of this country assumes that the Senate would be a \nrubber stamp for the President's nominees. After all, it was the Senate \nthat turned down some nominees of George Washington--the most popular \nPresident and the greatest President in this country's history--because \nit would not be a rubber stamp. It was an overwhelmingly Democratically \ncontrolled Senate at the time of Franklin Roosevelt, and it was that \nSenate that said to Franklin Roosevelt: You cannot pack the Supreme \nCourt.\n  I have said, also, many times that the Senate should be the \nconscience of the Nation. After all, we are the only 100 people in this \ncountry of 295 million Americans who get a chance to vote on lifetime \npositions to the Supreme Court--people who will affect our personal \nrights for decades to come.\n  Now, I have voted on every one of the current nine members of the \nU.S. Supreme Court. I actually voted on some who are no longer there. I \napproach each one the same way. Is this going to be a Supreme Court \nJustice for all Americans? That is what I asked about Judge Alito.\n  He came before our Senate Judiciary Committee with a record he has \ncreated over the last 30 years. As a judge, and before that as a high-\nranking Government official appointed to a succession of posts by \nRepublican Presidents, Judge Alito seemed consistently to defer to \nExecutive power and to show little empathy for the plight of ordinary \nAmericans. His record also suggested a pattern of saying what he needed \nto say to get to the next job. Certainly, nothing in his record, \nnothing in his job application indicated he felt very strongly about \nchecks and balances and the three branches of Government.\n\n  Now, in the course of this nomination and the hearings, he sought to \nretreat from his own words; but even trying to retreat, he did not. The \nhearing provided him with an opportunity to explain his record. It was \nan opportunity he chose to squander. The President's supporters and \nmany Republican Senators on the committee urged him not to be \nforthcoming. My gracious, the 18 members of that committee are the only \nones who get to ask him questions on behalf of all 295 million \nAmericans, and some urged him not to answer questions. He had the \nchance to answer some of the troubling questions that his past words \nand actions raised. He had the opportunity to demonstrate that his \nreplacement of Harriet Miers was not what it appeared to be--the \nPresident selecting somebody whom he knew he could count on to support \nGovernment power and the expansive doctrine of the ``unitary \nExecutive,'' and someone the extreme faction in the President's party \nfelt assured would march with Justices Scalia and Thomas in their \nculture war.\n  So it was an opportunity to answer questions--an opportunity he did \nnot take. The hearings and the whole confirmation process left us with \nmore questions and greater concerns than we had before. I have \ndiscussed his failure to assure us that he would be an effective check \nand balance on Executive power. He failed to show me or the American \npeople that when he recited platitudes such as ``nobody is above the \nlaw,'' he was not telling us what he thought he needed to say to get \none more promotion.\n  When I voted for John Roberts as Chief Justice, a conservative \nRepublican nominated by a conservative Republican, I voted for him \nbecause I looked at him and I thought, ``Would George Bush or Patrick \nLeahy, or George Smith or Patrick Jones, get fair treatment? And would \nwe be heard on what the facts and the law would be?'' I believed we \nwould. But I don't have that same confidence with Judge Alito.\n  One question for the Senate is whether Judge Alito takes seriously \nhis promises to the Senate and his obligations to avoid the appearance \nof impropriety. He had an opportunity to talk about his numerous \nfailures to recuse himself from cases during the nomination period, and \nhe didn't accept that opportunity.\n  In 1990, Mr. President, Judge Alito came before the Senate. I was \nhere at that time. He was seeking confirmation to the Third Circuit \nCourt of Appeals. He made a pledge--and they are made under oath--that \nhe would recuse himself from five categories of cases: cases involving \nthree different financial companies with whom he had dealings, cases in \nwhich his sister's law firm represented a party, and cases he had \noverseen as the U.S. Attorney in New Jersey. Someone in that \ncircumstance who would not make such a pledge might not have been \nconfirmed. But I was disappointed to discover that, despite making this \nexplicit promise to disqualify himself in these cases, he failed to \ndisqualify himself in\n\n[[Page S239]]\n\nat least four of the five categories from which he had sworn he would \ndisqualify himself. In fact, he apparently failed to put several of the \ncompanies on the so-called recusal list. These were companies from \nwhich he said he would recuse himself if matters involving them came up \nbefore the Third Circuit. He did not even give their names to the clerk \nto make sure that happened.\n  I don't suggest that he in any way got any financial benefit from \nthis. I doubt that he did. But, again, he was making promises to get \npromoted to the next job. Once he got promoted, the promises were \nforgotten.\n  One case we have heard a lot about involving the Vanguard funds, in \nwhich he had invested hundreds of thousands of dollars, and which he \nexpressly included in his 1990 pledge to the Senate, is particularly \ntroubling--not just because of his involvement but for the various \nreasons he gave, shifting reasons, for why he did not recuse himself. \nFirst, he said he didn't realize it was a case involving Vanguard. The \nword ``Vanguard'' appears in the case name three times and in the case \npapers many more times. He said the clerk had moved to a computerized \nrecusal system, so there was a computer glitch, and that may have been \nwhy he was assigned the case. Well, he would have seen Vanguard in the \ncase name three times. He said: Well, I didn't benefit from it. We were \ngetting a little bit into ``the dog ate my homework.'' Why not just \nsay, ``I screwed up?''\n  After significant investigatory work and pressing for answers, we \nfound that Vanguard was not on his computerized list to identify \nconflicts, so a computer glitch could not have occurred. He finally \nacknowledged--and I give him credit for this--having stated for weeks \nand weeks that there was a computer glitch, he finally acknowledged \nthat there was not. Why not say, ``I screwed up'' and accept the \nresponsibility? He acted like the Bush Administration most often does \nwhen it errs, by blaming others: his surrogates attacked those raising \nquestions, while he proffered numerous conflicting excuses.\n  For example, one of his many explanations was contained in a letter \nhe wrote to Chairman Specter. He contended that the 1990 promise he had \nmade to the Judiciary Committee in order to become a Circuit judge only \napplied to his ``initial service'' and that he later, apparently \nsecretly and unilaterally, decided that his promise to this Committee \nhad been ``unduly restrictive'' and that he need not follow it anymore. \nHe did not so inform the Judiciary Committee or the Senate of these \ndeterminations at any time before his 2005 nomination to the Supreme \nCourt. Moreover, it is wholly inconsistent with his finally adding the \nVanguard companies to his recusal list in December 2003. This letter \nseems more like self-serving, after-the-fact rationalizing than it does \na truthful explanation for what had happened in 2003. As we discovered \nthrough due diligence, Vanguard and Smith Barney were not on the \njudge's automatic recusal list even in 1993. There is no reason to \nthink they were on there before that. It certainly does not seem that \nJudge Alito tried to live up to his sworn commitment to the Senate even \nduring what he would have to concede was his ``initial service'' period \nas a Circuit judge.\n\n  Moreover, the ``initial service'' excuse makes no more sense with \nrespect to his Vanguard investments than it would with respect to his \nsister. She did not cease being his sister after some ``initial \nservice'' period of his on the bench. In fact, his Vanguard investments \nsignificantly increased over the period of his service on the bench. \nThe ``initial service'' concept in the Judiciary Committee's approach \nto recusal applies to transition from a law practice to the bench. \nThus, for example, once the cases on which he had been involved while \nthe U.S. Attorney in New Jersey had run their course, he was not \nprohibited for all time from hearing cases from that office. \nEventually, even he had to acknowledge at the hearing that this \n``initial service'' argument was not the real reason he failed to \nrecuse from the Vanguard case, even though that had been the argument \nhe made in a written response to our Committee's chairman.\n  To the end, Judge Alito has failed to take responsibility for his \naction. Instead, the best he can do is to admit at his hearing that he \n``just didn't focus on the issue of recusal'' and that ``no light went \noff.'' There was no remorse, no apology, and no embarrassment for the \nstring of conflicting and inaccurate explanations he gave during the \ncourse of this nomination. Accordingly there is no reason to think that \nif he becomes a Supreme Court Justice he will focus any better on \nconflict of interest and appearance of conflict issues, in a system \nwithout accountability. I voted against the nomination of Justice \nRehnquist to become Chief Justice in large measure because of his \ninvolvement in a case in which he should not have been. I take these \nmatters very seriously. It is apparent that this nominee does not.\n  In his 1985 job application for a job in the Reagan administration--\none that he said he was careful in doing--he very proudly included his \nmembership in the Concerned Alumni of Princeton, or CAP, which he \ntermed ``a conservative alumni group.'' Actually, he named only two \ngroups he had been associated with, that one and the Federalist \nSociety. He was also a member at the time of the Princeton Club in \nWashington. He didn't include that. He didn't include anything else. \nThe reason I mention this is that he knew exactly what memberships to \nwhat clubs would appeal to those in the Meese Justice Department. Some \nwould say that is being wise. But why emphasize membership in a group \nsuch as the Concerned Alumni of Princeton? Nobody would suggest that in \nhis hiring practices or in the way he lives Judge Alito is biased \nagainst women or minorities, but the Concerned Alumni of Princeton \nreceived national attention for resisting the admission of women and \nminorities--African Americans and others--into Princeton. Why brag \nabout being part of such an organization?\n  These same people only a generation earlier surely would have \nresisted the admission of people from Italian immigrant families. I \ntake that rather personally. My mother's family were Italian \nimmigrants. I still have relatives in Italy today, uncles, aunts, and \ncousins, who talk about how proud they are of their sons and daughters \nwho have gone to America.\n  I also think of a different era when my Irish father, as a teenager, \nhad to face signs: ``No Irish need apply'' or ``No Catholics need \napply.'' As a result, we grew up in a family where we learned that all \ndiscrimination was wrong.\n  Why brag about even a loose affiliation with a group that advocated \nany kind of discrimination?\n  Because it had been in the press, I thought I would help the judge \nout. I asked him about this. I figured it would be a simple \nexplanation; that he would make it very clear that he was opposed to \nthem. Instead, he said: I don't really remember that group. We alerted \nhim ahead of time that he was going to be asked that question. He said: \n``I don't remember that,'' even though it was on his application.\n  Then he said: Well, I think it was because of the concern that ROTC \nwas not being allowed on the Princeton campus. Good explanation, \nexcept, of course, by 1985 ROTC was back on the Princeton campus. \nNeither CAP's own materials nor media accounts suggest that ROTC was a \nprimary focus for CAP at the time. And of course, that was not an \nanswer to my question. My question was why he touted his membership in \n1985. He never answered my question.\n  Those little facts, inconvenient facts, that come in. They were not \ninconvenient at the time he was applying for a job with Edwin Meese. \nThen it was something of which to be proud. Now applying for a job on \nthe U.S. Supreme Court it is: I don't remember why I did it.\n  I will give him the benefit of the doubt. I will accept he was not \nvery active in the group. But then that goes all the more to why he \nemphasized it in his job application especially to that administration, \nto the Meese Justice Department. That was the most ideological and \npartisan administration we had seen until the present time. So it is \nlogical to think that he proudly proclaimed his membership in CAP and \nthe Federalist Society, as well as his support of Republican candidates \nand conservative causes and his recent submission of articles to the \nAmerican Spectator, to establish his right-wing credentials to help win \nthat coveted\n\n[[Page S240]]\n\npromotion. It seems apparent that he said all this in 1985 to show \nthose making promotion decisions that he was not just a traditional \nconservative, but a ``movement conservative,'' and that the activists \nin control of political promotions at the Meese Justice Department and \nthe White House could rely on him.\n  I am concerned he tried too hard back then to fit in with those in \npower, and it makes me wonder, when he was being screened for this job, \nwhen he met in that private closed-door meeting with Vice President \nCheney, Karl Rove, and Scooter Libby, what he said to them. In this \ntime of Executive overreaching, illegal spying, and expanding \nGovernment power, what the American people need is a Supreme Court that \nis willing to stand up for the liberties and rights of all Americans, \nnot someone who curries favor with the powerful.\n  I am especially interested in these circumstances because, as you \nknow, Mr. President, Judge Alito was the third person President Bush \nnominated for this particular seat. The second one, Harriet Miers, he \nnominated and then got a firestorm of criticism from Republicans, not \nfrom Democrats, but from Republicans, from some within the Republican \nParty who made it very clear to the President: You can't nominate her \nbecause we are not sure how she will vote. We are not sure that she \nwill vote the way we want her to.\n  Finally, the President--in a humiliation for him--was forced to \nwithdraw her name. He came forth with Judge Alito, and those same \npeople said: He is great. We are confident about how he will vote. We \nare fine with him.\n  I am concerned, as well, about his failure to be forthcoming in \nanswer to my questions about CAP. I would have been more willing to \ngive Judge Alito the benefit of the doubt if he had taken the \nopportunity the hearings provided to come clean about all this. He gave \nme no adequate answers. When Senator Schumer raised the matter of his \ninclusion of CAP on his job application again, on another day, later in \nthe hearing he hinted at what he had done in 1985 but still would not \nown up. He said:\n\n       [Y]ou have to look at the question that I was responding to \n     and the form that I was filling out. I was applying for a \n     position in the Reagan Administration, and my answers were \n     truthful statements, but what I was trying to outline were \n     the things that were relevant to obtaining a political \n     position.\n\n  But he stopped far short of answering because he had gotten himself \ninto another box by his previously saying to us that he had no \nrecollection of CAP. He concluded with the following:\n\n       Well, Senator, since I don't remember this organization, I \n     can't answer your question specifically, but I think that the \n     answer to the question lies in the nature of the form that I \n     was filling out and the things that I put.\n\n  Regrettably, when he had been asked by ABA representatives about his \nputting CAP in his 1985 job application and whether he was \n``pandering,'' he failed to take that opportunity to reflect on what he \nhad done and own up to the matter, as well. Instead, according to Marna \nTucker's testimony, he answered that he put CAP on that application \nbecause ``it would be improper to not tell the truth on an \napplication'' and ``that he was a member of that organization.'' That \nanswer says a lot.\n  He is right that it is ``improper to not tell the truth on an \napplication,'' but that does not explain why he chose to list CAP. The \nform does not call for him to list all clubs and affiliations. The form \nused to seek political advancement during the Reagan Administration \nasked for something else, a demonstration of partisan, political \ncommitment. It said: ``Please provide any information that you regard \nas pertinent to your philosophical commitment to the policies of this \nadministration,'' and asked applicants whether ``you ever served on a \npolitical committee or been identified in a public way with a \nparticular political organization, candidate or issue.'' That is why he \nincluded CAP, an organization that in the mid-1980's was a place that \nactivists like Dinesh D'Souza and other rising stars in the \nconservative movement favored.\n\n  Regrettably, at his hearing, and under oath, Judge Alito evaded. He \ncould not remember, tried to say the right things about discrimination, \nstood by while his supporters attacked the question and then watched as \nhis supporters pushed so hard that they made his wife break down in \ntears. I do not think that the Republican Senator who pressed that \nawkward line of defense intentionally meant to upset Mrs. Alito, but \nRepublican partisans have turned that moment that they created into a \npartisan weapon.\n  Like the matters of recusal, the CAP issue is another that Judge \nAlito could have put to rest by being more forthcoming at the outset. \nHe has never answered the question of why he touted his membership in \nCAP in 1985. To me the true answer seems obvious. Indeed, in a news \naccount that appeared on the last day of the hearings, his mentor at \nthe Department of Justice in those days admitted what was really going \non in that 1985 application. Charles Cooper, who was the Assistant \nAttorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel and Samuel Alito's \nsupervisor, said:\n\n       The only purpose of that essay was to satisfy the Office of \n     Presidential Personnel that he was simpatico with the Reagan \n     Administration's legal policy agenda. He went on to call \n     Samuel Alito's 1985 statement ``his essay of his political \n     bona fides.''\n\n  Judge Alito's 1985 job application is an ideological manifesto that \ngoes a long way to explain why the same people on the far right who \nshot down the President's nomination of Harriet Miers, because they \nwere not assured how she would rule, rushed to support Judge Alito when \nhis nomination was announced.\n  I looked at his job applications. He wrote:\n\n       [I]t has been an honor and source of personal satisfaction \n     for me . . . to help advance legal positions in which I \n     personally believe very strongly. I am particularly proud of \n     my contributions in recent cases in which the government has \n     argued in the Supreme Court that racial and ethnic quotas \n     should not be allowed and that the Constitution does not \n     protect the right to an abortion.\n\n  These are his words. He was eager to highlight his work in the \nSolicitor General's Office, which should be a place where lawyers honor \nworking in a nonpartisan and professional manner, rather than seek to \ntwist it to partisan political ends.\n  We have seen a few of the documents he produced in that office, but \nthe Bush administration's regime of secrecy has prevented the Judiciary \nCommittee and, of course, the Senate, and, of course, the American \npeople from reviewing most of his work from his time there. This was \nwork done during a Republican administration that litigated and lost \nthe famous Bob Jones University case about tax breaks for institutions \nthat discriminate; that lied to Congress about the EPA and Iran-Contra; \nthat sought to overrule Roe v. Wade; and that sought to roll the clock \nback on fundamental rights to equal protection.\n  The hearing gave Judge Alito an opportunity to do either of two \nthings. He could have embraced his statement from 1985 and his record \nas a judge and set out to explain why his deferential view of \npresidential power and his restrictive view of individual rights are \nappropriate for a justice who is supposed to be there for all 290 \nmillion Americans. We could have had the great ideological debate that \nso many on the far right seemed to want to have when the President's \nnominee was Harriet Miers. Or he could have disavowed the 1985 job \napplication and much of his record as a judge and told us that he would \nin fact be a check on the President and protect the fundamental \nconstitutional rights of all Americans. He did neither. Instead he \nrefused to share his views and tried to finesse his statements in the \n1985 application and limit them ``technically.'' He was so unresponsive \nthat commentators from across the political spectrum have called for an \nend to Supreme Court confirmation hearings since they reveal so little \nabout the nominee's thinking.\n  For example, he said that his statements about privacy represented \nhis views at the time, but that he would view the issue with an ``open \nmind'' as a justice with the authority to cut back, or overrule the \nrights expressly recognized in Roe v. Wade. Judge Alito never disavowed \nhis 1985 statement that in his legal view the Constitution does not \nprotect a woman's right to choose. In fact, he responded to Chairman \nSpecter that his statement in 1985 was a ``true reflection of [his] \nviews at the time'' and ``the position that [he] held at the time.''\n\n[[Page S241]]\n\n  We also have his multi-page memorandum on the Thornburgh case from \nhis days in the Solicitor General's office--one of the handful that \nslips through the veil of secrecy that the Bush Administration sought \nto construct--in which he asserts his legal view that Roe was wrongly \ndecided and should be overruled, but that tactically the better \napproach would be to incrementally undermine its legal authority.\n  This one memo is enough to demonstrate why such material should have \nbeen produced rather than hidden by this Administration so that the \nSenate and the American people would have the nominee's views and \nrecord. The Bush Administration refuses to produce Samuel Alito's work \nat the Solicitor General's office and at the Office of Legal Counsel. \nWho can tell what those other writings would reveal about the nominee's \nlegal views? The Washington Post recently reported that Charles Cooper \nhas now indicated that Samuel Alito worked on defending the Reagan \nAdministration in connection with the Iran-Contra crimes by working on \nlegal theories so that they would not have to inform the Congress which \nwas investigating in its oversight capacity. What else did Samuel Alito \nwork on that is being hidden from the Senate and the American people?\n\n  On the issue of a woman's right to choose, we also have Judge Alito's \nopinion in Casey in which he follows the script he laid out in his \nmemorandum to the Solicitor General and finds no state regulation an \nundue burden on a woman's right to choose. Of course, the Supreme \nCourt, including Justice O'Connor herself, were in place then to hold \nthe line in Casey, reaffirm Roe and reject Judge Alito's position.\n  He would not testify what his legal view is today. He made it very \nclear he continues to believe that Roe v. Wade was wrongly decided. In \ndescribing how to decide a case where there is a precedent, he left out \na step. He left out the step where the Justice, knowing there is a \ncontrolling precedent, decides whether the precedent was correctly or \nincorrectly decided. If a Justice believes the preceding case was \ncorrectly decided, he has no reason to go on to make the other \ncalculations about weight and reliance and all the other factors that a \nJustice is to consider when deciding whether to overrule past \nprecedent. He did not mention that step, though. In other words, Judge \nAlito's testimony presupposes that he continues to believe now what he \nbelieved in 1985, that Roe v. Wade was wrongly decided. Otherwise his \nanswers make no sense. A justice does not waste time worrying about \nfactors and weight and reliance when he considers the precedent \ncorrectly decided; that happens only when he is considering whether to \noverrule or limit that precedent.\n  I mention this as just one more case. Much has been said about Roe. \nBut for this Senator, it goes way beyond the question of Roe. It goes \nto the question of, to what extent would you allow a President to step \naside from checks and balances? All his writings indicate a President \nshould be able to do that. He is one of the strongest proponents I have \nheard in my life speaking about the so-called ``unitary Executive.''\n  What does that mean in real life? It means this President, more than \nall Presidents in history--all Presidents in history--has used the \nAlito theory to say: Even though I signed a law, even though I signed \nsomething into law, I don't have to follow it because I am the \nPresident.\n  There are only two Presidents I have heard say that something is not \nillegal if the President does it: One is Richard Nixon, and the other \nis George W. Bush, and President Bush has used the Alito theory to make \nthis argument 103 times.\n  That means he can sign a law saying the United States must obey our \nown laws, our treaties on torture, and then quietly write a separate \npage saying: However, as President, I will decide when we will follow \nthat law.\n  Judge Alito's contradictory testimony at the hearing about his view \nwere revealing. He went to great lengths to distance himself from his \npublic endorsement of Judge Bork's unsuccessful nomination to the \nSupreme Court. He had called Judge Bork one of the most qualified \nnominee of the last century and was effusive in his praise--until asked \nabout it at the hearing. There he sought to backtrack. He sought to \nexcuse his comments as those of a political appointee supporting his \nemployer's nominee, but had to concede that was not an accurate \nexplanation for his comments. Only when pressed did he concede that he \nindeed thinks highly of Robert Bork's candidacy.\n  And when Senator Kohl asked him for his views of whether the Supreme \nCourt should have taken the case of Bush v. Gore, his evasiveness \nreminded me of when I asked Clarence Thomas whether he had ever \ndiscussed Roe v. Wade with anyone. Senator Kohl was not even asking his \nviews on the holding of that case.\n  We are in a pivotal constitutional moment in our history with a \nsingle fundamental question: Will the Senate serve its constitutional \nrole and preserve the Supreme Court as a constitutional check on the \nexpansion of Presidential power?\n  The reason Presidential power issues have come to dominate this \nconfirmation is because we clearly have arrived at this crucial \njuncture in our Nation and at our highest Court over one simple \nquestion: Is the President of the United States above the law? I feel \nvery strongly none of us are. You, Mr. President, are not, I am not, \nthe President of the United States is not, the other 98 Senators are \nnot, judges are not.\n  The Framers knew that unchecked power leads to abuses and corruption, \nand the Supreme Court has to be the ultimate check and balance in our \nsystem. Vibrant checks and balances are instruments in protecting both \nthe security and the liberty of the American people.\n  This great, wonderful country of ours has existed for well over 200 \nyears because we have those checks and balances and because we protect \nthe liberties of individual Americans--all Americans, not just those \nwho fit into one narrow political ideology, but all Americans, all \nAmericans, all Americans, from any part of this country: Americans who \nexpress popular ideas or unpopular ideas, a free press, free \nobservation of religion, a free people. We have to have the Supreme \nCourt as the ultimate check and balance, and the independence of the \nCourt is crucial to our democracy and way of life.\n  The Senate, as I said before, should never be allowed to become a \nrubber stamp and neither should the Supreme Court. We owe it to the \nAmerican people today and Americans in generations to come to ask \nseveral essential questions:\n  Can this President, or any President, order illegal spying on \nAmericans?\n  Can this President, or any President, authorize torture in defiance \nof our criminal statutes and our international agreements?\n\n  Can this President, or any President, defy our laws and Constitution \nto hold American citizens in custody indefinitely without any court \nreview?\n  Can this President, or any President, choose which laws he will \nfollow and which he will not, by quietly writing a side statement when \nhe signs a bill into law?\n  These are some of the most vital questions of our time, and they are \namong the most vital questions that confront the Senate in considering \nthis nomination to our highest Court. Judge Alito's record, and his \nresponses--and his failure to adequately answer questions about these \nissues--are deeply troubling.\n  Regrettably, Judge Alito approached the question of a lifetime \nappointment to succeed Sandra Day O'Connor on the U.S. Supreme Court as \na job application process that resembled a political campaign with two \ndistinct parts. First, he had to get the nomination, which he sought as \na committed arch-conservative and as a reliable vote in favor of \nGovernment power. That mission was accomplished when he was named to \nreplace the nomination of Harriet Miers with the support of the \nPresident's most extreme supporters. That was his primary campaign. The \nSenate confirmation process is more the equivalent of a general \nelection in which he strives to appear as middle-of-the-road as \npossible. Unfortunately, what he did not do successfully was to \nreconcile the two roles.\n  I will vote against this nominee. I believe the President picked him \nfor his demonstrated legal views which are a stark contrast to the \nimage the White\n\n[[Page S242]]\n\nHouse and the handlers and supporters have attempted to create.\n  Mr. President, I see the distinguished senior Senator from Alaska. I \nappreciate his courtesy and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I first want to comment about the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Arlen Specter. Knowing the \nhealth challenges he has faced in the past, witnessing this Senator's \nstrenuous schedule in the last few months has been something to watch, \nto have the opportunity to witness his commitment to the Senate and to \nhis role as chairman of the Judiciary Committee.\n  I commend him very much for his dedication to his job and to his \nfunction as chairman of the Judiciary Committee. He has come through \nsome very serious medical periods in his life, but he has distinguished \nhimself in recent months in demonstrating his total commitment to the \nwork of the Senate. I honor him for the job he has done in conducting \nthese hearings.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield on that one point? I \ntotally agree with what he said about Senator Specter, who has been an \nexample not just to the other 99 Senators but to the whole country.\n  I am going to be honored to present him with an award, Tracy's Kids, \nawarding him for, among other things, primarily the example he has set \nfor the rest of the country that somebody can face a very serious \ncrisis and handle it with courage, dignity, and stalwartness. To all \nthe people who suffer various forms of cancer--the distinguished \nSenator knows personally, and I know a dear member of my family--this \nkind of inspiration helps a great deal.\n  I cannot thank the Senator from Alaska enough for the words he just \nsaid.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator who serves with the \nchairman with great dignity on the Judiciary Committee. I cannot appear \nhere without recognizing the serious illnesses that Senator Specter has \ngone through and survived and the energy he has shown despite those \nillnesses.\n  To me, there is no doubt that Judge Samuel Alito is well qualified to \nserve on the Supreme Court. He has served as Assistant to the Solicitor \nGeneral and as U.S. attorney for the District of New Jersey. He was \nunanimously confirmed by this Senate to serve on the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Third Circuit, and he has argued some 12 cases before \nthe Supreme Court. He is well respected by our Nation's legal \ncommunity. Seven of his current and former colleagues on the U.S. Court \nof Appeals for the Third Circuit testified in support of his \nnomination, and one of the former circuit judges who testified \nsupporting his nomination was the former judge Jim Gibbons, who was a \nclassmate of mine at law school and is a man whose judgment I respect \nvery much.\n\n  Judge Alito also received a unanimous ``well-qualified'' rating from \nthe American Bar Association, and our majority colleagues on the \nJudiciary Committee have reported his nomination to the Senate \nfavorably on a unanimous basis.\n  In my some 38 years now in the Senate, I have voted to confirm 16 \nnominees to the Supreme Court and 2 to the position of Chief Justice. \nIn each instance, I have followed the advice of the Judiciary Committee \non these votes, and I have always voted for a nominee based upon his or \nher qualifications. I have not been influenced by a Justice's personal \npolitical beliefs or the party affiliation of the President who sent \nthe nomination to the Senate.\n  For me, the decision to vote for Judge Alito is not a simple one. I \nam proud to come from a family with a long line of very strong pro-\nchoice women, and I have reflected their judgment here in the Senate. I \nam from a different generation. I remember well when a woman's right to \nchoose to have an abortion was not recognized by our law. The reversal \nof Roe v. Wade would be destabilizing for our country and for our \nFederal system. It could and probably would lead to a battle to amend \nthe Constitution to reassure American women of their rights, their \nconstitutional rights. Such a battle is unnecessary as long as the \nJustices of the Supreme Court honor the doctrine of stare decisis.\n  I asked Chairman Specter to give me some of the pertinent portions of \nthe testimony before the Judiciary Committee, and over the past few \ndays I have spent much time reviewing Judge Alito's answers to the \nquestions posed to him by members of the Judiciary Committee. Those \nanswers reflect a deep respect for precedent and for the doctrine of \nstare decisis.\n  On the third day of his confirmation hearing, Judge Alito told the \nJudiciary Committee this:\n\n       Roe v. Wade is an important precedent of the Supreme Court. \n     It was decided in 1973, so it has been on the books for a \n     long time. It has been challenged on a number of occasions . \n     . . and the Supreme Court has reaffirmed the decision; \n     sometimes on the merits; sometimes--in Casey--based on stare \n     decisis.\n       And I think that when a decision is challenged and it is \n     reaffirmed, that strengthens its value as stare decisis for \n     at least two reasons.\n       First of all, the more often a decision is reaffirmed, the \n     more people tend to rely on it. Secondly, I think stare \n     decisis reflects the view that there is wisdom embedded in \n     decisions that have been made by prior justices who take the \n     same oath and are scholars and are conscientious. And when \n     they examine a question and they reach a conclusion, I think \n     it's entitled to considerable respect. And, of course, the \n     more times that happens, the more respect the decision is \n     entitled to.\n\n  Another portion of Judge Alito's testimony also influenced my \nthoughts on this vote. On the second day of the hearings, Judge Alito \ntold the Judiciary Committee that if a case involving abortion comes \nbefore the Supreme Court while he serves on that Court:\n\n       The first question that would have to be addressed is the \n     question of stare decisis . . . and then, if I were to get \n     beyond that, if the Court were to get beyond the issue of \n     stare decisis, then I would have to go through the whole \n     judicial decision-making process before reaching a \n     conclusion.\n\n  This quote reflects the process Judge Alito stated he will follow to \nevaluate the cases that come before him if he serves on the Supreme \nCourt. I understand his comments to mean he will seek consensus among \nhis colleagues on the Supreme Court regarding the issues involving \nstare decisis. While serving on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, \nJudge Alito ruled on three cases related to abortion. In each of these \ncases, he demonstrated a respect for and a deference to established \nrules of law. He did what he believed the law required; he did not seek \nto enact a personal political agenda. In fact, he told Senator Sessions \nduring the confirmation hearings, in answer to a question of Senator \nSessions:\n\n       If I had been out to implement some sort of agenda to \n     uphold any abortion regulation that came along, then I would \n     not have voted the way I did in that Elizabeth Blackwell \n     case.\n\n  Based on his past rulings and his testimony before the Judiciary \nCommittee, I believe Judge Alito would respect stare decisis on the \nissue of Roe v. Wade or on any issue that comes before the Court where \nthat should be respected. And as I vote to confirm his nomination, I do \nso on the assumption that Judge Alito will uphold this commitment, \nwhich he stated on the record, to stare decisis, a process he outlined \nfor reviewing cases involving stare decisis.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI. Thank you, Mr. President. I rise today in support of the \nnomination of Judge Samuel A. Alito, Jr., to be an Associate Justice on \nthe U.S. Supreme Court. As a Senator, I have enjoyed the rare privilege \nof serving while the Senate considered two nominations to the U.S. \nSupreme Court in a short period. However, I am saddened to lose the \nknowledge and expertise of two experienced jurists from the Nation's \nHigh Court.\n  The nominations of Chief Justice Roberts and Judge Alito have given \nus an opportunity to reevaluate the current relationship between the \nthree branches of Government in comparison with the intentions of the \nConstitution. The evaluation shows that we have shifted into an era of \njudges who legislate. We must return to the elementary doctrines that \nrecognize the important and distinct roles of each branch. Congress is \nelected by the public to represent them as legislators. Through voting, \nthe public may reaffirm or replace office holders. There is no such \ncheck on federal judges. They are not elected by the public and they\n\n[[Page S243]]\n\nshould not use their positions to legislate.\n  In Judge Alito, President Bush has nominated a judge who recognizes \nthe difference between his role and the congressional role. During his \nnomination hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Judge Alito \nshared his thoughts on the judicial role:\n  ``The judiciary has to protect rights, and it should be vigorous in \ndoing that, and it should be vigorous in enforcing the law and in \ninterpreting the law . . . in accordance with what it really means and \nenforcing the law even if that's unpopular. But although the judiciary \nhas a very important role to play, it's a limited role. . . . It should \nalways be asking itself whether it is straying over the bounds, whether \nit's invading the authority of the legislature, for example, whether it \nis making policy judgments rather than interpreting the law. And that \nhas to be a constant process of re-examination on the part of the \njudges.''\n  I have carefully reviewed Judge Alito's qualifications and watched \nthe recently completed Senate confirmation hearing. The testimony \nprovided by Judge Alito and the other witnesses underscore his \ncommitment to the rule of law and a fair and impartial judiciary that \ninterprets the law rather than legislates from the bench.\n  Judge Alito has an excellent judicial reputation as being highly \nintelligent and fairminded. He was unanimously confirmed by the U.S. \nSenate to serve as U.S. attorney for the District of New Jersey. In \nthat capacity, Judge Alito argued 12 Supreme Court cases and at least 2 \ndozen court of appeals cases and handled at least 50 others. In 1990, \nPresident George H. Bush nominated Judge Alito to the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Third Circuit, and he was again confirmed unanimously \nby the U.S. Senate.\n  I believe Judge Alito knows the difference between benches and bills, \nCourts and Congress. His appointment will move the Court back closer to \nthe brand of justice the Framers of our Constitution intended, and I \nintend to support him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, the most momentous votes I have cast \nduring my years in this Senate were on two war resolutions, one against \nal-Qaida and the Taliban, which I supported, and the other against \nIraq, which I opposed.\n  After those life-and-death decisions, I cannot recall another vote of \nmore long-lasting importance than on the two nominees for the United \nStates Supreme Court: Chief Justice Roberts and now Judge Alito. The \nstatements of my colleagues which I have witnessed have evidenced the \nutmost seriousness with which we have undertaken this grave \nresponsibility.\n  The Constitution does not prescribe any criteria which a President \nmust consider in choosing his nominees for the Supreme Court. Neither \ndoes the Constitution prescribe any criteria by which Senators must \nconsider those nominees and decide whether to vote for or against their \nconfirmations. We must each establish our own measures, search our own \nconsciences, and make our own individual decisions.\n  Most of this process has been appropriately dignified and respectful, \nas it was with Chief Justice Roberts. I myself was not troubled by the \ndetailed questioning of either nominee during their Judiciary Committee \nhearings. That is the one and only opportunity for any Senators to \nquestion a nominee in a public forum, before all Senators must decide \nwhether or not to confirm that person to be one of nine Supreme Court \nJustices for the rest of his or her life. No other public office in \nthis country offers such longevity and almost irrevocable security as \nFederal judiciary.\n  I want to commend the members of the Judiciary Committee. I certainly \nwant to associate myself with the remarks of Senator Stevens regarding \nthe distinguished chairman, Senator Specter, whose personal courage and \nintegrity are examples for us all, and the ranking member, Senator \nLeahy, who also holds himself to those high standards. I have read the \ntranscripts from their confirmation hearings. Their questions, and the \nextensive research which informed them, brought, I believe, great \ncredit upon them and their committee.\n  Judge Alito's answers were also illuminating about him, although not \nin the same way as committee members' questions. A New York Times \nheadline best summarized for me Judge Alito's responses: It said, ``700 \nAnswers; Few Glimmers.'' Again and again, his answers were evasive. \nSome were simply not believable.\n  I would find it difficult to support Judge Alito's confirmation, \ngiven his past opinions, as expressed during his 15 years as a Federal \nCircuit Court Judge and also prior to that time as an official in the \nReagan administration. I find it impossible to support him, given his \nrecent lack of candor and credibility before the Judiciary Committee.\n  Let me give some examples. On the critical question of whether he \ncontinues to believe, as he stated in 1985, that the Constitution does \nnot provide a woman with the right to make her own reproductive \ndecisions, regardless of how they affect her life or her health, Judge \nAlito would not give an answer. Nineteen times he was asked whether he \nbelieved Roe v. Wade was ``settled law,'' as Chief Justice Roberts \naffirmed during his Judiciary Committee hearings, as ``super \nprecedent'' as the distinguished committee chairman suggested, or \nsimply whether he had changed his 1985 position. He rejected the first \ntwo and refused to answer the third. My colleague, Senator Schumer, \ntried seven times to get a straight answer to a very straightforward \nquestion:\n\n       In 1985 you stated--you stated it proudly, unequivocally, \n     without exception--that the Constitution does not protect a \n     right to an abortion. Do you believe that now?\n\n  Judge Alito's replies included:\n\n       I would address that issue in accordance with the judicial \n     process as I understand it and I have practiced it. . . .\n\n  and:\n\n       Senator, I would make up my mind on that question if I got \n     to it. . . .\n\n  The most Judge Alito would say about Roe v. Wade or the subsequent \nCasey Supreme Court decisions was that they were precedents. As my sons \nused to say, ``Well, duh.'' Everyone knows that every prior Supreme \nCourt decision constitutes a precedent. Again and again--and again--\nJudge Alito invoked this platitude about respect for stare decisis, \neven though, as Senator Coburn pointed out, precedents have been \noverturned by the Supreme Court more than 170 times involving some 225 \ncases.\n  Senator Coburn had the candor to state clearly that he wants Roe v. \nWade to be overturned, so I can only assume that his pointed historical \nreferences were intended to reassure all with similar views that they \ncould continue to rely on Judge Alito to help form a Supreme Court \nmajority which would reverse Roe v. Wade.\n  Judge Alito is certainly entitled to his personal views and \nconstitutional interpretations. The American people are entitled to \nknow what they are before he is placed on their Supreme Court for the \nrest of his life, because his views and interpretations will profoundly \naffect their lives and the lives of future Americans.\n  Unfortunately, Judge Alito denied most of us those answers. It is \nnoteworthy, however, that the Senators who feel most strongly about \noverturning Roe v. Wade all support Judge Alito and seem comfortable \nwith his nonanswers. I can't imagine such equanimity without other, \nprivate assurances that the nominee's bland platitudes belie a bedrock \nanti-Roe predisposition, as he stated candidly in 1985.\n  Certainly, the country's anti-abortion activists get it. The \nthousands of them who marched on the Capitol last Tuesday reportedly \ncheered every time Judge Alito's name was mentioned. Quoting parts of \nthe New York Times and Washington Post reports:\n\n       We must support the confirmation of Judge Alito and other \n     jurists who will support a strict-constructionist view of the \n     law and make it possible once and for all to end Roe v. \n     Wade.'' Rep. Mike Pence (R-Ind.), a leading House \n     conservative, thundered.\n       While Mr. Bush made no explicit mention of his nomination \n     of Judge Samuel A. Alito Jr. to the Supreme Court, the \n     expectation that the judge would soon win Senate approval and \n     join a majority in overturning Roe was clearly the \n     overarching message of the rally. . . .\n\n  Most chillingly:\n\n       Nellie Gray, the president of March for Life, the group \n     that organized the rally, said reversing Roe was this year's \n     theme. Speaking to the crowd in fiery tones, Ms. Gray \n     predicted that the United States would hold the\n\n[[Page S244]]\n\n     equivalent of Nuremberg trials for ``feminist abortionists,'' \n     calling support for a woman's right to choose ``crimes \n     against humanity.''\n\n  Let me turn to other subjects. I agree with my colleague from \nOklahoma, who told Judge Alito on the third day of the Judiciary \nCommittee hearings:\n\n       Integrity, I think, is the No. 1 issue.\n\n  I always feel uncomfortable to stand in judgment of another person's \nintegrity--or other matters of personal character--especially someone \nwhom I do not know personally. No one is perfect. I like to say that \nthere are no saints in politics--only shades of sinners.\n  Yet I agree with Senator Coburn about the importance of integrity in \na candidate for such a high public office as the United States Supreme \nCourt or the U.S. Senate.\n  So, I am very troubled by Judge Alito's answers to the Senate \nJudiciary Committee about two incidents: his membership in the \nConcerned Alumni of Princeton University and his initial failure to \nrecuse himself from the case involving the Vanguard Group.\n  Judge Alito acknowledged to the committee that he himself listed his \nmembership in the Concerned Alumni of Princeton University in his 1985 \napplication for appointment by then-President Reagan to an important \nposition in the U.S. Department of Justice. Presumably, he considered \nhis membership to be a positive reason for his favorable consideration. \nYet he repeatedly professed total ignorance of the organization's \nrepeatedly expressed, very extreme prejudices against the admission of \nwomen and minorities to his alma mater. His only acknowledged glimmer \nof recollection was that he was concerned about the status of ROTC on \nthe Princeton campus, even though, the committee research found ROTC \nhad been readmitted by Princeton way back in 1973, and the only \nreference to it found in the Concerned Alumni's publication, Prospect, \nwas in 1985, ``ROTC is popular again.''\n  I find it not believable that Judge Alito would have no recollection \nof the extreme and extremely controversial views of the Concerned \nAlumni at the time he joined the organization or listed it as one of \nhis credentials for the Reagan administration 20 years ago. He is too \nintelligent. His mind is too sharp. He recalls in great detail his \njudicial decisions and writings during the past 15 years and their \nprecedents from the previous 200 years. He remembers the details of \ndecisions in 1969 about ``one person--one vote.'' He remembers the \ncontext for other controversial statements in his 1985 application and \nsubsequently. Yet he professes to be unable to remember why he joined \nthe Concerned Alumni of Princeton University, why the president of \nPrinceton wrote to all Princeton alumni in 1984, calling the \norganization's extremist views ``callous and outrageous,'' or why he \nthought his membership would enhance his appeal to the Reagan \nadministration. I find it absolutely unbelievable.\n  I am also troubled by many of Judge Alito's answers to questions \nabout his initial failure to recuse himself from a case involving the \nVanguard Group, in which he had a financial interest that preceded his \nappointment to the Third Circuit Court in 1990. During those \nconfirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Judge \nAlito promised, in writing:\n\n       I would disqualify myself from any cases involving the \n     Vanguard Companies. . . .\n\n  I could accept--with reluctance, but I could accept--Judge Alito's \nadmission that his failure to recuse himself was an ``oversight'' for \nwhich he accepted responsibility, after he and the White House \ninitially tried to pass it off as a computer glitch. As Senator \nFeingold established, there is no evidence that Judge Alito ever \nregistered his promise to the committee on the Court's recusal form in \n1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, or any time before he failed to recuse himself \nin 2002.\n  Then, however, Judge Alito reached for the escape hatch that Senator \nHatch offered him, i.e., that his 1990 promise applied only to \n``conflicts of interest during your initial service in the position to \nwhich you have been nominated.''\n  In the committee transcript, Chairman Specter said:\n\n       You, in response to Senator Hatch, did not believe that you \n     are bound by the promise, because you said in your mind that \n     you felt that it was just for the initial aspects of it.\n\n  Senator Kennedy said:\n\n       That's another issue, because initially was meant to \n     include the investments that you had at that particular time. \n     You might have those investments and then discard an \n     investment and, therefore, no longer have a conflict. That is \n     what the asker of the question had intended. But you've added \n     another wrinkle to it. You've just indicated that when you \n     made a pledge to the committee that you were going to recuse \n     yourself, that you thought that at sometime you were going to \n     be released. . . .\n\n  Judge Alito responded:\n\n       Senator, as I said, I can't tell you 15 years later exactly \n     what I thought when I read that question. It refers to the \n     initial period of service. And looking at it now, it doesn't \n     seem to me that 12 years later is the initial period of \n     service.\n\n  I know from my own experience--as Judge Alito should also know--that \na financial conflict of interest lasts for as long as the financial \ninterest. It is not in any way limited or mitigated by time. That is a \nmatter of integrity, not interpretation.\n  In other areas, I am deeply troubled by Judge Alito's well-documented \nbiases against individual Americans and in favor of large and powerful \ncorporations and government organizations. The Knight Ridder \nNewspapers, which publishes two of Minnesota's three largest \nnewspapers, did an excellent analysis of Judge Alito's judicial record. \nI would like to quote excerpts from it.\n  It begins:\n\n       A Knight Ridder review of Alito's 311 published opinions on \n     the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals--each of singular legal or \n     public policy importance--found a clear pattern. Although \n     Alito's opinions are rarely written with obvious ideology, \n     he's seldom sided with a criminal defendant, a foreign \n     national facing deportation, an employee alleging \n     discrimination or consumers suing big businesses.\n       A review of Alito' s work on dozens of cases that raised \n     important social issues found that he rarely supports \n     individual rights claims. The primary exception has been his \n     opinions about First Amendment protections. Alito has been a \n     near freespeech absolutist in his writings, and he's been \n     equally strong on protecting religious freedoms.\n       But even some of his First Amendment opinions underscore \n     the bent in the rest of his work. He hasn't strictly enforced \n     church-state separation, and his love of the First Amendment \n     seems to stop at the prison walls. He has written opinions \n     that would deny prisoners access to reading materials and \n     curtail their rights to practice their religious beliefs.\n       In other areas, Alito often goes out of his way to narrow \n     the scope of individual rights, sometimes reaching out to \n     undo lower-court rulings that affirmed those rights.\n       Alito has been particularly rigid in employment \n     discrimination cases.\n       Many conservative jurists set a high bar for plaintiffs who \n     allege racial, gender or age bias in the workplace, but Alito \n     has seldom found merit in a bias claim. In most of the \n     employment discrimination cases, Alito succeeded in \n     applying a standard higher than the Supreme Court requires \n     to plaintiffs' claims, often forcing them to prove that \n     bias was the motivation behind their misfortunes. In two \n     cases, Alito dissented from 3rd Circuit rulings that \n     allowed discrimination claims to proceed. In one, a racial \n     discrimination case involving a black hotel maid, Alito \n     agreed that the woman had been treated unfairly, but he \n     said that the employer had produced enough evidence to \n     show that the unfair treatment didn't amount to illegal \n     discrimination.\n       Although Alito is the son of Italian immigrants, his record \n     in immigration cases is similar to his perspective in \n     criminal cases. He's demonstrated an inclination to defer to \n     the judgment of the immigration courts, which are under the \n     Justice Department's umbrella. As a result, a noncitizen \n     fighting deportation is paddling upstream with Alito.\n       Legal scholars, and some of Alito's supporters, have \n     pointed to his decision in the case of Parastoo Fatin, a \n     young Iranian woman who was fighting deportation in the early \n     1990s, as evidence of his scholarship and his impact on \n     immigration law. Alito ruled in Fatin's case that gender-\n     based persecution could be grounds for asylum. But the ruling \n     was a hollow victory for Fatin. She lost her case when Alito \n     found that she hadn't shown enough factual evidence to prove \n     that she'd be persecuted if she were sent back to Iran. It \n     was typical Alito--an impeccably crafted decision that denied \n     relief to an individual.\n  Finally, I am very concerned with Judge Alito's view of executive \npower which reigns supreme over Congress and the judiciary. That \nradical view threatens the checks and balances the Constitution created \namong the three coequal branches of government to protect our democracy \nand the rights of all American citizens.\n  All Senators--not just those on my side of the aisle--should be \ndeeply troubled about Judge Alito's position on Executive power. He \nbelieves the President has the right to interpret laws as\n\n[[Page S245]]\n\nhe wishes, rather than as they are written.\n  As one illustration, while he served as Deputy Assistant Attorney \nGeneral in the Reagan administration, Judge Alito recommended the use \nof interpretive presidential ``signing statements''--statements issued \nby the President when signing a bill not only to explain why the \nPresident signed it into law but also to provide his view of how the \nlaw should be interpreted.\n  The apparent purpose of such statements is to encourage the courts to \npay as much attention to the President's interpretation of a law as \nthey do to the legislative branch and give the President the ``last \nword on questions of interpretation.'' Judge Alito explained that such \nstatements would ``increase the power of the Executive to shape the \nlaw.''\n  He also wrote in that memo: A ``President's understanding of a bill \nshould be just as important as that of Congress.'' As a recent Los \nAngeles Times editorial stated, ``On its face, the assertion threatens \nto undermine the fundamental constitutional principle that it is for \nCongress to write the laws and for the executive to well execute \nthem.''\n  President Bush has issued over 100 signing statements since 2001. The \nmost notable was his signing statement a couple days after he signed \ninto law H.R. 2863, the Department of Defense emergency supplemental \nappropriations, which contained Senator McCain's amendment banning \ninhumane treatment of detainees by U.S. personnel. The President, in \nhis signing statement, basically asserted he could ignore parts of the \nlaw he had just signed under his constitutional authority.\n  Nowhere in the Constitution does it say a President can ignore the \nparts of a law he doesn't like.\n  Nowhere in the Constitution is there mention of ``signing \nstatements.'' The Constitution makes it very clear under article I, \nsection 7 what the President can do with legislation that Congress has \nenacted. He can sign it into law as it is written by Congress or he can \nveto it. There is no other option.\n  For almost 190 years, our country's first 39 Presidents followed this \nvery clear language of the Constitution. However, then-Deputy Assistant \nAttorney General Alito in 1985 decided that he could ignore all those \nprecedents and try to fabricate this ill-considered power for the \nPresident.\n  As yet, the Supreme Court has not been called upon to decide whether \nthis unprecedented exaggeration of Presidential power is \nConstitutional. Can there be any doubt, however, how Judge Alito would \nvote in such a case?\n  In closing, some critics are blaming the Senators who oppose Judge \nAlito for the absence of bipartisan unanimity in support of the \nPresident's nominee. Their blame is misplaced. The way to get broad, \nbipartisan consensus for a Supreme Court nominee is for the President \nto nominate someone from near the middle of the judicial mainstream, a \nnominee who promises to be a Justice for all of the American people, \nnot just for those on one side of the social spectrum.\n  President Bush initially proposed someone who might have offered that \npossibility: Harriet Miers. In addition to her moderately conservative \nviews, she would have maintained the Court's gender imbalance at two \nwomen and seven men. By contrast, if Judge Alito is confirmed, that \nappalling under-representation of America's women will become even \nworse. Our nation's highest court, the ultimate arbiter of the rights \nand protections for all citizens, will be comprised of eight men and \nonly one woman, of eight Caucasians and only one minority.\n  Unfortunately, the activist extremists on the country's political \nright erupted against Ms. Miers. Their vicious denunciations of the \nnominee and threats of political reprisals against her supporters \nprevailed, before her capabilities could be reasonably considered.\n  Now some of that nominee's destroyers are sanctimoniously bemoaning \nthe absence of unanimous support for this nominee.\n  Unfortunately, their sound and fury, as Shakespeare said, signify \nnothing. Sadly, their winning this confirmation will not be a victory \nfor this country because, tragically, they profoundly misunderstand the \nessential reason for the Supreme Court, which is to protect each one of \nus from all the rest of us, to protect the ``life, liberty, and pursuit \nof happiness'' of a minority of Americans from the potential domination \nby the majority.\n  The nine men and women on the Supreme Court must protect everyone by \nbelonging to no one. The goal of ``taking over'' the Supreme Court is \nshortsighted, narrow-minded, and wrong. Their success is America's \nperil. For our great Nation to continue to succeed, any and every such \neffort must fail. That failure is America's victory.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allen). The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, let me begin by congratulating the Senator from \nMinnesota for an absolutely superb presentation of the arguments that \nare at stake in this choice which the Senate faces. I think he has done \na terrific job of summarizing a great many of those issues in the broad \nscope of those issues, and I particularly appreciate the last comments \nhe made about the absence of unanimity and the divisions in the Senate \nover their vote.\n  None of us should forget the debate Harriet Miers met with a storm of \ncriticism--not from this side but from the other, from the rightwing. \nIn fact, she became more unacceptable to the Republicans because she \ndid not make clear which ideological direction she would take the \nCourt, rather than for the very broad-based appeal she would pose to \nthe country.\n  The reason we are here with this decision is not because of a choice \nwe have made. It is because of a choice the President has made. It is \nbecause that is the direction the President wants to move in. We have \nhad countless opportunities in the Senate where we have had votes on \nnominees which have garnered 100 votes, 98 votes, 95, 90. Anyone who is \nwatching understands that the Senate is divided on this nominee. At \nthis pivotal moment in our country's history with the issues we face, \nthat is not the way to tip the balance of the Court or to move the \nCourt in an ideological direction.\n  The critical question here is, Why are we so compelled to accept in \nsuch a rush a nominee who has so clearly been chosen for political and \nideological reasons? That is the real question. Our job is to advise \nand consent. No one understands better than I do the consequences of an \nelection and what happens when a President wins. I have heard \ncolleagues say: Well, the President won. He has a right to make his \nchoice.\n  Yes, he does. And the choice he has made is an ideological choice to \ntake the Court in a certain direction. That is his choice.\n  Our choice depends on our rights as Senators and depends on what the \nConstitution tells us we should do in terms of giving advice and \nconsent. My question to the Senate is, What is our advice with respect \nto the rights of a young person to be strip-searched or with respect to \npeople in their homes or with respect to a whole series of other \ncritical things that define this country? What is the advice of the \nSenate in this year?\n  These are not small issues to be expedited away by some kind of a \nsymbolic timetable, a State of the Union Message. Our advice and \nconsent ought to be weighed just as carefully and as importantly as the \nimpact this choice is going to have on the Court for years to come. \nThis is not just the vote of Monday afternoon. This is a vote of \nhistory.\n  Deciding on whether to confirm Judge Sam Alito to be an Associate \nJustice is one of the most important votes I will cast in the time I \nhave been in the Senate because of what it means to the Court and to \nthese critical choices. Confirming Judge Alito to a lifetime \nappointment on the Supreme Court would have irreversible consequences \nthat are already defined if Senators will take the time to measure \nthem.\n  In my judgment, it will take the country backward on critical issues. \nI will not talk about them all now; we do not have time. I know there \nis a pre-agreement. I understand that, and I respect that.\n  I am proud to join my friend, the senior Senator from Massachusetts, \nin taking a stand against this nomination. I know it is an uphill \nbattle. I\n\n[[Page S246]]\n\nhave heard many of my colleagues. I hear the arguments: Reserve your \ngunpowder for the future. What is the future if it changes so \ndramatically at this moment in time? What happens to those people who \ncount on us to stand up and protect them now, not later, not at some \nfuture time?\n  This is the choice for the Court now. I reject those notions that \nthere ought to somehow be some political calculus about the future. \nThis impact is going to be now. This choice is now. This ideological \ndirection is defined now.\n  This fight is not a fight for the short term. This is a fight over \ntwo very fundamentally different views about what defines us, what is \nappropriate in the relationship between government and citizen, and the \nright of our citizens to be free from unlawful government action. These \nare not just words. This is not something we just casually throw out \nthere. ``Unlawful government action'' is part of what motivated people \nto come here in the first place and to fight for what we love and \ncherish.\n  I used to be a prosecutor, and I worked closely with police. I loved \nmy work with the police. I respect the police. They do unbelievably \ndangerous work on behalf of our country every single day. They may walk \ninto a home, into a dark corner, not knowing who is there or what evil \nawaits. I understand that. I also understand when you assume that \nresponsibility, you assume a responsibility to uphold the law, to \nuphold the Constitution, and to help protect people. That is part of \nthe risk, part of what you take on.\n  What about the right to equal justice under the law? I heard one \nSenator the other day come to the Senate and say it isn't the job of a \nSupreme Court Justice to protect the downtrodden or the \ndisenfranchised, it is their job to interpret the law. On countless \noccasions we all know the weight that comes to bear in that decision-\nmaking process between powerful interests and those who do not have a \nvoice. That is also part of what defines us. What makes America \ndifferent from every country on the face of the Earth is that the \naverage citizen can go into a courthouse in America and hold the most \npowerful corporation to account for their safety, for their livelihood, \nfor their welfare. These are rights that Americans care about deeply.\n  The importance of this choice is highlighted by focusing on the seat \nthat this nominee has been chosen to replace. Look at Justice Sandra \nDay O'Connor, a deciding vote, a vote that will likely be lost if Judge \nAlito takes her place. Look at the case of Grutter v. Bollinger, which \nheld that State colleges and universities have the right to use \naffirmative action in their admission policies to increase educational \nopportunities for minorities and promote racial diversity on campuses.\n  What about Tennessee v. Lane, which upheld the constitutionality of \ntitle II of the Americans with Disabilities Act that required that \ncourtrooms be physically accessible to the disabled. Or Rush Prudential \nHMO v. Moran, which upheld State laws giving people the right to a \nsecond doctor's opinion if their HMO tries to deny them treatment. That \nis a classic example of power against the powerless. It happens every \nday in America. An HMO decides, no; an individual citizen wants the \ncoverage they think they got. Will they have the right to have the \naccess on that?\n\n  Hunt v. Cromartie, affirming the right of State legislatures to take \nrace into account to secure minority voting rights and redistricting--\nwe all know what has happened in this country, the challenge to the \nrights of minorities to vote. We still see it. As recently as in the \nlast election we saw minorities denied opportunities to register, \nopportunities to have equal numbers of voting machines in their \ndistrict. These are the things that define us.\n  Brown v. Legal Foundation of Washington, which maintained the key \nsource of funding for legal assistance for the poor; Alaska Department \nof Environmental Conservation v. EPA, which allowed the EPA to step in \nand take action to reduce air pollution under the Clean Air Act when a \nState conservation agency fails to act--there is not an American that \ndoesn't understand we are going backwards with respect to air quality. \nWhat are the rights of the EPA going to be where Justice Sandra Day \nO'Connor was the swing vote, 5-4, the only one who held the line on the \nright of the EPA to do that?\n  Stenburg v. Carhart, which overturned a State law that would have \nbanned abortion as early as the 12th week of pregnancy without \nproviding an exception to a woman's health--the list goes on. These are \nthe issues which are at stake.\n  Throughout his legal career--these are not things that are made up. \nThese are defined by the writings, by the decisions, by the memoranda, \nby the speeches that Judge Alito has made. In each of those, in all of \nthose, there is a startling lack of skepticism that is healthy in \njudges towards government power that infringes on individual rights and \nliberties. Professor Goodwin Liu of the University of Berkeley Law \nSchool concluded after analyzing those:\n\n       Judge Alito ``is less concerned about the government \n     overreaching than Federal appeals judges nationwide, less \n     concerned than Republican-appointed appeals judges \n     nationwide, and less concerned than his Republican-appointed \n     colleagues on the Third Circuit.''\n\n  Aren't we going to be concerned that he is less concerned than those \nof the same stripe? Not only is his record outside the mainstream of \nthe judicial spectrum, but ``it is at odds with the Supreme Court's \nvital role in protecting privacy, freedom, and due process of law.'' \nThat is Professor Liu.\n  In 1984, for example, Judge Alito wrote a Justice Department \nmemorandum concluding that the use of deadly force against a fleeing \nunarmed suspect did not violate the fourth amendment. The victim was a \n15-year-old African American. He was 5 foot 4. He weighed 100 to 110 \npounds. This unarmed eighth grader was attempting to jump a fence with \na stolen purse containing $10 when he was shot in the back of the head \nin order to prevent escape. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals found \nthe shooting unconstitutional because deadly force can only be used \nwhen there is ``probable cause that the suspect poses a threat to the \nsafety of the officers or a danger to the community if left at large.'' \nThat is what we teach law enforcement officials.\n  But Judge Alito disagreed. Judge Alito said: No, he believed the \nshooting was reasonable because ``the State is justified in using \nwhatever force is necessary to enforce its laws''--even deadly force. \nThat is his conclusion. That is the standard that is going to go to the \nSupreme Court if ratified. It is OK to shoot a 15-year-old, 110 pounds, \na 5-foot-4-inch kid who is trying to get over a fence with a purse, \nshoot him in the back of the head.\n  Otherwise, Judge Alito believed that any suspect could evade arrest \nby making the State choose between killing them or letting them escape. \nThat is the conclusion. Think about that. Judge Alito believed that the \nState could use whatever force was necessary to enforce its laws \nregardless of whether the suspect was armed or dangerous. Does the \nChair believe that? Do the other Senators believe that? I don't think \nso. Do mainstream Americans believe that?\n  Lucky for us, we did not have to answer that question. Why? Because \nin 1985, Justice White rejected Judge Alito's position, and the court \nheld that deadly force is not justified ``where the suspect poses no \nimmediate threat to the officer and no threat to others''. The court \nstated unequivocally, ``a police officer may not seize an unarmed, \nnondangerous suspect by shooting him dead.''\n  So Judge Alito is out of touch with mainstream juris prudence with \nrespect to the use of force in America. Becoming a Federal judge did \nnot make Judge Alito any more protective of an American's personal \nprivacy and freedoms when it comes to government intrusion. That ought \nto concern every conservative in this Nation. Every conservative in \nAmerica ought to care about the government's power to just walk into \nyour home, to intrude on the rights of individual Americans.\n  In Baker v. Monroe Township, over a dozen local and Federal narcotics \nagents raided the apartment of Clement Griffin, just as his mother and \nher three children were arriving for a family dinner. Officers forced \nthe family down to the ground, pointed guns at them, handcuffed and \nsearched them. Two Reagan appointees to the court held that a jury \nshould decide whether\n\n[[Page S247]]\n\nexcessive force was used, but Judge Alito disagreed. He agreed that the \nsearch was ``terrifying'' and ``most unfortunate''. But he did not \nbelieve that the family had a right to make their case to a jury in \ncourt. He would have denied those American citizens, terrified as they \nwere, their day in court.\n  Judge Alito, I regret to say, often goes out of his way to justify \nexcessive government actions. Many have talked in the Senate about Doe \nv. Groody, where Judge Alito, dissenting in an opinion by our current \nhead of the Department of Homeland Security, then-Judge Michael \nChertoff, concluded that the strip-search of a 10-year-old girl was \nunreasonable. That was the conclusion of Judge Chertoff. Judge Alito \nconcluded that the strip-search of a 10-year-old girl was \nreasonable. He reached this astonishing conclusion on a technicality. \nRather than relying on the search warrant to determine whether the \nstrip search of a child was authorized, Judge Alito argued that the \ncourt ought to look to the police officer's supporting affidavits.\n\n  As a rule, however--now, I can say this as a former prosecutor \nbecause we used to labor over those warrants very carefully, knowing \nthey were going to be scrutinized--affidavits are not part of the \nsearch warrants unless the trial judge decides they are. That ``goes to \nthe heart of the constitutional requirement that judges, not the \npolice, authorize the warrants. But Judge Alito said: No, no, no, no, \nit is OK to go look behind what they were intending, and decided they \nmust have intended to include the search of the entire family, \nincluding a 10-year-old child. Is that the standard we want on the \nCourt?\n  Judge Alito's minimalist view of the fourth amendment's right to \nprivacy is not limited to claims of excessive force. In United States \nv. Lee, he upheld the FBI's installation of a video and audio \nsurveillance device in a hotel room in order to record conversations \nbetween the target of a bribery sting and a police informant. The FBI \nconducted the surveillance without a warrant, arguing, first, that the \ntarget had no expectation of privacy in a hotel room, and, second, that \nthe device was turned on only when the informant was in the room. Judge \nAlito accepted the FBI's argument, and found no constitutional \nviolation.\n  His eagerness to buy the FBI's arguments, particularly in light of \nthe Supreme Court decisions to the contrary, raises serious questions \nabout how he would approach serious constitutional violations to the \nNational Security Agency's program of domestic eavesdropping. Americans \nacross the board are concerned about the violation of the law with \nrespect to what we passed in the Congress overwhelmingly. After all, \nwith the eavesdropping in Lee and the eavesdropping being conducted \nnow, we see some startling similarity. Both are defended on the basis \nof Executive discretion and self-restraint.\n  The fourth amendment is not defined that way. It is defined by \njudicial restraint itself, not the Executive restraint, and by judicial \nreview.\n  We also should never forget, as we think about this issue, the words \nof an eminent Justice, Justice Brandeis, who said:\n\n       Experience should teach us to be most on our guard to \n     protect liberty when the Government's purposes are \n     beneficent. . . . The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in \n     insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well-meaning but \n     without understanding.\n\n  I believe that is what we need to protect ourselves against. That is \nwhat the Framers created the judiciary to do. And that is what I fear \nthe record shows Judge Alito has not been willing to do.\n  Now, if his judicial opinions and legal memoranda do not convince you \nof these things, you can take a look at the speech he gave to the \nFederalist Society in which, as a sitting judge, he ``preached the \ngospel'' of the Reagan Justice Department nearly 15 years after he left \nit; a speech in which he announced his support of the ``unitary \nexecutive theory'' on the grounds that it ``best captures the meaning \nof the Constitution's text and structure.''\n  As Beth Nolan, former White House counsel to President Clinton, \ndescribes it:\n\n       ``Unitary executive'' is a small phrase with almost \n     limitless import: At the very least, it embodies the concept \n     of Presidential control over all Executive functions, \n     including those that have traditionally been exercised by \n     ``independent'' agencies and other actors not subject to the \n     President's direct control. Under this meaning, Congress may \n     not, by statute, insulate the Federal Reserve or the Federal \n     Election Commission . . . from Presidential control.\n\n  Judge Alito believes you can.\n\n       The phrase is also used to embrace expansive \n     interpretations of the President's substantive powers, and \n     strong limits on the Legislative and Judicial branches. This \n     is the apparent meaning of the phrase in many of this \n     Administration's signing statements.\n\n  Now, most recently, one of those signing statements was used to \npreserve the President's right to just outright ignore the ban on \ntorture that was passed overwhelmingly by the Congress. We had a long \nfight on this floor. I believe the vote was somewhere in the 90s, if I \nrecall correctly. Ninety-something said this is the intent of Congress: \nto ban torture. But the President immediately turned around and did a \nsigning in which he suggested an alternative interpretation. And Judge \nAlito has indicated his support for that Executive power.\n  During the hearings, Judge Alito attempted to convince the committee \nthat the unitary executive theory is not about the scope of \nPresidential power. But that is just flat wrong. Not only does the \ntheory read Executive power very broadly, but, by necessity, it reads \ncongressional power very narrowly. In other words, as the President \ngains exclusive power over a matter, the Constitution withholds \nCongress's authority to regulate in that field. That is not, by any \noriginalist interpretation, what the Founding Fathers intended.\n  Let me give you a real-life example, as described again by Beth \nNolan:\n\n       [W]hen the Reagan Administration undertook the covert arms-\n     for-hostages operation that eventually grew into the Iran-\n     Contra scandal, it triggered the requirement of the National \n     Security Act that the Administration provide Congress \n     ``timely notification'' of the covert operation.\n\n  Reading the phrase ``timely notification'' against the background of \nthe unitary executive theory, the Justice Department stated, ``The \nPresident's authority to act in the field of international relations is \nplenary, exclusive, and subject to no legal limitations save those \nderived from the applicable provisions of the Constitution itself.''\n\n       According to Justice, under that interpretation, Congress's \n     role in this matter was limited because its only \n     constitutional powers in the area of foreign affairs were \n     those that directly involved the exercise of legal authority \n     over American citizens. Justice even qualified this \n     statement, saying that by ``American citizens'' it meant \n     ``the private citizenry'' and not the President or other \n     executive officials.\n\n  According to Ms. Nolan:\n\n       [I]f such claims are taken seriously, then the President is \n     largely impervious to statutory law in the areas of foreign \n     affairs, national security, and war, and Congress is \n     effectively powerless to act as a constraint against \n     presidential aggrandizement in these areas.\n\n  Does that sound familiar? It ought to sound familiar. The Bush \nadministration's legal opinion on torture, the administration's \nresponse to the McCain antitorture amendment, and the justifications \ngiven for the NSA's domestic spying program have all been based, in \nlarge part, on this exact same theory of the unitary executive.\n  Given Judge Alito's history in the Reagan Justice Department, given \nhis writings on the Third Circuit, given the year 2000 speech to the \nFederalist Society, a central question is whether you can trust that \nhe, in fact, is going to protect the rights of the Congress and the \nlegislative branch as well as those personal freedoms of individual \nAmericans from those governmental intrusions?\n  I believe the record says ``no.''\n  Now, as I mentioned earlier, I know this is flying against some of \nthe sort of political punditry of Washington. I understand that. But \nthis is a fight worth making because it is a fight for a lifetime \nappointment on the Supreme Court of the United States, with a series of \ndecisions that suggest a view--however brilliant a legal mind--he has a \nbrilliant legal mind. I met with him. He is a nice fellow--we all \nunderstand that--well regarded by some people in the judicial system. \nHe was looked at by the ABA. And they make a judgment based on sort of \njust legal decisions, not necessarily the ideological impact, the \nlarger implication, all the other conditions that we need to consider \nas we give advice and consent.\n  Perhaps Professor Liu of the Berkeley Law School put it best when he \nwrote this. He said:\n\n\n[[Page S248]]\n\n\n       Judge Alito's record envisions an America where police may \n     shoot and kill an unarmed boy to stop him from running away \n     with a stolen purse; where federal agents may point guns at \n     ordinary citizens during a raid, even after no sign of \n     resistance; where the FBI may install a camera where you \n     sleep on the promise that they won't turn it on unless an \n     informant is in the room; where a black man may be sentenced \n     to death by an all-white jury for killing a white man, absent \n     a multiple regression analysis showing discrimination; and \n     where police may search what a warrant permits, and then \n     some.\n\n  He says:\n\n       [T]his is not the America we know. Nor is it the America we \n     aspire to be.\n\n  So these are the reasons we need to take a hard look at what we are \ndoing, even if it means swimming upstream. There are consequences to \nthis nomination that I do not believe all the American people got out \nof the hearings because the hearings did not answer questions. And when \nyou pose some of these choices to Americans, they come down on the side \nthat I have described: being protected, not making those kinds of \nchoices about a young kid, making sure that our privacy is protected.\n  So for those reasons, and others I will discuss starting on Monday, I \noppose Judge Alito's nomination. And I hope that colleagues, others, \nwill join in that effort in the end.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will please call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

A veteran of three wars, he ascended to the rank \nof colonel, Regular Army as well as serving as brigadier general, \nNational Guard of Rhode Island, adjutant general of Rhode Island, and \nalso was promoted to the grade of major general and commanding general. \nGeneral Kiely was a model soldier, receiving a Purple Heart, 2 Bronze \nStars, Valor, and 3 Legions of Merit, along with 22 other Federal \nGovernment awards and decorations, as well as the Rhode Island Cross \nand the Rhode Island Star. His military knowledge and service to our \nNation will be dearly missed, and my deepest condolences go to Mrs. \nMarilyn L. Kiely and the Kiely family in their time of \nmourning.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/27/senate-section/article/S248-4", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S248]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING JOSEPH O'DONNELL\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, it is with great sadness that today \nI reflect upon the life of Joseph O'Donnell. Mr. O'Donnell dedicated \nhis life to his family and to public service. He served alongside my \nfather as Lieutenant Governor in the 1960s, and is, in fact, the last \nRepublican elected to the position. He remained active in politics \nuntil his passing. In addition to his tenure as Lieutenant Governor, \nJoe O'Donnell has served his community and the State of Rhode Island \nfor over 55 years, including as State Director of Administration, as \nChairman of the North Smithfield Water Authority, and in a number of \nother capacities. In addition, Mr. O'Donnell served the business \ncommunity as a founding partner and chairman of the board of Keough \nKirby Associates, Inc., as a trustee of Landmark Health Systems, and in \nother board positions for numerous business and civic organizations. As \na panelist on the `Coffee-An' radio program in his later years, Joe \nO'Donnell contributed his knowledge of politics, his great sense of \nhumor, and his penchant for gourmet cooking to a larger audience. His \nname is on the Wall of Honor at the Marine Maritime Academy for \noutstanding lifetime achievement, and he was a recipient of the Admiral \nJoel R.P. Pringle Society Award from the Naval War College Foundation \nin Newport. It is with heavy hearts that Stephanie and I send our \ndeepest sympathies to Mrs. Yolande O'Donnell and their six children. Of \nall his accomplishments, I know he is most proud of the closeness of \nhis family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/27/senate-section/article/S248-5", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S248]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/27/senate-section/article/S248-6", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S248]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/27/senate-section/article/S248-7", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S248-S249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MEASURES REFERRED\n\n  The following bills were read the first and the second times by \nunanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n       H.R. 2099.

A bill to amend title X of the Public Health Service Act to \nprohibit family planning grants from being awarded to any entity that \nperforms abortions; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I would like to offer my comments in \nsupport of The Title X Family Planning Act, which I introduced today. I \nam very pleased to have Senator Santorum and Senator DeMint join me as \noriginal co-sponsors of this very important legislation. The Title X \nFamily Planning Act prohibits the distribution of taxpayer dollars, \nthrough Title X family planning funds, to those that provide abortions. \nI believe that this important legislation is very timely, because this \nweek thousands of pro-life advocates gathered in our Nation's capital \nfor the March for Life, some of which came all the way from my home \nState of Louisiana.\n  In 1970, Congress enacted Title X of the Public Health Service Act, \nwhich is a program designed to make contraceptive supplies and family \nplanning services available to those unable to afford them without \ngovernment assistance. Originally, family planning services were not \nallowed to include abortions, and currently, Federal dollars cannot \ndirectly fund abortions.\n  Current law prohibits the use of Title X family planning funds ``in \nprograms where abortion is a method of family planning''; and current \nregulations require some form of separation between federally-funded \nfamily planning services and abortions. 42 U.S.C. 300a-6 (1970). \nHowever, the current regulations do not contain a descriptive standard \nof what constitutes ``separation.'' 42 CFR part 59 (2000). It only \nrequires that these activities be separated by something more than mere \nbookkeeping.\n  This level of separation--separation of accounting records and \nseparation of facilities within the same building--is not enough. When \nTitle X money goes to clinics that perform abortions, even though the \nmoney cannot directly fund abortions it is being used to indirectly \nfacilitate abortions. For example, abortion providers are using Title X \nfunding to offset operational costs, which, therefore, frees them to \nuse monies that would otherwise be allocated to operational costs, \ntowards funding abortion.\n  The Title X Family Planning Act would restore the original intent of \nTitle X by prohibiting the distribution of Title X family planning \nmoney to grantees that perform abortions and to grantees whose \nsubgrantees perform abortions, unless a physician certifies that the \nabortion is necessary to save the life of the mother. The bill \nspecifically exempts hospitals. In order to ensure that grantees who \nprovide abortions do not obtain funding, the bill also requires the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to give to Congress a list of \ngrantees that provided abortions in the preceding fiscal year. Grantees \nthat appear on the list would not be eligible to receive Title X family \nplanning funds, unless the grantee submits a certification to the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services that neither the grantee nor its \nsubgrantees perform abortions.\n  The rationale behind this prohibition is simple: when abortion is so \ndivisive an issue, when so many Americans have grave moral reservations \nabout it, why should we sustain and underwrite private abortion \nproviders with taxpayer funds?\n  The Title X Family Planning Act denies no one family planning \nservices. In every locality where a private abortion provider is \nreceiving Title X funds, there are alternative sources for family \nplanning services, inducing both public agencies and private agencies \nthat do not offer abortions.\n  The Title X Family Planning Act does not cut one penny from family \nplanning funds. It only ensures that those funds are used for actual \nfamily planning services.\n  The Title X Family Planning Act does not infringe upon the right to \nfree speech.

Res. 356\n\n       Whereas on October 8, 2005, a magnitude 7.6 earthquake \n     struck Pakistan, India, and Afghanistan;\n       Whereas the epicenter of the earthquake was located near \n     Muzaffarabad, approximately 60 miles north-northeast of \n     Islamabad, with aftershocks and landslides continuing to \n     affect the area;\n       Whereas more than 75,000 people have died, including \n     approximately 17,000 children, nearly 70,000 people are \n     injured and approximately 3,000,000 people are homeless as a \n     result of the earthquake;\n       Whereas the United States has pledged a total of \n     $510,000,000 in assistance to the affected areas, including \n     $300,000,000 for relief and reconstruction, $110,000,000 to \n     support Department of Defense relief operations, and at least \n     $100,000,000 in anticipated contributions from private \n     entities in the United States;\n       Whereas, as of January 25, 2006, the total amount of \n     humanitarian assistance provided to Pakistan by the United \n     States Agency for International Development is more than \n     $66,500,000;\n       Whereas the Department of Defense has deployed \n     approximately 875 members of the Armed Forces and 31 \n     helicopters to aid in the earthquake relief efforts;\n       Whereas since October 8, 2005, United States helicopters \n     have flown more than 3,200 missions, evacuated approximately \n     3,800 people, and delivered nearly 15,000,000 pounds of \n     supplies;\n       Whereas the cost of rebuilding the affected areas could be \n     more than $5,000,000,000;\n       Whereas Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, during her \n     October 12, 2005 visit to Pakistan, said the United States \n     would support the efforts of the Government of Pakistan over \n     the long-term to provide assistance to the victims of the \n     earthquake and rebuild areas of the country devastated by the \n     earthquake;\n       Whereas the robust humanitarian response of the Government \n     of the United States to the earthquake disaster has made an \n     impact on the Government and people of Pakistan and \n     demonstrates the United States commitment to Pakistan and the \n     well-being of its residents;\n       Whereas the United States humanitarian mission in Pakistan \n     may impact positively on the way Americans are viewed, \n     especially in areas where the population may oppose United \n     States counterterrrorism policies and where radical groups \n     and affiliates of known terrorist organizations are \n     conducting high-profile relief efforts;

which was \nreferred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 357\n\n       Whereas youth mentoring is a centuries-old concept, through \n     which an adult provides guidance, support, and encouragement \n     to help a young person become a responsible and productive \n     adult;\n       Whereas mentoring, when done well, helps young people stay \n     in school and improve academically, boosts self-esteem and \n     communication skills, and improves the chances of going on to \n     higher education;\n       Whereas there are thousands of mentoring programs in \n     communities of all sizes across the United States, focused on \n     building strong and effective relationships between caring \n     adults and young people who need positive adult role models;\n       Whereas in spite of the great benefits mentoring provides, \n     the United States has a serious mentoring gap, with more than \n     15,000,000 young people currently in need of caring adult \n     role models;\n       Whereas the demand for mentoring far exceeds the current \n     capacity of local mentoring programs and the number of adults \n     who currently volunteer as mentors;\n       Whereas recent research conducted as part of the National \n     Conversation on Mentoring--Take II points to the need to \n     generate significantly larger numbers of volunteer mentors as \n     one of the most critical issues facing mentoring;\n       Whereas the designation of January 2006 as National \n     Mentoring Month will focus the Nation's attention on the \n     essential role mentoring plays in the lives of young people;\n       Whereas the month-long celebration of mentoring will \n     encourage more organizations, including schools, businesses, \n     nonprofit organizations, faith institutions, foundations, and \n     individuals to become engaged in mentoring; and\n       Whereas National Mentoring Month will, most importantly, \n     build awareness of mentoring and recruit more individuals to \n     become mentors, helping close the Nation's mentoring gap: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) proclaims the month of January 2006 as the fifth annual \n     ``National Mentoring Month'';\n       (2) recognizes that the President has issued a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States and interested \n     groups to observe the month with appropriate ceremonies and \n     activities that promote awareness of and volunteer \n     involvement with youth mentoring; and\n       (3) recognizes with gratitude the contributions of the \n     millions of caring adults who are already serving as mentors \n     and encourages more adults to volunteer as mentors.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege today to join Senator \nMcCain and 25 of our colleagues in submitting a resolution recognizing \nJanuary 2006 as National Mentoring Month. Business, community, and \nmedia leaders have formed a coalition to raise public awareness about \nthe importance of taking time to make a real difference in the life of \na child.\n  Under the impressive leadership of the National Mentoring Partnership \nand the Harvard School of Public Health, the coalition is sponsoring an \nadvertising campaign to explain the benefits of mentoring for children \nand mentors alike. Each of us has had adults who have made a positive \ndifference for us, family, teachers, coaches, clergy, neighbors or \ncaring friends who were there to listen and offer guidance. Each of us \nhas the opportunity to offer that same gift to young persons today.\n  Each week with many of my colleagues in the Senate, I read with an \nelementary school student in the District of Columbia in the Everybody \nWins program. During our lunchtime sessions, my second grade partner \nand I share good books and stories. Whether mentors choose reading \nprograms or some other activity, these times are dedicated to listening \nand responding to the child's needs. Mentors have busy lives, but every \nchild needs to know that we can make time for them.\n  In States across this country there are long lists of young persons \nwaiting for mentors. This important project will connect new mentors to \nthese waiting children and enhance the quality of their lives. I urge \nthe Senate to approve this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/27/senate-section/article/S251-2", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S251-S252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 78--CONDEMNING THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAN FOR \n VIOLATING ITS INTERNATIONAL NUCLEAR NONPROLIFERATION OBLIGATIONS AND \n  EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR EFFORTS TO REPORT IRAN TO THE UNITED NATIONS \n                            SECURITY COUNSEL\n\n  Mr. FRIST (for himself, Mr. Reid, Mr. Allard, Mr. Allen, Mr. Biden, \nMr. Brownback, Mr. Burr, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Coleman, Mr. Crapo, Mr. \nEnsign, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Graham, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Lieberman, \nMr. Lugar, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Santorum, Mr. \nSchumer, Mr. Talent, Mr. Warner, Mr. McCain, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Dodd, \nMs. Cantwell, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. Menendez) \nsubmitted the following concurrent resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 78\n\n       Whereas Iran is a non-nuclear-weapon State Party to the \n     Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done at \n     Washington, London, and Moscow July 1, 1968 (commonly \n     referred to as the ``Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty''), \n     under which Iran is obligated, pursuant to Article II of the \n     Treaty, ``not to receive the transfer from any transferor \n     whatsoever of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive \n     devices or of control over such weapons or explosive devices \n     directly, or indirectly; not to manufacture or otherwise \n     acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices; \n     and not to seek or receive any assistance in the manufacture \n     of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices'';\n       Whereas Iran signed the Agreement Between Iran and the \n     International Atomic Energy Agency for the Application of \n     Safeguards in Connection with the Treaty on the Non-\n     Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done at Vienna June 19, \n     1973 (commonly referred to as the ``Safeguards Agreement''), \n     which requires Iran to report the importation and use of \n     nuclear material, to declare nuclear facilities, and to \n     accept safeguards on nuclear materials and activities to \n     ensure that such materials and activities are not diverted to \n     any military purpose and are used for peaceful purposes and \n     activities;\n       Whereas Iran signed the Protocol Additional to the \n     Agreement Between Iran and the International Atomic Energy \n     Agency for the Application of Safeguards in Connection with \n     the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons at \n     Vienna on December 18, 2003 (commonly referred to as the \n     ``Additional Protocol'');\n       Whereas the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) \n     reported in November 2003 that Iran had been developing an \n     undeclared nuclear enrichment program for 18 years and had \n     covertly imported nuclear material and equipment, carried out \n     over 110 unreported experiments to produce uranium metal, \n     separated plutonium, and concealed many other aspects of its \n     nuclear facilities and activities;\n       Whereas the Government of Iran informed the Director \n     General of the IAEA on November 10, 2003, of its decision to \n     suspend enrichment-related and reprocessing activities, and \n     stated that the suspension would cover all activities at the \n     Natanz enrichment facility, the production of all feed \n     material for enrichment, and the importation of any \n     enrichment-related items;\n       Whereas, in a Note Verbale dated December 29, 2003, the \n     Government of Iran specified the scope of suspension of its \n     enrichment and reprocessing activities, which the IAEA was \n     invited to verify, including the suspension of the operation \n     or testing or any centrifuges, either with or without nuclear \n     material, at the Pilot Fuel Enrichment Plant at Natanz, the \n     suspension of further introduction of nuclear material into \n     any centrifuges, the suspension of the installation of new \n     centrifuges at the Pilot Fuel Enrichment Plant and the \n     installation of centrifuges at the Fuel Enrichment Plant at \n     Natanz, and, to the extent\n\n[[Page S252]]\n\n     practicable, the withdrawal of nuclear material from any \n     centrifuge enrichment facility;\n       Whereas, on February 24, 2004, the Government of Iran \n     informed the IAEA of its decision to expand the scope and \n     clarify the nature of its decision to suspend to the furthest \n     extent possible the assembly and testing of centrifuges and \n     the domestic manufacture of centrifuge components, including \n     those related to existing contracts, informed the IAEA that \n     any components that are manufactured under existing contracts \n     that cannot be suspended will be stored and placed under IAEA \n     seal, invited the IAEA to verify these measures, and \n     confirmed that the suspension of enrichment activities \n     applied to all facilities in Iran;\n       Whereas, in November 2004, the Governments of the United \n     Kingdom, France, and Germany entered into an agreement with \n     Iran on Iran's nuclear program (commonly referred to as the \n     ``Paris Agreement''), securing a formal commitment from the \n     Government of Iran to voluntarily suspend uranium enrichment \n     operations in exchange for discussions on economic, \n     technological, political, and security issues;\n       Whereas the Department of State has reported for a decade \n     on Iran's state sponsorship of terrorism and has declared in \n     its most recent Country Reports on Terrorism that Iran \n     ``remained the most active state sponsor of terrorism in \n     2004'';\n       Whereas President of Iran Mahmoud Ahmadinejad expressed, in \n     an October 26, 2005, speech, his hope for ``a world without \n     America'' and his desire ``to wipe Israel off the map'' and \n     has subsequently denied the existence of the holocaust;\n       Whereas Article XII.C of the Statute of the IAEA requires \n     the IAEA Board of Governors to report the noncompliance of \n     any member of the IAEA with its IAEA safeguards obligations \n     to all members and to the Security Council and General \n     Assembly of the United Nations;\n       Whereas Article III.B-4 of the Statute of the IAEA \n     specifies that ``if in connection with the activities of the \n     Agency there should arise questions that are within the \n     competence of the Security Council, the Agency shall notify \n     the Security Council, as the organ bearing the main \n     responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and \n     security'';\n       Whereas, on September 24, 2005, the IAEA Board of Governors \n     adopted a resolution finding that Iran's many failures and \n     breaches of its obligations to comply with the Safeguards \n     Agreement constitute noncompliance in the context of Article \n     XII.C of the Statute of the IAEA and that matters concerning \n     Iran's nuclear program have given rise to questions that are \n     within the competence of the Security Council as the organ \n     bearing the primary responsibility for the maintenance of \n     international peace and security;\n       Whereas, on January 3, 2006, the Government of Iran \n     announced that it planned to restart its nuclear research \n     efforts, nullifying the Paris Agreement;\n       Whereas, in January 2006, Iranian officials, in the \n     presence of IAEA inspectors, began to remove IAEA seals from \n     the enrichment facility in Natanz, Iran;\n       Whereas Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom Jack Straw \n     warned Iranian officials that they were ``pushing their \n     luck'' by removing the United Nations seals that were placed \n     on the Natanz facility by the IAEA 2 years earlier;\n       Whereas President of France Jacques Chirac said that the \n     Governments of Iran and North Korea risk making a ``serious \n     error'' by pursuing nuclear activities in defiance of \n     international agreements;\n       Whereas Foreign Minister of Germany Frank-Walter Steinmeier \n     said that the Government of Iran had ``crossed lines which it \n     knew would not remain without consequences'';\n       Whereas Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice stated, ``It is \n     obvious that if Iran cannot be brought to live up to its \n     international obligations, in fact, the IAEA Statute would \n     indicate that Iran would have to be referred to the U.N. \n     Security Council.'';\n       Whereas President Ahmadinejad stated, ``The Iranian \n     government and nation has no fear of the Western ballyhoo and \n     will continue its nuclear programs with decisiveness and \n     wisdom.''; and\n       Whereas the United States has joined with the Governments \n     of Britain, France, and Germany in calling for a meeting of \n     the IAEA Board of Governors to discuss Iran's non-compliance \n     with its IAEA safeguards obligations: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) condemns the many failures of the Government of Iran to \n     comply faithfully with its nuclear nonproliferation \n     obligations, including its obligations under the Safeguards \n     Agreement (as reported by the Director General of the IAEA to \n     the IAEA Board of Governors since 2003), its suspension \n     commitments under the Paris Agreement, and prior commitments \n     to the EU-3 to suspend all enrichment- and reprocessing-\n     related activities;\n       (2) commends the efforts of the Governments of France, \n     Germany, and the United Kingdom to seek a meaningful and \n     credible suspension of Iran's enrichment- and reprocessing-\n     related activities and to find a diplomatic means to address \n     the noncompliance of the Government of Iran with its \n     obligations, requirements, and commitments related to nuclear \n     non-proliferation;\n       (3) strongly urges the IAEA Board of Governors, at its \n     special meeting on February 2, 2006, to order that Iran's \n     noncompliance with its safeguards obligations be reported to \n     the United Nations Security Council; and\n       (4) calls on all members of the United Nations Security \n     Council, in particular the Russian Federation and the \n     People's Republic of China, to act expeditiously to consider \n     any report of Iran's noncompliance in fulfillment of the \n     mandate of the Security Council to respond to and deal with \n     situations bearing on the maintenance of international peace \n     and security.\n\n

Res. 356) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 356\n\n       Whereas on October 8, 2005, a magnitude 7.6 earthquake \n     struck Pakistan, India, and Afghanistan;\n       Whereas the epicenter of the earthquake was located near \n     Muzaffarabad, approximately 60 miles north-northeast of \n     Islamabad, with aftershocks and landslides continuing to \n     affect the area;\n       Whereas more than 75,000 people have died, including \n     approximately 17,000 children, nearly 70,000 people are \n     injured and approximately 3,000,000 people are homeless as a \n     result of the earthquake;\n       Whereas the United States has pledged a total of \n     $510,000,000 in assistance to the affected areas, including \n     $300,000,000 for relief and reconstruction, $110,000,000 to \n     support Department of Defense relief operations, and\n\n[[Page S253]]\n\n     at least $100,000,000 in anticipated contributions from \n     private entities in the United States;\n       Whereas, as of January 25, 2006, the total amount of \n     humanitarian assistance provided to Pakistan by the United \n     States Agency for International Development is more than \n     $66,500,000;\n       Whereas the Department of Defense has deployed \n     approximately 875 members of the Armed Forces and 31 \n     helicopters to aid in the earthquake relief efforts;\n       Whereas since October 8, 2005, United States helicopters \n     have flown more than 3,200 missions, evacuated approximately \n     3,800 people, and delivered nearly 15,000,000 pounds of \n     supplies;\n       Whereas the cost of rebuilding the affected areas could be \n     more than $5,000,000,000;\n       Whereas Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, during her \n     October 12, 2005 visit to Pakistan, said the United States \n     would support the efforts of the Government of Pakistan over \n     the long-term to provide assistance to the victims of the \n     earthquake and rebuild areas of the country devastated by the \n     earthquake;\n       Whereas the robust humanitarian response of the Government \n     of the United States to the earthquake disaster has made an \n     impact on the Government and people of Pakistan and \n     demonstrates the United States commitment to Pakistan and the \n     well-being of its residents;\n       Whereas the United States humanitarian mission in Pakistan \n     may impact positively on the way Americans are viewed, \n     especially in areas where the population may oppose United \n     States counterterrrorism policies and where radical groups \n     and affiliates of known terrorist organizations are \n     conducting high-profile relief efforts; and\n       Whereas the results of a poll taken by the nonprofit \n     organization Terror Free Tomorrow show that, at the end of \n     November 2005, more than 46 percent of Pakistanis had a \n     favorable view of the United States, double the percentage of \n     Pakistanis that held that view in May 2005: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends the members of the United States Armed Forces \n     and civilian employees of the Department of State and the \n     United States Agency for International Development for their \n     swift and sustained efforts to assist the victims of the \n     earthquake in South Asia that occurred on October 8, 2005;\n       (2) commends the Governments of Pakistan and India for \n     working together to save lives and provide humanitarian \n     relief in the affected areas and encourages them to continue \n     in this spirit of cooperation;\n       (3) commends the international community, including \n     nongovernmental organizations, private corporations, and \n     individual citizens, for responding swiftly and generously to \n     the relief and recovery effort;\n       (4) urges continued attention by international donors and \n     relief agencies to the needs of vulnerable populations in the \n     stricken areas, particularly the thousands of children who \n     have been left parentless and homeless by the disaster; and\n       (5) urges the Government of the United States to take the \n     lead in encouraging the international community to commit to \n     continue relief efforts in response to the earthquake in \n     South Asia and to help rebuild critical infrastructure in the \n     affected areas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/27/senate-section/article/S253-1", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S253-S254]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CONDEMNING THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAN\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Con. Res. 78 which was submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the concurrent \nresolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 78) condemning the \n     Government of Iran for violating international nuclear \n     nonproliferation obligations and expressing support for \n     efforts to report Iran to the United Nations Security \n     Council.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nconcurrent resolution be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 78) was agreed to, as \nfollows:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 78\n\n       Whereas Iran is a non-nuclear-weapon State Party to the \n     Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done at \n     Washington, London, and Moscow July 1, 1968 (commonly \n     referred to as the ``Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty''), \n     under which Iran is obligated, pursuant to Article II of the \n     Treaty, ``not to receive the transfer from any transferor \n     whatsoever of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive \n     devices or of control over such weapons or explosive devices \n     directly, or indirectly; not to manufacture or otherwise \n     acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices; \n     and not to seek or receive any assistance in the manufacture \n     of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices'';\n       Whereas Iran signed the Agreement Between Iran and the \n     International Atomic Energy Agency for the Application of \n     Safeguards in Connection with the Treaty on the Non-\n     Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done at Vienna June 19, \n     1973 (commonly referred to as the ``Safeguards Agreement''), \n     which requires Iran to report the importation and use of \n     nuclear material, to declare nuclear facilities, and to \n     accept safeguards on nuclear materials and activities to \n     ensure that such materials and activities are not diverted to \n     any military purpose and are used for peaceful purposes and \n     activities;\n       Whereas Iran signed the Protocol Additional to the \n     Agreement Between Iran and the International Atomic Energy \n     Agency for the Application of Safeguards in Connection with \n     the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons at \n     Vienna on December 18, 2003 (commonly referred to as the \n     ``Additional Protocol'');\n       Whereas the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) \n     reported in November 2003 that Iran had been developing an \n     undeclared nuclear enrichment program for 18 years and had \n     covertly imported nuclear material and equipment, carried out \n     over 110 unreported experiments to produce uranium metal, \n     separated plutonium, and concealed many other aspects of its \n     nuclear facilities and activities;\n       Whereas the Government of Iran informed the Director \n     General of the IAEA on November 10, 2003, of its decision to \n     suspend enrichment-related and reprocessing activities, and \n     stated that the suspension would cover all activities at the \n     Natanz enrichment facility, the production of all feed \n     material for enrichment, and the importation of any \n     enrichment-related items;\n       Whereas, in a Note Verbale dated December 29, 2003, the \n     Government of Iran specified the scope of suspension of its \n     enrichment and reprocessing activities, which the IAEA was \n     invited to verify, including the suspension of the operation \n     or testing or any centrifuges, either with or without nuclear \n     material, at the Pilot Fuel Enrichment Plant at Natanz, the \n     suspension of further introduction of nuclear material into \n     any centrifuges, the suspension of the installation of new \n     centrifuges at the Pilot Fuel Enrichment Plant and the \n     installation of centrifuges at the Fuel Enrichment Plant at \n     Natanz, and, to the extent practicable, the withdrawal of \n     nuclear material from any centrifuge enrichment facility;\n       Whereas, on February 24, 2004, the Government of Iran \n     informed the IAEA of its decision to expand the scope and \n     clarify the nature of its decision to suspend to the furthest \n     extent possible the assembly and testing of centrifuges and \n     the domestic manufacture of centrifuge components, including \n     those related to existing contracts, informed the IAEA that \n     any components that are manufactured under existing contracts \n     that cannot be suspended will be stored and placed under IAEA \n     seal, invited the IAEA to verify these measures, and \n     confirmed that the suspension of enrichment activities \n     applied to all facilities in Iran;\n       Whereas, in November 2004, the Governments of the United \n     Kingdom, France, and Germany entered into an agreement with \n     Iran on Iran's nuclear program (commonly referred to as the \n     ``Paris Agreement''), securing a formal commitment from the \n     Government of Iran to voluntarily suspend uranium enrichment \n     operations in exchange for discussions on economic, \n     technological, political, and security issues;\n       Whereas the Department of State has reported for a decade \n     on Iran's state sponsorship of terrorism and has declared in \n     its most recent Country Reports on Terrorism that Iran \n     ``remained the most active state sponsor of terrorism in \n     2004'';\n       Whereas President of Iran Mahmoud Ahmadinejad expressed, in \n     an October 26, 2005, speech, his hope for ``a world without \n     America'' and his desire ``to wipe Israel off the map'' and \n     has subsequently denied the existence of the holocaust;\n       Whereas Article XII.C of the Statute of the IAEA requires \n     the IAEA Board of Governors to report the noncompliance of \n     any member of the IAEA with its IAEA safeguards obligations \n     to all members and to the Security Council and General \n     Assembly of the United Nations;\n       Whereas Article III.B-4 of the Statute of the IAEA \n     specifies that ``if in connection with the activities of the \n     Agency there should arise questions that are within the \n     competence of the Security Council, the Agency shall notify \n     the Security Council, as the organ bearing the main \n     responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and \n     security'';\n       Whereas, on September 24, 2005, the IAEA Board of Governors \n     adopted a resolution finding that Iran's many failures and \n     breaches of its obligations to comply with the Safeguards \n     Agreement constitute noncompliance in the context of Article \n     XII.C of the Statute of the IAEA and that matters concerning \n     Iran's nuclear program have given rise to questions that are \n     within the competence of the Security Council as the organ \n     bearing the primary responsibility for the maintenance of \n     international peace and security;\n       Whereas, on January 3, 2006, the Government of Iran \n     announced that it planned to restart its nuclear research \n     efforts, nullifying the Paris Agreement;\n       Whereas, in January 2006, Iranian officials, in the \n     presence of IAEA inspectors, began to remove IAEA seals from \n     the enrichment facility in Natanz, Iran;\n\n[[Page S254]]\n\n       Whereas Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom Jack Straw \n     warned Iranian officials that they were ``pushing their \n     luck'' by removing the United Nations seals that were placed \n     on the Natanz facility by the IAEA 2 years earlier;\n       Whereas President of France Jacques Chirac said that the \n     Governments of Iran and North Korea risk making a ``serious \n     error'' by pursuing nuclear activities in defiance of \n     international agreements;\n       Whereas Foreign Minister of Germany Frank-Walter Steinmeier \n     said that the Government of Iran had ``crossed lines which it \n     knew would not remain without consequences'';\n       Whereas Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice stated, ``It is \n     obvious that if Iran cannot be brought to live up to its \n     international obligations, in fact, the IAEA Statute would \n     indicate that Iran would have to be referred to the U.N. \n     Security Council.'';\n       Whereas President Ahmadinejad stated, ``The Iranian \n     government and nation has no fear of the Western ballyhoo and \n     will continue its nuclear programs with decisiveness and \n     wisdom.''; and\n       Whereas the United States has joined with the Governments \n     of Britain, France, and Germany in calling for a meeting of \n     the IAEA Board of Governors to discuss Iran's non-compliance \n     with its IAEA safeguards obligations: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) condemns the many failures of the Government of Iran to \n     comply faithfully with its nuclear nonproliferation \n     obligations, including its obligations under the Safeguards \n     Agreement (as reported by the Director General of the IAEA to \n     the IAEA Board of Governors since 2003), its suspension \n     commitments under the Paris Agreement, and prior commitments \n     to the EU-3 to suspend all enrichment- and reprocessing-\n     related activities;\n       (2) commends the efforts of the Governments of France, \n     Germany, and the United Kingdom to seek a meaningful and \n     credible suspension of Iran's enrichment- and reprocessing-\n     related activities and to find a diplomatic means to address \n     the noncompliance of the Government of Iran with its \n     obligations, requirements, and commitments related to nuclear \n     non-proliferation;\n       (3) strongly urges the IAEA Board of Governors, at its \n     special meeting on February 2, 2006, to order that Iran's \n     noncompliance with its safeguards obligations be reported to \n     the United Nations Security Council; and\n       (4) calls on all members of the United Nations Security \n     Council, in particular the Russian Federation and the \n     People's Republic of China, to act expeditiously to consider \n     any report of Iran's noncompliance in fulfillment of the \n     mandate of the Security Council to respond to and deal with \n     situations bearing on the maintenance of international peace \n     and security.\n\n
