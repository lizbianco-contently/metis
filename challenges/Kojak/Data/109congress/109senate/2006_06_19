Mr. President, today we are resuming our work on the \nDepartment of Defense authorization bill. This afternoon provides a \ngood opportunity for Senators to come to the floor and offer Defense-\nrelated amendments. Under last week's order, at 4 o'clock today the \nSenate will proceed to executive session to begin consideration of \nSandra Ikuta to be a circuit court judge for the Ninth Circuit. We have \nallocated an hour of debate on the nomination and, therefore, the vote \nwill occur at 5 p.m. on the Ikuta nomination.\n  Tomorrow we will return to Defense authorization again. I encourage \nMembers to work with the two bill managers to determine the best time \nto debate their amendments. I hope the Senate will maintain focus on \nthe pending issue of authorizing appropriations for our military \nactivities. We can complete this bill in a reasonable period of time \nthis week if Senators will work with the chairman and ranking member on \nrelevant amendments. Our two managers have a great deal of experience \nin shepherding this bill through on the floor and have already done a \ngreat job working together to clear amendments on both sides of the \naisle.\n  Having said that, I look forward to moving forward on this bill and \ncompleting our work on it at the earliest possible time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/19/senate-section/article/S6025-7", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE SECRETARY.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary is responsible for carrying \n     out the Agreement and this title, including the authority, to \n     be exercised in consultation with the Secretary of State, to \n     accept or reject, on behalf of the United States, \n     recommendations made by the joint management committee.\n       (b) Regulations; Cooperation With Canadian Officials.--In \n     exercising responsibilities under this title, the Secretary--\n       (1) may promulgate such regulations as may be necessary to \n     carry out the purposes and objectives of the Agreement and \n     this title; and\n       (2) with the concurrence of the Secretary of State, may \n     cooperate with officials of the Canadian Government duly \n     authorized to carry out the Agreement.\n\n     SEC. 608. RULEMAKING.\n\n       (a) Application With Magnuson-Stevens Act.--The Secretary \n     shall establish the United States catch level for Pacific \n     whiting according to the standards and procedures of the \n     Agreement and this title rather than under the standards and \n     procedures of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and \n     Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), except to the extent \n     necessary to address the rebuilding needs of other species. \n     Except for establishing the catch level, all other aspects of \n     Pacific whiting management shall be--\n       (1) subject to the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation \n     and Management Act; and\n       (2) consistent with this title.\n       (b) Joint Management Committee Recommendations.--For any \n     year in which both parties to the Agreement approve \n     recommendations made by the joint management committee with \n     respect to the catch level, the Secretary shall implement the \n     approved recommendations. Any regulation promulgated by the \n     Secretary to implement any such recommendation shall apply, \n     as necessary, to all persons and all vessels subject to the \n     jurisdiction of the United States wherever located.\n       (c) Years With No Approved Catch Recommendations.--If the \n     parties to the Agreement do not approve the joint management \n     committee's recommendation with respect to the catch level \n     for any year, the Secretary shall establish the total \n     allowable catch for Pacific whiting for the United States \n     catch. In establishing the total allowable catch under this \n     subsection, the Secretary shall--\n       (1) take into account any recommendations from the Pacific \n     Fishery Management Council, the joint management committee, \n     the joint technical committee, the scientific review group, \n     and the advisory panel;\n       (2) base the total allowable catch on the best scientific \n     information available;\n       (3) use the default harvest rate set out in paragraph 1 of \n     Article III of the Agreement unless the Secretary determines \n     that the scientific evidence demonstrates that a different \n     rate is necessary to sustain the offshore whiting resource; \n     and\n       (4) establish the United State's share of the total \n     allowable catch based on paragraph 2 of Article III of the \n     Agreement and make any adjustments necessary under section 5 \n     of Article II of the Agreement.\n\n     SEC. 609. ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS.\n\n       (a) Employment Status.--Individuals serving as such \n     Commissioners, other than officers or employees of the United \n     States Government, shall be considered to be Federal \n     employees while performing such service, only for purposes \n     of--\n       (1) injury compensation under chapter 81 of title 5, United \n     States Code;\n       (2) tort claims liability as provided under chapter 171 of \n     title 28 United States Code;\n       (3) requirements concerning ethics, conflicts of interest, \n     and corruption as provided under title 18, United States \n     Code; and\n       (4) any other criminal or civil statute or regulation \n     governing the conduct of Federal employees.\n       (b) Compensation.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), an \n     individual appointed under this title shall receive no \n     compensation for the individual's service as a \n     representative, alternate representative, scientific expert, \n     or advisory panel member under this title.\n       (2) Scientific review group.--Notwithstanding paragraph \n     (1), the Secretary may employ and fix the compensation of an \n     individual appointed under section 604(a) to serve as a \n     scientific expert on the scientific review group who is not \n     employed by the United States Government, a State government, \n     or an Indian tribal government in accordance with section \n     3109 of title 5, United States Code.\n       (c) Travel Expenses.--Except as provided in subsection (d), \n     the Secretary shall pay the necessary travel expenses of \n     individuals appointed under this title in accordance with the \n     Federal Travel Regulations and sections 5701, 5702, 5704 \n     through 5708, and 5731 of title 5, United States Code.\n       (d) Joint Appointees.--With respect to the 2 independent \n     members of the scientific review group and the 2 public \n     advisors to the scientific review group jointly appointed \n     under section 604(c), and the 1 independent member to the \n     joint technical committee jointly appointed under section \n     605(b), the Secretary may pay up to 50 percent of--\n       (1) any compensation paid to such individuals; and\n       (2) the necessary travel expenses of such individuals.\n\n     SEC. 610. ENFORCEMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary may--\n       (1) administer and enforce this title and any regulations \n     issued under this title;\n       (2) request and utilize on a reimbursed or non-reimbursed \n     basis the assistance, services, personnel, equipment, and \n     facilities of other Federal departments and agencies in the \n     administration and enforcement of this title; and\n       (3) collect, utilize, and disclose such information as may \n     be necessary to implement the Agreement and this title, \n     subject to sections 552 and 552a of title 5, United States \n     Code.\n       (b) Prohibited Acts.--It is unlawful for any person to \n     violate any provision of this title or the regulations \n     promulgated under this title.\n       (c) Actions by the Secretary.--The Secretary shall prevent \n     any person from violating this title in the same manner, by \n     the same means, and with the same jurisdiction, powers, and \n     duties as though all applicable terms and provisions of the \n     Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 \n     U.S.C. 1857) were incorporated into and made a part of this \n     title. Any person that violates any provision of this title \n     is subject to the penalties and entitled to the privileges \n     and immunities provided in the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery \n     Conservation and Management Act in the same manner, by the \n     same means, and with the same jurisdiction, power, and duties \n     as though all applicable terms and provisions of that Act \n     were incorporated into and made a part of this title.\n       (d) Penalties.--This title shall be enforced by the \n     Secretary as if a violation of this title or of any \n     regulation promulgated by the Secretary under this title were \n     a violation of section 307 of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery \n     Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1857).\n\n     SEC. 611. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary \n     such sums as may be necessary to carry out the obligations of \n     the United States under the Agreement and this title.\n\n\n                              CDQ PROGRAM\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. Presdient, as part of the conference report on the \nCoast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2006, which is expected \nto be passed by the Senate shortly, there is a provision in section 416 \nthat amends section 305(i) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation \nand Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1855(i)), which authorizes the Western \nPacific Community Development Quota (CDQ) Program for fisheries of the \nBering Sea and Aleutian Islands (BS/AI).\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is correct. Section 416 provides more specific \nauthorities and direction concerning the operations and fishing \nallocations to and among CDQ groups, in accordance with the \nrecommendations of a Blue Ribbon panel established by the Governor of \nAlaska.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I am familiar with this program, which originated in the \nNorth Pacific Fishery Management Council in 1992, and I support its \ngoals of providing economic opportunities for rural coastal communities \nin Western Alaska. It is my understanding that section 416 ensures the \nCDQ groups will continue to receive the same annual percentage \nallocations as they do now under existing Federal law, and that it \nwould preserve existing treatment of such allocations--consisting of a \ndirected fishing allowance if that is the current law, i.e., the BS/AI \npollock fishery, or including both directed and non-target fishing in \nfisheries where that is the current practice. Is that correct, Senator \nStevens?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes, that is correct. Are you concerned about those \nprovisions?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. No, my concerns relate to Section 416's amendment to\n\n[[Page S6042]]\n\nMSA section 305(i)(1)(B), which would increase CDQ group allocations \nfor certain BS/AI groundfish fisheries, including Pacific cod, \nmackerel, and flatfish species, from 7.5 percent to 10 percent, and \ntreat this allocation as a directed fishing allowance, which does not \ninclude incidental catch. All allocations in these fisheries, including \nthe CDQ allocations, are currently-managed as total quotas, not as \ndirected fishing allowances, which obliges all participants to keep \nboth the directed and incidenteal catch within a ``hard cap.'' Did you \nintend to change the current manner in which the council sets CDQ \nallocations in these fisheries, from a hard cap allocation to a \ndirected fishing allowance allocation?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes, we wanted to create the same approach for these \ngroundfish fisheries that we created legislatively for pollock. \nHowever, these allocations would become effective only upon the \nestablishment of a quota program, fishing cooperative, sector \nallocation or rationalization program in the fishery, and the intent is \nto ensure that management measures apply equally to both CDQ and non-\nCDQ groups. With respect to application of this section to the Pacific \ncod fishery, however, the new CDQ allocations under section 416 are not \nintended to take effect until full rationalization of that fishery, or \nJanuary 1, 2009, whichever date is earlier.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. We are both justifiably proud of the success of the \npollock cooperatives established under the American Fisheries Act, AFA, \nand particularly their low bycatch rates. However, it is my \nunderstanding from speaking with NOAA and council staff that making \nthis directed fishing allowance in statute for the CDQ portion of these \nother BS/AI groundfish fisheries would deprive the council of its \ncurrent authority to limit incidental catch associated with these \nallocations, although it would retain such authority for the non-CDQ \nallocations. I am concerned that this lack of authority could \nunintentionally promote increases in incidental catch for CDQ groups. \nIn addition, any unconstrained growth in incidental catch under the \nlegislatively directed fishing allowances could result in less \navailable catch allowance for the non-CDQ groups subject to incidental \ncatch controls, which seems contrary to your intent that each set of \ngroups be subject to the same management controls.\n  While the pollock fishery has very low incidental catch rates, in \n2005 its incidental catch was only 0.16 percent above the directed \nfishery allowance, the directed fisheries of the BS/AI, other than \nhalibut, sablefish, pollock, and crab, have a relatively higher level \nof bycatch. The council has taken actions to limit and reduce the \namount of incidental catch allowance to all directed fishery \nparticipants in order to reduce overall bycatch levels. Prohibiting the \ncouncil from establishing an incidental catch allowance is antithetical \nto current public policy and resource management in the BS/AI. \nMoreover, it is not consistent with provisions included in the Senate's \nversion of the Magnuson-Stevens Act reauthorization, S. 2012. I suggest \nSection 416 (MSA section 305(i)(1)(B), as amended) be modified to \ninclude this explicit authority.\n  Do you agree with me that the council should retain its ability to \nset incidental catch allowances for the CDQ groups in the fisheries \naffected by section 416's amendment to MSA section 305(i)(1)(B)?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes, I agree. We did not intend to eliminate any \nmanagement authorities regarding incidental catch that are currently \navailable to the Council.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. In view of our agreement on these points, do you agree \nto authorize the council and the Secretary to establish incidental \ncatch limits for these fisheries without prohibiting the council from \nproviding the CDQ program with an incidental catch allowance.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes, I would agree to that clarification to subparagraph \n(B). However, that change must also guarantee that any management \nmeasures will apply equally to both CDQ and non-CDQ portions of the \nfisheries affected by subparagraph (B). Do you agree?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Yes, I do agree that we must ensure fair treatment of \nboth groups in these fisheries, and would support including such \nlanguage in these changes. Do I have your commitment that you will \ninclude these changes to Section 416 in the Coast Guard Conference \nReport before final passage in the Senate, or, if not procedurally \npossible, in another bill that will be enacted this year, including the \nfinal version of the Magnuson-Stevens Act reauthorization?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes. Do you give your consent for final passage of S. \n2012 today?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I fully support passage of S. 2012, your and Senator \nInouye's bill to reauthorize the Magnuson-Stevens Act, particularly in \nview of your commitment to make these changes to section 416 of the \nCoast Guard Conference Report. Senator Inouye, are you in agreement \nwith Senator Stevens and me on these points?\n  Mr. INOUYE. Yes, I would be pleased to work with you and Chairman \nStevens on ensuring that the items you have agreed upon are enacted.\n\n\n                  ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL IMPACT ANALYSIS\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I congratulate the chairman of the Senate \nCommittee on Commerce, Science and Transportation on Senate passage of \nS. 2012, the Magnuson-Stevens Fisheries Conservation and Management \nReauthorization Act of 2006. The chairman has worked very hard to gain \nthe consensus necessary to pass this bill to reauthorize marine \nfisheries conservation and management programs. The Commerce Committee \nreport on this bill provides a wealth of information concerning the \nbill's provisions. However, I would like to ask the chairman to clarify \ntwo provisions in the bill.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Mississippi for \nhis kind words and I would be happy to respond to his questions.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, section 104(a) of S. 2012 would amend \nsection 303(a) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fisheries Conservation and \nManagement Act in several places to require the collection of certain \neconomic information from fisheries participants and require that \nfisheries management plans and amendments analyze the economic and \nsocial impacts of such plans' or amendments' conservation and \nmanagement measures on, and possible mitigation measures for, fisheries \nparticipants and fishing communities affected by these plans or \namendments.\n  Is it the chairman's understanding that the committee intended, for \nthe purposes of this provision, that only the economic impact of direct \nparticipants in the fishery that engage in fishing or fish processing \nbe subject to this economic information collection and impact analysis? \nDoes the chairman agree that attempting to consider such economic \nimpacts on persons such as consumers of fish or suppliers of fishing \nsectors would add unwarranted complexity to this analysis and would \ndetract from the proper focus on only those persons who have a direct \neconomic stake in the fishery?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator from Mississippi is correct. Regional \nFishery Management Councils are tasked with analyzing a large amount of \ndata in order to develop fisheries management plans and amendments. The \ncommittee intended that the economic and social impact analysis \ndescribed in section 303(a) of the act, as amended by this bill, be \nlimited to direct participants in the fishery that engage in fishing or \nfish processing, and not include persons such as consumers of fish or \nsuppliers of fishing sectors.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the chairman for that response. Additionally, \nsection 105 of the bill would amend section 303(b)(2) of the Act to \nprovide additional direction on the authority of Regional Fishery \nManagement Councils to close areas to fishing, or restrict fishing in \nareas of the waters under their jurisdiction. Is it the chairman's \nunderstanding that the committee intended, for the purpose of this \nprovision, that any restriction or closure under this authority will be \nof the minimum size, and include the minimum restrictions on fishing, \nthat are necessary to achieve the intended conservation and management \nbenefits?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senator from Mississippi is correct \non this matter as well. The committee intended that any restriction or \nclosure\n\n[[Page S6043]]\n\nunder this authority will be of the minimum size, and include the \nminimum restrictions on fishing that are necessary to achieve the \nintended conservation and management benefits.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, again, I thank the chairman for his \nclarification of these provisions of S. 2012. I also thank him for his \nyears of work to improve the framework through which our Nation's \nmarine fisheries are conserved and managed. I can think of no other \nMember of this body who more deserves to have his name included in the \nname of the law that governs marine fisheries conservation and \nmanagement.\n  Mr. REED. I thank Senators Stevens and Inouye for including a report \nin Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization \nAct, S. 2012, to study council management coordination between the New \nEngland Fishery Management Council and the Mid-Atlantic Fishery \nManagement Council, MAFMC. This report speaks to an issue of great \nimportance to Rhode Island fishermen. I would also like to thank \nSenator Lautenberg for working with me on developing this language.\n  In October 2005, I introduced the Rhode Island Fishermen's Fairness \nAct in order to address a serious flaw in our Nation's regional \nfisheries management system by adding Rhode Island to the MAFMC, which \ncurrently consists of representatives from New York, New Jersey, \nDelaware, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina. The \nlegislation would create two seats on the MAFMC for Rhode Island: one \nseat nominated by the Governor of Rhode Island and appointed by the \nSecretary of Commerce, and a second seat filled by Rhode Island's \nprincipal state official with marine fishery management responsibility. \nThere is a precedent for this proposed legislation. In 1996, North \nCarolina's representatives in Congress succeeded in adding that State \nto the MAFMC through an amendment to the Sustainable Fisheries Act. \nLike Rhode Island, a significant proportion of North Carolina's landed \nfish species were managed by the MAFMC, yet the State had no vote on \nthe council.\n  While I am disappointed that this reauthorization bill did not \ninclude my legislation, I believe that the report will provide useful \ninformation to the Senate that will support Rhode Island's \nparticipation as a voting member on the MAFMC based on the Magnuson-\nStevens Act's National Standards and the economic value of MAFMC \nmanaged species to Rhode Island. The report will provide an opportunity \nfor the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council, in consultation with \nthe New England Fishery Management Council, to: evaluate the role of \ncouncil liaisons in the development and approval of management plans \nfor fisheries in which Rhode Island has a demonstrated interest and \nsignificant landings; evaluate approaches developed by the councils to \nimprove representation of non-member States in decision-making; and \nanalyze characteristics that supported North Carolina's inclusion in \nthe MAFMC and how those characteristics support Rhode Island's \nposition.\n  The MAFMC manages the following 13 species, all of which are landed \nin Rhode Island: Illex squid, loligo squid, Atlantic mackerel, black \nsea bass, bluefish, butterfish, monkfish, scup, spiny dogfish, summer \nflounder, surfclam, ocean quahog, and tilefish. Rhode Island fishermen \ntarget a large proportion of species managed by MAFMC. These species \nmake up a large proportion of landings within Rhode Island every year. \nBetween 1995 and 2004, MAFMC species represented between 42 percent and \n56 percent of all finfish landed in Rhode Island annually, for an \naverage of 37 percent of total landings by weight. The economic value \nof these species to Rhode Island in 2004 totaled $72.8 million. Between \n1995 and 2004, squid, Illex and loligo, was the number one marine \nspecies, based on economic value, landed in Rhode Island, with a value \nof $24.7 million in 2004. Because of these fisheries importance to \nRhode Island, both in terms of the economic value and overall landings \nby weight, I believe the State deserves a vote in the management of \nthese species on the MAFMC.\n  Again, I want to thank Senators Stevens, Inouye, and Lautenberg for \ntheir assistance in addressing Rhode Island's interest to become a \nvoting member of the MAFMC. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues on this issue.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment at the desk be \nagreed to, the committee-reported substitute, as amended, be agreed to, \nthe bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed, and the motion \nto reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4310) was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The committee-reported substitute, as amended, was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 2012), as amended, was ordered to be engrossed for a \nthird reading, read the third time and passed.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I return to my original unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the Senator from \nMassachusetts being recognized for 30 minutes in morning business? \nWithout objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/19/senate-section/article/S6043-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6043-S6047]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support the John Warner National \nDefense Authorization Act of fiscal year 2007, and I commend the \nimpressive way in which the distinguished Senator from Virginia has led \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee over these last 6 years. He has \nprovided a consistently steady hand on the tiller in these troubled \ntimes, and the Senate's action in naming the bill is eminently well \ndeserved.\n  In a time of conflict, our first and foremost responsibility is to \nprovide for our troops in the field, and this bill provides for our \nsoldiers, our sailors, marines, and airmen defending our great country \nin all parts of the world. We have improved on the administration's \nrequest for our service members. Our forces overseas are being \nstressed, and they bear the heavy burden of combat. Yet the \nadministration would cut their end strength and reduce the value of the \nretirement health benefits they may well need to cope with the effect \nof the war.\n  The committee wisely chose not to follow this path. Instead, we \nmaintained the end strength and benefits in addition to a 2.2-percent \npay raise and larger targeted increases for midgrade, enlisted, and \nwarrant officers. The bill also improves on the administration's \nrequest for future readiness. It authorizes substantial investments in \nkey ships, aircraft, and Army transformation programs. It also ensures \nlong-term value for the taxpayer by preserving competition in our vital \naircraft engine and shipbuilding industries.\n  In addition, it calls for continued acquisition reforms to reduce \nfraud and waste in defense spending. Even more important, the bill \ninvests in the protection of our personnel. It authorizes over a \nbillion dollars in force protection equipment, including up-armored \nHMMWVs and body armor. And it also provides $2.1 billion for the joint \nimprovised explosive device defeat fund to support a Manhattan project \neffort to deal with IEDs, the No. 1 threat to our forces in the field \nand to innocent Iraqis.\n\n  So this is a very worthy piece of legislation. It bears the name of \none of our most honorable Members, the chairman of our committee, and I \nwelcome the opportunity to support that.\n  I had intended this afternoon to offer an increase in the minimum \nwage as an amendment to the Defense authorization bill. I think it is a \nfair question to ask, does this really make sense on a Defense \nauthorization bill? I respond to that that so many of those brave men \nand women are fighting in Afghanistan or Iraq or fighting for the \nvalues this Nation represents, and one of the values this Nation \nrepresents is fairness and decency to hard-working American workers. \nFairness and decency for hard-working American workers means they are \ngoing to be paid a fair, just wage. That is why I think it is \nconsistent with this legislation. I know we are going to have important \ndebates and discussions on other parts of the Defense authorization \nbill, but we welcome the opportunity to raise this issue. It is not a \nnew issue, it is a familiar issue. It doesn't take a great deal of \ntime, although a number of our\n\n[[Page S6044]]\n\ncolleagues wish to be heard on it because it is an issue we have \ndebated and discussed going back to the 1930s. The Members of this body \nare extremely familiar with it as a public policy issue in question and \ncan express an informed judgment about it in virtually short order.\n  For generations, Americans have believed that if they worked hard and \nplayed by the rules, they could achieve the American dream. They \nbelieved they could be better off than their parents or could join the \nmiddle class. They could earn more each year, provide safety and \nsecurity for their families, and save for their retirement. But today, \nmore and more Americans are losing faith in that dream as prices for \neveryday necessities, such as gasoline and housing and health care, \nskyrocket. Too many hard-working people are living on the edge--just \none serious illness, one pink slip away from bankruptcy.\n  For minimum wage workers, the American dream is even further from \nreality. Minimum wage workers are men and women of dignity. They care \nfor their children and for young children in daycare centers. They care \nfor senior citizens in nursing homes. They check out groceries in the \nsupermarket. They clean our office buildings. But the minimum wage they \nreceive no longer covers their bills. A minimum wage worker who works \n40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, earns just $10,700. That is almost \n$6,000 below the poverty line for a family of three.\n  At these wages, no matter how hard they work, minimum wage workers \nare forced to make impossible choices between paying the rent and \nbuying groceries, paying the heating bills or buying clothes. They \ncannot afford health care. They cannot earn enough to pay for adequate \nhousing for their families anywhere in the country. Minimum wage \nworkers' daily fear is poverty, hunger, and homelessness. Our \nRepublican colleagues continue to turn a blind eye to the struggles of \nworking families in this country, particularly the hard-working people \nwho work for the very lowest wages.\n  It has been almost 10 years since Congress raised the minimum wage. \nTime and again, many have called on the Senate to increase the minimum \nwage. Yet, time and again, Republican colleagues refuse to give working \npeople the raise they deserve, even though we grant annual pay \nincreases to Senators. What could be more hypocritical?\n  Fortunately, the American people understand what the Republican \nleadership does not, and that is nobody who works hard for a living \nshould have to live in poverty. That is why the American people \noverwhelming support an increase in the minimum wage. Year after year, \nas the GOP Congress keeps refusing to help minimum wage workers, the \nAmerican people are rising up. They are marching in the streets and \npraying in churches and synagogues. They are also taking their battles \nto the ballot box and telling us overwhelmingly that a minimum wage \nincrease is long overdue.\n  This amendment that I am offering with a number of my colleagues will \nraise the minimum wage to $7.25 an hour in 3 steps over the next 2 \nyears--70 cents now, 60 cents a year from now, and 60 more cents 2 \nyears from now. This increase will directly raise the pay of more than \n6.5 million workers, indirectly benefitting more than 8 million more.\n  Contrary to public perception, these workers are not teenagers \nlooking for their first job for pocket change. Eighty percent of those \nwho benefit are adult workers, more than a third the sole breadwinners \nof their families. Raising the minimum wage is something I believe is \nenormously important, and the time to do it is now.\n  I want to review for the Senate for a few minutes a brief history of \nwhere we are in terms of the minimum wage. It started in 1938. We see \nthe Presidents listed here. They represent Republican Presidents, as \nwell as Democratic Presidents, who have supported an increase in the \nminimum wage, going back to 1938. Franklin Roosevelt, three different \nsteps; Harry Truman; Dwight Eisenhower, a Republican; John Kennedy saw \nan increase; Lyndon Johnson; Richard Nixon; George Bush; and William \nClinton.\n  The history of the minimum wage up to the last few years has \nbasically been a bipartisan effort. Yet we have not been able to get a \nbipartisan effort to increase the minimum wage over the period of the \nlast 9 years. What has happened to those who are on the lowest rung of \nthe economic ladder? As I mentioned, these are men and women of \ndignity.\n  At the start of this debate, we have to understand who the minimum \nwage workers are. They are men and women of dignity. These are tough, \ndifficult jobs, but they try to do them well, and they take great pride \nin their jobs. They work as assistants to teachers, in nursing homes \nlooking after the elderly, cleaning out the great buildings of American \ncommerce, and they are maids in various buildings all across this \nNation. They are men and women of dignity.\n  I thought we had sort of an agreement in this body, with Republicans \nand Democrats alike, that if you have a job, you ought to have a job \nthat gets you out of poverty, not one that keeps you in poverty. \nCurrently, the minimum wage keeps you in poverty; it doesn't get you \nout of it. I thought we could all agree that we want to get people who \nwork hard and play by the rules out of poverty and have their work be \nrewarding. I thought that would be something at least Republicans and \nDemocrats could agree on. But we have not been able to get that \nagreement, Mr. President.\n  What we have seen over the period since 2000 to 2004 is the number of \nAmericans now living in poverty--those lowest income people have \nincreased by 5.4 million of our fellow American citizens. Well over a \nmillion of those are children who are living in poverty in the United \nStates. The principal reason for that is because we have not seen an \nincrease in the minimum wage, which is something we can do that can \nmake a major difference in the reduction of poverty for these people \nwho are working hard.\n\n  Now, this chart shows what the poverty line is. Look where the \nminimum wage is in the 1960s, right at the poverty line. In the late \nsixties, it was even above the poverty line. It would have been close \nto $19,000 a year in terms of real purchasing power. Then in the 1970s \nand through the 1970s up until 1980, we kept the minimum wage at the \nFederal poverty level. Then we have seen the decline in the purchasing \npower of the minimum wage now to be less than $5,888. It was up to \n$19,000 at one time, but is now down to $5,888. You see, Mr. President, \nif you look at this chart, the 1990 figure--just above it--that was \nwhen we raised the minimum wage. And again, in 1997, we saw an increase \nin the minimum wage. That is when we see those red indicators go up. \nThat shows how far we have seen a decline in the minimum wage. The real \nminimum wage declined 20 percent in the 9 years of Republican \nopposition. It is not just the fact that the figures have been frozen, \nit is the fact that its purchasing power has declined significantly.\n  Look at this, Mr. President. This shows the dramatic reduction down \n20 percent in the purchasing power of what we have passed previously. \nWe are not only not increasing the value of the minimum wage in terms \nof purchasing power, which has declined; now we see in our proposal, \neffectively over a 2-year period, we raise it to $7.25. We know that we \nwill hear from some that we cannot raise that to $7.25 because of the \ndramatic impact, adverse impact, it would have on the American economy. \nIt is interesting that this fall in the No. 2 economy in Europe, which \nis Great Britain, it will be $9.80 an hour. In another leading economy \nin Western Europe, which happens to be Ireland, it is $9.60 an hour. \nThey have robust economic growth in their economy.\n  Listen to their chancellor, Gordon Brown, talk about the difference \nthe increase in the minimum wage has made. The number of people they \nbrought out of poverty is 2\\1/2\\ million people, and a million and a \nhalf people they brought out of poverty in Great Britain. We have the \npossibility of making a modest difference with this. This is a modest \nincrease to $7.25.\n  I put this chart up because it is a clear indication about what is \nhappening out in the workforce with American workers. They are working \nlonger and harder. More than 39 million Americans, which is 28 percent \nof the workforce, work more than 40 hours a week. Nearly one in five \nworkers works more than 48 hours a week.\n\n[[Page S6045]]\n\nMore than 7.6 million Americans are working two or more jobs, and \n334,000 of them hold two full-time jobs. So American workers' hours \nhave increased more than in any other industrialized nation.\n  American workers are working longer and harder and getting less pay, \nMr. President. We have seen an explosion in terms of productivity, but \nthat is not being passed down to the workers at the lower rung, \nalthough it was done at other times by Republicans and Democrats. So \nwhat do we say? Are we saying the minimum wage workers are slackers, or \nthat these workers are not working the full time? Are we saying they \nare not showing up for work? Absolutely not. We see from these \nstatistics that American workers--and particularly the workers at the \nlower income--are working longer and harder than any workforce in any \nother industrialized nation in the world.\n  These are the figures from the OECD in 2004. You see that Americans \nhave increased more than any other industrialized country. Many \ncountries have actually gone down. Canada has gone up, from 16.8 \npercent since 1970 to 2002, and America is up 20 percent. This is what \nwe have.\n  So what are we talking about? We are talking about an issue that \nprimarily affects women because nearly 60 percent of workers affected \nby a minimum wage increase are women. So this is primarily a women's \nissue. Better than half of all of those women have children. So this is \nalso a children's issue. This is a children's issue and a women's \nissue.\n  We hear a great deal about family values in this Chamber. This is a \nfamily value--how that child is going to grow up, whether that worker \nwill be treated with respect and dignity, whether that mother or father \nis going to be able to spend time with that child. That is all \nreflected in whether we are going to get the increase in the minimum \nwage. This is also a civil rights issue because so many of those who \nearn the minimum wage are men and women of color. So it is a women's \nissue, a children's issue, and civil rights issue.\n  Mr. President, this $4,400 means that would be the cumulative value \nof that over the period of a year--2 years of childcare--at a time that \nthis body is cutting back on childcare, and the waiting lists in our \nStates are becoming extensive.\n  We know now this would help a family with childcare, with a full \ntuition for a community college degree, a year and a half of heat and \nelectricity, more than a year of groceries, and more than 8 months of \nrent. This is not insignificant. It may be to Members of this body, but \nit is not insignificant to those people who are out there working hard.\n  What I believe is the most difficult point for Americans to \nunderstand is that from the time we raised the minimum wage last in \n1997 to 2006, Members of Congress have increased their salary by \n$31,600, but we have refused to increase the minimum wage by 5 cents. \nMaybe someone can explain that. We have increased our salaries by \n$31,600, and we haven't increased the minimum wage 5 cents. That is not \nright, that is not fair, that is wrong, and we have an opportunity to \nchange it.\n  At other times when we have talked about the minimum wage and the \nimpact it has had on the total wages that have been paid in this \ncountry, many have said: If you increase the minimum wage, it is going \nto add to the problems of inflation. We see that the increase in the \ntotal amount of minimum wage we include in this is less than one-\nquarter of 1 percent of total wages that are paid. So it is incidental \nto that.\n  If we look back over the increases of the minimum wage in the 1990s, \nit had virtually no impact in terms of employment. Employment actually \nincreased, and unemployment was reduced during that period of time. If \nwe look at the various polls that have been taken even with small \nbusiness, they say they don't believe they are adversely impacted by an \nincrease in the minimum wage.\n  I submit that we are prepared to move ahead and increase the minimum \nwage as I open these remarks. I want to retain a few minutes for my \nfriend from New Mexico. We sent our fighting men and women to \nAfghanistan and Iraq to fight for the values of fairness, decency, and \njustice, and we are talking about economic justice in this instance. If \nwe are talking about trying to maintain our commitment to the kind of \nvalues for which they are fighting--economic justice, economic fairness \nis certainly one of them--then this issue about increasing the minimum \nwage is about as basic and fundamental in terms of economic justice as \nany issue we will have before the Senate.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator controls an additional 10 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield such time as the Senator from New Mexico uses.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for bringing this \namendment to the Senate for consideration. I understand he is not \noffering it at this moment but will at a later point. I wish to speak \nbriefly about some of the points he has made and make a few others.\n  There is a philosophical argument which has raged around the world \nfor a long time about whether it is appropriate to have a minimum wage. \nI am certain that when this Congress decided in 1938 that the United \nStates should have a minimum wage, there was a substantial amount of \ndebate on that philosophical issue. So I concede that to start with.\n  They are having a similar debate in Mexico today. They have a \nPresidential election coming up in Mexico in a couple of weeks. One of \nthe issues in Mexico is whether they should raise the minimum wage. The \nminimum wage in Mexico is $4.50 a day. The question is, Should we have \na minimum wage and, if so, should it be a minimum wage that actually \nhelps people to stay out of poverty or to work their way out of \npoverty? That is the issue which the Senator from Massachusetts is \nraising for consideration today.\n  I believe very strongly that we should have a minimum wage. I believe \nvery strongly that we should change that minimum wage as necessary to \nkeep up with the cost of living and with the poverty rate, as we have \ndetermined it, so that people who do work full time for a minimum wage \ncan stay above the poverty line. That would be the ideal.\n  In fact, when we look at the chart that was referred to by the \nSenator from Massachusetts, which I think is an excellent chart, it \npoints out that beginning about 1980, the minimum wage began to drop \nprecipitously relative to the Federal poverty line. It remains very low \nand is declining even further today because of the refusal of this \nCongress and this administration to take action to deal with it.\n  I fear, while very few today would argue that we should have no \nminimum wage, in fact, that is where we are headed with the policy this \nadministration has adopted. We are continuing to resist efforts to \nchange the minimum wage. The minimum wage is becoming less and less a \nsupport for the low-paid workers of this country, and clearly we are \nway behind in trying to deal with this issue.\n  There is one other issue which I wish to particularly call to my \ncolleagues' attention, and that is the question of whether or not, if \nthere should be a minimum wage, should it be set at the national level \nor should it be set at the State level or the local level? In fact, we \nmade a decision in 1938 to have a minimum wage set at the national \nlevel. Now since the Federal Government has refused in the last 9 years \nto take any action to moderate or adjust that minimum wage, more and \nmore communities, more and more States are acting to fill that vacuum, \nand that is what we are seeing all over my State.\n  Let me point out that in my State in 2003, the Santa Fe City Council \npassed the highest minimum wage increase in the country. In January of \n2004, the minimum wage increased to $8.50 per hour. In January of this \nyear, the minimum wage went to $9.50 per hour. It is scheduled to go to \n$10.50 per hour in 2008 in the city limits of Santa Fe, NM. According \nto the mayor of Santa Fe, approximately 9,000 families received a raise \nbecause of that city ordinance that changed the minimum wage. Believe \nit or not, the Santa Fe economy did not crumble. In fact, according to \na University of New Mexico study that was released last year, job \ngrowth in Santa Fe was 3.5 percent the first year\n\n[[Page S6046]]\n\nthat the $8.50 wage was in effect. It was ahead of the 2.1-percent \ngrowth in jobs for our State as a whole. Overall, employment increased \nin each quarter after the living wage went into effect, and it has been \nespecially strong for hotels and restaurants, which have the most low-\nwage jobs.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Yes, I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, there have been a number of cities, \nincluding Boston, across this country that have adopted a living wage. \nOf course, as the Senator knows, there have been a number of States \neven in the most recent times--North Carolina, Arkansas, the most \nrecent--that have increased the minimum wage. I am wondering whether \nthe Senator from New Mexico found out in Santa Fe, with an increase in \nthe living wage, what we found out in Baltimore, for example, and that \nwas, first of all, there is much lower turnover by workers in the \ncommunity, and therefore there is much less training that is necessary \nfor the municipality when they get new workers. There is a much higher \ndegree of attendance, fewer people who are dropping out of the labor \nmarket, productivity has increased, and in all we have seen in so many \nliving-wage communities that the concerns which have been expressed by \nthe opposition have melted away because what has happened is the \nworkforce that has remained has become more loyal, more productive, \nhigher morale, and less willing to move or change jobs, better and \ncontinued training for their job, and the output for those workers has \nbeen a significant improvement. I wonder if the Senator has some \ngeneral impressions with regard to his own observations and results.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I do think my strong impression is there \nhave been many of the positive benefits the Senator cited that we have \nrealized in Santa Fe and other communities in my State where there has \nbeen an increase in the minimum wage.\n  One other I would mention is that the number of families in need of \ntemporary assistance has declined significantly since we moved to a \nhigher minimum wage in Santa Fe, and that has been another benefit to \nthe community.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Yes, I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. What we have seen is if the employers are not paying the \nminimum wage, then the workers are eligible for a variety of different \nFederal programs that are paid for by the general taxpayers; while if \nthey pay the minimum wage or a living wage--and the living wage is more \nin correspondence to the poverty wage--then these workers are no longer \neligible for the range of social programs that are available and there \nis less of a burden on working Americans. In other words, we find that \nmany of the companies that are paying low wages are actually being \nsubsidized by the taxpayers with either food assistance or additional \nhousing or additional benefits for which they otherwise would not be \neligible. This has been estimated to be in the billions of dollars.\n  The Senator makes a very good point that this is just an example \nabout how many of these employers are being subsidized by the taxpayers \nby keeping low wages so their workers are eligible for other \ngovernmental programs, while if they are paid a decent wage, they \nwouldn't be eligible, and that would relieve the burden on the American \ntaxpayers.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I agree entirely with what the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts has said. In fact, the governmental assistance \nprograms that are required and that are in place do not have to do the \njob of filling in the gap between this poverty line and the minimum \nwage as we have allowed it to exist. So there is a serious issue here.\n  I wish to mention one other aspect of this issue.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 30 minutes. The Senator's \ntime has expired.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, first, I ask unanimous consent that I may \nbe allowed to speak in morning business not to exceed 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, we \nhave yet to bring up the Defense authorization bill. The leadership is \ncontinuing to work out, hopefully, an accommodation for the initiative \nof the Senator from Massachusetts on the very important amendment on \nminimum wage. So I wish to inform colleagues that hopefully this will \nbe procedurally worked out, such as we can bring the bill up and then \nproceed on the bill. But in the meantime, we remain in morning \nbusiness, and if there is additional time the Senator from \nMassachusetts would like or the distinguished Senator from New Mexico--\nand I see the Senator from Kentucky--I will be perfectly willing to try \nto accommodate Senators.\n  Might I inquire of the Senator from Kentucky the subject on which he \nwould like to speak?\n  Mr. BUNNING. It is on the nomination of the Federal Reserve vice-\nchairmanship.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, could the Senator from New Mexico just be \ngiven a final few minutes to wind up, and then I have no objection to \nproceeding with the nomination.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine. Yes. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I ask \nunanimous consent that another 10 minutes be allocated to Senator \nKennedy under his jurisdiction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield to the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues. I thank the \nchairman of the committee, Senator Warner. Let me just make one \nadditional point and then yield the remainder of the time to Senator \nKennedy to conclude the argument.\n  The other point is I find the positions of many of the employers who \nhave come in to see me and talk to me about this issue of minimum wage \nhas changed very dramatically over the last year or two. For a long \nperiod of time, I found that the owners of hotels and restaurants and \nother businesses in my State would come to town each year and lobby me \nagainst an increase in the minimum wage, believing that increasing the \nminimum wage would make it more difficult for them to compete. The \ntruth is, now the local communities such as the community of Santa Fe, \nthe community of Albuquerque, and other local communities around the \ncountry have begun to change the minimum wage and to essentially take \naction where the Federal Government has failed to take action. I am \nfinding that these same employers are now coming in and saying: Would \nyou please adjust the Federal minimum wage? Would you please take what \nis the normal course and keep the Federal minimum wage at a reasonable \nlevel so that we do not have every community in the country feeling \nunder pressure to pass an ordinance on the subject? I think that is a \nreasonable position for them to take.\n  So those same businesses that used to lobby me against increasing the \nminimum wage are now lobbying me in favor of increasing the minimum \nwage because they believe very strongly that this is a national issue, \nthat we ought to have a national minimum wage, it ought to be \nreasonable, and it ought to be adjusted as the cost of living goes up \nand as the Federal poverty line requires.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment when it \nactually gets offered. I thank my colleague for allowing me to speak on \nthis issue.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will just speak briefly and then yield \nto the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Just a point I want to underline, and that is the impact of a low \nminimum wage on children--on children. America's children are more \nlikely to live in poverty than Americans in any other group. Nearly one \nin five children live in poverty. The poverty rate for children in the \nUnited States is substantially higher, often two or three times higher, \nthan that of most of the other major western industrial nations. \nSweden's child poverty rate is a fifth of America's. Poland's child \npoverty rate is half of America's. African-American and Latino children \nare more likely to live in poverty than White children.\n\n[[Page S6047]]\n\nOne-third of African-American children live below the poverty line, as \ndo nearly one-third of Latino children. We must give these children a \nboost in life by ensuring that their hard-working parents receive a \nliving wage. Raising the minimum wage will help raise these families \nout of poverty, making a difference in the lives of their children. \nIncreasing the minimum wage will help nearly 7.5 million children whose \nparents would receive a raise, and over 3 million kids have parents who \nwould get an immediate raise.\n  Reducing child poverty is one of the best investments that Americans \ncan make in our Nation's future. Fewer children in poverty will mean \nmore children entering school ready to learn, more successful schools \nand fewer dropouts, better child health, and less strain on hospitals \nand public health systems, less strain on our juvenile justice system, \nand less child hunger and malnutrition and other important advances. It \nis long past time to raise the minimum wage. No child in this country \nshould have to live in poverty.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I understand from the distinguished \nSenator from Massachusetts that this concludes for this period of time \nhis comments on the minimum wage. I would simply ask at this time \nunanimous consent that those Senators desiring to have statements on \nthe minimum wage amendment printed in the Record appear following \nSenator Kennedy's colloquy with his colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. We will, of course, I say to my good friend, in due \ncourse comment and provide a response to, first, your request on \nprocedure, and, second, to the substance of this very important \namendment. So I thank you for the cooperation that you have shown this \nmorning.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/19/senate-section/article/S6047-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6047]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF DONALD KOHN TO BE VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS \n                     OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to executive session for the consideration of Calendar No. 711, \nDonald Kohn; provided further that Senator Bunning be recognized to \nspeak for up to 15 minutes; following the use or yielding back of time, \nthe Senate proceed to a vote on the confirmation of the nomination, \nwith no further intervening action or debate.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent following the vote, the President be \nimmediately notified of the Senate's action and the Senate resume \nlegislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I simply would say, it says ``Senate \nresume legislative session.'' It should be: The Senate will resume the \nsession of morning business. We wouldn't return to legislation right \naway.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session for consideration of Executive Calendar \nNo. 711, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Donald L. \nKohn, of Virginia, to be Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors of the \nFederal Reserve System.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nKentucky is recognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Thank you, Mr. President. I will not require 15 minutes, \nbut I do have some things to say about the nominee. I just want to \nspeak for a few minutes to explain why I am going to vote no on the \nnomination of Donald Kohn to be Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors \nof the Federal Reserve.\n  I am going to vote against Dr. Kohn because I do not think he has \nbeen an independent voice at the Fed. Since he joined the Fed in 2002 \nas a member, he has agreed with all of the interest rate decisions that \nChairman Bernanke and former Chairman Greenspan advanced. And because \nof recent statements, some as recently as Friday, I am convinced he is \nnot going to speak up against yet another decision to hike interest \nrates when the Fed open market committee meets at the end of this \nmonth.\n  Interest rate and inflation fears caused by statements from the Fed \nmembers have put our stock markets into free fall. Ever since the last \nFed hike, stock values have been plummeting. A lot of value has been \ndestroyed. Even counting a few good days last week, most of the major \nindexes are, at best, flat for 2006, despite a great runup in the first \n4 months of the year. Individual investors and pension funds have lost \nbillions of dollars, investors' confidence is shaken, and for what? \nInflation data is at worst mixed. I certainly do not believe it is out \nof control. Oil and commodity prices have fallen significantly lately. \nConsumer spending is still strong.\n  Former Fed Chairman Greenspan said recently that the economy has been \nable to handle the high gasoline prices. And even Chairman Bernanke \nadmitted last week that the signs of inflation have weakened.\n  But the Fed keeps raising interest rates, and its members keep \ntalking like another rate increase is coming, even after the June \nmeeting. Inflation indicators talked about by Fed members look at what \nhas been, not what is coming. And interest rate increases take time to \nimpact the economy. But the Fed has not taken a break in raising rates \nfor over 2 years--2 years. The Fed has a bad record of overshooting, \nand I am afraid they will overshoot this time if they have not already \ndone so.\n  We all know that interest rate hikes will slow the economy. I just \nhope that it won't kill it. We need the Fed to stop the madness. I am \nnot convinced that Dr. Kohn will be a voice to stop the madness sooner \nrather than later. Because I am not convinced Dr. Kohn will be the \nright voice at the Fed or an independent voice as Vice Chairman, I will \nvote no.\n  So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the vote occurs \non Dr. Kohn's nomination, the Record reflect that I voted no.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the vote now occurs on the nomination. The \nquestion is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination of \nDonald L.

Mr. President, when it is appropriate, I would like to \noffer an amendment to the Defense authorization bill, and I have \nprovided that amendment to the chairman of the committee and to the \nranking member. I would like, obviously, to get a vote on that at \nwhatever time is convenient to them and the orderly processing of that \nlegislation. I am told that right now is not the right time, and that I\n\n[[Page S6048]]\n\nshould go ahead and speak as in morning business and explain the \namendment, which I am glad to do.\n  This is amendment No. 4317. It has been filed. It is at the desk. I \nwould just explain to people this is an amendment that would propose to \nexpedite the processing of individuals who are being held in \nGuantanamo.\n  Let me take a brief moment and describe more specifically what the \namendment does. With respect to individuals currently held at \nGuantanamo, the amendment would require that the Government charge, \nrepatriate, or release those prisoners within 180 days of the enactment \nof this legislation; that is, the completion of the signing by the \nPresident of the Defense authorization bill. However, if for any reason \nthe Government has not charged or repatriated or released the \nindividuals within that timeframe provided in the amendment, then the \nDepartment of Defense would be required to provide a report regarding \nwhy they have not done so to the appropriate committees of the \nCongress, and this report could be submitted in classified form, if \nnecessary, or in unclassified form.\n  Nothing in the amendment would require the Department of Defense to \nrelease any individual who is a threat to the security of the United \nStates. Also, to make it perfectly clear, this amendment does not state \nthat the Guantanamo facility would be closed within 180 days. The \namendment merely provides that within that period, which I believe to \nbe a reasonable timeframe, the United States will make a determination \nregarding what it intends to do with the individuals currently being \nheld there. For example, if an individual is charged and tried before a \nmilitary tribunal, there is nothing in the amendment that prevents the \nGovernment from continuing to detain that person at Guantanamo, either \nwhile they are awaiting trial or after they are sentenced, if a \nsentence is imposed and they are found guilty. My amendment is simply \naimed at moving this process along, not at closing the facility.\n  The amendment also provides the Government with flexibility regarding \nthe appropriate venue if it decides to bring charges against an \nindividual. The Government could file charges in a United States \ndistrict court, in a military tribunal, or in an international criminal \ntribunal. On June 9, President Bush stated that he believes that those \nheld at Guantanamo ``ought to be tried in courts here in the United \nStates.''\n\n  Several days later, on June 14, he said that the best way to ``handle \nthese types of people is through our military courts.''\n  Frankly, whether they are tried in our military courts or in domestic \ncourts is not of great consequence, as long as the trial is conducted \nin accordance with due process. What is important is that the \nindividuals whom we believe have committed a crime are brought to \njustice and those who are not a threat to this Nation are released. \nThis is one of the fundamental premises of our traditional notion of \njustice, and it is time that we restore our adherence to this important \nprinciple.\n  Serious questions have been raised with respect to the military \ncommissions that are currently being used in the few cases where \nindividuals have been charged. In fact, the Supreme Court is expected \nto rule within the next week or so regarding the legality of such \ncommissions. However, the amendment that I am offering does not favor \nany one venue over any other venue, should the United States decide to \ntry an individual. The amendment simply states that a person may be \ncharged in a ``military tribunal.'' This could include court martial \nproceedings under the Uniform Code of Military Justice or military \ncommissions.\n  The amendment does not provide the Government with any new authority, \nnor does it restrict the ability of the Government to bring charges in \nan appropriate military tribunal. Regardless of what the Supreme Court \nrules in the Hamdan case, the amendment still maintains flexibility \nwith regard to such decisions.\n  Some may assert that under the laws of war there is no requirement \nthat a person be charged with a crime and that individuals can be held \nuntil the end of hostilities. While I understand this argument, we have \nnot applied traditional laws of war with respect to these people. \nNeither have we applied traditional notions of domestic criminal law.\n  Over the last several years the administration has been adamant that \nit would not apply the requirements of the Geneva Convention to these \nprisoners and that Federal courts have no role in providing judicial \noversight of the detention of these individuals. The fact is that the \nadministration has made up the rules that apply to these persons as \nthey have gone along.\n  In addition, as the President likes to say, we are fighting an \nunconventional war of an indefinite duration. The threat of terrorism \nis not going to be resolved with some formal peace treaty. It is and \nwill remain for some time one of the most significant challenges that \nyou or our Nation will face.\n  It is time that we begin to close the legal black hole that has \nexisted with respect to these individuals and begin to deal with them \nwithin some recognized legal framework. As the President stated on June \n14 of this year, ``We better have a plan to deal with them in our \ncourts.'' I agree with that. The amendment I am offering would help \nexpedite this process and would ensure that the United States has such \na plan. It would also reassert congressional oversight of the process.\n  Under the amendment I am offering, the Government could also send an \nindividual back to his home country, so long as there are not \nsubstantial grounds to believe that the individual would be subjected \nto torture or, if appropriate, the Government could release the \nindividual to a third party country. Nothing in my amendment biases \nwhat is done with these individuals. As I have said, the decision of \nwhether a person is charged or repatriated or released is in the \ndiscretion of the Government and would be made in a manner consistent \nwith our national security.\n  Some may argue that the 180 days provided under the amendment is not \nenough time to make such a determination. First, let's remember that \nmany of the people we are talking about have been at Guantanamo for \nover 4 years. It is my understanding that no new prisoners have been \nsent to Guantanamo for over 21 months. Every person held at Guantanamo \nhas already gone before a Combatant Status Review Tribunal to determine \nwhether they are so-called enemy combatants.\n  As part of this process, the Department of Defense presents the \nevidence that it believes provides a basis for the continued detention \nof the individual. All of the prisoners have been interrogated \nrepeatedly and the intelligence regarding their alleged wrongdoing has \nbeen thoroughly vetted. As such, the 6 months provided under this \namendment is more than sufficient time to make a decision of what to do \nwith these individuals. There has been plenty of time to gather the \ninformation necessary to make a determination of whether or not they \nshould be tried for committing a crime or whether they should be sent \nto their home country or whether they should be released if they are \nnot in fact a threat to the United States. But, as I mentioned before, \nif the Government is unable to comply or chooses not to comply, it is \nsimply required at that point--the Secretary of Defense is required--to \nprovide the relevant congressional committees with information \nregarding why this deadline was not met.\n  These are not earth-shattering proposals that are contained in my \namendment. These are all options on which the President has said that \nhe is moving forward. President Bush has stated on several occasions \nrecently that he would like to close Guantanamo and that the \nindividuals being held there should be tried in a court and repatriated \nor released.\n  This last May, while on a trip to Germany, the President said, ``I \nwould like to close the camp and put the prisoners on trial.'' He has \nreiterated this position twice this month. He has also stated that the \nGovernment is in the process of repatriating certain individuals. \nAccording to the Department of Defense, there are about 120 prisoners \nwho have been determined to be eligible for transfer or release.\n  Unfortunately, despite the statements that progress is being made in \nprocessing these individuals, the facts are clear. There are currently \napproximately 460 prisoners that remain in a\n\n[[Page S6049]]\n\nstate of indefinite imprisonment with little prospect of either being \nheld accountable for their actions or being allowed to prove their \ninnocence. Since the United States began sending people to Guantanamo \nin 2002, only 10 individuals have ever been formally charged with any \nwrongdoing.\n  From a diplomatic standpoint, the continued indefinite detention of \nindividuals at Guantanamo has damaged our own country. As President \nBush said on June 14:\n\n       No question, Guantanamo sends a signal to some of our \n     friends--provides an excuse, for example, to say the United \n     States is not upholding the values that they are trying to \n     encourage other countries to adhere to.\n\n  The President is right. I strongly believe that the prolonged \nindefinite imprisonment of persons without charges is inconsistent with \nthe traditions and values of the United States and that it will \ncontinue to cause difficulty in our relations with other nations, \nincluding the allies that we rely upon in confronting the threat of \nterrorism. Frankly, it is embarrassing that when our leaders travel the \nworld they have to constantly respond to questions about why the United \nStates is indefinitely imprisoning people and whether it is engaging in \ninterrogation methods that amount to torture.\n  Where the United States was once a champion of due process and an \nadvocate for the humane treatment of prisoners, we are now subjected to \nalmost universal criticism throughout the world community over our \nviolation of these principles. Our handling of these individuals has \nnot only resulted in serious doubts by our allies about whether we are \na nation that respects the rule of law, but they have also given the \nterrorists around the world an opportunity to use this resentment to \nadvance their goals.\n  In July 2003, almost 3 years ago and over a year and a half after the \nfirst person was sent to Guantanamo, I introduced a similar amendment \nto the Defense Appropriations bill that would have required the \nSecretary of Defense to simply report to Congress regarding the status \nof individuals held at Guantanamo and whether it intended to charge or \nrepatriate or release such individuals.\n\n  The amendment was aimed at encouraging the Department of Defense to \nmake decisions as to what it intended to do with the individuals and to \nprovide for basic congressional oversight. Opponents of the measure \nargued that even a report on the administration's intentions placed \nunwarranted pressure on the administration to make decisions and that \nadditional time was needed to investigate those individuals and to \nexploit useful intelligence. Since that time, these persons have been \ninterrogated, have been investigated at length, and any useful \nintelligence information has been gathered.\n  Once again, I anticipate there will be those who say that we need to \nwait, we need to do nothing, we need to let the process work itself out \nin the courts or within whatever timeframe the executive branch \nbelieves is proper. As Senators, I believe our responsibility is not to \nsit back and watch as another several years roll by. The time to act is \nnow. Reasserting congressional oversight of this process is long \noverdue.\n  We have been holding people at Guantanamo for over 4\\1/2\\ years. The \ntime has come to begin to close this chapter in our Nation's history. \nIt is time for the Senate to provide a clear message that the United \nStates takes seriously its obligation to uphold the rule of law.\n  I have no doubt that we will look back at the Guantanamo experience \nas an aberration, as a mistaken endeavor that has taken us away from \nour historic commitment to the rule of law and respect for basic human \nrights. However, I also believe that we are at a transition period. We \nhave before us an opportunity to change course. I hope my colleagues \nwill support this important measure when I do offer it as an amendment \nto the Defense authorization bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allen). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his cooperation \non the procedure this afternoon. This is a very significant and \nimportant amendment. In due course we will have comments from our side \nwith regard to the amendment. I am certain the distinguished ranking \nmember and I will work out a timely schedule for you to bring it up \nagain, take such time as you need for further debate, be followed by a \ndebate on this side and then a vote, because it certainly is one that \ndeserves the attention of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I see my distinguished ranking member here. We are in \nmorning business, I say to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first let me commend the Senator from New \nMexico for his amendment. It is a very significant amendment. It is \ncarefully worked out. It is very much worthy of the Senate's \nconsideration.\n  I know we are in morning business. I simply want at this point to \ninform the body that an amendment which I have now filed on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Jack Reed, Senators Feinstein and Salazar, is now at \nthe desk. Its number is 4320. Its purpose is to state the sense of \nCongress on the United States policy on Iraq.\n  I am not going to speak on the amendment at this time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Why don't you go ahead and speak on it?\n  Mr. LEVIN. No, I would rather save my remarks for a time when it \nrelates more to the issue at hand, when we call up this amendment. I \nthank my good friend from Virginia for that suggestion, but I think I \nwould rather, at the time I call up the amendment, make the remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in his usual courtesy, the Senator from \nMichigan handed me, a few moments ago, this amendment. I glanced over \nit. It is, indeed, I think, a very serious-minded approach. I am not \nsure at this point in time I am ready to say that I concur in all \nprovisions. But it is reminiscent of the initiative taken last year by \nthe distinguished Senator from Michigan when he put in an amendment \nwith regard to the situation in Iraq. I recall very well having taken \nthat amendment and reworked it in some several ways, and eventually the \nSenate adopted that amendment. So I will, accordingly, give it very \nserious consideration, and at an appropriate time I look forward to \nengaging him in debate on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Let me again thank my good friend from Virginia. I, too, \nindeed, remember that debate last year on that amendment. The Senator \nfrom Virginia made a very constructive contribution to the debate. The \nfinal outcome was not the original amendment that I filed, but what \nremained of the amendment was significant and I think had an impact on \nthe policy of this country. I commended him then and I commend him now \nfor that effort on his part. I look forward to a discussion about this \namendment, No. 4320.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I notice in this \namendment, though, language quite similar to what we had last year in \none provision on this amendment.\n  At this time, unless the Senator from New Mexico desires to further \naddress the Senate, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Senate just passed critical \nlegislation to ensure the productivity and sustainability of our \nNation's fishery resources. S. 2012, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery \nConservation and Management Reauthorization Act of 2005, is the product \nof over a year and a half of discussions, hearings, drafts, revisions, \nand compromise.\n  My good friend and cochairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator \nInouye, worked closely with me on drafting this bill to manage and \nregulate the fisheries in the United States\n\n[[Page S6050]]\n\nExclusive Economic Zone. The bill is cosponsored by Senators Lott, \nHutchison, Snowe, Smith, Vitter, Kerry, Boxer, Lautenberg, Bill Nelson, \nCantwell, and Pryor.\n  In a speech last week, President Bush urged the Congress to pass \nlegislation to reauthorize the Magnuson-Stevens Act. The Senate has now \nacted and I will work closely with the House to get our bills resolved \nin conference and get this important legislation to the President for \nhis signature.\n  The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 2005 \nimplements many of the recommendations from the U.S. Commission on \nOcean Policy, the first such Congressionally authorized commission to \nreview our Nation's ocean policies and laws in over 35 years. The \nrecommendations of the commission were important to the development of \nthis Act. The intent of this legislation is to authorize these \nrecommendations and to build on some of the sound fishery management \nprincipals we passed in the Sustainable Fisheries Act in 1996, the last \ntime we reauthorized the Act.\n  Specifically, our bill will preserve and strengthen the Regional \nFishery Management Councils. The eight regional councils located around \nthe United States and Caribbean Islands are a model of Federal \noversight benefiting from local innovation and management approaches. \nThis reauthorization legislation establishes a council training program \ndesigned to prepare members on the numerous legal, scientific, \neconomic, and conflict of interests requirements that apply to the \nfishery management process. In addition, to address concerns over the \ntransparency of the regional council process, the bill provides for \nadditional financial disclosure requirements for council members and \nclarifies the Act's conflict of interest and recusal requirements.\n  The bill mandates the use of annual catch limits that shall not be \nexceeded to prevent overfishing and preserve the sustainable harvest of \nfishery resources in all 8 regional council jurisdictions. The \nPresident mentioned in his speech last week that overfishing must end. \nThe bill the Senate passed today will achieve this goal by requiring \nevery fishery management plan contain an annual catch limit be set at \nor below optimum yield--this will provide accountability in our \nfisheries and ensure that harvests do not exceed a level that provides \nfor the continued productivity of the fishery resource.\n  An important recommendation from the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy \nwas to establish national standards for quota programs. Our legislation \nestablishes national guidelines for Limited Access Privileges Programs \nfor the harvesting of fish. Limited access privilege programs, called \nLAPPs for short, include individual fishing quota, and are expanded to \nallow for allocation of harvesting privileges under these programs to \nfishing communities or regional fishery associations, which can take \ninto account impacts on shoreside interests in a rationalized fishery. \nIn addition, there is a 5-year administrative review to ensure future \nquota programs are meeting the goals of the program and the \nconservation and management requirements of the act.\n  An important objective of the bill the Senate passed today is to \nprovide a more uniform and consistent process for fishery management.\n  The bill requires a revision and updating of agency procedures for \nfishery management compliance with the national Environmental Policy \nAct, known as NEPA. This would allow for the development of one content \nprocess for councils to consider the substantive requirements of NEPA \nunder the timelines provided in the Magnuson-Stevens Act when \ndeveloping fishery management plans, plan amendments, and regulations. \nThe regional councils, the administration, and to a lesser extent the \nU.S. Commission on Ocean Policy, all recommended the need for \naddressing the inconsistencies between the two acts and resolving \ntimelines or process issues such that councils are not spending all \ntheir time and funding on developing litigation proof Environmental \nImpact Statements and Environmental Assessments under NEPA.\n  This legislation will strengthen the role of science in council \ndecision making, another important recommendation of the U.S. \nCommission on Ocean Policy, through a number of provisions. It \nspecifies that the role of the Scientific and Statistical Committees \nSSCs is to provide their councils with ongoing scientific advice needed \nfor management decisions, which may include recommendations on \nacceptable biological catch or optimum yield, annual catch limits, or \nother mortality limits. The SSCs are expected to advise the councils on \na variety of other issues, including stock status and health, bycatch, \nhabitat status, and socio-economic impacts.\n  Improvements for data collection and better management are important \nenhancements to the overall effectiveness of the Magnuson-Stevens Act. \nThe bill the Senate passed today authorizes a national cooperative \nresearch and management program, which would be implemented on a \nregional basis and conducted through partnerships between Federal and \nstate managers, commercial and recreational fishing industry \nparticipants, and scientists. It provides a mechanism for improving \ndata relating to recreational fisheries by establishing a new national \nprogram for the registration of marine recreational fishermen who fish \nin Federal waters. And it directs the Secretary, in cooperation with \nthe councils, to create a regionally based Bycatch Reduction \nEngineering Program to develop technological devices and engineering \ntechniques for minimizing bycatch, bycatch mortality, and post-release \nmortality.\n  Finally, it is important to note the Magnuson-Stevens Act has worked \nwell and provided for the effective conservation and management of U.S. \nfishery resources. For instance, the fisheries managed by the North \nPacific Council, which both the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy and the \nPew Oceans Commission lauded as the example for proper fisheries \nmanagement, does not have an overfished stock or endangered species of \nfish. It consistently sets an optimum yield far below the acceptable \nbiological catch and as a result the fisheries in its jurisdiction have \nremained sustainable and productive. Our goal here is to improve the \nact and allow for continued sustainability of the resource for \ngenerations to come.\n  Unfortunately, management internationally and especially on the high-\nseas is lacking. Illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, IUU, as \nwell as expanding industrial foreign fishing fleets and high bycatch \nlevels, are threats to sustainable fisheries worldwide. Ultimately, \nthese types of unsustainable and destructive fishing practices on the \nhigh seas threaten the good management that does take place in U.S. \nwaters.\n  The bill the Senate has passed today strengthens U.S. leadership in \ninternational conservation and management by requiring the Secretary of \nCommerce to establish an international compliance and monitoring \nprogram, provide reports to Congress on progress in reducing IUU \nfishing, promote international cooperation, and strengthen the ability \nof regional fishery management organizations to combat IUU and other \nharmful fishing practices. In addition, the legislation allows for the \nuse of measures authorized under the High Seas Driftnet Act to force \ncompliance in cases where regional or international fishery management \norganizations are unable to stop IUU fishing.\n  I have enjoyed very much the bipartisan spirit that has defined this \nlegislation and in particular working closely with my Commerce \nCommittee co-chairman Senator Inouye to produce such important \nlegislation to ensure the conservation and management of our Nation's \nfishery resources.\n  I end by congratulating all for the bipartisan spirit which defines \nthis legislation, and in particular my close working relationship with \nSenator Inouye to produce this important legislation and for the action \nof Senator Murray. She and I entered into an agreement for comments. I \ncongratulate her for her work with me on this important legislation to \nensure the conservation and management of our fisheries resources, and \nI thank the managers of the bill.\n  Mr. WARNER.

Transportation of minors in circumvention of certain laws \n  relating to abortion..........................................2431''.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, a lot of discussion has been going on in \nthe Senate with regard to a shift that we are making that I don't \nentirely agree with. That is a shift off of the underlying bill--not \nliterally off the bill but in terms of substance--addressing the issue \nof minimum wage that my colleague from Massachusetts has addressed.\n\n[[Page S6052]]\n\n  Personally, as I have explained to my colleagues, I don't believe \nthis is the appropriate bill on which to be addressing the minimum \nwage. We should be debating the war on terror and the progress that has \nbeen achieved in Iraq and the way we can further that success in the \nfuture.\n  We have agreed to set aside amendments so that the Senator from \nMassachusetts can offer an amendment on the minimum wage, and I second-\ndegreed that amendment with a child custody protection amendment.\n  Our discussions have led to the understanding that after we figure \nout how we are going to address both the minimum wage and child custody \nprotection over the course of this afternoon or tonight or tomorrow, we \nwill get around to having a vote on the minimum wage issue.\n  There has been some discussion whether we had to file cloture on the \nminimum wage or on child custody protection, but we agree that, after \nfurther discussion, we will figure out the most appropriate manner to \nbring to the floor and address these issues over the next--I am not \nsure how long it will take, but figure out exactly how long that is. I \ndo encourage our Members to come to the floor and to continue debating \nthe underlying bill as well, the Department of Defense authorization \nbill.\n  Again, I wish that neither one of these issues that we just offered \nwere going to be debated on this particular bill, but I understand it \nis the right of each Senator to come forward and offer those two bills.\n  Again, I will turn to my colleague from Massachusetts to make a \nstatement as to whether that is the general understanding of where we \nare.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the leader for his cooperation. \nAs I understand what he is basically saying is that he will work out, I \nimagine with the Democratic leader, an appropriate time so at least the \nSenate will have an opportunity, before final passage of this \nlegislation, that we will get a vote on my amendment or action on it \nrelated thereto. Am I right?\n  Mr. FRIST. That is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the leader. Earlier in the day, I listened to \nthe concerns of the leader about the appropriateness of my amendment on \nthis legislation. I pointed out earlier, when I addressed the Senate, \nthat I believe that our fighting men and women in Iraq, Afghanistan, \nand around the world are fighting for American values, and part of \nAmerican values is economic fairness and economic justice, and part of \neconomic fairness and economic justice is making sure we are going to \ntreat American workers decently and fairly.\n  So I want to indicate both to the leader and, most particularly, to \nthe chairman of the Armed Services Committee, we will work with him in \nevery possible way to work out the appropriate timing on it so that \nother serious work of the committee can move ahead in a timely way.\n  I thank both leaders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. The challenge with the Department of Defense authorization \nbill is really just this, what is playing out; that is, for us to \naddress what is the issue, I believe, that is most important to the \nUnited States today. That is supporting our men and women who are \nfighting so bravely and gallantly for us right now in this war on \nterror.\n  Thus, I believe that a minimum wage amendment should not be debated \non this particular bill, but it looks like it will be debated on this \nparticular bill. In the colloquy that was just entertained, it is clear \nwe will be debating it on the bill.\n  It was clear last week the other side did not really want to stay on \nthis issue of debating Iraq, surrounding Iraq. And by offering this \namendment, they made it clear they do want to shift debate off to an \nentirely different issue, an issue that does have a time and a place \nthat is more appropriate for it to be addressed. At that time, we \nshould be debating the overall economy and the impact that it would \nhave on small business and on jobs in this country.\n  We need to also have that debate on how to maintain, to continue the \nstrong economic growth that we are seeing in this country today because \nof President Bush's strong progrowth economic policies which have \ncreated 5.3 million jobs in the last 3 years. We have unemployment that \nis down to 4.7 percent, which is lower than the average of the 1990s \nand 1980s and 1970s.\n  In order to keep the economy growing, we need to continue to debate \nhow to open new markets, how to reduce the burden on our economy of \ntaxation and regulation, how we make education more affordable, how we \ntackle health care costs--all of which are very important issues.\n  Again, I prefer not to debate all those issues on this important \nbill, the Department of Defense authorization bill. We need to look, at \nsome point, at the issues surrounding our overall economy, a progrowth \npackage, and look at the issues surrounding the minimum wage, but to do \nit in isolation on a totally unrelated bill I don't think is the way to \ngo.\n  On this bill, I do believe America can do better.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will please call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, what is the matter before the Senate at this \ntime?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The second-degree amendment of the Senator \nfrom Tennessee, Mr. Frist, to the amendment from the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. REID. We are on the Defense bill, then?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct, until 4 o'clock.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, at an appropriate time I will lay down an \namendment. Right now I will just speak on it for a few minutes.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Reid pertaining to the introduction of S. 3536 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. President, the hour of 4 o'clock will be here in a couple \nminutes, and I have a few more minutes to speak. I ask unanimous \nconsent that I be allowed to finish my statement using leader time, and \nthat the 4 o'clock time for consideration of the judicial nomination be \nextended for probably less than 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I extend my appreciation to the \ndistinguished Senator from Virginia, Mr. Warner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I had stepped off the floor for a minute. \nYou are going to introduce your legislation as an amendment to the \nauthorization bill.\n  Mr. REID. Yes, but I will do it at a subsequent time.\n  Mr. WARNER. I appreciate that cooperation.\n  Mr. REID. I want to talk to Senator Levin and the chairman before \noffering it.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague.\n  I believe we should proceed under the standing order.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/19/senate-section/article/S6052-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6052-S6054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF SANDRA SEGAL IKUTA TO BE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR \n                           THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is my understanding that at 5 o'clock \nwe will have the vote; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. Under the previous \norder, the Senate will vote at 5 p.m. on the nomination.\n  Mr. WARNER. Upon the conclusion of that vote, would the Chair advise, \nare there any orders with regard to the business to be conducted then \nby the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume legislative session.\n  Mr. WARNER. On the authorization bill for the Armed Forces?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The authorization bill is the pending \nlegislative business, so the answer is yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair. It is my understanding two Senators, \nboth of whom are members of the Armed Services Committee, the senior \nSenator from Georgia and the Senator from Rhode Island, desire to \naddress the Senate. I want it clearly understood, we do not wish to \nhave additional amendments filed. I will have to work this out in the \ninterim period. I will do my best to accommodate these Senators without \namendments being filed to the bill at this time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Momentarily, I will ask that the quorum call be \nreinstated, but I ask unanimous consent that the time be allocated \nequally between both sides on the pending nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to speak on the \nnomination of Ms. Sandra Segal Ikuta to be a judge for the U.S. Court \nof Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Ms. Ikuta was nominated by President \nBush to be a judge for the Ninth Circuit on February 8, 2006. Her \nhearing was held on May 2, 2006. Thanks to the cooperation of the \ndistinguished ranking member, Senator Leahy, and all members of the \ncommittee, we processed her through on May 25, 2006, and she is now \nready for a confirmation vote by the Senate.\n  Ms. Ikuta has an extraordinary record. She received a bachelor's \ndegree from the University of California, Phi Beta Kappa, a master's \ndegree from Columbia University School of Journalism, and a law degree \nfrom the University of California. She clerked for Judge Kozinski of \nthe Ninth Circuit. Ms. Ikuta then clerked for U.S. Supreme Court \nJustice Sandra Day O'Connor. Following her Supreme Court clerkship, she \nwent to work for O'Melveny & Myers as an associate, becoming a partner \nin 1997. She specialized in environmental law, including serving as co-\nchair of the firm's environmental practice group.\n  She then entered public service as Deputy Secretary and General \nCounsel to the California Resources Agency in Governor Schwarznegger's \nadministration. She has written extensively in the field of \nenvironmental law, served as chair of the environmental section of the \nLos Angeles County Bar in 2001 and 2002, and she received a unanimous \n``well qualified'' rating from the American Bar Association. I urge my \ncolleagues to confirm her.\n  Mr. President, before yielding to my distinguished colleague, let me \nagain thank him for all of his cooperation, and we will soon celebrate \na year and a half of very productive, very cooperative, very collegial \nwork on the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania. He and I have been friends since the day we were \nboth prosecutors, and I think that has helped in running that \ncommittee.\n  Today the Senate will confirm another lifetime appointment to our \nFederal courts. Sandra Segal Ikuta, who has been nominated to a seat on \nthe Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, has the support of her \nhome-state Senators, Senator Feinstein and Senator Boxer. Her \nnomination was reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee last \nmonth as we expedited consideration through the committee.\n  I am pleased that the Republican leadership has scheduled debate and \nconsideration of this nomination and am glad that the Republican \nleadership is this month taking notice of the fact that we can \ncooperate on swift consideration and confirmation of consensus \nnominations. Working together, we confirmed 5 judges in 1 week earlier \nthis month. All of them could have been confirmed last month if the \nRepublican leadership had chosen to make progress instead of picking a \nfight on a controversial nomination. I look forward to working with the \nRepublican leadership to schedule debate and consideration of Andrew \nGuilford, who has been nominated to the United States District Court \nfor the Central District of California.\n  I, again, commend the Republican Senate leadership for wisely passing \nover the controversial nominations of William Gerry Myers III, Terrence \nW. Boyle, and Norman Randy Smith. The Republican leadership is right to \nhave avoided an unnecessarily divisive debate over these nominations \nthat were reported on a party-line vote.\n  During the 17 months I was Chairman of the Judiciary Committee and \nthe Senate was under Democratic control, we confirmed 100 of President \nBush's nominees. After today, in the last 17 months under Republican \ncontrol, the Senate will have confirmed 44. With this nomination, the \nSenate has confirmed 22 judicial nominations this year and equaled its \ntotal for all of last year.\n  Judicial vacancies continue to hover just under the 50 mark, but more \nthan half of these vacancies have no nominee. I urge the White House to \nwork with Senators from both parties to select nominees who can be \nexpeditiously considered and confirmed like Ms. Ikuta.\n  I am particularly pleased that they have chosen to turn to the \nnomination of Ms. Ikuta who, like Judge Milan Smith, is a nominee to \nthe Ninth Circuit. Ms. Ikuta is a consensus nominee who can be easily \nconfirmed. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about another pending \nNinth Circuit nominee, Norman Randy Smith. In nominating Judge Smith of \nIdaho for a lifetime appointment to the Ninth Circuit, President Bush \nbroke with the longstanding precedent of replacing each circuit court \nvacancy with a nominee from the same State, taking away a California \nseat on the Ninth Circuit. Senators Feinstein and Boxer expressed their \nstrong opposition to this nomination in a January 30, 2006, letter to \nChairman Specter.\n  I have urged President Bush to resolve this impasse by doing the \nright thing and nominating Judge Smith not for a California seat but \nfor the vacancy created by the retirement of Judge Thomas G. Nelson \nfrom Idaho. Regrettably, he has not done so.\n  In their letter to Chairman Specter, Senators Feinstein and Boxer \nexpressed their concerns that the confirmation of Judge Smith to the \nNinth Circuit would transfer a judgeship from California to Idaho, \nviolating historical precedent. Judge Smith has been nominated to fill \nthe seat last occupied by Judge Stephen Trott, an appointee of \nPresident Ronald Reagan from California, whose retirement in 2004 \ncreated this vacancy. Judge Trott was from California, where he had \npracticed for much of his career prior to becoming a judge. In fact, he \nwas nominated to fill the seat of another Californian, Judge Joseph \nSneed. At the time of his nomination, while he worked at the Department \nof Justice in Washington, the Senators from California were consulted \nand it was understood to be a California seat.\n  While an agreement can sometimes be worked out among Senators and the \nWhite House to proceed with someone from another State within the \ncircuit\n\n[[Page S6054]]\n\nfirst, so long as the subsequent nomination comes from the first State, \nI do not know of any precedent for shifting a circuit seat based on a \njudge's personal decision to change his or her personal residence. If \nthat were to become the rule, I expect that Vermont might well benefit \nfrom judges initially named as from New York or Connecticut recognizing \nthe beauty and lifestyle that Vermont has to offer and moving to the \nGreen Mountain State. But that is not the rule and has never been the \nrule. Instead, we have worked out circuit court allocations among the \nStates based on tradition and history.\n  Of course this White House has attempted to steal a seat before, when \nit attempted to replace a Maryland Fourth Circuit judge with someone \nfrom Virginia. That attempt was unsuccessful. That was the ill-fated \nnomination of Claude Allen, a White House insider who has since \nresigned his high-ranking position and been arrested on charges of \nretail theft.\n  I am sensitive that every State within a circuit should have at least \none judge come from that State. I supported legislation to ensure that \nand to afford Hawaii a seat on the Ninth Circuit. I will defend Idaho's \nright to a seat on the Ninth Circuit, just as I defend Vermont's right \nto a seat on the Second Circuit. However, Judge Smith was not nominated \nto Idaho's seat. If the President would take my suggestion and \nrenominate him to that Idaho vacancy, that would resolve this problem.\n  Judge Ikuta will occupy a California seat on the Ninth Circuit \npreviously held by Judge James R. Browning. Judge Browning was an \nextraordinary jurist for whom the Ninth Circuit's building in San \nFrancisco was recently named. She has a great tradition to uphold an I \nwish her well. I congratulate her and her family on her confirmation.\n  While I am pleased that the Senate will today confirm Ms. Ikuta to \nthe Ninth Circuit, I note that President Bush has yet to nominate a \nsingle Asian-Pacific American candidate to any of the dozens of \nvacancies that have arisen on our federal circuit courts. Indeed, \nPresident Bush has nominated only one Asian-American candidate out of \nthe hundreds of Federal judicial nominees he has named overall. There \nare many, many qualified Asian-American attorneys and judges. There is \nno quota or requirement that the Federal bench be diverse, but it is \nsurprising that given the nominations he has had the opportunity to \nmake, which are approaching 300, I can remember only a single Asian-\nPacific American judicial nominee, and not one Asian-Pacific American \nappellate nominee. This lack of diversity in nominees is quite a \ncontrast with the record of President Clinton, who appointed several \nAsian-Pacific nominees to the district and appellate courts. President \nClinton appointed Judge Denny Chinn, Judge George H. King, Judge \nAnthony W. Ishii, and Judge Susan Oki Mollway to Federal district \ncourts in New York, California and Hawaii, and who elevated Judge A. \nWallace Tashima to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth \nCircuit. The current President is more interested in naming White House \ninsiders and ideologues. In fact, he has nominated more people \nassociated with the Federalist Society than African-American, Hispanic, \nand Asian-Pacific American nominees combined.\n  With the retirement of Judge Tashima from the Ninth Circuit, there \nare no Asian-American circuit court judges. Despite the opportunity \npresented with two Supreme Court vacancies in the past year to make the \nNation's highest court better reflect America's diversity, the \nPresident has made the Supreme Court less diverse, failing even to fill \nthe seat of the Court's first female Justice, Sandra Day O'Connor, with \na qualified woman. Of course he was forced by the extreme faction of \nhis own party to withdraw his nomination of his friend and counsel \nHarriet Miers before she even had a hearing.\n  President Clinton sought to add diversity to the Federal bench. This \nPresident is more focused on guaranteed results and making sure certain \ncircuits will be stocked with those who tilt the courts to the right \nand rule in his favor.\n  Mr. President, if I have remaining time, I yield it back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Under the previous order, the \nhour of 5 p.m. having arrived, the Senate will proceed to vote on the \nnomination.\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, in the 2 minutes I have left, I would \nlike to comment very briefly on a trip made by the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee to oversee World War I and World War II cemeteries in the \nNetherlands and France. The chairman of the committee, the \ndistinguished Senator from Idaho, Mr. Craig, organized the trip, with \nSenator Burr, Senator Isakson, and myself.\n  Let me say to you that it was inspirational to visit the cemeteries--\nI had never done that before--to see so many marble crosses and marble \nstars of David. It was especially poignant for me because my father \nfought in World War I. He left Russia at the age of 18 in 1911 to \nescape the tyranny. The Czar wanted to send him to Siberia. He wanted \nto go to Kansas. It was a close call. I say that jokingly. He was proud \nto serve in the U.S. Army as a Doughboy. It took all of 30 days for him \nto be inducted, until he was shipped overseas, really, with a big \nbull's eye on his back as cannon fodder by all means.\n  When I was growing up, he would regale my brother, my two sisters, \nand me with World War I songs, such as ``It's A Long Way To \nTipperary.'' I recall his singing the song about the bugler in the \nfamous World War I song, ``Oh, How I Hate To Get Up In The Morning.'' \nIt said that if given a chance, he would have shot the bugler. And my \nfather liked to sing that song. He got up early a lot of mornings.\n  Fighting in the Argonne Forest, he was wounded in action by shrapnel \nfire. He carried shrapnel in his legs until the day he died. Had the \nshrapnel hit him a little higher, Harry Specter might have been in one \nof those cemeteries and he wouldn't have been my father.\n  It was quite an inspirational trip.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my written statement be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       I have sought recognition to comment on a trip by the \n     Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee to the Netherlands and \n     France from May 26th through June 1st to conduct \n     congressional oversight on World War I and World War II \n     cemeteries in those countries. The trip was organized by the \n     Committee Chairman, Senator Larry Craig (R-ID) and with \n     Senators Richard Burr (R-NC) and Johnny Isakson (R-GA) and \n     myself in attendance. The itinerary included the following \n     cemeteries: Aines-Marne American Cemetery, France; Ardennes \n     American Cemetery, Belgium; Henri-Chapelle American Cemetery, \n     Belgium; Netherlands American Cemetery, The Netherlands; \n     Normandy American Cemetery, France, and Suresnes American \n     Cemetery, France.\n       It was a sobering and thought provoking trip to see so many \n     marble Crosses and marble Stars of David in symmetrical rows. \n     We know the history of those two wars with so many casualties \n     but until you actually see the tombstones it is an \n     abstraction.\n       We found all of the cemeteries to be meticulously \n     maintained. The grass was manicured, the foliage was \n     magnificent and the unique shrines at each cemetery were very \n     impressive. From the point of view of congressional \n     oversight, the Senate delegation was unanimous in concluding \n     that the American Battle Monuments Commission has done a \n     superb job in maintaining the cemeteries.\n       On May 28th we attended a particularly impressive cemetery \n     at the Netherlands American Cemetery with dozens of wreaths \n     being laid in honor of the fallen veterans. At the Suresnes \n     American Cemetery in Paris, the memorial recounted the \n     statistics of the 126,000 U.S. soldiers who were killed in \n     World War I and the 407,300 U.S. soldiers killed in World War \n     II.\n       On a personal level, I was especially touched by the graves \n     of World War I veterans because my father, Harry Specter, \n     fought in that War. He came to the United States at the age \n     of 18 in 1911 to escape the Czar's tyranny. The Czar wanted \n     to send him to Siberia. He wanted to go to Kansas. I jokingly \n     say it was a close call.\n       My father was inducted on May 6, 1918 at Fairbury, Nebraska \n     and shipped out of the United States for France thirty days \n     later. His discharge papers bear the notation: ``Character: \n     Excellent''.\n       The reality was that he, like so many others, was sent to \n     France as cannon fodder--with really a big bull's-eye painted \n     on his back. He patriotically brushed off that off and was \n     proud to serve in the Army of his adopted country. He talked \n     jokingly that frequently all they had to eat was ``jam \n     sandwiches'' which meant two pieces of bread jammed together. \n     He talked about climbing a tree in France to pick fruit for \n     himself and his buddies. That is what his family had done in \n     the village of Batchkurina in the heart of the Ukraine about \n     160 miles southwest of Kiev. He commented that he was never \n     required to fire his rifle at the German enemy.\n       When I was growing up, he would regale my brother, two \n     sisters and me with World War I songs such as ``It's a Long \n     Way to Tipperary.'' I recall his singing about the bugler on \n     the famous World War I song ``Oh How I Hate to Get Up in the \n     Morning.'' Fighting in the Argonne Forest, he was wounded in \n     action by shrapnel fire. He carried shrapnel in his legs \n     until the day he died. Had the shrapnel hit him a little \n     higher, Harry Specter might have lain in one of the \n     cemeteries and he wouldn't have been my father.\n       The U.S. Ambassador to France, Craig R. Stapleton, invited \n     the delegation to dinner on May 31st, attended by French \n     officials and embassy personnel. During the course of the \n     evening, Ambassador Stapleton spoke about a relative, Flem \n     Stapleton, the son of his grandfather's first cousin Benjamin \n     Franklin Stapleton. He recounted finding his relative's name \n     on the roster of World War I veterans killed in action which \n     prompted him to do some research. He found that Flem \n     Stapleton was killed in action in his first battle at the age \n     of twenty. When Ambassador Stapleton recounted the story, \n     tears came to his eyes and he was unable to continue for a \n     few moments.\n       When I was asked to speak a few moments later, I said \n     Ambassador Stapleton had really captured and articulated the \n     emotion which I felt on seeing the Crosses and Stars of \n     David.\n       The visits to the cemeteries gave me new meaning for \n     patriotism and the great contributions which our servicemen \n     and women have made to the security of our nation and the \n     freedom we all enjoy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/19/senate-section/article/S6055-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6055-S6056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THE CONTINUING SERVICE OF SENATOR ROBERT C. BYRD\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate has just marked another \nmilestone with the extraordinary service of the senior Senator from \nWest Virginia. I consider him a mentor and a friend. I have had the \nprivilege of serving with Senator Byrd on the Judiciary Committee and I \ncurrently serve with him on the Appropriations Committee. I know \nfirsthand his work as the Senate majority leader, the Senate Democratic \nleader, and as our President pro tempore.\n  He understands the role of the Senate and the need for it to act as a \ncheck and a balance on the President. In recent years, he has been \ndiscovered by a new generation of Americans as a true Senator.\n  By his work and his example he teaches each of us every day what the \nSenate should be and must be if the constitutional design of the \nFounders is to serve and preserve our rights and liberties.\n  One of the great privileges of serving in the Senate is to serve with \nthe senior Senator from West Virginia. One of the great pleasures is to \nhear him speak on this floor. His continuing contributions to the \nSenate and the Nation are too numerous to recount but I would like to \nmention one of the many outstanding moments.\n  Senator Byrd has preserved the Constitution from numerous assaults. \nHe takes seriously the Senate oath to ``support and defend'' the \nConstitution. He has protected it from a number of ill-conceived and \npolitically-motivated amendments, including the so-called balanced \nbudget amendment and the line-item veto. The last time the Senate \nconsidered amending the Constitution to cut back on our individual \nliberties and limit the first amendment, that guarantee in the Bill of \nRights of our freedom of religion and speech, it was in no small way \nthanks to Senator Byrd that the Constitution and the rights of \nAmericans were preserved.\n  On March 29, 2000, he gave an extraordinary speech. I was a manager \non the matter and was fortunate to be present. I noted at the time that \n``periodically, we hear greatness in speeches,'' and observed that this \nwas a case where the Senate had heard greatness. It is a speech that \nstudents of the Constitution and of constitutional history should \nstudy.\n  In the days ahead, we will again be challenged to amend our Bill of \nRights for the first time in over 200 years. I can think of no one I \nwould rather stand with and fight for the Constitution than the senior \nSenator from West Virginia. Every day he walks on the floor of this \nSenate carrying the Constitution because he knows that the liberties of \nthe American people are not to be sacrificed for passing political \nfavor. He is a fierce advocate for the Nation, the Constitution, the \nSenate, but first and foremost, for the people of the State of West \nVirginia whom he represents so ably.\n\n[[Page S6056]]\n\n  I have said that I sit in the white hair row. It is a row that I \npicked. Because of my seniority, I can sit just about anywhere I want, \nbut I sit in this row to sit near Senator Byrd.\n  Senator Byrd is a Senator's Senator, but he is also a Senator who \nrespects and preserves the Constitution. We are supposed to be the \nconscience of the Nation. There is only 100 of us to represent 219 \nmillion Americans. Thank goodness one of those 100 is Robert C. Byrd of \nWest Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/19/senate-section/article/S6056-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              COMMONSENSE CONSUMPTION ACT OF 2005, S. 908\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would note that regrettably, we have on \nthe Senate's calendar legislation designed to limit the rights of \nconsumers, the so-called Commonsense Consumption Act of 2005, as bad \npublic policy.\n  It defies common sense to give entire industries blanket immunity \nfrom potential harm they impose on Americans. The incentives involved \nin litigation are one of the few remaining measures leading to real \ncorporate responsibility, not to mention accountability. The handful of \nlawsuits that would have been barred by this legislation actually \nresulted in settlements providing for more nutritious food in our \nschools, more accurate labeling for consumers, and the removal of \nharmful trans fats from some of the foods we eat. A blanket ban on such \nmeasures will lead to more serious problems such as increases in heart \ndisease and diabetes and other chronic conditions that are taxing this \nNation's health system.\n  There are many problems with the sweeping language of this \nlegislation. It would dismiss existing State and Federal cases, as well \nas preempt future cases. Sponsors of the bill claim that it would not \nprevent false advertising claims but the language in the bill does not \nguarantee this result. It prevents suits against manufacturers, \nmarketers, distributors, advertisers or sellers of specific products \nbut the exception for false advertising only applies to manufacturers \nand sellers. Why should advertisers and sellers be excluded from this \nexception? They are just as likely to deceive consumers as \nmanufacturers and sellers. Also, the legal standard will be heightened \nso that consumers would be required to prove intentional violation of \nFederal or State statutes, rather than simply having to prove \nviolations of government regulations on advertising and food safety. \nWhy would we want to give immunity to companies that violate safety \nregulations? And why should the injured consumer be required to prove a \ncorporation's intent if it can be proved that the corporation violated \nthe law? We all know how impossible it is to prove ``corporate intent'' \nwithout the extraordinary help of a whistleblower. And we all know that \nwere it not for citizens' lawsuits, we may never have learned of the \nharm that big tobacco companies knowingly caused to so many, for so \nlong, while denying so much of what they knew. Time and again, the \nlegal system has been more effective than government watchdog agencies \nin prying loose consumer information like that, which we otherwise \nmight never see.\n  This legislation does not create any alternative method for keeping a \ncheck on corporate misconduct that has a detrimental effect on the \nhealth of all Americans. If this bill passes, American consumers will \nonly be left with the thin hope that suddenly the Bush-Cheney \nadministration will begin true regulation of corporations on behalf of \nAmerican consumers.\n  If we are serious about trying to address the national health \nepidemic that is related to obesity, then we should be considering \nlegislation to clarify food labeling so consumers can make informed \nchoices. How about legislation requiring nutritious food in our \nschools? How about listening to the scientific and health community \nabout the needless dangers of trans fats in our food? How about ending \ncuts in education that lead to the cancellation of physical education \nand health courses?\n  Consideration of this corporate immunity legislation would be \nespecially ill-timed in light of the numerous pressing issues that face \nthis Nation today. The Senate's time would be better spent debating \nstem cell research, or the life saving technologies that would make \nAmericans' lives better. We should also be moving forward with \ncomprehensive immigration reform, reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act, \nand addressing the horrific genocide in Darfur. This bill also yet to \nbe subject to committee consideration. If the Judiciary Committee had \nconsidered this legislation, I am confident we would have amended the \nsweeping language of this blanket immunity bill.\n  This legislation favors the interests of corporations over the health \nof our children and the health of their parents. This is not the fix \nthat is needed. Let us direct our energies towards making American \nhealth care better by finding cures to diseases, making it easier for \nconsumers to make informed choices, getting more Americans insured and \ninvesting in health care prevention.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/19/senate-section/article/S6056-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6056-S6057]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                BIRTHDAY WISHES TO DAW AUNG SAN SUU KYI\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. As with all supporters of freedom and democracy in \nthe, world, I rise today to extend birthday wishes to Daw Aung San Suu \nKyi, the Nobel Laureate who remains under house arrest in Burma.\n  Much like her previous several birthdays, Suu Kyi's birthday today \nalmost certainly will not be a happy one. The ``gift'' given to Suu Kyi \nby the ruling State Peace and Development Council, SPDC, a few weeks \nago was the news that it was again extending her detention.\n  Under the autocratic rule of the SPDC, drug trafficking, disease and \nhuman rights violations are rampant and pose growing problems to the \nregion as a whole. The SPDC adheres to policies that seek only to \nconsolidate its own power, and the ruined lives of the Burmese people \nare the result. Indeed, there is little reason for celebration in Burma \ntoday.\n  The plight of Suu Kyi symbolizes the plight of her countrymen. \nMoreover, her commitment to freedom and justice through peaceful \npolitical change has created a legacy that will endure long after the \nSPDC's reign is no more.\n  The best gift the free world can give Suu Kyi is to remain steadfast \nin support of freedom in Burma today. She can count on my support.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an op-ed in today's Wall \nStreet Journal by Under Secretary of State Paula Dobriansky be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, June 19, 2006]\n\n                     ``Press for Change in Burma''\n\n                        (By Paula J. Dobrainsky)\n\n       Today marks the 61st birthday of Aung San Suu Kyi, the \n     elected leader of Burma's National League for Democracy. It \n     is the third consecutive birthday that she has spent under \n     detention--and a stark reminder that not only she, but 50 \n     million fellow Burmese are living without basic freedoms and \n     human rights. Absent change, Burma is likely to continue a \n     dangerous decline that threatens the welfare of its people \n     and its neighbors alike.\n       Only by unconditionally releasing Ms. Suu Kyi and all other \n     political prisoners, restoring a democratic form of \n     government, and observing international standards of human \n     rights can Burma's regime bring stability, prosperity and \n     peace to its country--and international respect to its \n     leaders. Toward that end, we are seeking a United Nations \n     Security Council resolution that underscores the \n     aforementioned goals, which were communicated by U.N. \n     Undersecretary General for Political Affairs Ibrahim Gambari \n     to senior Burmese officials during his visit to the country \n     last month. The U.S. is committed to working with the U.N. \n     Security Council, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, regional \n     institutions and governments to press for genuine national \n     reconciliation in Burma.\n       The threat to the Burmese people from their own leaders is \n     clear: In only the last few months, attacks against ethnic \n     minorities have displaced thousands. Military units abuse \n     their power regularly and commit egregious human rights \n     abuses with impunity, including rape, forced labor, murder \n     and torture. The regime's continued economic mismanagement \n     and corruption have led to a widespread failure of the \n     banking system and rampant inflation, which increases the \n     daily hardships of the Burmese people. Making matters worse, \n     the military's restrictions on U.N. and nongovernmental \n     organizations have hampered the ability of relief \n     organizations to deliver assistance to Burma's most \n     vulnerable populations.\n       Infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and avian \n     flu are best controlled by responsible governments with \n     transparent public health systems that cooperate closely with \n     international institutions. Yet even as the Burmese regime \n     spends considerable\n\n[[Page S6057]]\n\n     sums to finish relocating its capital, malnutrition is rising \n     and thousands are dying from treatable diseases like malaria \n     and tuberculosis. This tragic failure calls into question the \n     Burmese junta's willingness and ability to protect and \n     improve the well-being of its people.\n       Burma's people are not alone in facing the consequences of \n     their government's actions: the country's deterioration poses \n     a real danger to its neighbors and--in today's interconnected \n     world--even to those far away. The drug trade and trafficking \n     in persons are rampant; both flow across porous borders and \n     spread corruption, political instability and disease.\n       America will persist in its strategy to increase \n     international pressure on Burma by working with individual \n     governments and regional organizations, such as the European \n     Union, to seek to return the country to its people through a \n     transparent, inclusive political process. The U.S. \n     administration will continue to impose economic sanctions on \n     the Burmese government, while insisting upon the \n     unconditional release of Ms. Suu Kyi and other political \n     prisoners; an end to attacks on civilians and other human \n     rights violations; and a real dialogue leading to peace, \n     democracy and national reconciliation.\n       In Asia, the U.S. will continue to collaborate with Burma's \n     neighbors, including members of the Association of Southeast \n     Asian Nations, who have a particular interest in seeing \n     Burma's decline reversed. Asean leaders have already publicly \n     called for the release of political prisoners and for the \n     resumption of a national dialogue with all political \n     stakeholders. On June 3, Indonesian Foreign Minister Hasan \n     Wirayuda stated that ``the junta [can] not deflect criticism \n     of the Nobel peace laureate's detention by saying it was an \n     internal matter. The truth is no country can claim that human \n     rights abuses are its own internal affairs.''\n       Finally, the U.S. will work in the U.N. to press for change \n     in Burma. We are pleased that the U.N.'s Economic and Social \n     Council will discuss Burma's forced labor practices in its \n     July session. The U.S. will continue to pursue a U.N. \n     Security Council resolution. As U.S. Secretary of State \n     Condoleezza Rice has said, America stands with the people of \n     Burma, and we have not forgotten their dream of democracy.\n       The economic, political and public health situation in \n     Burma has deteriorated to the point where the regime's \n     combination of repression and its unwillingness--or \n     inability--to meet its own citizens' needs pose a threat to \n     the peace, security and stability of the region. We must all \n     act together to help the Burmese people win the freedom and \n     prosperity they deserve.\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Senator Bob \nDole, a person who is often thought of as one of the most prominent \npolitical figures of our time. Perhaps former Secretary of State Colin \nPowell described Senator Dole best when he said he is, ``A plain-spoken \nman of strength, maturity and integrity.''\n  This ``plain-spoken'' man from Oklahoma's neighboring State of Kansas \nis legendary for his brave sacrifice to our great country in World War \nII. In the war, he was a platoon leader in the distinguished Tenth \nMountain Division in Italy. He was awarded two Purple Hearts and a \nBronze Star after being seriously injured in battle, but his service \nand sacrifice did not end there. After a long, determined road to \nrecovery, a renewed faith in God, and loving support from family and \nfriends, he began his political career.\n  After earning his law degree, Senator Dole served in the Kansas \nLegislature from 1951 to 1953. He came to Washington to serve in the \nHouse of Representatives in 1960. He was then elected to the Senate in \n1968. His leadership skills gained swift recognition as he became \nchairman of the National Republican Committee in 1971 and Senate \nmajority leader in 1984.\n  After Republicans lost control of the Senate in 1986, Senator Dole \ncontinued serving his party as Senate minority leader. In this \ncapacity, he became known for his ``watch-dog'' tactics fighting \nagainst Democrat tax-and-spend, big-government policies. Thanks to his \nhelp in exposing the unrestrained behavior of the Democrats, the \nAmerican people voted to put Republicans back in control of both Houses \nof Congress in 1994. After this overwhelming victory, Senator Dole was \nonce again voted to the post of majority leader, making him the longest \nserving Senate leader in the history of the Republican Party.\n  I was privileged to serve with Bob Dole in this body from 1994 to \n1996 and work on different issues with him. I supported him in 1996 \nwhen he was fighting tax increases and other excessive governmental \npolicies.\n  After leaving the Senate to run for an unsuccessful Presidential bid \nin 1996, Senator Dole continued his public service by becoming chairman \nof the National World War II Memorial to erect a memorial on The \nNational Mall to honor the sacrifice of the brave men and woman who \nserved in the largest and deadliest war in history. He also served as \ncochair of the Families of Freedom Scholarship Fund to assist the \neducational needs of the families of victims of the September 11 \nattacks.\n  Through media appearances, speeches, two best-selling books, ``Great \nPresidential Wit, I Wish I Was In The Book'' and ``Great Political Wit, \nLaughing (Almost) All the Way to the White House,'' and his personal \nWorld War II memoirs, ``One Soldier's Story,'' Senator Dole continues \nto leave a legacy of the values and principles that have made this \ngreat country what it is today.\n  Bob Dole is a man of character and integrity, and I am proud to honor \nhim with this deserving tribute today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/19/senate-section/article/S6057-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6057]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     MARRIAGE PROTECTION AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Marriage \nProtection Amendment. This poorly conceived, divisive proposal does not \nbelong in the U.S. Constitution. To me, the Constitution is a sacred \ndocument, one that protects rights and preserves liberties, and we \nshould not amend it lightly. Never once has our Constitution been \namended to deny rights to a group of Americans. And we should not do it \nnow.\n  This divisive and unnecessary amendment--which failed overwhelmingly \nwhen last brought before the Senate--would undermine rights like civil \nunions now enjoyed by people in many States throughout the Nation. This \namendment would override State laws that grant fundamental protections \nsuch as hospital visitation rights, inheritance rights, and health care \nbenefits.\n  Unfortunately, the White House and some Members of Congress think it \nis more important to attempt to divide our Nation over an amendment \nthat they know has no chance of passing than to actually govern. The \ntiming of this marriage debate and vote--just months before a heated \nmidterm election--proves that this amendment is a political ploy to \ndistract the American people from the issues that the President and his \nparty are failing to address, like skyrocketing oil prices, the war in \nIraq, and the lack of affordable prescription drugs.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I join a broad range of opponents to the \namendment, including former Republican Representative Bob Barr, various \nclergy groups, and countless voters in my State and across the country \nin opposing this amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/19/senate-section/article/S6057-3", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6057-S6058]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JAMES REID\n\n Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize James \nReid of St. Charles, MI, who earned the distinct honor of reaching the \nrank of Eagle Scout. James has earned such an honor through his \noutstanding dedication to his community and his commitment to \ncitizenship.\n  James's rise to the rank of Eagle Scout is an achievement that is \ntruly worthy of recognition. With this achievement, he joins a \nprestigious group of individuals, including U.S. Presidents, Members of \nCongress, astronauts, entertainers, businessmen, and clergymen.\n  James's dedication to community is evident in and around the St. \nCharles area. At a young age, he brought his community together through \nthe fundraising and construction of the flagpole that now completes the \ncity's monument to Lewis and Clark. In addition, he serves as an \nadvocate for the homeless, working countless hours building\n\n[[Page S6058]]\n\nhouses throughout the St. Louis metropolitan area. In recognition of \nhis dedication, James earned the President's Gold Volunteer Service \nAward. As for many Eagle Scouts, this honor is merely the beginning of \nsuccess, and I wish him the best of luck in his future endeavors.\n  The honor of achieving the rank of Eagle Scout is truly a momentous \noccasion for James Reid and his family and has come as a result of his \ndiligence and hard work. I thank James for representing St. Charles and \nthe State of Missouri in such an exemplary manner.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/19/senate-section/article/S6058-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6058]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JOHNNY WILSON\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today I take a moment to honor the \nextraordinary accomplishments of a young citizen from Massachusetts, \n10-year-old Johnny Wilson. Last October, Johnny set a world record as \nthe youngest person ever to swim from Alcatraz Island to Aquatic Park \nin San Francisco, a distance of 1.4 miles. It was an impressive \naccomplishment in and of itself, but Johnny's swim had far greater \nmeaning and purpose than setting a record. For every quarter mile he \nswam, Johnny collected pledges for disaster relief for the victims of \nHurricane Katrina, and his swim produced over $150,000.\n  Johnny first got the idea from a family friend, Rick Murray, an Iron \nMan triathlete, who suggested the idea after noticing Johnny's strength \nas a swimmer and offered to be his coach. Johnny spent over a year in \ntraining, swimming 10 miles a week in pools during the school year and \nin the ocean near Hyannis Port during the summer. In addition, he spent \n3 months training in the cold water of the San Francisco Bay to further \nprepare for the conditions of his swim.\n  Johnny first got the idea to use his swimming ability to raise funds \nlast September, when his school began to emphasize efforts to aid the \nvictims of Katrina. He and seven of his classmates rallied the local \ncommunity, calling all the families they knew and asking for pledges \nfor every quarter mile of the swim that Johnny would complete. By the \nday of the swim, these efforts had already yielded over $30,000 in \ndonations.\n  The swim began before sunrise at 6 a.m. last October 10. The large \nwaves, freezing water, and the fact that he was the only child \nattempting the swim did not deter Johnny from diving in the water that \nmorning. Flanked 10 feet on either side by adult safety swimmers and \nkayaks in case of an emergency, Johnny swam into Aquatic Park Cove 1 \nhour 6 minutes later to the cheers of his family, teacher, and \nclassmates. Halfway through the swim, he stopped to warm his numbed \nlimbs, but when asked if wanted to stop swimming, he said no and \ncontinued on his way. His commitment to himself and to the Katrina \nvictims he wanted to help enabled him to deal with the long, cold \nwaters to reach his goal.\n  The media attention to Johnny's swim and its admirable purpose \nincreased his fundraising ability. Word of his mission spread in over \n600 broadcasts in 20 countries and led to appearances on the ``Today \nShow'', ``Oprah'' and ``CNN.'' The additional publicity helped raise \n$20,000 more for Johnny's cause, as people throughout the country and \naround the world were touched by the strength of his spirit and heart \ndemonstrated by this remarkable young man. In the end, Johnny was able \nto make an amazing contribution of $51,000 to the Hurricane Katrina \nvictims' fund of the Red Cross.\n  Able and caring young people like Johnny inspire a new sense of hope \nfor the Nation's future. He demonstrated the difference that one \ncommitted person can make in bringing people together to touch the \nlives of others. I commend Johnny Wilson for his impressive \nachievement, his caring heart, and his wonderful contribution to the \nlives of those devastated by Hurricane Katrina. He represents the best \nof our country, and I wish him well in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/19/senate-section/article/S6058-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6058]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            PLANKINTON, SOUTH DAKOTA, TO CELEBRATE 125 YEARS\n\n Mr. THUNE.

In that order, I \ndeclared a national emergency with respect to the policies and actions \nof certain individuals in Belarus, to address the unusual and \nextraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the \nUnited States posed by the actions and circumstances involving Belarus, \nas described below. This action follows the issuance of Proclamation \n8015 of May 12, 2006, ``Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and \nNonimmigrants of Persons Responsible for Policies or Actions That \nThreaten the Transition to Democracy in Belarus,'' in which I \ndetermined that it is in the interest of the United States to suspend \nthe entry into the United States of members of the government of \nAlyaksandr Lukashenka and others who formulate, implement, participate \nin, or benefit from policies or actions, including electoral fraud, \nhuman rights abuses, and corruption, that undermine or injure \ndemocratic institutions or impede the transition to democracy in \nBelarus.\n  The United States, the European Union, and other allies and partners \naround the world have repeatedly expressed support for the democratic \naspirations of the Belarusian people and condemned the Belarusian \ngovernment's human rights abuses, assaults on democracy, and \ncorruption. The Belarusian authorities have resorted to intense \nrepression in an attempt to preserve their power, including the \ndisappearances of four regime critics in 1999 and 2000, which the \nauthorities have failed to investigate seriously despite credible \ninformation linking top government officials to these acts.\n  The undemocratic 2006 presidential election was only the latest \nexample of the Belarusian government's disregard for the rights of its \nown citizens. Hundreds of civic and opposition activists were \narrested--and many beaten--both before and after the vote for \nexercising their rights. The authorities forcibly dispersed peaceful \npost-election demonstrations. There is simply no place in a Europe \nwhole and free for a regime of this kind.\n  The order also takes an important step in the fight against public \ncorruption, which threatens important United States interests globally, \nincluding ensuring security and stability, the rule of law and core \ndemocratic values, advancing prosperity, and creating a level playing \nfield for lawful business activities. As noted in Proclamation 8015, \nthe persistent acts of corruption by Belarusian government officials in \nthe performance of public functions has played a significant role in \nfrustrating the Belarusian people's aspirations for democracy. This \norder authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to block the assets of \nsenior-level officials of the Government of Belarus, their family \nmembers, or those closely linked to such officials engaged in such \ncorruption.\n\n[[Page S6060]]\n\n  Thus, pursuant to IEEPA and the NEA, I have determined that these \nactions and circumstances constitute an unusual and extraordinary \nthreat to the national security and foreign policy of the United \nStates, and I have issued the order to deal with this threat.\n  The order blocks the property and interests in property in the United \nStates, or in the possession or control of United States persons, of \nthe persons listed in the Annex to the order, as well as of any person \ndetermined by the Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with \nthe Secretary of State: to be responsible for, or to have participated \nin, actions or policies that undermine democratic processes or \ninstitutions in Belarus; to be responsible for, or to have participated \nin, human rights abuses related to political repression in Belarus; and \nto be a senior-level official, a family member of such official, or a \nperson closely linked to such an official who is responsible for or has \nengaged in public corruption related to Belarus.\n  The order also authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, after \nconsultation with the Secretary of State, to designate for such \nblocking any person determined to have materially assisted, sponsored, \nor provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods \nor services in support of, the activities listed above or any person \nlisted in or designated pursuant to the order. I further authorized the \nSecretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the Secretary of \nState, to designate for such blocking any person determined to be owned \nor controlled by, or acting or purporting to act for or on behalf of, \ndirectly or indirectly, any person listed in or designated pursuant to \nthe order. The Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the \nSecretary of State, is also authorized to remove any persons from the \nAnnex to the order as circumstances warrant.\n  I delegated to the Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with \nthe Secretary of State, the authority to take such actions, including \nthe promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers \ngranted to the President by IEEPA, as may be necessary to carry out the \npurposes of the order. All executive agencies are directed to take all \nappropriate measures within their authority to carry out the provisions \nof the order.\n  The order, a copy of which is enclosed, was effective at 12:01 a.m. \neastern daylight time on June 19, 2006.\n                                                      George W.

In accordance with this provision, I have sent the \nenclosed notice to the Federal Register for publication, stating that \nthe emergency declared with respect to the accumulation of a large \nvolume of weapons-usable fissile material in the territory of the \nRussian Federation is to continue beyond June 21, 2006. The most recent \nnotice continuing this emergency was published in the Federal Register \non June 20, 2005 (70 FR 35507).\n  It remains a major national security goal of the United States to \nensure that fissile material removed from Russian nuclear weapons \npursuant to various arms control and disarmament agreements is \ndedicated to peaceful uses, subject to transparency measures, and \nprotected from diversion to activities of proliferation concern. The \naccumulation of a large volume of weapons-usable fissile material in \nthe territory of the Russian Federation continues to pose an unusual \nand extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of \nthe United States. For this reason, I have determined that it is \nnecessary to continue the national emergency declared with respect to \nthe accumulation of a large volume of weapons-usable fissile material \nin the territory of the Russian Federation and maintain in force these \nemergency authorities to respond to this threat.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to ensure oversight of intelligence on Iran, and for \nother purposes; to the Select Committee on Intelligence.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we live in a dangerous time, and that is an \nunderstatement. The threats to our freedom are many. They range from \nterrorist attacks such as those that hit our shores on 9/11 to rogue \nnations with nuclear ambitions such as North Korea and Iran.\n  It is important that we, as a country, address each of these threats. \nRecent history is rife with examples of what happens if we fail to do \nso. The threats don't go away; they only get worse.\n  This is a fact we can see in today's headlines about North Korea's \nnew missile tests--they have not fired a missile since 1998; and from \nall reports we have been able to pick up on the news, they are now \nfueling another missile just prior to launch--and also in Iran, where \nefforts to halt the country's nuclear program have been delayed and \ncomplicated by the administration's, I believe, failures in Iraq.\n  This weekend, the Washington Post reported that top Bush \nadministration officials ignored an offer from Iran in 2003, when \nAmerican leverage in the region was at its height. The offer from Iran \nwas to curtail its nuclear activities. This is very troubling.\n  Paul Pillar, the former head of Middle East analysis for the \nintelligence community, said that the U.S. position regarding Iran is \n``inherently weaker now'' because of Iraq, and that ``there have been a \nlot of lost opportunities.'' One expert analyst said the \nadministration's mismanagement ``strengthened the hands of those in \nIran who believe the only way to compel the United States to talk or \ndeal with Iran is not by sending peace offers but by being a \nnuisance.''\n  Today, I am introducing legislation which would improve Congress's \noversight of the administration's efforts on Iran--the Iran \nIntelligence Oversight Act. The legislation will ensure that Congress \nis fully engaged in the Iran debate, and it will also push the Bush \nWhite House to develop and implement the right policy for dealing with \nIran.\n  All of us are painfully aware of this Congress's unwillingness to \nhold this administration accountable for its mistakes and misjudgments. \nThere has been virtually no oversight on anything.\n  I have said before that there has been a lack of a legislative branch \nof Government. The executive exists, the judicial branch exists, but \nthe Founding Fathers' view to have three separate but equal branches of \nGovernment has not been in existence for the last 5\\1/2\\ years. The \nreason the President has not had to veto a single bill is he has gotten \nanything he wants from this Republican Congress.\n  The Senate Intelligence Committee has led the way in terms of \nstonewalling and rubber-stamping the Bush administration. Nearly 3 \nyears into its investigation of the White House's politicization of \nIraq intelligence, we still don't have a report.\n  Unfortunately, the committee record on Iran is not any better.\n  U.S. News and World Report had a quote earlier this spring from the \ncommittee's chairman, saying:\n\n       [W]e have not made the progress on our oversight of Iran \n     intelligence, which is critical.\n\n  U.S. News further said the panel had done only piecemeal scrutiny of \nthe spy agencies' work on Iran, quoting a Republican staffer as saying:\n\n       There is no organized committee staff effort to look at \n     Iran right now. . . . It's all sort of on hold.\n\n  That is really too bad.\n  Perhaps Tehran will be kind enough to wait for them, but the Senate \nshould not. The Senate must be engaged as we move our diplomacy forward \nwith Iran. We must take seriously our responsibility to insist on a \nthorough review of the facts, a full debate of the threat, and full \nconsultation as events move forward.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would put in place the \nrigorous oversight necessary to hold the administration accountable for \nits rhetoric and its all too frequent tendency to spin and distort the \nfacts.\n  The act requires the administration to give Congress and the American \npeople solid answers to three questions.\n  First, what is the judgment of the Government's professional \nintelligence analysts about the threat of Iran, and what tools are most \nlikely to influence the Iranians to change their ways?\n  Second, what are the President's policy objectives with Iran, and \nwhat is his strategy for achieving these objectives?\n  Currently, we are only left to guess.\n  To the best of my knowledge, Congress has not yet been briefed on any \nof the key details of the deal offered to Iran a few weeks ago. The \nIranians have been briefed, the Europeans have been briefed, the \nRussians have been briefed, the Chinese have been briefed--but not the \nU.S. Senate.\n  Congress needs to be in on the takeoff, not asked to board the plane \nfor the crash landing.\n  Third, this legislation asks the question: What is the process for \nmaking sure that senior administration officials do not publicly \nmischaracterize the evidence and the challenge of Iran?\n  Much of what we heard from the administration in the run-up to Iraq \nabout mushroom clouds, yellow cake, and aluminum tubes turned out to be \noverstated or based on intelligence that was known to be very, very \nsuspect.\n  I am told that the most famous of the Vice President's speeches on \nIraq--the August 2002 VFW speech that set the rush to war and \ndramatically overstated the threat from Iraq--was never even cleared by \nthe intelligence community.\n  With my legislation in place, and with vigilance from Congress, we \nwill be one step closer to ensuring this kind of misleading information \ndoes not happen regarding the threat posed by Iran.\n  I want to be clear: President Bush must take seriously the challenge \nof Iran, as I know he does, but the way to success will be a policy \nbased on the facts. Under my legislation, the administration will be \nheld accountable for anything less.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3536\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S6064]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

UNITED STATES POLICY ON IRAQ.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``United \n     States Policy on Iraq Act of 2006''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Global terrorist networks, including those that \n     attacked the United States on September 11, 2001, continue to \n     threaten the national security of the United States and are \n     recruiting, planning, and developing capabilities to attack \n     the United States and its allies throughout the world.\n       (2) Winning the fight against terrorist networks requires \n     an integrated, comprehensive effort that uses all facets of \n     power of the United States and the members of the \n     international community who value democracy, freedom, and the \n     rule of law.\n       (3) The United States Armed Forces, particularly the Army \n     and Marine Corps, are stretched thin, and many soldiers and \n     Marines have experienced three or more deployments to combat \n     zones.\n       (4) Sectarian violence has surpassed the insurgency and \n     terrorism as the main security threat in Iraq, increasing the \n     prospects of a broader civil war which could draw in Iraq's \n     neighbors.\n       (5) United States and coalition forces have trained and \n     equipped more than 116,000 Iraqi soldiers, sailors, and \n     airmen, and more than 148,000 Iraqi police, highway patrol, \n     and other Ministry of Interior forces.\n       (6) Of the 102 operational Iraqi Army combat battalions, 69 \n     are either in the lead or operating independently, according \n     to the May 2006 report of the Administration to Congress \n     entitled ``Measuring Stability and Security in Iraq'';\n       (7) Congress expressed its sense in the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 (119 Stat. 3466) that \n     ``calendar year 2006 should be a period of significant \n     transition to full Iraqi sovereignty, with Iraqi security \n     forces taking the lead for the security of a free and \n     sovereign Iraq, thereby creating the conditions for the \n     phased redeployment of United States forces from Iraq''.\n       (8) Iraq's security forces are heavily infiltrated by \n     sectarian militia, which has greatly increased sectarian \n     tensions and impeded the development of effective security \n     services loyal to the Iraq Government.\n       (9) With the approval by the Iraqi Council of \n     Representatives of the ministers of defense, national \n     security, and the interior on June 7, 2006, the entire \n     cabinet of Prime Minister Maliki is now in place.\n       (10) Pursuant to the Iraq Constitution, the Council of \n     Representatives is to appoint a Panel which will have 4 \n     months to recommend changes to the Iraq Constitution.\n       (11) Despite pledges of more than $8,000,000,000 in \n     assistance for Iraq by foreign governments other than the \n     United States at the Madrid International Donors' Conference \n     in October 2003, only $3,500,000,000 of such assistance has \n     been forthcoming.\n       (12) The current open-ended commitment of United States \n     forces in Iraq is unsustainable and a deterrent to the Iraqis \n     making the political compromises and personnel and resource \n     commitments that are needed for the stability and security of \n     Iraq.\n       (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that in \n     order to change course from an open-ended commitment and to \n     promote the assumption of security responsibilities by the \n     Iraqis, thus advancing the chances for success in Iraq--\n       (1) the following actions need to be taken to help achieve \n     the broad-based and sustainable political settlement so \n     essential for defeating the insurgency and preventing all-out \n     civil war--\n       (A) there must be a fair sharing of political power and \n     economic resources among all the Iraqi groups so as to invest \n     them in the formation of an Iraqi nation by either amendments \n     to the Iraq Constitution or by legislation or other means, \n     within the timeframe provided for in the Iraq Constitution;\n       (B) the President should convene an international \n     conference so as to more actively involve the international \n     community and Iraq's neighbors, promote a durable political \n     settlement among Iraqis, reduce regional interference in \n     Iraq's internal affairs, encourage more countries to \n     contribute to Iraq's extensive needs, and ensure that pledged \n     funds are forthcoming;\n       (C) the Iraq Government should promptly and decisively \n     disarm the militias and remove those members of the Iraqi \n     security forces whose loyalty to the Iraq Government is in \n     doubt; and\n       (D) the President should--\n       (i) expedite the transition of United States forces in Iraq \n     to a limited presence and mission of training Iraqi security \n     forces, providing logistic support of Iraqi security forces, \n     protecting United States infrastructure and personnel, and \n     participating in targeted counterterrorism activities;\n       (ii) after consultation with the Government of Iraq, begin \n     the phased redeployment of United States forces from Iraq \n     this year; and\n       (iii) submit to Congress a plan by the end of 2006 with \n     estimated dates for the continued phased redeployment of \n     United States forces from Iraq, with the understanding that \n     unexpected contingencies may arise;\n       (2) during and after the phased redeployment of United \n     States forces from Iraq, the United States will need to \n     sustain a nonmilitary effort to actively support \n     reconstruction, governance, and a durable political solution \n     in Iraq; and\n       (3) the President should carefully assess the impact that \n     ongoing United States military operations in Iraq are having \n     on the capability of the United States Government to conduct \n     an effective counterterrorism campaign to defeat the broader \n     global terrorist networks that threaten the United States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 4321.

Mr. President, today marks the anniversary of a joyous day \nin our Nation's history. It was on this day in 1865 when word finally \nreached the farthest corner of the Southwest that all slaves were free. \nMore than 2\\1/2\\ years after President Lincoln's Emancipation \nProclamation, this was the day freedom became a reality. After hundreds \nof years of servitude and oppression, this was the day that former \nslaves claimed their rightful place as equal citizens. Juneteenth was \nthe day our Nation reclaimed its dignity.\n  Today, Juneteenth is still a celebration of freedom. It is an \nopportunity for engagement and self-improvement, a time to reflect and \nrecommit ourselves to the pursuit of justice and equality. Juneteenth \nis about acknowledging where we have been as a Nation, looking honestly \nand critically at our past, and gaining a fresh understanding of the \nchallenges we face as we look toward the future.\n  Half a century after Brown v. Board of Education, this is a day for \nus to assess the quality of education we are providing to our children. \nForty years after the passage of the Voting Rights Act, this is a day \nfor us to think of the injustices that must be overcome, the millions \nwithout health care, the families without jobs, and the disparities \nthat continue to divide us.\n  Juneteenth should be a reminder to all Americans that we must not \nresign ourselves to waiting for a better time to do what we know is \nright. This is the day we honor previous generations for the great \nstrides they have taken toward creating a more just society. This is \nthe day we honor future generations by undertaking with determination \nthe work that is yet to be done.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 516) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 516\n\n       Whereas news of the end of slavery did not reach frontier \n     areas of the United States, and in particular the \n     Southwestern States, for more than 2 years after President \n     Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation of January 1, 1863, and \n     months after the conclusion of the Civil War;\n       Whereas on June 19, 1865, Union soldiers led by Major \n     General Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston, Texas, with news \n     that the Civil War had ended and that the enslaved were free;\n       Whereas African Americans who had been slaves in the \n     Southwest celebrated June 19, commonly known as ``Juneteenth \n     Independence Day'', as the anniversary of their emancipation;\n       Whereas African Americans from the Southwest continue the \n     tradition of Juneteenth Independence Day as inspiration and \n     encouragement for future generations;\n       Whereas, for more than 135 years, Juneteenth Independence \n     Day celebrations have been held to honor African American \n     freedom while encouraging self-development and respect for \n     all cultures;\n       Whereas, although Juneteenth Independence Day is beginning \n     to be recognized as a national, and even global, event, the \n     history behind the celebration should not be forgotten; and\n       Whereas the faith and strength of character demonstrated by \n     former slaves remains an example for all people of the United \n     States, regardless of background, religion, or race: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Senate--\n       (A) recognizes the historical significance of Juneteenth \n     Independence Day to the Nation;\n       (B) supports the continued celebration of Juneteenth \n     Independence Day to provide an opportunity for the people of \n     the United States to learn more about the past and to \n     understand better the experiences that have shaped the \n     Nation; and\n       (C) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     Juneteenth Independence Day with appropriate ceremonies, \n     activities, and programs; and\n       (2) it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (A) history should be regarded as a means for understanding \n     the past and solving the challenges of the future; and\n       (B) the celebration of the end of slavery is an important \n     and enriching part of the history and heritage of the United \n     States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/19/senate-section/article/S6097-4", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6097]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE INTERSTATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.
