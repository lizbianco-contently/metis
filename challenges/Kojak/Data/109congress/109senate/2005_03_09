Mr. President, during the last session of Congress, \nSenators on the other side of the aisle blocked an up-or-down vote 20 \ntimes on 10 of President Bush's nominees for the Federal appellate \ncourts. Filibusters were threatened against five more judicial \nnominees. With one possible exception, this has never happened before. \nThe Senate has a 200-year tradition of majority rule when it comes to \nconfirming judges. In fact, until the last session of Congress, the \nidea of not voting on a President's judicial nominee once it reached \nthe floor was unthinkable.\n  It would be difficult to imagine a case in which passions ran higher \nthan during the confirmation proceedings for Justice Clarence Thomas in \n1991. Yet President Bush nominated Clarence Thomas in July of 1991, and \n3\n\n[[Page S2298]]\n\nmonths later the Senate voted to confirm him, 52 to 48. There was never \nany discussion of blocking his nomination by blocking an up-or-down \nvote.\n  So in the spirit of compromise, I would like to, once again, offer my \nsolution for avoiding what some in the minority call the ``nuclear \noption'' that would change Senate rules to prevent filibusters of \nPresident Bush's judicial nominees.\n  In an address on this floor 2 years ago, on March 17, 2003, I said I \nwould reserve the right to vote against any judicial nominee of any \nPresident but that I would not filibuster the qualified court nominee \nof any President. That was before I knew whether the President would be \nnamed Bush or Kerry.\n  This is what I said then:\n\n       Before I finish my remarks, I make this pledge. I may be \n     here long enough, and I hope it is a while, before I have an \n     opportunity to cast a vote for a nominee for a Federal \n     judgeship that is sent over by a Democratic President, but I \n     can pledge now how I will cast my vote. It will be the same \n     way I appointed 50 judges when I was Governor. I look for \n     good character. I look for good intelligence. I look for good \n     temperament. I look for good understanding of the law and of \n     the duties of judges. I will look to see if this nominee had \n     the aspect of courtesy to those who come before the court. I \n     will reserve the right to vote against some extremists, but I \n     will assume that it is unnecessary and unethical for the \n     nominee to try to say to me how he or she would decide a case \n     that might come before him or her. When it comes time to \n     vote, when we finish that whole examination, I will vote to \n     let the majority decide.\n\n  That is what I said 2 years ago. I also said:\n\n       In plain English, I will not vote to deny a vote to a \n     Democratic President's judicial nominee just because the \n     nominee may have views more liberal than mine. That is the \n     way judges have always been selected. That is the way they \n     should be selected.\n\n  Mr. President, that was my pledge 2 years ago. That is my pledge \ntoday. And if a few other Senators of both parties would individually \nmake this same pledge to eventually allow up-or-down votes on all \njudicial nominees, then there would be an end to this discussion of the \nso-called nuclear option.\n  I have no doubt that changing the Senate's cloture rule by a majority \nvote is clearly constitutional. Some have argued that the Senate's \ncloture rule, which allows just 41 of us to block up-or-down votes, \ncarries over from one Congress to the next by rule V. But no less an \nauthority than the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, when he \nwas majority leader, argued very persuasively and with great common \nsense that this is not true. He said:\n\n       This Congress is not obliged to be bound by the dead hand \n     of the past. The first Senate, which met in 1789, approved 19 \n     rules by a majority vote. Those rules have changed from time \n     to time. . . . So the Members of the Senate who met in 1789 \n     and approved that first body of rules did not for one moment \n     think, or believe, or pretend, that all succeeding Senates \n     would be bound by that Senate. . . . It would be just as \n     reasonable to say that one Congress can pass a law \n     providing that all future laws have to be passed by two-\n     thirds vote. Any Member of this body knows that the next \n     Congress would not heed that law and would proceed to \n     change it and would repeal it by majority vote.\n\n  That was the Senator from West Virginia talking. So, very simply, the \nConstitution provides that 51 Senators can change Senate rules to allow \na majority to cut off debate on a President's nominee of an appellate \ncourt judge.\n  Now, that does not mean that we ought to rush to make a change in \nthat way. To extend the analogy, nuclear weapons have been effective in \nworld history because of the threat of their use, not because of their \nactual use. And that has been true here on this Senate floor.\n  In the debates on the adoption of Rule XXII on the Senate floor in \n1917, and later modifications in 1953 to 1959, and then 1960 to 1975, \nthe debate and eventual compromises were driven by the threat of the \nconstitutional option, which we are discussing today.\n  The chairman of our Judiciary Committee, Senator Arlen Specter, has \nsaid he ``intends to exercise every last ounce of [his] energy to solve \nthis problem without the nuclear option.'' I hope he will continue that \neffort.\n  The Senate protects the minority party's rights for a reason. In \nwritings about early America, Alexis De Tocqueville warned that one of \nthe potential failings of democracy would be the ``tyranny of the \nmajority.'' South Africa succeeded in creating a constitutional \ngovernment because the new Black majority was willing to protect the \nminority rights of White citizens. As we watch the people of Iraq \nstruggle to create a constitutional government, we know that a major \nsign of their success will be whether they are able to include and \nprotect the rights of Sunnis who are only 20 percent of the country but \nwho formerly dominated the country.\n  I can remember back when I came here as a legislative assistant to \nHoward Baker in the Senate in 1967, Republicans were the ones worrying \nabout protecting minority rights then. There were 64 Democrats and 36 \nRepublicans. And then, 10 years later, when I came back to the Senate \nas an aide to Senator Baker for a few months, when he was elected \nRepublican leader, there were 38 Republicans. In 1979, when the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia made his persuasive argument \nthat a majority of the Senate could change Senate rules, there were 58 \nDemocrats and 41 Republicans.\n  So just as our Republican majority should be cautious about making \nchanges that would lessen minority rights, I would respectfully suggest \nthat the Democratic minority should be equally cautious about provoking \nsuch a change.\n  One way, of course, to avoid provoking rules changes would be for the \nDemocratic Senators who opposed the President's nominees in the last \nsession to look them over again and reconsider their basis for \nopposition.\n  For example, I believe if some of the Senators on the other side \nwould really study the record of Judge Charles Pickering of \nMississippi, they would be impressed with his commitment to civil \nrights. At a time when it was hard to do, he testified against a grand \nwizard of the Ku Klux Klan in 1967, and did it in open court. At the \nsame time, he put his children in public schools when many White \nMississippians were putting their children in what were called \n``segregation academies.''\n  Any Senator who carefully looks at the record of former Attorney \nGeneral Bill Pryor of Alabama, I believe, would admire his record on \ncivil rights. He was a law clerk for Judge John Minor Wisdom, probably \nthe leading civil rights Federal judge of the last century. Bill Pryor \nshowed, as attorney general, he could take a position on abortion, on \nprayer before football games, on reapportionment, and on displaying the \nTen Commandments that were at odds with his personal views because he \nbelieved the decisions of the Supreme Court and the U.S. Constitution \nrequired it.\n  Both Judge Pickering and Judge Pryor have served in recess \nappointments and have even more of a record now to consider favorably.\n  But the other way to avoid a lengthy and damaging procedural battle \nis simply for individual Senators now to declare their willingness to \nsupport allowing an up-or-down vote of any qualified nominee for the \nbench by any President. This would apply to this Republican President's \nnominees or to some future Democratic President's nominees.\n  I do not know what terrible grievances in the past have caused such \nstrong feelings on the other side causing them to take these \nunprecedented steps to block an up-or-down vote on nominees once the \nnominee gets to the floor. As I say, there is a 200-year tradition--a \n200-year tradition--in this body of then moving to an up-or-down vote.\n  It never happened before like this. And if it continues, even though \nI hope it does not, it will almost certainly force a Senate rules \nchange. I hope we don't come to that. I have suggested two ways to \navoid it. I have taken a step myself to forgo some of my rights as an \nindividual Senator as one way to help solve the problem. I hope others \nwill do the same.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my remarks from March 17, 2003, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Mr. President, I am a new Senator. I am aware of the \n     traditions of the Senate, one of which is that a new Senator \n     is not expected to say much--at least throughout the year is \n     not expected to say much--to begin with until they have \n     something of importance to\n\n[[Page S2299]]\n\n     say. So I have not said much. I had been planning to make my \n     first remarks on this floor next Tuesday on the issues I care \n     most about, which are the education of our children and \n     putting the teaching of American history and civics back in \n     its rightful place in our schools so that our children can \n     grow up knowing what it means to be an American. I planned on \n     doing that next Tuesday. But I have decided to make some \n     remarks today--earlier than expected because I am \n     disappointed in what I have heard in the debate about Miguel \n     Estrada.\n       Like my friend from Missouri, I have had the opportunity to \n     preside in the last few days. That is one of the honors that \n     are accorded new Members of the Senate. I have been listening \n     very carefully. My disappointment has increased with each of \n     these 10 days as the debate has continued.\n       I am disappointed first because I believe our friends on \n     the other side of the aisle are being unfair to Miguel \n     Estrada. I am most disappointed in them because I believe if \n     the direction of this debate continues as it is going--and I \n     heard the comments of my friend from Missouri yesterday on \n     this same matter--if we continue in the same direction, we \n     run the risk of permanently damaging the process by which we \n     select Federal judges and by which we dispense justice in the \n     United States. I am disappointed because this is not what I \n     expected when I came to the Senate.\n       I may be new to the Senate, but I know something about \n     judges. I am a lawyer. I once clerked for a U.S. Attorney \n     General. His name was Robert Kennedy. I once clerked for a \n     great Federal appellate judge. His name was John Minor Wisdom \n     of New Orleans. I once worked in this body 36 years ago for \n     Senator Howard Baker, a great lawyer. I watched this body as \n     it considered and confirmed men and women to the Federal \n     courts of this land. As Governor of Tennessee for 8 years, I \n     had the responsibility of appointing--and did appoint--nearly \n     50 men and women to judgeships all the way from \n     chancellorships to the supreme court.\n       I know pretty well the process we have followed in the \n     Senate and in this country for the last couple of centuries.\n       It is fairly simple. It can be expressed in plain English. \n     The Executive nominates, the Senate considers, and then \n     confirms or rejects the nomination; and in doing so, what the \n     Senators have always looked for, mainly, has been good \n     character, good intelligence, good temperament, a good \n     understanding of the law and the duties of a judge, and \n     whether a nominee seems to have courtesy for those who may \n     come before him or her. And it has always been assumed that \n     it is unnecessary--and, in fact, it is unethical by the \n     standards of most of the judicial canons in this country--for \n     the nominee to try to say how he or she would decide a case \n     that might come before him or her.\n       Then, after all that examination is done in the Senate, \n     there is a vote. And under our constitutional traditions, the \n     majority decides.\n       I have been listening very carefully, and that is not what \n     is happening. The other side has simply decided that it will \n     not allow the Senate to vote on the nomination of Miguel \n     Estrada. In doing so, it is doing something that has never \n     been done for a circuit court of appeals judge in our \n     Nation's history.\n       In those hours that I have presided over this body in the \n     last few days, I have been listening very carefully to see \n     what reasons our friends on the other side could give for \n     coming to such an extraordinary conclusion about whom I have \n     come to learn is an extraordinary individual, Miguel Estrada.\n       I have been listening carefully for the answers, especially \n     to these three questions: No. 1, what is wrong with Miguel \n     Estrada? What is wrong with him? No. 2, why can't we vote on \n     Miguel Estrada, after 10 days of debate? And, No. 3--most \n     importantly--why should we change the constitutional \n     tradition that a majority of the Senate will decide whether \n     to confirm Miguel Estrada? Because what they are saying, \n     really, is that he will need to get 60 votes--60 votes--\n     instead of 51.\n       I have had the privilege of listening to each of their \n     arguments. As my friend from Missouri knows, they first try \n     one argument, and it does not go so well. Then they move to \n     another argument, and it does not stand the light of day. And \n     then they move to another one.\n       But let me tell you what I have heard as I have listened to \n     the debate.\n       First, they said--it would be hard to imagine that anyone \n     could say this with a straight face, but we had many straight \n     faces on the other side of the aisle saying this--that he was \n     not qualified to be a Federal appellate judge.\n       You do not hear that argument very much anymore because \n     that is almost a laughable comment if it were not such a \n     serious matter.\n       But let's go over this. This man isn't just qualified; if \n     this were sports, he would be on the Olympic team, and he \n     would be getting an award for ``American Dream Story of the \n     Year.''\n       Here is a man who came to this country at age 17 from \n     Honduras. He had a speech impediment. He spoke very little \n     English. And within a short period of time, he was attending \n     Columbia University, one of the most prestigious universities \n     in America.\n       Then he went to Harvard Law School. Now, it is really hard \n     to get into Harvard Law School. It has great competition. \n     Everyone who is applying to a law school around the United \n     States of America this year--and I know a great many of \n     them--think about it. This young man, in a few years, was \n     admitted to Harvard Law School. And not only that, he became \n     an editor of the Harvard Law Review and graduated magna cum \n     laude.\n       This is a dream resume, but it is not even over.\n       Then he went to the Second Circuit as a law clerk. Then he \n     became a clerk for a Supreme Court Justice. By now he was in \n     the top 1 percent of 1 percent of all law school students in \n     the country, with the kind of resume for a lawyer every law \n     firm in the country would want to hire. He has a record that \n     almost everyone would admire.\n       Then he went to the Southern District of New York, one of \n     the most competitive places, to be hired for training there.\n       Then he was in the Solicitor General's Office. To those who \n     are not lawyers or who do not keep up with this sort of \n     thing, just being in the Solicitor General's Office might not \n     sound like such a big deal, but those are the plum positions. \n     The way I understand that office, there are a couple of \n     political appointees there--the Solicitor General and his \n     Deputy--and there are about 20 career lawyers. Miguel Estrada \n     was one of those lawyers. They are there because they are not \n     just good, they are the best in America. They have the best \n     resumes. They have been the clerks to the Supreme Court \n     Justices. They are going to be the greatest lawyers. It is \n     the most competitive position in which you can be.\n       And there he is, Miguel Estrada, coming here at age 17, \n     barely speaking English, making his way into there. He worked \n     there for the Clinton administration and the Bush \n     administration. Then he went to one of the major law firms of \n     America. And he has argued 15 cases before the Supreme \n     Court of the United States.\n       That is an incredibly talented record. There is almost no \n     one who has been nominated for any judgeship in our country's \n     history who has a superior record. For anyone to have even \n     suggested for 15 minutes that Miguel Estrada is not superbly \n     qualified to be a member of the United States Court of \n     Appeals--for anyone to even suggest that--it is difficult to \n     see how one could do that with a straight face.\n       Little has been made about what he did in the Solicitor \n     General's Office. I think it is worth talking about that. \n     These talented young men and women have the job of helping \n     the Solicitor General make decisions about what to do in \n     cases in which the United States is a party. That means they \n     review all the decisions that come against us, the United \n     States of America. They are the lawyers for us, the United \n     States of America.\n       They write memoranda and they write opinion and they must \n     argue back and forth. And they must argue about every side of \n     every issue. And our friends on the other side have come up \n     with straight-face argument No. 2, which is that somehow Mr. \n     Estrada, who does not even have all those memoranda, should \n     be penalized because the U.S. Government does not want to \n     hand those memoranda, that were exchanged back and forth \n     between the various Solicitor General's assistants, over to \n     the Senate.\n       We have never done that. There are seven living former \n     Solicitors General of the United States, and seven--all of \n     them--have written a letter to this body saying that has \n     never been done, and it never should be done, for obvious \n     reasons. If it were done, you would never have any \n     straightforward memoranda left in that office. It protects \n     us, the United States. And that never should even be \n     considered to be held against Mr. Estrada.\n       So is he qualified? It is hard to imagine someone who is \n     better qualified. I consider it a great privilege to come to \n     the Senate and find a President who discovered such an \n     extraordinary person to nominate for the Court of Appeals for \n     the District of Columbia Circuit. Such a story should give \n     inspiration to men and women all over America, that this is \n     the country to which you can come, regardless of race or \n     background or whatever your condition, and dream of being \n     admitted to the best universities, finding the best jobs in a \n     short period of time, and being nominated by the President of \n     the United States for such a court.\n       What a wonderful story. And what an embarrassing event it \n     is to have our friends on the other side to even take the \n     time of this Senate trying to suggest such a person is not \n     qualified. So let's just throw that argument away and put it \n     in the drawer.\n       Since that argument did not fly, they then moved to \n     argument No. 2, which is equally difficult to offer with a \n     straight face, if I may respectfully say so. They said he has \n     no judicial experience.\n       Now, this argument is still being made. I heard the \n     distinguished Senator from New York, last night, in an \n     impassioned address, right over on the other side, say he has \n     never been a judge, and we don't know what his opinions are. \n     Never been a judge--Miguel Estrada cannot be a judge because \n     he has never been a judge.\n       Well, I am awfully glad that was not the standard that was \n     applied to Justice Felix Frankfurter when President Roosevelt \n     nominated him. He would never have been a judge before he was \n     a Justice of the Supreme Court.\n       I am glad it was not the standard that was applied to Louis \n     Brandeis before he was nominated to the Supreme Court. I am \n     glad it was not the standard that was applied to\n\n[[Page S2300]]\n\n     Thurgood Marshall, the first African American who was ever \n     appointed to the Supreme Court of the United States. He had \n     never been a judge. And so should Thurgood Marshall have \n     never been a Justice because he had never been a judge?\n       When I graduated from New York University Law School, the \n     dean came to see me and said I had a chance to be a messenger \n     down in New Orleans for a man that my dean, Bob McKay, said \n     was one of the three or four best Federal judges in the \n     country. His name was John Minor Wisdom, a great man and a \n     great lawyer. He had never been a judge before President \n     Eisenhower appointed him.\n       Neither had Elbert Tuttle from Atlanta or John Brown from \n     Texas. The three of them became three of the greatest judges \n     in the South. They presided, having been appointed by a \n     Republican President, over the desegregation of the southern \n     U.S. They were among the greatest judges we have ever had, \n     and they had never been judges.\n       Of 108 Supreme Court Justices who have been appointed, 43 \n     of those have never been a judge. I have a list somewhere \n     here of judge after judge after judge. Earl Warren; Byron \n     White; Justice Powell; Justice Rehnquist; Justice Breyer; \n     Judge Wisdom's favorite friend on the second circuit, Henry \n     Friendly of New York. He had never been a judge before. \n     Charles Clark; Jerome Frank; John Paul Stevens; Warren \n     Burger; Harold Leventhal; Spottswood Robinson; Ruth Bader \n     Ginsberg, who had never been a judge before she was a \n     Justice. Does that mean she wasn't qualified to sit on this \n     Court?\n       Why would the other side be taking up the time of the \n     Senate at a time when we are concerned with war with Iraq and \n     the economy is hurting, by making that kind of argument? They \n     would be asked to sit down in any respectable law school in \n     America if they gave that answer. Yet they are here in the \n     Senate trying to persuade us that it makes a point.\n       In 1980, I appointed George Brown of Memphis as the first \n     African American justice in the history of the State of \n     Tennessee. If George Brown had to be a judge before he had \n     become a justice, I could never have appointed an African \n     American justice, because there were no African American \n     judges at that time. Even today, given the paucity of \n     Hispanics and African Americans and women who are judges, if \n     we were to say that in order for someone to be a judge, \n     before he or she becomes a judge, we would have a terrible, \n     invidious discrimination against men and women who should not \n     be discriminated against, and I am sure my friends on the \n     other side don't want to see that happen.\n       So even though we have spent days arguing that Miguel \n     Estrada should not be considered because he has never been a \n     judge, that argument has no merit to it whatsoever. We hear \n     it less and less now that it is on the tenth day.\n       Well, those two arguments didn't fly because here is a \n     superbly qualified person. So they said he didn't answer the \n     questions.\n       I just had the privilege of hearing the distinguished \n     Senator from California and the distinguished Senator from \n     Minnesota spend a long time talking about that, saying he \n     hasn't answered questions. Well, Mr. President, I am not a \n     member of the Judiciary Committee, but I know they had \n     hearings and I know Members on the other side were in charge \n     of the Senate when they had the hearings. I know the hearings \n     could have gone on as long as they wanted them to because \n     they were in charge. If I am not mistaken, the distinguished \n     Senator from Utah was here. I believe they went on all day \n     long. The hearings were unusually long. Miguel Estrada was \n     there and he answered their questions. Every Senator on the \n     committee had the opportunity to ask followup questions in \n     writing, and two did. The Senator from Massachusetts and the \n     Senator from Illinois did that. Mr. Estrada gave those \n     answers in writing. He has now said to Members of the Senate \n     that he is available for further questions. He will be glad \n     to visit with them.\n       What does he have to do to answer the questions? Why is \n     there a new standard for Miguel Estrada? Why do we say to \n     him, for the first time, tell us your views in a particular \n     case before we will confirm you? We have tradition rooted in \n     history that it is even unethical to do that. I appointed \n     50 judges, as I said, when I was Governor. When I sat down \n     with these judges, I didn't ask: How would you rule on TV \n     A and the rate case, or how would you rule on partial-\n     birth abortion, in the abortion case; or what would you do \n     about applying the first amendment to the issue of whether \n     to take the Ten Commandments down from the courthouse in \n     Murfreesboro, TN, or how do you feel about prayer in the \n     schools, or if somebody says a prayer before a football \n     game?\n       I didn't do that because I didn't think it was right to ask \n     a judge to decide a case before the case came before him, \n     which has been the tradition in this country. We are not \n     appointing legislators to the bench, or precinct chairmen, or \n     think-tank chairmen, or Senators; we are appointing judges. \n     They are supposed to look at the facts and consider the law \n     and come to a conclusion. But they say he didn't answer the \n     questions.\n       Mr. President, the only way I know to deal with that--\n     because this side says one thing and that side says the \n     other, and since I am not on the Judiciary Committee--is to \n     read the questions and the answers. I wanted to see whether \n     he was asked some questions and whether he gave some answers.\n       These are the questions and answers, Mr. President. This is \n     the record of the hearing of Miguel Estrada, plus a long \n     memorandum of questions from the Senator from Massachusetts \n     and the Senator from Illinois that he also answered. I will \n     not take the Senate's time to read all of the questions and \n     answers, but since they keep saying he didn't answer the \n     questions, let me give some examples.\n       The chairman of the committee says: Mr. Estrada, we have \n     heard you have held many strongly-held beliefs. You are a \n     zealous advocate. That is great. You know, lawyers who win \n     cases are not the ones who say ``on the one hand, this, on \n     the other hand, that.'' They are zealous. But you also have \n     to make sure, if you are going to enforce the laws, that your \n     personal views don't take over the law. Senator Thurmond has \n     asked every single nominee I have ever heard him speak to--\n     Republican or Democrat--to speak to that effect. What would \n     you say is the most important attribute of a judge, and do \n     you possess that?\n       A very good question.\n       Answer: The most important quality for a judge, in my view, \n     Senator Leahy, is to have an appropriate process for \n     decisionmaking. That entails having an open mind, it entails \n     listening to the parties, reading their briefs, going back \n     behind the briefs and doing the legal work needed to \n     ascertain who is right in his or her claims. In courts of \n     appeals court where judges sit in panels of three, it is \n     important to engage in deliberations and give ears to the \n     views of colleagues who may have come to different \n     conclusions. In sum, to be committed to judging as a process \n     that is intended to give us the right answer and not a \n     result. I can give you my level best solemn assurance that I \n     firmly think I have those qualities, or else I would not have \n     accepted the nomination.\n       ``Does that include the temperament of the judge?'', asked \n     the chairman.\n       Mr. Estrada said: Yes, that includes the temperament of a \n     judge. To borrow somewhat from the American Bar Association, \n     the temperament of a judge includes whether he or she is \n     impartial and openminded, unbiased, courteous, yet firm, and \n     whether he will give ear to people who have come into his \n     courtroom and who don't come in with a claim about which the \n     judge may at first be skeptical.\n       The chairman said: Thank you.\n       I submit that is a good answer. I appointed 50 judges and I \n     would have listened to that question. I would give him an A-\n     plus on that.\n       Here is the Senator from Iowa: Before I make some comment, \n     I want to ask three basic questions.\n       This is in the hearing with Mr. Estrada. This is the man \n     who the other side says doesn't answer questions.\n       The Senator from Iowa: In general, Supreme Court precedents \n     are binding on all lower Federal courts, and circuit court \n     precedents are binding on district courts within a particular \n     circuit. Are you committed to following the precedents of the \n     higher courts faithfully, giving them full force and effect \n     even if you disagree with such precedents?\n       Mr. Estrada: Absolutely, Senator.\n       How could you make a better answer than that? You could \n     either say yes or no. He said yes.\n       The Senator from Iowa: What would you do if you believed \n     the Supreme Court or court of appeals had seriously erred in \n     rendering a decision? Would you, nevertheless, apply that \n     decision, or would you use your own judgment on the merits, \n     or the best judgment of the merits?\n       Mr. Estrada: My duty as a judge, and inclination as a \n     person and as a lawyer of integrity would be to follow the \n     orders of the highest court.\n       The Senator from Ohio: And if there were no controlling \n     precedent dispositively concluding an issue with which you \n     were presented in your circuit, to which sources would you \n     turn for persuasive authority?\n       Mr. Estrada: When facing a problem for which there is not a \n     decisive answer from a higher court, my cardinal rule would \n     be to seize aid from any place I could get it. Depending on \n     the nature of the problem, that would include related case \n     law and other areas higher courts had dealt with that had \n     some insights to teach with respect to the problem at hand. \n     It could include history of the enactment, in the case of a \n     statute, legislative history. It could include the custom and \n     practice under any predecessor statute or document. It could \n     include the view of academics to the extent they purport to \n     analyze what the law is instead of prescribing what it ought \n     to be, and, in sum, as Chief Justice Marshall once said, to \n     attempt not to overlook anything from which aid might be \n     derived.\n       I give him an A-plus for that. That was a good question, \n     and he gave a superb answer, just the kind of answer I think \n     an American citizen who wants to appear before an \n     impartial court in this country would hope to hear. I do \n     not think we want to hear: Welcome to the court, Mr./Ms. \n     Litigant. We have here your Democratic court; we have here \n     your Republican court. If your views are all right, you \n     might get the right hearing. You would want a judge who \n     said what Mr. Estrada said.\n       The Senator from Massachusetts, who has been extremely \n     critical of Mr. Estrada, asked a more detailed question. Mr. \n     President, you may be wondering why I am going into such \n     detail when this is available to the whole world, including \n     the Senators on the\n\n[[Page S2301]]\n\n     other side. The problem is perhaps someone has not bothered \n     to offer this book to our friends on the other side because \n     they keep coming down here while you and I are presiding day \n     in and day out for 10 straight days and saying Mr. Estrada \n     has not answered the questions. My suggestion is he has \n     answered question after question, and he has done a beautiful \n     job of answering the questions.\n       Let me take a few more minutes and give examples of \n     answering questions.\n       The Senator from Massachusetts: Now, Mr. Estrada, you made \n     the case before the court that the NAACP should not be \n     granted standing to represent the members. As I look through \n     the case, I have difficulty in understanding why you would \n     believe the NAACP would not have standing in this kind of \n     case when it has been so extraordinary in terms of fighting \n     for those--this is the NAACP--and in this case was making the \n     case of intervention because of their concern about the youth \n     in terms of employment, battling drugs, and also voting.\n       In other words, Mr. Kennedy was saying: Mr. Estrada, how \n     can you do this when the NAACP is on the other side?\n       Mr. Estrada's answer: The laws that were at issue in that \n     case, Senator Kennedy, and in an earlier case, which is how I \n     got involved in the issue, deal with the subject of street \n     gangs that engage in or may engage in some criminal activity. \n     I got involved in the issue as a result of being asked by the \n     city of Chicago--the last time I checked, the mayor of the \n     city of Chicago was a Democrat, a good mayor, but just so I \n     would not want anyone to think this was a partisan comment--\n     which had passed by similar ordinance dealing with street \n     gangs. And I was called by somebody who worked for Mayor \n     Daley when they needed help in the Supreme Court in a case \n     that was pending on the loitering issue. I mention that \n     because after doing my work in that case, I got called by the \n     attorney for the city of Annapolis, which is the case to \n     which you are making reference. They had a somewhat similar \n     law to the one that had been at issue in the Supreme Court. \n     Not the same law. They were already in litigation, as you \n     mentioned, with the NAACP. By the time he called me--this is \n     the lawyer for the city--he had filed a motion for summary \n     judgment making the argument that you outlined. And he had \n     been met with the entrance into the case by a prominent DC \n     law firm on the other side. He went to the State and local \n     legal center and asked: Who can I turn to to help? And they \n     sent him to me because of the work I had done in the Chicago \n     case. Following that, I did the brief, and the point on the \n     standing issue that you mentioned is that in both Chicago and \n     in the Annapolis ordinance, you were dealing with types of \n     laws that had been passed with significant substantial \n     support from the minority communities. I have always thought \n     that it was part of my duty as a lawyer to make sure that \n     when people go to their elected representatives and ask for \n     those type of laws to be passed to make the appropriate \n     arguments that a court might accept to uphold the judgment of \n     the democratic people. In the context of the NAACP, that was \n     relevant to a legal issue because one of the requirements we \n     argued for representational standing--those who might be \n     listening may think this is awfully detailed, awfully \n     specific, awfully long. Mr. President, that is my point. \n     Senator Kennedy asked an appropriate and very detailed \n     question about an issue involving street gangs in Chicago \n     where Mayor Daley asked Mr. Estrada to help, and Mr. Estrada \n     gave Senator Kennedy a very detailed, courteous, respectful, \n     specific answer that has taken me 3 or 4 minutes to read, and \n     I am not through yet.\n       The point is, the other side keeps saying he has not \n     answered questions when he has answered the questions. Not \n     only has he answered them, he has answered them in a way a \n     superbly qualified lawyer with his background might be \n     expected to answer.\n       The Senator from Alabama: Mr. Estrada, if you are confirmed \n     in this position, and I hope you will be, how do you see the \n     rule of law, and will you tell us, regardless of whether you \n     agree with it or not, you will follow binding precedent?\n       Mr. Estrada: I will follow binding case law in every case. \n     I don't even know that I can say whether I concur in the case \n     or not without actually having gone through all the work of \n     doing it from scratch. I may have a personal, moral, \n     philosophical view on the subject matter, but I undertake to \n     you that I would put all that aside and decide cases in \n     accordance with the binding case law and even in accordance \n     with the case law that is not binding but seems instructive \n     in the area, without any influence whatsoever from any \n     personal view that I may have about the subject matter.\n       What Mr. Estrada was saying to the Senator from Alabama \n     was: Mr. Senator, with respect, I may not decide this case \n     the way you would like for it to be decided because I will \n     look at the case law and I will follow the case law, and I \n     might even decide this case the way my personal view would \n     decide it if the case law is different than my personal view. \n     In other words, I think Mr. Estrada is giving the answer that \n     most Americans want of their judges, regardless of what party \n     they are in.\n       I will give a couple more examples, and I do this because \n     this has gone on now 10 days. All I hear from the other side \n     is he will not answer the questions, he is not answering the \n     questions, when, in fact, there is a book full of questions \n     and answers to which I believe law professors in the law \n     school I attended would give a very high grade.\n       Here is the Senator from Wisconsin: With that in mind, Mr. \n     Estrada, I would like to know your thoughts on some of the \n     following issues. Mr. Estrada, what do you think of the \n     Supreme Court's effort to curtail Congress' power which began \n     with the Lopez case back in 1995, the Gun-Free School Zone \n     Act. That was a very controversial case. I remember my own \n     view on that. I would have voted against it, even though, \n     obviously, I am for gun-free school zones, but almost every \n     Senator voted for it because they did not want to sound like \n     they were against gun-free school zones, I guess, or whatever \n     the reason might have been, but it was a controversial issue \n     and a hard issue to vote against.\n       Mr. Estrada: Yes, I know the case, Senator. As you may \n     know, I was in the Government at the time, and I argued a \n     companion case to Lopez that was pending at the same time and \n     in which I took the view that the United States was urging in \n     the Lopez case and in my case for a very expansive view of \n     the power of Congress to pass statutes under the commerce \n     clause and have them to be upheld by the court. Although my \n     case, which was the companion case to Lopez, was a win for \n     the Government on a very narrow theory, the court did reject \n     the broad theory I was urging on the court on behalf of the \n     Government.\n       In other words, Mr. Estrada was sticking up for the very \n     people who are saying he will not answer their questions. He \n     was there. That was his view, and he talks about it, and he \n     answered the question: Even though I worked very hard in that \n     case to come up with every conceivable argument for why \n     the power of Congress would be as vast as the mind could \n     see, and told the court so at oral argument, I understand \n     I lost on that issue in that case as an advocate, and I \n     will be constrained to follow the Lopez case.\n       Here we are, Mr. President. Mr. Estrada took a position \n     that I would have voted against. I think he is wrong, but he \n     really did not take a position that I would vote against him. \n     He argued a case before the court that made the very best \n     argument he could make, arguing two lines of opinions. What \n     our friends on the other side are saying is, when he writes a \n     brief or argues a case on behalf of the United States, that \n     somehow that reflects the point of view with which they \n     disagree. I disagree with his brief. I would not consider \n     voting against him or anybody else based on that kind of \n     reason, a very complete answer.\n       Then if I may, I will state two more. Again, I would not \n     normally think it was necessary for me to read the questions \n     and read the answers, except that virtually every Senator \n     from the other side who has come in has said he has not \n     answered the questions, so I want the American people and my \n     colleagues to know that if they want to know whether he has \n     answered the questions all they need to do is go to the \n     hearing record and read the question and read the answer.\n       Here is a tough one from the Senator from California: Do \n     you believe that Roe v. Wade was correctly decided?\n       There is no more a difficult question for a judge who comes \n     before the Senate, because that is a terribly difficult issue \n     about which we all have deeply held moral beliefs, and for \n     all of us almost there is only one right way to answer the \n     question, unless one believes that what judges are supposed \n     to do is to interpret the law and apply the law to the facts.\n       Mr. Estrada's answer: My view on that judicial function, \n     Senator Feinstein, does not allow me to answer that question.\n       Then he goes on to explain what he meant.\n       I have a personal view on the subject of abortion, as I \n     think you know. But I have not done what I think the judicial \n     function would require me to do in order to ascertain whether \n     the Court got it right as an original matter. I have not \n     listened to the parties. I have not come to an actual case or \n     a controversy with an open mind. I have not gone back and run \n     down everything that they have cited. And the reason I have \n     not done any of those things is that I view our system of law \n     as one in which both me as an advocate and possibly, if I am \n     confirmed, as judge have the job of building on the wall that \n     is already there and not to call it into question. I have had \n     no particular reason to go back and look at whether it was \n     right or wrong as a matter of law, as I would if I were a \n     judge that was hearing the case for the first time. It is \n     there. It is the law, as has been subsequently refined by the \n     Casey case, and I will follow it.\n       That is a complete answer to the most difficult question \n     that could be asked of a nominee for a Federal judgeship.\n       Senator Feinstein: So you believe it is settled law?\n       Mr. Estrada: I believe so.\n       As I mentioned, if I understand the committee's rules, \n     every Senator on the committee has the ability to ask \n     followup questions. I know when I was confirmed by the \n     committee they asked me many followup questions and I worked \n     hard answering the questions 10 or 12 years ago when I was in \n     the first President Bush's Cabinet. These are serious \n     questions and serious answers.\n       Here I think is a revealing question, and one which may \n     give us some idea of why we are in the 10th day of debate on \n     one of the most superbly qualified candidates ever nominated \n     for the court of appeals, a man who exemplifies the American \n     dream. The Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, asked \n     this question:\n       Mr. Estrada, do you consider yourself a ``conservative'' \n     lawyer? Why or why not?\n\n[[Page S2302]]\n\n     Why do you believe that you are being promoted by your \n     supporters as a conservative judicial nominee? Do you believe \n     that your judicial philosophy is akin to that of Justices \n     Scalia and Thomas? Why or why not?\n       What Senator Kennedy is looking for is to find out is this \n     a conservative lawyer. Is the suggestion that we may want \n     conservative decisions or liberal decisions? I thought we \n     wanted fair decisions, based on precedent, based on fact. I \n     thought we wanted judges who it would be impossible for us to \n     tell where they were coming from before they were coming.\n       The response from Mr. Estrada is very interesting. He said \n     to the Senator from Massachusetts: My role as an attorney is \n     to advocate my client's position within ethical bounds rather \n     than promote any particular point of view, conservative or \n     otherwise.\n       A-plus for that, I would say.\n       Mr. Estrada says: I have worked as an attorney for a \n     variety of clients, including the United States Government, \n     State and local governments, individuals charged with \n     criminal activity.\n       Are we going to say criminal lawyers cannot be confirmed \n     because they represented people who murdered people and that \n     makes them murderers?\n       Large corporations, indigent prisoners seeking Federal \n     habeas corpus, in those cases I have advocated a variety of \n     positions that might be characterized as either liberal or \n     conservative.\n       Remember, this is from a career employee in the U.S. \n     Solicitor's Office in the Clinton and Bush administrations. \n     This is Miguel Estrada: While I am grateful for the wide \n     ranging and bipartisan support that my nomination has \n     received, I have no knowledge of the specific reasons that \n     might cause a particular supporter of my nomination to \n     promote my candidacy for judicial office. As a judge I would \n     view my job as trying to reach the correct answer to the \n     question before me without being guided by any preconceptions \n     or speculations as to how any other judge or justice might \n     approach the same issue.\n       If all of the Senators would take the time to read Miguel \n     Estrada's answers, some of them might end up in a textbook of \n     appropriate answers, if they believe a judge's job is to \n     apply precedent and consider the facts and come to a fair \n     decision.\n       Miguel Estrada is qualified, and he is not just qualified, \n     he is one of the most qualified persons ever nominated for \n     the Federal court of appeals. If he, by his very candidacy, \n     represents the American dream that anything is possible, \n     coming here from Honduras at age 17 and making his way \n     through such a distinguished series of appointments, if he \n     has answered the questions in what I would argue is a \n     superior way, the way most nominees would be capable of \n     answering the questions, and I have read just a few of them--\n     I can come back and take another 2 or 3 hours and read more \n     because there are hours of questions and answers--and if a \n     majority of Members of the Senate have signed a letter saying \n     they would vote to confirm him, then why can we not vote on \n     Miguel Estrada?\n       The only reason can be that our Democratic friends want to \n     change the way judges are selected. They want to say it takes \n     60 votes instead of 51, and they want to say the criteria for \n     winning those votes is to answer the questions the way they \n     want.\n       That will give us a Federal judiciary filled with \n     partisans, or an empty Federal judiciary because we will be \n     debating night after night because we cannot agree on whom to \n     nominate and confirm. Such a process, if carried on in \n     subsequent Congresses, will diminish the executive. It will \n     diminish the judiciary. It will reduce the likelihood that \n     facts will be considered and that binding precedent will \n     apply. In other words, it will reduce the chance that justice \n     will be done. It will reduce respect for the courts because \n     it will be assumed that if partisan views on the case are \n     what it takes to get confirmed by the Senate, then partisan \n     views are what it takes to win a case before the court.\n       It reminds me of the story we tell at home about the old \n     Tennessee judge. He was in a rural county up in the mountains \n     and the lawyers showed up for a case one morning. He said: \n     Gentlemen, we can save a lot of time. I received a telephone \n     call last night. I pretty well know the facts. All you need \n     to do is give me a little memorandum on the law.\n       We do not want a judiciary where those who come before it \n     believe the judges got their political instructions when they \n     were confirmed and that there is really no need to argue the \n     case.\n       So Miguel Estrada is superbly qualified. Miguel Estrada has \n     answered question after question, and he has done it very \n     well. A majority of the Senate has signed a letter saying \n     they are ready to vote today to confirm Miguel Estrada, and \n     never in our history have we denied such a vote by filibuster \n     to a circuit court judge. It is time to vote.\n       Before I finish my remarks, I make this pledge. I may be \n     here long enough, and I hope it is a while, before I have an \n     opportunity to cast a vote for a nominee for a Federal \n     judgeship that is sent over by a Democratic President, but I \n     can pledge now how I will cast my vote. It will be the same \n     way I appointed 50 judges when I was Governor. I look for \n     good character. I look for good intelligence. I look for good \n     temperament. I look for good understanding of the law and of \n     the duties of judges. I will look to see if this nominee has \n     the aspect of courtesy to those who come before the court. I \n     will reserve the right to vote against some extremists, but I \n     will assume that it is unnecessary and unethical for the \n     nominee to try to say to me how he or she would decide a case \n     that might come before him or her. When it comes time to \n     vote, when we finish that whole examination, I will vote to \n     let the majority decide.\n       In plain English, I will not vote to deny a vote to a \n     Democratic President's judicial nominee just because the \n     nominee may have views more liberal than mine. That is the \n     way judges have always been selected. That is the way they \n     should be selected.\n       I conclude in equally plain English, and with respect, I \n     hope my friends on the other side of the aisle would not deny \n     a vote to Miguel Estrada just because they suspect his views \n     on some issues may be more conservative than theirs.\n       These are the most serious times for our country. Our \n     values are being closely examined in every part of the world. \n     Our men and women are about to be asked, it appears, to fight \n     a war in another part of the world. How we administer our \n     system of justice is one of the most important values they \n     are defending. We need to constrain our partisan instincts to \n     get them under control. We need to avoid a result that \n     changes the way we select judges. In my view, we permanently \n     damage our process for selecting Federal judges.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, before Senator Alexander leaves the \nChamber, I am pleased that I was late so he had to speak first and I \ncould listen to him. His remarks were thoughtful, thought provoking, \nand conclusive. If Senators on the other side of the aisle will listen \nto what he said and think it through, they will understand that this \nsituation is going to be resolved. If they continue to insist it be \nresolved their way, I believe the Senate will decide that they will \nchange procedural rules.\n  Having said that, I remind those who are listening and those who have \nlived through very recent history that there have been some contentious \nnominees that we have considered in recent times and that the American \npeople can vividly remember. Let me remind those listening: We had the \nnomination of Judge Carswell years past. That was a highly debated \nnomination. All kinds of things were said about his qualifications, his \ncapacity. There was enough enthusiasm against him--rancor--that if the \nfilibuster had been used and brought to fruition, he probably never \nwould have gotten enough votes to break the filibuster. He would have \nbeen defeated that way. But that did not happen. There was an up-or-\ndown vote, and he was defeated.\n  Remember recently when we thoroughly debated Clarence Thomas, how \nmany weeks that went on; how many days the debate went on. That \ncontroversial nomination was not filibustered. There was an up-or-down \nvote, just as we Senators on this side of the aisle are almost begging \nthe Democrats to let happen for current nominees. It happened in the \ncase of Clarence Thomas and he won by two votes. It is obvious, that if \nthose who opposed him--and they opposed him with a great deal of \ncertainty that he should not go on the bench--would have chosen the \ncourse of today, they would have used a filibuster. Why didn't they? \nThey didn't because historically in the Senate, traditionally in the \nSenate, where there is majority support for a nominee, a filibuster is \nnot used.\n  Having said that, it is obvious to this Senator that somehow or \nanother in the last 4 years there has been a new idea promulgated that \nthe advice and consent function, which the Constitution says is our \nprerogative to give to Presidential nominees, allows the other side, \nwhen it has an objection to a nominee, to filibuster that nominee. \nThere have been more filibusters in the last 4 years against judges \nthan in all of this body's previous history. It appears that every time \nthere is a contentious nominee, that tactic will be used. That idea was \nnot in this body before 2000. That tactic was not used before to the \nsame degree it is used now. It is an invitation, I say to my friends on \nthe other side of the aisle, for the majority to decide that enough is \nenough.\n  The idea that we want to protect the minority goes both ways. Senator \nAlexander is right. Many of us have been in the Senate on this side of \nthe aisle when we were in the minority. I came here when we only had 38 \nRepublicans. We were the ones crying out for protection. But we didn't \nfilibuster Federal judgeships. We didn't filibuster district\n\n[[Page S2303]]\n\nor circuit or Supreme Court nominees. That was for a number of years, \nnot just one or two. For a number of years we were in the minority.\n  But the problems with requiring a super-majority is a concept that \nhas been discussed by our Founding Fathers. Alexander Hamilton wrote:\n\n       To give the minority a negative upon the majority (which is \n     always the case where more than a majority is requisite to a \n     decision) is, in its tendency, to subject the sense of the \n     greater number to that of the lesser.\n\n  Obviously, that is the case. Obviously, when we look at judges and \nhistory, the Constitution talks about advice and consent and clearly \nrequires that a majority of the Senate consent. Our rules are not the \nonly things that talk about advice and consent. The Constitution does. \nOur Founding Fathers, fully aware of this Hamiltonian quote, provided \nin the Constitution the events when more than a majority is required.\n\n  The Constitution said to override Presidential vetoes required more \nthan a majority; to remove Federal officers under impeachment required \nmore than a majority; to ratify treaties required more than a majority; \nto expel a House or Senate member required more than a majority; and to \npropose constitutional amendments required more than a majority. It did \nnot say such was required when we are exercising our advice and consent \npower. Had that been a situation in our governance that required a \nsupermajority, it would have been easy for the Founding Fathers to \nwrite that in. But they did not.\n  From this Senator's standpoint, the other side of the aisle, which \ntalks so much about closing down Government if they don't get their way \non this, ought to think it through carefully. Closing down the \nGovernment is something that ought to be used rarely. Even the words \nought to be used carefully. ``Closing down the Government'' could mean \nwe are going to stop funding education. It could mean we are going to \nclose down all the national parks. It could mean we are not going to \nhave enough money appropriated for our military. Closing down the \nGovernment, a threat from the other side of the aisle which they think \nwould make us change our minds about this issue, is at least a two-\nedged sword and probably only a one-edged sword. That sword will be: \nWoe to those who close down Government over issues such as this.\n  Recall within the last 15 years, closing down Government was a \nthreat, I regret to say, made by and carried out by some leadership in \nthe House. The issue was thought by them to be paramount. But the \npublic prevailed. The public said: The paramount issue is to keep your \nGovernment open, even if your cause is one you believe whole-heartedly \nin. From my standpoint, the threat is sufficient for me to seriously \nconsider using this constitutional option so that advice and consent \nwill be majoritarian instead of requiring 60 votes in the Senate.\n  The reason is easy for me. The Senate as an institution--its rules, \nits process--is marvelous. I have been here a long time. I support it. \nIt is set apart by free debate, by opportunity to amend. But there also \nis precedent in our rules. There are requirements that the Senate think \ncarefully about what they are doing regarding as important an issue as \nadvice and consent. Some think, that Senator from New Mexico has been \nhere too long; he has frequently said he admires and respects the rules \nof the Senate and has become accustomed to them. I have frequently \nsaid, for those who don't like the rules, wait until you are here 3 or \n4 years--you will think they are great. Freshmen think we ought to get \nthings done right now; forget the rules and the procedures. But let \nthem stay here a term, and they understand what the Senate rules mean.\n  Understanding all that and feeling as I do about these issues, it \nseems to me we cannot continue to deny a man like Miguel Estrada a seat \nin the judiciary when there is more than a majority of the Senate who, \nafter hours of debate, is willing to have a vote. The other side knows \nthat such a vote has a majority of support so they prevent a vote from \noccurring. You can't keep doing that and expect the majority to sit by \nand say: It is just the current rules, you can't change them; don't \nworry about it. In fact, that is a dangerous proposition.\n  The bell will toll. If this is continued, there will be Members such \nas this Senator who will end up saying: We have had enough. We are \nwilling to abide by the same rules when we are in the minority. It will \napply to both Democrats and Republicans. We know some say we will be in \nthe minority one day. Some of us are willing to say: Let it be the case \nfor both, and let us rule by majority vote with reference to judicial \nappointees.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to offer an historical \nperspective on the very important issue of the Senate exercising its \nadvice and consent responsibilities on judicial nominations. It has \nbeen the subject of considerable discussion, and I wanted to offer some \nthoughts on the subject myself. I have been around here long enough, in \nboth the majority and the minority, to understand that a Senator may \nfrom time to time use a vote on a judicial nomination to protest the \nnomination or a particular course of action. But what we saw in the \n108th Congress was a wholesale departure from the norms and the \ntraditions of the Senate, whereby the use of the judicial filibuster \nbecame a commonplace device to stop the President's circuit court \nnominees.\n  For the first time in history, a minority of Senators, on a repeated, \npartisan, and systematic basis, has prevented the Senate as a whole \nfrom discharging its constitutional obligation to provide advice and \nconsent on judicial nominations.\n  This level of obstructionism is truly unprecedented. As \njustification, those who support this approach have pointed to several \nnominees of President Clinton on whom it was necessary to file cloture. \nI was here during that period. I remember exactly what happened.\n  The fact is it was the Republican leadership in the majority who \nfiled cloture on these very controversial Clinton nominees. This does \nnot show that the Republican Conference was trying to prevent their \nconsideration. Rather, Republicans, who were Members of the opposition \nparty of the President, filed cloture to advance their consideration--\nto advance their consideration.\n  If there is any doubt, one need only look at the cloture votes on two \nof the most controversial Clinton nominees, Marsha Berzon and Richard \nPaez, and then compare those cloture votes with the votes on the \nnominations themselves. Doing so reveals two important points.\n  First, the cloture vote on these nominees was overwhelmingly in favor \nof ending debate--of ending debate--and proceeding to their \nconfirmation. The cloture vote on the Berzon nomination was 86 to 13. \nSo obviously there were 13 Senators trying to prevent Ms. Berzon from \nbecoming a Federal judge. The cloture vote on the Paez nomination was \n85 to 14. Indeed, the vast majority of the Republican Conference--in \nfact, a supermajority of about 70 percent of our conference--voted for \ncloture. These plain facts dispute the notion that the Republican \nConference was filibustering the Berzon and Paez nominations.\n  In short, if I could be a bit poetic, a cloture vote does not a \nfilibuster make. A cloture vote does not a filibuster make.\n  A second point is even more telling. Many of the very same members of \nour conference who voted for cloture on these nominations then turned \naround and voted against confirmation because we had serious concerns \nabout the Paez and Berzon nominations. Senator Lott, who was \nmajority leader at the time, did that, and so did I, voted for cloture, \nbelieving that judges should not be filibustered for the purpose of \nending their nomination--and then voted against the judge on the up-or-\ndown vote to which all judges are entitled. The confirmation vote on \nthe Berzon nomination was 64 to 34. The\n\n[[Page S2304]]\n\nconfirmation vote on the Paez nomination was 59 to 39. Obviously, the \nopponents of Paez could have killed that nominee by a filibuster if \nthey had chosen to do so. Both times we approached the filibuster level \nof 41 votes. I know how to count votes, and if we had wanted to \nfilibuster the Paez and Berzon nominations, I suspect we could have and \nprobably stopped them both. But the Republican leadership did not whip \nour caucus to filibuster these two nominations. In fact, it did the \nopposite. To his great credit, Senator Lott urged our colleagues not to \nfilibuster these two nominations despite the strong opposition to them \nwithin our conference.\n\n  That is why Judge Paez and Judge Berzon have been sitting on the \nninth circuit for the last 5 years. In fact, today is the fifth \nanniversary of their confirmation. They were confirmed on March 9, \n2000. And for those who point to the Paez and Berzon nominations to try \nto justify their filibusters, I emphasize again we are talking about \nJudge Paez and Judge Berzon. So given that many of my Republican \ncolleagues and I opposed both the Berzon and Paez nominations as shown \nby our votes against the nominations themselves, why did we vote for \ncloture? We did so because we were mindful of a longstanding Senate \nnorm and precedent that the Senate does not filibuster judicial \nnominations. That is an unwritten Senate rule. Even if one strongly \ndisagrees with the nomination, the proper course of action under Senate \nnorms and traditions, as they have consistently been understood and \napplied, is not to filibuster the nominee but to vote against him or \nher. That is precisely what a supermajority of my conference and I did \non the Paez and Berzon nominations, who were two of the most \ncontroversial--these were extraordinarily controversial judges that \nPresident Clinton had named to the ninth circuit. My Republican \ncolleagues and I honored Senate tradition. We followed the \nconstitutional directive set forth in article II, section 12, that the \nSenate as an institution as reflected by the will of the majority of \nits Members, render its advice and consent on the President's nominees. \nWe put propriety over partisanship.\n  But that precedent has now been changed. Those norms and traditions \nhave been upset.\n  Therefore, I ask my colleagues to consider the ramifications of \ncontinuing down this path of institutionalizing this use of the \njudicial filibuster as a tool of obstruction. For more than 200 years \nwe have recognized the careful balance our Founding Fathers struck \namong our three branches of Government. Judicial filibusters pose a \ndanger to this constitutionally required separation of powers.\n  I believe it is not too late to turn back. It is in the best \ninterests of both great parties and the Senate itself that we restore \nthe norms, traditions, and precedents of the past 200 years that have \nserved this country so well. It is extraordinarily shortsighted. Our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle will have the White House again \none day, and the shoe will be on the other foot. They will rue the day, \nif this precedent is allowed to prevail, that they set this precedent. \nI think it is time we stood back, took a breath and thought about this \ninstitution and respected its norms and traditions.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/09/senate-section/article/S2304-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE ON TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST THE \n                            PEOPLE OF SPAIN\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, the President of the United States is on \nthe road today. He is taking his case for privatization of Social \nSecurity around the United States. It is an interesting debate. It is a \ngood debate because it gets down to the heart of the question.\n  I joined with some Democratic Senate leadership--Harry Reid, Byron \nDorgan, and several other colleagues--and we went on the road last week \nto New York, Philadelphia, Phoenix, and Las Vegas to talk about this \nissue. We are engaging the American people because we believe it is an \nimportant debate.\n  I think we should start the debate by agreeing on some very basic \npoints, and the first point on which we should agree is that at the end \nof the debate, Social Security will still be there, it will survive, \nand we are all committed to it. Any proposal that comes from anyone of \neither political party that weakens Social Security and lessens the \nlikelihood that it will be there as a safety net for America should be \nsummarily rejected. That is why we on the Democratic side have said we \nwant to sit down with President Bush and the Republican leadership to \nmake Social Security strong, but first we have to take privatization of \nSocial Security off the table because privatization of Social Security, \nas the President is proposing, will weaken Social Security, it will not \nstrengthen it. It takes trillions of dollars out of the Social Security \ntrust fund, a trust fund that has already been raided by politicians \nfor years. It would be devastated by taking out this much money.\n  The President is calling for taking the money out of the Social \nSecurity trust fund that is going to be used to pay off retirees in the \nyears to come.\n  How do they make up for this? The President's White House proposes \ncutting the benefits for retirees as much as 50 percent. So if someone \nis receiving $1,200 today, had the President's plan been in effect from \nthe beginning of Social Security, they would be receiving around $500. \nIt is a dramatic cut the President is talking about. It would push many \nsenior citizens into poverty, not to mention add dramatically to our \nnational debt, a debt which is already too large, will be increased \nthis year by our deficit spending, and a debt which is financed by \nforeign countries. China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan hold America's \nmortgage.\n  President Bush's privatization plan means that mortgages will grow \nsubstantially, from about $8 trillion to at least $15 trillion by the \nPresident's calculations. That means our children, who are supposed to \nbe benefited by this so-called privatization, will not only have to \ngamble their retirement in the stock market, but also face the payment \nof this debt. That is fundamentally unfair.\n  Many people have said: Why don't the Democrats come forward with a \nplan on Social Security? I will tell my colleagues the Democratic plan \nin three words: Social Security first. If any plan to strengthen Social \nSecurity does not guarantee that this safety net and the benefits \npeople can count on for retirement will be there in the years to come, \nit is not a plan we should even consider. Privatization cannot meet \nthat guarantee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on the \nDemocratic side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 6 minutes 50 seconds remaining.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I concur with the remarks of the Senator \nfrom Illinois about Social Security. We have heard a lot of talk on \nthis floor. We have heard a lot of talk on the television shows and all \naround the country in recent weeks about Social Security. We have heard \nabout a supposed crisis in this program, that it will be flat busted or \nbroke, we have heard about the President's view that this social \ninsurance program must be radically restructured, and we have heard \nthat privatizing Social Security is the only way to go.\n  Now we hear that the President is embarking on a 60-stop campaign \ntour in an effort to sell his privatization plan to the American \npeople. The American people are not buying this risky privatization \nscheme.\n  From the day this debate began, I have consistently said that any \nproposal put forward to address Social Security must meet a few basic \nstandards. It has to preserve Social Security's guaranteed benefit. It \nhas to preserve Social Security's protections for workers when they are \ndisabled. It has to protect against benefit reductions, especially for \nwomen, minorities, and others, and it has to protect our budget from \never-growing deficits.\n  This week in the Senate we saw the first bill that purports to reform \nSocial Security, and, unfortunately, that new legislative proposal \nfails my simple test in a few not-so-simple ways. First, preservation \nof the guaranteed benefit has to be our top priority. The bedrock of \nSocial Security is the guaranteed benefit, and the President's plan \ncalls for cutting benefits by one-third or more. That is a huge hit to \nevery retiree who depends on this system. Like Bush's plan, the new \nSenate bill will also slash benefits. That plan has a further 7 percent \nreduction in benefits for early retirees relative to current law that \nis phased in between 2024 and 2028.\n\n  In conjunction with the two pieces of the plan that raise the \nretirement age, the proposal would reduce benefits for retirees--people \nwho are retiring at 62--by 40 percent by the year 2026, by 50 percent \nby the year 2054, and it will reduce them by 56 percent by the year\n\n[[Page S2306]]\n\n2080. The deconstruction of the guaranteed benefit leads us further \naway from the real security this program provides, and this country \nneeds to know that even though Republicans do not like to campaign on \nit, their plans would end the guaranteed benefit Social Security \nprovides today.\n  A few weeks ago, I joined several of my female colleagues on the \nSenate floor to speak about how the President's plan would impact \nwomen. Unfortunately, this is not a new battle. For years, we have \nfought to ensure that women and minorities receive a fair shake in \nSocial Security reform discussions. The promise of Social Security is \nespecially important to women. Why? Because women face unique \nchallenges when they retire. We know women make less money throughout \ntheir lifetimes, so we know when they retire they have fewer dollars to \nlive on. Women also leave the workforce to raise their families. That \nis a value that we all support and endorse and want women to be able to \ndo, but that means they have less money when they retire. Finally, \nwomen live longer. That is a fact. And they are more likely to suffer \nfrom a chronic health condition. So they, in particular, rely on the \nsecurity of Social Security. With those special challenges women face, \nwe know today Social Security keeps a lot of older women out of \npoverty. The benefit formulas of Social Security are tilted to give a \ngreater rate of return for lower wage workers such as women and \nminorities.\n  Unfortunately, time and time again, we have found that these \nproposals will impoverish women and slash their benefits. The new plan \nthat has been offered in the Senate is no exception. That plan will cut \nbenefits based on a new life-expectancy requirement. The Senate \nRepublican plan says:\n\n       By factoring increased life expectancy into the base \n     benefit calculation, the rate of increase in benefit payments \n     will be slowed.\n\n  Addressing the long-term solvency of Social Security is a laudable \ngoal, but trying to balance the books by slashing benefits for women is \nabsolutely unacceptable. This plan would dismantle the progressive \nnature of Social Security benefits, leaving women with less money over \na longer period of time. So if one is a woman who retires at 62 or 65 \nand lives to be 95, under these plans they will not be able to make it. \nTheir Social Security benefits will be reduced, and they will not be \nable to live off what they retired on 30 years prior to that.\n  It makes no sense to reduce women's benefits. They are already \nlimited by their lower income, and cutting them again simply because \nthey live longer is just wrong. In fact, we should be doing all we can \nto ensure progressive benefits for low wage earners that are targeted \nto those least likely to have other retirement savings. All too often, \nas we know, that means women.\n\n  I know I am not going to stand for this attack on women, and I know \nmany of my colleagues are going to stand right alongside me in this \nfight.\n  Finally, there is another important issue I will talk about today \nthat no one on the other side of the aisle or the other side of \nPennsylvania Avenue cares to talk about, and that is these Social \nSecurity plans will add trillions of dollars to an already massive \nFederal debt, a debt that we are just handing over to the generation \ncoming behind us.\n  In traveling the country to sell his privatization plan, President \nBush has been saying we have an obligation and a duty to confront \nproblems and not pass them on to future generations. Well, many of us \non both sides of the aisle agree with him. We should not create new \nproblems for the next generation to handle. The trouble is, the \nPresident's plan actually adds to the problems of the next generation. \nIt does nothing to solve them.\n  This new Republican plan, just like President Bush's, would add \ntrillions of dollars in debt to our country's financial sheets in the \nnext two decades alone. In fact, the Center on Budget and Policy \nPriorities said that the privatization proposal will create nearly $5 \ntrillion in new debt over the next 20 years. That money is going to \nhave to come from somewhere, and it is naive to think that huge new \nborrowing will not affect current retirees. It is also naive to think \nthat massive new borrowing will not affect programs such as Medicare \nand Medicaid that really do need our attention. It is naive to think we \nwill simply go along and pass on these massive new problems to our \nchildren and our grandchildren.\n  So once again we are left to consider privatization plans that run up \nmassive new debt on the country's credit card while pulling money away \nfrom the Social Security system and ending the bedrock of the program--\nthe guaranteed benefit. That is a recipe for disaster.\n  The President and his friends in the Senate are fixated on private \naccounts, even though they will do absolutely nothing to address the \nlong-term solvency of the Social Security program.\n  Last week, I joined with 41 of my colleagues to ask President Bush to \ntake this risky scheme off the table before moving forward with any \nSocial Security reform. The letter said, in part, funding privatized \naccounts with Social Security dollars would not only make the program's \nlong-term problems worse, but many believe it represents a first step \ntowards undermining the program's fundamental goals. Therefore, so long \nas this proposal is on the table, we believe it will be impossible to \nestablish the kind of cooperative bipartisan process we need to truly \naddress the challenges facing the program many decades in the future.\n  We will not stand for the President's plan for social insecurity. We \nwill continue to stand for future generations against a private \nsolution that simply adds trillions of dollars in debt to future \ngenerations. We want to be proud of what we pass along to our children \nand grandchildren.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order there will be 10 \nminutes of debate equally divided on each of the following amendments: \namendment No. 110, Amendment No. 66, amendment No. 62, and amendment \nNo. 67.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if you will please notify me when I have 1 \nminute remaining of my 5 minutes allocated, I would appreciate it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will so notify the Senator.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The argument behind this bankruptcy reform bill is it is \nnot going to affect people in lower income categories. Senators on the \nother side of the aisle have come to the floor and said: Don't worry \nabout this bill. Yes, it is stricter, you have to file more documents, \nit will cost more in legal fees, but if your income is lower than the \nmedian income and you file for bankruptcy, it does not affect you. You \nare exempt from it.\n  Senator after Senator has come to the floor and said that. I even \nasked Senator Sessions of Alabama on the floor yesterday: Is that your \nunderstanding, that if you are below median income you do not have to \nfile all the papers for the means test? You don't have to go through \nsome of the most harsh provisions of the bankruptcy bill? And he said \nyes, that was his understanding.\n  My amendment is very simple. It clarifies what has been said over and \nover again, that the means test does not apply to debtors who go into \nbankruptcy court whose incomes fall below the median level. It adds \nonly two sentences to the bill. It makes it clear that those lower \nincome debtors only have to show the court, first, the documentation \nalready required under chapter 7, and then their monthly income. Once \nthey show the monthly income, if it is below the median income in that \narea, they are exempt from the means test. That is all my amendment \nsays.\n  Frankly, if colleagues on the other side of the aisle will not accept \nthis amendment, I have to wonder whether they really believe this bill \nexempts lower income people. If it does not, it means everybody walking \ninto bankruptcy court, not just those who can repay but many who have \nmuch lower salaries and incomes and cannot, is going to have to go \nthrough all of the procedural hooks and ladders set up by this S. 256. \nI don't think that is reasonable. It certainly is not the way this bill \nhas been explained for the last 2 weeks. It is important that we read \nand recount what Senator Hatch said on February 28:\n\n       Let me tell you at the outset, the poor are not affected by \n     the means test. The legislation provides a safe harbor for \n     those who fall below median income.\n\n  The Republican leader came to the floor, and here is what he said:\n\n       This bankruptcy reform act exempts anyone who earns less \n     than the median income in their State.\n\n  Those are the words of Senator Frist.\n  Senator Sessions:\n\n       I remind all of my colleagues that people who are \n     economically distressed and have incomes below the median \n     income already will be exempt from the means test.\n\n  If this is true, and I hope it is, there is no reason this amendment \nshould not pass overwhelmingly, in fact by a voice vote. But if those \nwho drew up this bill really want to put everybody through these means \ntests regardless of their income, even those in the lowest income \ncategories, that is another story altogether.\n  We know that half the people who go to bankruptcy court today are \nthere because of medical bills. They are people who ended up with a \nmountain of debt because of an illness in their family. Do you know \nwhat else? Three-fourths of those people filing for bankruptcy because \nof medical bills had health insurance. They thought they had protected \nthemselves and their families. They didn't have enough health insurance \nor they lost their job after the diagnosis. It happens.\n\n  What we are saying is if you are in one of those terrible situations \nwhere things have gone terribly wrong for your family and you are \nfacing bankruptcy and you are in a low-income category, for goodness' \nsakes, why would we heap more procedural requirements, more cost, more \npaperwork, more demands on the poorest among us?\n  This amendment says what three Republican Senators have said on the \nfloor word for word: If you are below the median income, you do not \nhave to fill out the papers for the means test. I hope my colleagues, \nthose who came to the floor and said this over and over again, agree to \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you for notifying me of that.\n  We are going to have several amendments this morning. Each one of \nthese amendments tries to clarify this bill. This bill is being driven \nby the credit card and banking industry, you know, the same people who \nfill your mailbox with credit card applications you never asked for, \nthe same people who show up at the Big Ten football game trying to \npeddle their credit cards to students--the same people are pushing this \nbill. They want folks to get deep in debt and if they file for \nbankruptcy never get out from under the debt--keep paying it for a \nlifetime: a literal debtors' prison.\n  If we truly want to exempt the lowest income Americans from the worst \nprovisions and toughest provisions of this bill, I encourage all of my \ncolleagues to support amendment No. 110.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 66\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 66 on behalf of \nmyself, Senators Rockefeller, Leahy, Dayton, and Kennedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The amendment is pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I understand under the rule I have 5 minutes; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this is a straightforward amendment that \nprotects the ability of workers to receive their pay, including \nvacation and sick pay and severance pay, when their company goes \nbankrupt. Under bankruptcy law, wages owed have long been\n\n[[Page S2308]]\n\ngiven an extremely high priority, as they should be. This bill raises \nthe cap on how much pay can be received as a high priority to $10,000. \nUnfortunately, however, the bill puts a time limit on this of 180 days. \nIn other words, under the bill a worker gets this preference, gets \nfirst-in-line priority preference for getting backpay and wages but \nonly for the last 180 days prior to the company filing for bankruptcy. \nMy amendment simply strikes the 180-day limitation. It doesn't touch \nthe $10,000 limit.\n  Why is this important? Many courts have ruled that severance pay is \nearned during the entire time a worker works for a company. If a \nworker, let's say, has worked for a company for 10 years and under the \ncontractual agreement gets $500 per year severance pay for every year \none worker worked for the company, if this worker has worked for the \ncompany for 10 years, this worker is due $5,000 in severance pay. The \ncompany goes bankrupt. He gets first in line, he gets his priority, but \nhe can only get it for the last 180 days. So, instead of $5,000, he or \nshe only gets $250. That is grossly unfair.\n  We faced a similar problem with vacation pay. Again, vacation pay has \nbeen held to accrue over a certain time period, usually 1 year. So a 1-\nyear time period is when you accrue vacation pay. Let's say, though, \nthat your company goes bankrupt. Let's say you have earned vacation pay \nfor the whole year. Now you only get 180 days' credit, so you are \ngetting about half of what you normally would get.\n  Last, we have the issue of when does the 180-day clock start ticking. \nA lot of times, a company will file for bankruptcy long after it has \nclosed a division here or a division there or closed an operation \nsomeplace and they have laid off people. This happens a lot.\n  Let's say you have worked for a division in Louisiana, and the \ncompany, a national company, closed operations in that plant and they \njust laid you off. They have not gone bankrupt yet; they laid you off. \nThen 181 days later or 190 days or 200 days later the company files for \nbankruptcy, OK? Now that worker who worked in that division wants to \nget priority for back wages. I am sorry, you are out of luck. Why? \nBecause you only get 180 days going back. You may have been laid off, \nbut the company did not go bankrupt, so now you only get to go back 180 \ndays, and they lose their priority. This, again, is grossly unfair.\n  Are there other examples where there is no time period for the \ncollection or for getting into priority preference? I would just \nmention two. There is a priority for creditors of grain storage \nfacilities. Let's say a farmer has grain in a storage facility. We are \nfamiliar with that in Iowa. This has happened many times in the past. \nLet's say the storage facility goes bankrupt. The farmer gets first-in-\nline priority to get his pay for the grain stored in that facility. \nThere is no time limit. It could be 2 years, 3 years; there is no time \nlimit whatsoever. But under this bill, for workers, there is a 180-day \ntime limit.\n  For the child support and alimony priority--we have heard a lot of \ndiscussion about that--there is no cap and there is no time limit. For \nfarmers on grain elevators there is a cap, but there is no time limit. \nFor child support and alimony there is neither a cap nor a back-time \nlimit.\n  This amendment is very simple. It just says, if you are a worker, if \nyour company goes bankrupt--we leave the $10,000 cap. That is fair. \nThat has been raised from $5,000 to $10,000. It was $5,000 under the \nold bill. But it does away with the 180-day time limit. It just takes \noff that time limit and lets workers get in the priority queue to get \nseverance pay, vacation pay, sick pay--their back wages--when and if \nthe company goes bankrupt.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, if there is no one here seeking to speak \non the bill, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to proceed as in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Congratulating Governor Schwarzenegger\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate the Governor of \nCalifornia, Governor Schwarzenegger, who just the other day, the day \nbefore yesterday, announced his support for a California initiative to \nget junk food out of our schools. I refer here to a newsclip that came \nout on Monday. I will read from it.\n\n       Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, a longtime advocate of \n     healthier food in schools, said Sunday that all ``junk food'' \n     in vending machines on California campuses should be replaced \n     with nutritious snacks such as fresh vegetables. ``I think we \n     should use our vending machines in the schools--fill them \n     with good food, with fresh vegetables, with milk and products \n     that are really healthy for the body,'' said Schwarzenegger, \n     speaking at the annual fitness exhibition here that bears his \n     name.''\n\n  I say: Bravo Governor Schwarzenegger. Thank you. Thank you for taking \nthe lead on this issue. I hope other Governors will follow suit and \nfollow his leadership.\n  I have been concerned about our kids' eating habits for many years \nnow. In the 1996 farm bill, I tried to get vending machines taken out \nof schools. That didn't quite happen, of course. But we are still \nmaking the effort to try to get fresh fruits and vegetables to kids in \nschool for healthier eating. More and more, we see schools making \nagreements with soft drink companies for exclusive contracts. You walk \ndown the hallways in schools: Coke, Pepsi, this and that, all over the \nplace. Kids are bombarded with this. The fact is, these kids in school \nare creating for themselves bad habits which, when they go into \nadulthood, lead to chronic diseases. So we have to start with our kids \nand start in the schools where vending machines and other sources of \njunk food have a profoundly negative impact on students' nutrition.\n  A recent study took a group of students who ate only USDA-approved \nschool lunches up through the fourth grade. Then they tracked them into \nthe fifth grade, where they gained access to school vending machines, \nsnack bars, and other food sources. Up to the fourth grade they had \nonly USDA-approved school lunches. In the fifth grade they got to go to \nvending machines and stuff like that. Guess what the study found. As \nfifth graders, they consumed 33 percent less fruit, 42 percent fewer \nvegetables, 35 percent less milk than they did as fourth graders. In \naddition, they ate 68 percent more deep-fried vegetables--French \nfries--and drank 62 percent more soft drinks and other sugary \nbeverages. In 1 year, from fourth to fifth grade.\n  Our Nation spends a whopping $1.8 trillion on health care, and 75 \npercent of that goes to treat chronic diseases. A large share of that \nis preventable. If we are going to turn this situation around, if we \nare going to move from a current sick care system to a genuine health \ncare system and emphasize prevention and wellness, then our schools are \non the front line, and that is why what Governor Schwarzenegger did is \nso vitally important. Kids today face a minefield of nutritional risks \nfrom the time they get up in the morning to the time they go to sleep \nat night, opportunity after opportunity to eat unhealthy foods.\n  Guess what. They are bombarded with ads all day long. Whether it is \non television, signs in their schools, they are bombarded with ads to \neat junk food, drink sugary beverages.\n  When was the last time you saw an ad for an apple? When was the last \ntime you saw an ad to eat fresh vegetables? No. You see ads to eat all \nkinds of junk food every single day. That is what our kids see.\n  Ninety-three percent of our teenagers exceed Government guidelines \nfor consumption of saturated fat. One-quarter of our kids show 5 to 10 \nearly warning signs of heart disease.\n  This is from the CDC. I am not making this up.\n  One-third of today's children will go on to develop diabetes.\n  This is from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n  Fifteen percent of America's children and teenagers are overweight. \nThat is 3 times what it was 35 years ago. It is higher than any other \nindustrialized country in the world.\n  We are placing our kids at risk in schools. They are inundated by \ncandy, soft drinks, snacks high in sugar, salt, and fat. And to make \nmatters even worse, physical education is being squeezed out of \nschools.\n  I saw a recent figure that on average in the United States, grade \nschool kids get less than 1 hour of physical activity in school. We are \nsqueezing physical activities out of school. If they are on the \nfootball team or the basketball team, or some other varsity, they are \nall right. But if they are not up to that\n\n[[Page S2309]]\n\nstandard, what physical activity is there for a kid in school today?\n  Lastly, I have worked on a bipartisan basis with members on the \nSenate Agriculture Committee and the Appropriations Committee to \nincrease physical activities in school and get funding for fresh fruits \nand vegetables. We started this in the farm bill. It has been a great \nsuccess, giving free fresh fruits and vegetables to kids. We found that \nwhen you give free fresh fruits and vegetables to kids in school, they \neat them, it solves the hunger pain, and they study better. Guess what. \nThey are not putting their money in the vending machines to buy junk \nfood.\n  We have had 3 years of experience. We took four States and 100 \nschools to test this theory, and every single one of those schools has \nbeen a resounding success. Now we are up to 9 States and over 200 \nschools. It is growing.\n  I again commend Governor Schwarzenegger and hope we can get \nCalifornia to move ahead on that also. The Governor said they were \nintroducing legislation to ban all junk foods in schools. I say, \nCongratulations, Governor Schwarzenegger. Evidently, this is being \nwritten or introduced in California to rid schools of vending machines \nof sodas, bad foods, and stuff such as that. I again want to \ncongratulate the Governor of California.\n  He also spoke on Sunday about the ``broader need for parents to pay \nattention to what children eat''--saying ``they shouldn't feed them \n1,000-calorie cheeseburgers just to avoid an argument.''\n  Good for you, Governor.\n  He said:\n\n       I know it's easy to go in that direction. I know when I \n     come home I don't want to fight at home with my kids about \n     what they should eat. Because there are already fights about \n     their homework and about reading and math.\n       You've got to make an effort. What you give a child or what \n     you put in your body is exactly what we become. So the more \n     garbage you put in there, the more you're going to look like \n     a garbage disposal.\n\n  Again, I want to take the time to commend the Governor for his \nleadership on this issue. He is a great example of physical fitness. He \nis also a great example of endurance and of leadership. I hope the \nGovernor of California will not confine himself on this issue only to \nCalifornia. I hope he will take his message nationwide. I hope the \nother States and other Governors will follow his lead on what he has \ndone in California.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the articles I read from--one that \nappeared in the Associated Press and also the Los Angeles Times--be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Associated Press, March 7, 2005]\n\nCalifornia Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger Says He Wants To Ban Junk Food at \n                                Schools\n\n                           (By Erica Werner)\n\n       Columbus, OH.--California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger wants \n     to pump up his state's students with vegetables, fresh fruits \n     and milk.\n       ``First of all, we in California this year are introducing \n     legislation that would ban all the sale of junk food in the \n     schools,'' Schwarzenegger said during a question-and-answer \n     session with fans on the final day of the Arnold Classic, the \n     annual bodybuilding contest that bears his name. He said junk \n     food would be pulled from school vending machines in favor of \n     healthier foods, including fruits and vegetables.\n       After the session Sunday, the governor's aides said \n     Schwarzenegger supports a bill by Democratic state Sen. \n     Martha Escutia that would ban soft drinks at public schools.\n       The administration also hopes to develop a more \n     comprehensive legislative package dealing with snack foods \n     later in the year, said Chief of Staff Pat Clarey, although \n     she added it might not eliminate all junk food from schools.\n       Topics at the question-and-answer session ranged from \n     fitness to whether Schwarzenegger wants to be president. \n     Several hundred fans at the Columbus Veterans Memorial \n     auditorium were invited to ask the former world bodybuilding \n     champion whatever they wanted.\n       With fellow former Mr. Olympia Franco Columbo at his side, \n     Schwarzenegger spent about 50 minutes answering questions.\n       Many people asked detailed queries about workout routines. \n     Schwarzenegger talked knowledgeably on how best to improve \n     the deltoid muscles--numerous repetitions, tailored to the \n     three separate deltoid muscle groups, front, middle, and \n     back.\n       Schwarzenegger said he still does 30 to 45 minutes of \n     cardio each day and lifts weights about four days a week. He \n     said he misses doing heavy lifting, but doctors banned it \n     after his heart surgery in 1997.\n       At one point, Schwarzenegger delivered what amounted to a \n     motivational lecture after a questioner betrayed some \n     discouragement about his own fitness potential. \n     Schwarzenegger told him to visualize his goal, never lose \n     sight of the vision and work toward it.\n       ``As you know, I'm a big believer in the mind,'' \n     Schwarzenegger said. ``Just be positive, and kick some \n     butt.''\n       At the men's bodybuilding finals the night before, \n     Schwarzenegger had called on bodybuilding to get rid of \n     steroids, which are reportedly rampant in the sport. He got \n     one question on the topic Sunday, from a sixth-grader.\n       The girl asked the governor to explain why he's said \n     publicly he doesn't regret his own past steroid use. \n     Schwarzenegger reiterated that at the time he took the drugs \n     they were new to the market and weren't illegal.\n       People shouldn't take steroids now--``A, they are harmful \n     for the body, and B, they are illegal,'' he said.\n       Schwarzenegger was asked whether he would consider running \n     for president if the Constitution were amended to allow \n     foreign-born citizens to serve in the office. As in the past, \n     he said he's focused on governing California.\n       ``I'm not saying no I'm not interested in it, but I'm not \n     concentrating on it,'' he said.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I commend the Governor of California. I \nsay to him that whatever we can do here on a bipartisan basis to back \nyou up, you have our support and our encouragement. Please take your \nmessage nationwide. Don't just keep it in California.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 62\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I call up my Amendment No. 62.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, is the rule 10 minutes per side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will my friend tell me when I will have 1 minute \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Absolutely.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, in the next 5 minutes I want to describe \nthis amendment. I cannot imagine anyone in the Senate voting against \nthis amendment. Having said that, I predict that this amendment will \nnot be agreed to because there seems to be some type of agreement going \non that this bill can not change at all, in any way, shape, or form. \nBut I want to give the Senate a chance.\n  When I was growing up, my mother said, If you ever borrow anything, \ngive it back. Try not to borrow money, but if you borrow money, give it \nback as fast as you can.\n  I think all of us here understand that to be a responsible person, \nyou have to be responsible for your debts. There is no question about \nthat. It is not right to borrow money and then turn your back on the \nperson who extended that credit to you, whether it is an individual or \na credit card company or a bank. But in this bill there seems to be \nabsolutely no bounds. It seems to be that the person who lent you the \nmoney has no responsibility whatsoever to be diligent about it, to be \nfair about it, to be reasonable about it, or, frankly, to be smart \nabout it. And the credit card companies know they have the perfect bill \ncoming toward them. There is absolutely no responsibility placed on \nthem.\n  I ask anyone listening to this debate to think about how many credit \ncard applications you receive in the mail in a week's time, in a \nmonth's time. Once I started saving it up. Then they started sending \nthem to my grandson. He is 9. I was surprised they didn't send it to \nour cat. I suppose they would, if cats could pay interest.\n  But let me tell you about this particular egregious situation I am \ntrying to fix. I think it would shock Americans to understand this. The \nfastest growing part of the credit card business is the young people in \nthis country. The credit card companies entice\n\n[[Page S2310]]\n\nour young people to go into debt, go into debt, and they know the sky \nis the limit as to what they can charge for that debt. Is it 10 \npercent? No. That would be low. Is it 20 percent? That would be low. \nThere was an amendment here to cap it at 36 percent, and that failed. \nWe are talking about taking a young person who doesn't have a clue and \noffering them credit cards.\n  If I were to ask you how many cards does the average young person \nhave--people between 18 and 24--I would say one or two--the answer is \nsix credit cards. This is the fastest growing group.\n  That is also why the credit card companies go ahead and give more and \nmore credit cards to people who were defaulting the most. Frankly, it \nis because they are still making a mint. Credit card profits have gone \nup in the last 10 years 100 percent.\n  When you analyze the stories--I have read them in the Wall Street \nJournal--you find they are getting paid back for sure, but they are not \ngetting the full 30-percent interest. But the poor people who are \ncaught in this have a real problem.\n  Here is what the amendment says. If a credit card company issues a \nseventh credit card to someone below the age of 21 without a \nresponsible party cosigning, and if that individual has a job that pays \nless than the poverty level, then in fact if there is a default the \njudge should take into consideration the facts. It is as simple as \nthat. Why wouldn't a credit card company ask you that simple question, \nHow many cards do you have? And, What is your income? After all, this \nis unsecured debt. It is not secured by anything but the person.\n\n  We are saying, if, in fact, an individual defaults, they are younger \nthan 21, they had no cosigner, they earn below the poverty line, they \nalready have six cards, if they wind up in bankruptcy court, the judge \nshould consider this situation.\n  This is about responsibility on the part, yes, of the person who is \nusing the card, but also on the part of the credit card companies.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                            AMENDMENT NO. 67\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the \namendment I offered yesterday. It is an amendment designed principally \nto protect children and families caught in the bankruptcy situation.\n  Let me state again at the outset, clearly there is a need to reform \nthe bankruptcy laws--none of us disagree with that--but it must require \na sense of balance. People are moving through the bankruptcy courts, \nbut we also need to keep in mind that families, particularly children, \nthe innocents in this, are not going to be so disadvantaged by the \nprocess that we create a more serious problem than the bankruptcy issue \nsuggests.\n  Under this bill as presently crafted, there are several areas where \nwe could do a far better job of seeing to it that children and families \nare going to be protected to the extent possible, while creditors are \nalso going to have an ability to reach assets. This bill provides too \nstrong a straitjacket for families.\n  I offer four different parts in this amendment. The first modifies \nthe means test to require greater flexibility and reasonableness in \ncalculating a debtor's ability to pay. Under the bill you have $1,500 a \nyear as the total amount allowed for educational expenses for children. \nThe reality of the 21st century, putting aside parochial school \neducation, even for a public school, $1,500 is too low a figure for the \nchildren to get the proper education they need. Our amendment raises \nthat ceiling from $1,500 to $5,000.\n  Second, the amendment ensures that support payments, child support \npayments, alimony, if there are any resources coming from the earned \nincome tax credit or the child tax credit, specifically money intended \nto support children and their needs, should not go to creditors. Those \nmoneys ought to be kept out of the estate. Again, child support, \nalimony, EITC, child tax credits. The bill does not presently allow \nthat. We specifically passed that legislation to assist poor families \nand families with children.\n  Third, the amendment enables debtors going through bankruptcy to keep \npersonal property normally found in and around the home. The bill does \nlist some new items that were not in the earlier versions of the bill. \nThat is a simple reasonableness test. Rather than having a finite list, \nif these goods have no resale value at all, and they are used for \nchildren and used for providing for the needs of the household, they \nought to be excluded. That is the third part of this amendment.\n  Fourth, the amendment ensures that debtors are not forced into \nbankruptcy court to seek to prove that food, diapers, school uniforms, \nand other items are luxury items. Under the present law, the bankruptcy \ncurrent law allows $1,225 to be charged within 60 days of filing \nbankruptcy. This bill drops that number to $500 within 90 days. That is \na totally unrealistic number. Anyone who has young children will tell \nyou $500 over 90 days to provide for your children is far too low. We \ntried to offer a compromise, saying any charges amounting to $1,000 \nwithin 70 days. As I say, existing law is $1,225 within 60 days. The \nbill says $500 within 90 days. Our amendment says $1,000 within 70 \ndays.\n  Lastly, as part of this amendment, if the creditors think these are \nluxury items, let them make the allegation in court. This bill requires \nthese dependent women, most of them single women raising children, have \nto prove these are not luxury items. The burden ought to be on the \nopposite side of the equation.\n  That is what the amendment is designed to do. There are four pieces \nto it. It is specifically designed to offer some relief to the \ninnocents, the children and the families who are going through this \nprocess--not to blame them or put them in an untenable situation.\n  This amendment is supported by a long list of organizations across \nthe country dealing with women and children. I ask unanimous consent \nthat list be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       ACES, Association for Children for Enforcement of Support, \n     Inc., American Association of University Women, American \n     Medical Women's Association, Business and Professional Women/\n     USA, Center for Law and Social Policy, Center for the \n     Advancement of Public Policy, Center for the Child Care \n     Workforce, Children NOW, Children's Defense Fund, Church \n     Women United, Coalition of Labor Union Women (CLUW), Equal \n     Rights Advocates, Feminist Majority, Hadassah, International \n     Women's Insolvency & Restructuring Confederation (``IWIRC''), \n     MANA, A National Latina Organization, National Association \n     for Commissions for Women (NACW), National Black Women's \n     Health Project, National Center for Youth Law, National \n     Council of Jewish Women, National Council of Negro Women, \n     National Organization for Women.\n\n  Mr. DODD. This bill deserves to make some changes. I hope our \ncolleagues look closely at what is in the bill and support this \namendment and see we can provide a sense of balance and relief for \nchildren and families who need some protection when they go through the \nbankruptcy process.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority time is expired and the majority \nhas 5 minutes on each of four amendments.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 62\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, let me talk about the Boxer amendment for a \nminute or two. The purpose of this amendment is to restrict credit \navailability for young adults.\n  Others believe that using credit cards to build a history is a \nlaudable objective for young adults. This amendment does not \ndistinguish between legitimate uses by young adults from other uses. It \napplies to any person under 21, regardless of his or her financial \nindependence or employment situation.\n  Also, note that 18-year-olds can serve in the military, get married, \nvote, and in most States serve on juries, all without a cosigner.\n  This bill does address the issue of credit card debt and younger \nadults. Title XII of the bill provides for a study regarding the impact \nof the extension of credit to individuals who are claimed as dependents \nfor Federal income tax purposes and are in college.\n  The same section provides other relevant credit card-related reforms \nthat are the result of careful negotiation. These include several \namendments to\n\n[[Page S2311]]\n\nthe Truth in Lending Act which includes creating increased disclosure \nrequirements for credit card statements and mandating the credit card \ncompanies assist borrowers in determining how long it will take to pay \noff their credit card balances; requiring certain additional \ndisclosures to borrowers buying and refinancing their homes; require \nadditional disclosures regarding credit card so-called introductory \nrates; extending Truth in Lending requirements to Internet-based credit \ncard solicitations; adding new disclosures related to the credit card \nlate fees; and prohibiting cancellation of credit cards solely due to \nborrowers' failure to incur finance charges.\n  These are good changes, in my view, and the view of the majority of \nthe Senate. They were all carefully negotiated over the last 8 years. \nWe do not need to come in now and make further revision to delicate \ncompromises such as this. I urge my colleagues to vote against the \nBoxer amendment. It would do more harm than any good.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 67\n\n  I wish to speak against Senator Dodd's amendment 67. This is an \nomnibus amendment. There is nothing else to call it. This late in the \ngame, a successful amendment usually targets specific provisions in the \nbill for improvement. And getting agreement on one of these rifleshot \namendments can be like herding cats.\n  Quite frankly, this is a message statement. It asks us to protect \nfamilies. This is a noble goal, but it is not one served by this \namendment. This amendment alters the carefully negotiated means test to \npermit nearly all filers to avoid a presumption of abuse. In some \nrespects, it is redundant.\n  For example, it lists as expenses many things that are already \ncovered in the IRS standards used in the bill to determine appropriate \nexpenses. In other areas, it is excessive. For example, it increases \nthe allowable expenditures for private school education from $1,500 to \n$5,000.\n\n  The worst part of this is it created a category of miscellaneous \nexpenses. This is not just a loophole. My gosh, you could drive a truck \nthrough the opening for abuse this amendment puts through the middle of \nthe means test, a test that has the purpose of a reduction in abusive \nbankruptcy filings.\n  I said it once, and I say it again. This means test is the heart of \nthis bill. The means test is fair. The means test has been carefully \nnegotiated between Democrats and Republicans over 8 years of time. I \nhave to oppose any effort to revise the means test at this late day. I \nurge my colleagues to vote against this amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 110\n\n  I rise in opposition also to the Durbin amendment. It takes a broad \nswipe at the means test again. First, the very purpose of the means \ntest is to treat genuinely impoverished filers fairly. If you are below \nthe State median income, you are not subject to the means test. It is \nas simple as that. This amendment undermines the ability of a court to \nverify a person's income when he or she is filing for bankruptcy.\n  This amendment would remove the basic requirement that debtors fill \nout certain forms to verify their income. You have to fill out forms to \nget a driver's license, to get a job, to apply for a retirement plan. \nFor example, when an individual applies for food stamps, there is a \ncomplete application process to verify income and assets before this \nbenefit is approved. Is it too much to ask that if the Government is \ngoing to allow you to liquidate all of your debts, you at least show \nthe court definitive proof of your income?\n  Instead, this amendment allows a person simply to declare that his \nincome is below the State median income. All he has to show are \n``calculations or other information.'' In other words, take their word \nfor it. That seems to open the door to the fraud this bill is designed \nto prevent.\n  I believe most people are honest, but inevitably there are some \napplicants who will take advantage of the looser requirement. As Ronald \nReagan said in a different context: Trust but verify.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the Durbin amendment, as well.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 66\n\n  I oppose the Harkin amendment. This was part of a problematic \nRockefeller amendment we have already voted down. I respect my \ncolleagues' dedication to the issue, but I must urge my colleagues to \nvote no.\n  I am pleased we invoked cloture yesterday by a vote of 69-31. If that \nis not bipartisan, I do not know what is. This bill has been in the \nworks for 8 years now, and I hope we can soon pass it for the fifth and \nfinal time. My colleague from Wisconsin has 14 amendments pending. I \nalso understand there are roughly another six or so Kennedy amendments \nand two Durbin amendments. That is 22 amendments between these \nSenators.\n  I wonder if my colleagues know how many other amendments are pending. \nThe answer is three: one from the ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, one from Senator Akaka, and one from Senator Talent. What \ndoes this tell you?\n  I respect my colleagues from Wisconsin, Massachusetts, and Illinois, \nbut why are they dragging out this process? Their amendments constitute \nroughly 88 percent of the remaining omnibus bill. I suspect that even \nif we accepted every one of the amendments, all three would not vote \nfor this legislation. So this is important. I respect the right of \nSenators to bring up their germane amendments in postcloture \nsituations. If they want to do it that way, they certainly can.\n\n  I oppose every one of those amendments. I think a majority of the \nSenators should oppose those, as well. We need to get this bill done. \nWe know we have to keep it intact in order to get the House to take it \nand get it signed by the President. It is time to bring this to an end. \nWe have been at it for 8 years and we have worked to accommodate \neveryone we possibly could. It has been a bipartisan vote every time, \noverwhelming bipartisan vote every time. By gosh, it is time to vote on \nthis bill.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 13 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Is that my time? I am prepared to yield back the remainder \nof my time and proceed to a vote.\n  Do we have the yeas and nays on all four amendments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We do not.\n  Mr. HATCH.

Mr. President, this amendment basically protects workers \nwho are able to take a priority preference in back wages, vacation pay, \nseverance pay, and sick pay when a company goes bankrupt.\n  Under the bill, there is a limit of $10,000. That is fine; I do not \ntouch that. This amendment lifts the 180 days. For example, let's say a \nworker has worked for a company for 10 years and they get $500 a year \nseverance pay. The company goes bankrupt. Normally, you get $5,000, but \nbecause of the 180 days, you only get $250 for which you get a \npriority; otherwise, you get in line with the other creditors.\n  What this does is lift the 180 days. There are other examples. If a \nfarmer today has a warehouse receipt for grain in an elevator, there is \nno time limit on that. They can go 2, 3, 4 years. For alimony there is \nno time limit. For child support, there is no time limit. There ought \nnot be an arbitrary time limit for a worker who has backpay, sick pay, \nor severance pay coming. That is all this amendment does.\n  I cannot believe the House will not send this to the President if we \nadopt this amendment. Do not even try to sell that to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided on the Boxer amendment, No. 62.\n  Will the Chamber please be in order.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Here are the facts, my colleagues. The fastest growing \nsegment of bankruptcies occurs in Americans who are 25 years and \nyounger. The average number of credit cards a college senior has is not \ntwo, three, or four, but six. The average senior in college has six \ncredit cards and credit card companies are marketing to our young \npeople at rock concerts, on college campuses. We want responsibility \nbut on all sides.\n  My amendment puts a modicum of responsibility on the credit card \ncompanies. It simply says a bankruptcy judge should consider an \nappropriate response if a credit card company has given a card to a \nperson who is under the age of 21, has no responsible cosigner, an \nincome below the poverty level, and the person already had six credit \ncards.\n  My friends, I hope you will not march down and vote ``no'' against \nthis amendment. How can you explain at home that a credit card company \nwould have no responsibility if they have given a seventh credit card \nto a person below the age of 21 who has income below the poverty level? \nI hope you will support the Boxer amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 105\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, I rise today to speak on my pending \namendment, No. 105.\n  Section 106 of the bill does not allow consumers to declare personal \nbankruptcy in either Chapter 7 or Chapter 13, unless they receive a \nbriefing from an approved nonprofit credit counseling agency within six \nmonths of filing. The bill also requires each consumer who receives \nbankruptcy protection to take a credit counseling instructional course. \nThe credit counseling instructional course requirement is intended to \nprovide financial education to consumers who declare bankruptcy so they \ncan attempt to avoid future financial problems.\n  Approximately one-third of all credit counseling consumers enter a \ndebt management plan. In exchange, creditors can agree to offer \nconcessions to consumers to pay off as many of their debts as possible. \nThese concessions can include a reduced interest rate on the amount \nthey owe and the elimination of fees. However, most credit card \ncompanies have become increasingly unwilling to significantly reduce \ninterest rates for consumers in credit counseling. A study by the \nNational Consumer Law Center and the Consumer Federation of America \nrevealed that 5 of 13 credit card issuers increased the interest rates \nthey offered to consumers in credit counseling between 1999 and 2003.\n  The amendment would amend section 502(b) of the bankruptcy code to \nprevent unsecured creditors, primarily credit card issuers, from \nattempting to collect accruing interest and additional fees from \nconsumers in credit\n\n[[Page S2313]]\n\ncounseling if the creditor does not have a policy of waiving interest \nand fees for debtors who enter a consolidated payment plan at a credit \ncounseling agency.\n  Since it appears that Congress will require that consumers enter \ncredit counseling before filing for bankruptcy, we must ensure that \ncredit counseling is truly effective and a viable alternative to \nbankruptcy.\n  Credit card issuers, undermining the good intentions of consumers who \nenter into credit counseling, have sharply curtailed the concessions \nthey offer to consumers in credit counseling, contributing to increased \nbankruptcy filings. According to a survey by VISA USA, 33 percent of \nconsumers who failed to complete a debt management plan in credit \ncounseling said they would have stayed on the plan if creditors had \nlowered interest rates or waived fees.\n  A large body of research, conducted by such entities as the \nCongressional Budget Office and the Federal Deposit Insurance \nCorporation, shows that aggressive lending practices by credit card \nissuers have contributed to the current high level of bankruptcies in \nthis country. Credit card companies have an obligation to ensure that \neffective alternatives are readily available to the consumers they \naggressively pursue.\n  As a show of support for the effectiveness of consumer credit \ncounseling, especially as an alternative to bankruptcy, credit card \nissuers should waive the amount owed in interest and fees for consumers \nwho enter a consolidated payment plan. Successful completion of a debt \nmanagement plan benefits both creditors and consumers. For many \nconsumers paying off their debt is not easy. My amendment will help \npeople who are struggling to repay their obligations. I encourage all \nof my colleagues to support this amendment to help consumers enrolled \nin debt management plans to successfully repay their credits, free \nthemselves from debt, and avoid bankruptcy.\n  My amendment has been endorsed by the Consumer Federation of America, \nU.S. Public Interest Research Group, Consumer Action, and the National \nConsumer Law Center.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support for my amendment be \nincluded in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                  Consumers Union,\n\n\n                               Consumer Federation of America,\n\n                                                    March 7, 2005.\n     Re support for Akaka credit counseling and payday loan \n         amendments to bankruptcy bill.\n\n     Hon. Daniel K. Akaka,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: The undersigned national consumer \n     organizations strongly support your amendments to the \n     bankruptcy bill (S. 256) that would encourage more \n     responsible lending by payday loan companies and keep more \n     consumers in credit counseling and out of bankruptcy.\n\n\n  making credit counseling a more successful alternative to bankruptcy\n\n       S. 256 requires consumers to seek credit counseling within \n     six months of filing for bankruptcy. However, the credit card \n     companies that created credit counseling have taken steps in \n     recent years that undermine it as a viable alternative to \n     bankruptcy for some consumers. By slashing funding for \n     legitimate credit counseling agencies and charging consumers \n     in credit counseling higher interest rates than in the past, \n     credit card companies are leaving debt choked Americans with \n     few options other than bankruptcy.\n       If Congress is going to require that consumers enter credit \n     counseling before filing for bankruptcy, it must ensure that \n     credit counseling is truly an effective and viable \n     alternative to bankruptcy. This amendment would stop a credit \n     card company from attempting to collect on debts in \n     bankruptcy unless the creditor has a policy of waiving \n     interest rates for consumers who enter credit counseling.\n       Consumers who enter a credit counseling ``debt management \n     plan'' agree to discontinue credit card use and to make one \n     consolidated payment to the credit counseling agency, which \n     then forwards the funds to the appropriate credit card \n     company. In exchange, creditors agree to offer two key \n     ``concessions'' to help consumers pay off as much of their \n     debts as possible: a reduced interest rate on the amount they \n     owe and the elimination of fees that have accrued.\n       Unfortunately, credit card companies in recent years have \n     become increasingly unwilling to reduce interest rates for \n     consumers in credit counseling, which has led to more \n     bankruptcy filings. According to a study by the National \n     Consumer Law Center and Consumer Federation of America, five \n     of 13 major credit card issuers increased the interest rates \n     they offered to consumers in credit counseling between 1999 \n     and 2003. Currently, only two major credit card issuers \n     (Wells Fargo and American Express) completely waive all \n     interest for consumers in credit counseling. The majority of \n     other major credit card companies charge interest rates in \n     credit counseling above 9 percent, with issuers like Capital \n     One, General Electric and Discover charging rates of 15 \n     percent or more.\n       The increasing refusal of creditors to offer low interest \n     rates causes more consumers to drop out of credit counseling \n     and to declare bankruptcy. According to a survey by VISA USA, \n     one-third of consumers who failed to complete a debt \n     management plan in credit counseling said they would have \n     stayed on the plan if creditors had further lowered interest \n     rates or waived fees. Moreover, almost half of those who \n     dropped off the plan had or were going to declare bankruptcy.\n       It is ironic that the same creditors whose aggressive and \n     reckless lending practices have contributed to the increase \n     in bankruptcies in this country have weakened credit \n     counseling in recent years. It is hypocritical for the credit \n     card industry to demand that Congress give them bankruptcy \n     relief while closing off credit counseling as an effective \n     alternative for many consumers.\n\n\n           prohibiting the recovery of predatory payday loans\n\n       This amendment would prohibit payday lenders from having a \n     claim on these loans in bankruptcy. Lenders who entice cash-\n     strapped consumers to write checks without money in the bank \n     to cover them as the basis for making ``payday loans'' should \n     not be allowed to use the bankruptcy courts to collect. \n     Payday loans trap borrowers in a cycle of debt when consumers \n     flip loans to keep their checks from bouncing.\n       Last year, consumers paid $6 billion to borrow $40 billion \n     in small cash advances from over 22,000 payday loan outlets. \n     These loans of $100 up to $1,000 are secured by personal \n     checks or electronic access to bank accounts and must be \n     repaid in full on the borrower's next payday. Lenders charge \n     annual interest rates on these loans that begin at 390 \n     percent, with finance charges of $15 to $30 per $100 \n     borrowed.\n       Payday lending condones check-kiting as a financial \n     management tool and encourages the unsafe use of bank \n     accounts. Loans phased on check/debit-holding get paid before \n     other obligations, due to the severe adverse consequences of \n     failing to make good on a check. Some lenders threaten \n     criminal prosecution or court martial of military consumers \n     for failure to make good on the check used to get a payday \n     loan. If the consumer files bankruptcy to stop the cycle of \n     debt, some lenders then try to convince the bankruptcy court \n     that the payday loans should not be discharged.\n       Consumers need comprehensive small loan protections, \n     reasonably-priced alternatives to payday loans, and sound \n     financial education. In the meantime, Congress should prevent \n     any lender that entices consumers to write checks without \n     funds on deposit or to sign away electronic access to their \n     bank accounts from also using the bankruptcy courts to \n     collect on their usurious loans.\n       If this nation is truly going to reduce bankruptcies, \n     lenders must first exercise more responsible lending \n     decisions and be more responsive to consumers who show a \n     genuine interest in resolving their debt problems. We applaud \n     you for moving to make payday and credit card lenders more \n     accountable in their treatment of consumers.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jean Ann Fox,\n       Director of Consumer Protection, Consumer Federation of \n     America.\n     Travis B. Plunkett,\n        Legislative Director, Consumer Federation of America.\n     Susanna Montezemolo,\n       Policy Analyst, Consumers Union.\n     Linda Sherry\n       Editorial Director, Consumer Action.\n     Edmund Mierzwinski,\n       Consumer Program Director, U.S. Public Interest Research \n     Group.\n     John Rao,\n       Staff Attorney, National Consumer Law Center.\n  Mr. AKAKA.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would like to have the attention of \nthe Senate to discuss my remaining amendments to the bankruptcy bill. I \nthink my colleagues are aware that I strongly oppose this bill and that \nI am\n\n[[Page S2314]]\n\nvery disappointed in the process that has brought us to this point. I \ndo not believe the sponsors of this bill and its supporters in the \nother body have dealt fairly with the proposed amendments.\n  I understand the Senator from Utah came to the floor earlier in the \nday and was complaining that I had a number of amendments and that I \ndid not intend to vote for the bill.\n  I have been a legislator for 22 years. This is not an auction. Even \nif you are going to vote against a bill, if you have an amendment you \nbelieve will make it a better bill, it is still a worthy consideration. \nI was told in the committee, where I wanted to offer many of these \namendments, that I should not offer them, that I should wait until the \nbill came to the floor to offer the amendments. So in most cases that \nis exactly what I did, being assured there would be a good faith \nresponse and consideration of the amendments. Well, of course, that is \nnot what has happened to date. And I categorically reject the idea that \nsimply because you do not think a bill is good, you do not have a \nproper role on the floor of the Senate in trying to improve it.\n  This has not been a legislative process worthy of the Senate. Members \nof the Judiciary Committee, as I just said, were implored to save their \namendments for the floor. Then, when we got here, we were told no \namendments could be accepted. It was a classic bait and switch. \nNegotiations have been minimal and pro forma. Extremely reasonable \namendments were rejected supposedly because they were not drafted \ncorrectly, according to the sponsors, but there was no willingness to \nwork on the language of the amendments so they could become acceptable.\n  One of the most disheartening examples of this way of dealing with \ngood faith amendments was the treatment of the amendment offered by the \nSenator from Florida concerning identity theft. Senator Nelson simply \nwanted to give some special consideration to people who are forced into \nbankruptcy because other people--criminals, in fact--ran up debts in \ntheir names. It is awfully hard to argue with a straight face and \npretty hard to claim that victims of identity theft should have to pay \nat least some of their debts if they have a higher than median income. \nThe debts are not even theirs. Believe it or not, this bill might \nactually force someone to file for chapter 13 and make payments on \ndebts for 5 years that were not even run up by the person filing for \nbankruptcy. I find this to be incredible. Unfortunately, the response \nfrom one of the bill's cosponsors was: ``well, you have a good point \nhere, but your amendment is just too broad.''\n  In the Senate I have come to love in my 12 years here, the Senate I \nserved in just a few years ago when we last considered the bankruptcy \nbill, Senators and their staffs would have sat down and they would have \nworked out language that was not too broad. There would have been some \nnegotiation. In many cases an agreement would be reached. But in this \ndebate that kind of legislating is apparently forbidden.\n  What is most disheartening is that so many Senators sent here to \nrepresent their constituents, to exercise their independent judgment \nfor the good of their States and the country, have been willing to \nblindly follow instructions from the shadowy coalition of groups that \nare behind this bill--mainly the credit card industry--and vote down \neven the most reasonable of amendments. It is just sad when there is no \ndebate on amendments, no discussion, no negotiation, just an edict from \noutside of the Senate, and the ``no'' votes follow every time.\n  Last night I offered a very important amendment concerning small \nbusinesses. I spoke for 10 or 15 minutes about the amendment and \nexplained some new data on small business bankruptcies that I think \nshows these provisions are actually very wrongheaded. After what has \ngone on here, I, of course, didn't expect to win the amendment, but I \ndid think we might have a debate of sorts. The sponsors of the bill \ndidn't even bother to come down and debate. Not one Senator made a \nsingle response to my arguments. They sent an emissary to deliver the \nmessage right before the vote that the sponsors expected a ``no'' vote. \nNonetheless, I have not given up hope that some real legislating can \nstill take place in the waning moments of our consideration of this \nbill.\n  I have a number of amendments, 14 to be exact, pending before this \nbody. They are entitled to receive votes before we vote on final \npassage. They are reasonable and modest amendments. They are not so-\ncalled message amendments. They are not intended to be poison pills or \nbring down the bill by causing a huge disagreement with the House. They \nare intended to improve the bill because this bill is now not an \nacademic exercise, as we know. It is going to become law. It is going \nto be the first bankruptcy reform of any great substance since 1978. It \nis going to become law, probably in a matter of weeks, and it will have \na real impact on real people all over this country.\n  Last night my staff was able to have some discussions about these \namendments with staff for the sponsors. I am hopeful that some of these \namendments can be accepted or negotiated. I am prepared to entertain \nany reasonable offer. If I feel the sponsors have made a legitimate \neffort to look closely at my amendments and consider them with an open \nmind, and if some number of those amendments are accepted, I will not \nseek votes on all the amendments. No one likes a vote-arama, as it has \ncome to be known, when we vote on a bunch of amendments in a row and \noften people don't know what they are voting on. But we will have one \nif the attitude that has been on display for the last week and a half \ncontinues.\n  I know my bargaining position is not strong. But I hope my colleagues \nwill look at these amendments and realize that they are modest and \nmight actually improve the bill in a way that wouldn't offend anyone in \nthis entire body from the point of view of their philosophy about what \nbankruptcy law should be. Writing laws that work is what the Senate is \nsupposed to do. Here is an opportunity to do that.\n  Let me talk briefly about each of these amendments because I do not \nintend to call each one up individually for debate. Some of them are \nvery simple. Let me reiterate that I am open to discussion on any of \nthese amendments. If there is something about the drafting that could \nbe improved, I urge the sponsors to work with me and help me perfect \nthe amendments so they can become part of the bill in a managers' \npackage or perhaps even by unanimous consent.\n  The first amendment I will discuss is amendment No. 92 which has to \ndo with section 106 of the bill on credit counseling and education. The \nbill requires credit counseling and credit education for people who \nfile for bankruptcy. Section 106 of the bill requires debtors to obtain \na credit counseling briefing before filing a bankruptcy case and to \ntake a credit education course as a condition of receiving a discharge. \nHowever, the provisions provide no recourse for debtors who have \nexigent circumstances that would make it actually impossible for them \nto take a credit education course after filing or to get credit \ncounseling, even during the 30-day grace period the bill now allows.\n\n  Let me give a few examples. I know these cases may be rare, but they \nare real. There are people in this country who are homebound and do not \nhave a telephone or Internet access. I wish there weren't, but there \nare. Are we going to decide in the Senate that these unfortunate \ncitizens can never file for bankruptcy because they are in that \nsituation? How about people who suffer from dementia caused by \nAlzheimer's or some other disease? They sometimes have to file for \nbankruptcy because of massive medical bills, and they can do so through \nsomeone who has power of attorney. Do we think anything is to be gained \nby requiring a debtor who is ill with a terrible, incurable disease, \nnot even competent to sign legal papers anymore, to take a credit \neducation course?\n  How about U.S. soldiers fighting in Iraq or Afghanistan or serving \nanywhere overseas? It is a tragedy that some of our young men and women \nserving their country have to file for bankruptcy, but that is actually \nhappening right now every day. Yes, there is Internet access in Iraq, \nbut do we want to require a soldier to sit down at a computer to take a \ncredit counseling or credit education course while they are in Iraq in \norder to protect his or her family back home from financial ruin?\n\n[[Page S2315]]\n\n  By the way, the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act does not address this \nproblem. Nothing in that statute would excuse members of the military, \neven those on active duty serving overseas, from the credit counseling \nand education requirements. Our fighting men and women are already \nhaving to file for bankruptcy despite the protections of that law. My \namendment creates simply a safety valve to address this problem by \ngiving courts discretion--it just gives them discretion--to waive the \ncredit counseling and education requirements based on a sworn statement \nfiled by the debtor with the court.\n  The bill also fails to address the potentially prohibitive cost of \ncredit education to some debtors. In contrast, section 111, which \naddresses credit counseling services, requires credit counseling \norganizations to provide counseling without regard to ability to pay \nthe fee for such a service. My amendment borrows the same language, \nrequiring credit education to be offered for a reasonable fee and \noffered to all persons without regard to ability to pay the fee.\n  These changes are essential to ensuring that the bankruptcy system is \nstill an option available for those who truly need it. Let's not make \nthese counseling and education requirements, which I think have a great \ndeal of merit, into some kind of a trap for some unusually situated but \nstill good-faith debtors whom the bankruptcy decision is actually \ndesigned to help. I know this issue is particularly important to \nSenator Sessions. I hope to be able to work with him to reach \nagreement. He and I have worked together well on this and a number of \nother issues in the past with the regard to the bankruptcy bill. I hope \nhe will follow suit on this as well.\n  The amendment I have just discussed deals with the impact of this \nbill on a very few, unusual, and very hard-luck debtors. The same is \ntrue of the next amendment I want to discuss concerning current monthly \nincome. There are actually two amendments I have filed on this topic, \namendment No. 96 and amendment No. 97. I am suggesting two alternative \napproaches to deal with the same problem.\n\n  Section 318 requires debtors in chapter 13 whose current monthly \nincome is over the median to file a 5-year plan rather than a 3-year \nplan. Requiring debtors to file a 5-year plan means it will take them \nlonger to get back on their feet and they will end up paying more money \nto emerge from bankruptcy. Only those with a higher income should be \nsubjected to this longer plan. But because of the way the income \nthreshold is calculated in the bill, there is a great possibility of \narbitrary and unfair results.\n  Whether this requirement applies depends on the income that debtors \nearn in the 6 months before bankruptcy rather than their actual income \nat the time of filing. In other words, the median income test is based \non what you used to make, not what you make at the time of bankruptcy. \nTo understand this problem, imagine person A has an income of $60,000 \nand that the State's median income is $45,000. A month before \nbankruptcy, she loses her job and is forced to take a job that pays \nonly $30,000. Under the bill, her current monthly income works out to \n$5,000, even though she only makes $30,000 at the time of the \nbankruptcy and even if she never finds a higher paying job. So she \nwould be forced into a 5-year plan, even though her real income is well \nbelow the threshold the bill's drafters apparently had in mind.\n  Imagine person B has an income of $40,000 before and after filing for \nbankruptcy. Because person B's income is below the median, she will be \nallowed to enter a 3-year plan even though she actually makes more than \nperson A. So the definition of current monthly income as the average of \nthe prior 6 months' income may not make sense in some cases.\n  My amendments provide two alternative ways to allow for a different \nand more accurate monthly income to be calculated. In addition, under \nmy amendment, if a debtor's income decreases during the bankruptcy case \nto less than the median income, then a debtor who is at that time on a \n5-year plan can seek to have the plan reduced to a 3-year plan.\n  Incidentally, the bill already provides a safety valve for \ncalculating current monthly income in chapter 7. The court can reduce \nthe income used for the means test if special circumstances are \npresent. Special circumstances such as job loss or a sharp reduction in \nincome from a home business would certainly qualify. I think it is an \noversight that this was not done for chapter 13. So I hope the sponsors \nwill simply fix this problem.\n  This change also needs to be made in another section of the bill \nwhere current monthly income plays a significant role; that is, in \ndetermining whether a debtor will have to use the restrictive IRS \nstandards under the means test to figure out what living expenses will \nbe permitted.\n  Again, it is unfair to someone filing in chapter 13 to make that \ndetermination based on past income rather than what the person actually \nmakes.\n  This is a commonsense fix. We shouldn't import the means test to \nchapter 13 without allowing for special circumstances adjustments to \nincome. Either of my amendments would bring chapter 13 in line with \nchapter 7 on this score.\n  The next amendment I want to discuss also has to do with chapter 13. \nThere is a peculiar problem in this bill. I have often called it a bill \nthat is at war with itself. What I mean by that is that the bill's \noverriding purpose--the argument that we have heard over and over on \nthe floor in the past week 26 and a half--is to get more people to file \nfor bankruptcy under chapter 13, which will require them to pay some of \ntheir debts over a 3- or 5-year period before getting a discharge of \ntheir remaining debts. This is what the means test is all about--\ngetting debtors to pay some of their debts if they are able. That is \nchapter 13. You would think, then, that the bill's sponsors and \nsupporters would want to make sure that chapter 13 remains a viable \noption for those debtors. But the bill also includes a number of \nprovisions that make it less advantageous to file in chapter 13 and \nharder to complete repayment plans. That is a bill at war with itself, \nand I predict this bill will have very bad consequences if it is \nadopted as it stands. The chapter 13 bankruptcy trustees and judges \nhave certainly told us that over and over again for the past 8 years. \nApparently, no one wants to listen.\n  One amendment I have offered to try to undo one of the problems this \nbill creates for chapter 13 amendment No. 95, having to do with \ndischarge of back taxes. Current bankruptcy law allows debtors who \ncomplete chapter 13 payment plans to discharge all taxes that were owed \nmore than 3 years before the time of the petition. This allows debtors \nto look forward to someday improving their financial situation without \nfacing a lifetime of debt repayment for old taxes. But the bill makes \nit less advantageous to file for bankruptcy under chapter 13 by \ndisallowing the discharge of many of these older taxes.\n  Under section 707 of the bill, a standard now applicable only to \nchapter 7 would be applied to chapter 13. In chapter 7 cases, debtors \nmay only discharge old taxes if they filed a tax return for those taxes \nat least 2 years before filing for bankruptcy. That limitation does not \ncurrently apply to chapter 13 cases. By the way, under chapter 13 \ntoday, as in chapter 7, taxes owed for the last 3 years must still be \npaid in full as priority debts, which enables the IRS to collect what \nis available from the debtor's disposable income with very low \ncollection costs, and older taxes are paid pro rata with other \ncreditors for duration of the plan. Society benefits at the completion \nof a debtor's chapter 13 payment plan when the debtor is able to rejoin \nthe economic system as a tax-paying wage earner.\n  This is an important protection. Typical older tax cases involve \ndebtors who have recently gotten back on their feet and found a job \nafter years of economic or family displacement. The displacement is \noften the result of serious health or substance abuse problems, \nunstable employment or a marital collapse. These debtors may have \ndrifted through many jobs over several years without keeping the W-2 or \n1099 forms needed to file tax returns. Having finally found steady \nemployment, debtors are often faced with a wage garnishment for these \nold taxes just at the time they are attempting to get back on level \nfinancial ground. The debtors may need to file for bankruptcy to stop \nthe garnishment so that they will have\n\n[[Page S2316]]\n\nenough money left from take-home pay to pay rent, child support, or \nother financial necessities.\n  But if old taxes cannot be discharged through a chapter 13 plan, as \nproposed in this bill, debtors will have no reason to try to pay what \nthey can afford to pay through a chapter 13 plan, because they will \nknow that at the end of the 3- to 5-year payment plan, they likely will \nagain face an IRS garnishment for the older taxes.\n  My amendment addresses this problem. I should also point out that the \namendment retains the bill's prohibition on the discharge of taxes for \nwhich a fraudulent return was filed. So we are talking about \ndischarging of back taxes that are not the result of fraud, just the \nresult of nonpayment.\n  The next amendment also deals with chapter 13. It is amendment No. \n94, and would correct a serious drafting error in section 102(h) of the \nbill that threatens to unintentionally eviscerate chapter 13. Refusing \nto remedy this error would be disastrous for the very chapter of the \ncode that the sponsors of this bill want to encourage people to use.\n  In chapter 13 cases, debtors must devote all they can afford--that \nis, their disposable income after living expenses--to payments under \ntheir plan. These payments go to administrative expenses, secured \ncreditors and unsecured creditors. In fact, most chapter 13 cases filed \nunder current law are filed in order to deal with secured debts, to \nprevent foreclosure on a home or repossession of a car.\n  As written, section 102(h) of this bill would instead require that \nfor debtors who are below median income, all disposable income must go \nto unsecured creditors, and none could be used for secured debts or \nadministrative expenses. This is an obvious drafting error, since the \npurpose of section 102(h), as I understand it, was simply to require \ndebtors with income over the median income to use the IRS standards \ncontained in the means test to determine their allowable living \nexpenses but to leave the law unchanged for debtors below median \nincome.\n  If this error is not corrected, the bill will make it impossible for \ndebtors below median income to use chapter 13. Now some in this body \nmay be under the mistaken impression that people who file for chapter \n13 bankruptcy are well off and they will only choose that chapter if \nthey are forced to by this bill. That is obviously not true since \nchapter 13 exists now and millions of people use it voluntarily. The \nlarge majority of chapter 13 filers are actually below median income. \nIn fact, in the 1980s, one study found that about 15 percent of chapter \n13 filers were actually below the poverty line. Very few people file in \nchapter 13 because they have large amounts they can afford to pay to \nunsecured creditors. They do it to protect their homes from foreclosure \nor their cars from repossession. While there certainly are exceptions, \npeople who file for bankruptcy are generally poor, whether they choose \nchapter 7 or chapter 13.\n  Currently, with no means test in place, about 30 percent of \nbankruptcy debtors voluntarily file under chapter 13. Even the sponsors \nof this bill claim that only another 8-10 percent of those who now file \nunder chapter 7 would be switched to chapter 13 if the means test were \nimplemented. So even with the means test, the majority of chapter 13 \ndebtors will almost certainly be below median income. That means the \ndrafting error I have discussed is a big deal. We have to fix this \nproblem before it becomes law.\n  A second problem created by this error has to do with administrative \nexpenses in chapter 13 cases. Administrative expenses in bankruptcy \ninclude the fees of lawyers and trustees who are paid to process the \ncase.\n  Section 102(h) of the bill would effectively impose a 10 percent cap \non chapter 13 administrative expenses for debtors with income over the \nmedian. And it would prohibit any payments at all for administrative \nexpenses for debtors below the median. What that means is that there \nwill be no lawyers to handle chapter 13 cases at all. Chapter 13 will \nbecome a nullity.\n  This bill has contained a number of antilawyer provisions over the \nyears, but I cannot imagine that the drafters of this bill intended to \neffectively prohibit attorney participation on behalf of debtors in \nchapter 13 cases.\n  My amendment will correct these drafting problems. It makes clear \nthat the means test expense standards will be used for chapter 13 cases \nfiled by debtors who make more than the median income. It makes sure \nthat below median income debtors can pay their secured creditors. And \nit will allow administrative expenses, including attorneys' fees, to be \nincluded in the plan payments. I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment if you don't want this bill to write chapter 13 out of \nexistence.\n  Another of my amendments deals with a provision that bankruptcy \nlawyers are very concerned about. This is amendment No. 93 on debt \nrelief agencies. The amendment is strongly supported by the American \nBar Association. This amendment would exclude lawyers from the \nprovisions dealing with ``debt relief agencies'' in sections 226 to 228 \nof the bill. As currently written, the bill would impose a number of \nunnecessary burdens on the attorney/client relationship in bankruptcy \nproceedings. Subjecting attorneys to the ``debt relief agency'' \nprovisions will add little substantive protection for consumers, but \nrequire substantial amounts of extra paperwork and cost.\n  Requiring lawyers to call themselves ``debt relief agencies'' will do \nmore to confuse the public than to protect it. I think members of the \npublic generally understand what the word ``lawyer'' means, but the \nphrase ``debt relief agency'' is vague and unhelpful. It is also \nmisleading, because there are significant differences between lawyers \nand nonlawyers, but both would be identifying themselves as debt relief \nagencies under this bill.\n  Only lawyers are permitted to give legal advice, to file pleadings, \nor to represent debtors in bankruptcy hearings. Perhaps most \nimportantly, only lawyers are bound to confidentiality by the attorney-\nclient privilege. These distinctions are important to consumers, but \nthey would be obscured by the bill as written.\n  Furthermore, these provisions would apparently apply to any law firm \nthat provides bankruptcy services, even if that law firm were primarily \nproviding landlord-tenant advice--even to landlords--criminal defense \nservices, or other unrelated services. Large firms with only one \nbankruptcy practitioner may be required to advertise themselves as \n``debt relief agencies.''\n  I think this will be immensely confusing to consumers without any \napparent benefit.\n  The substantive provisions on ``debt relief agencies'' would add \nlittle to the already existing laws and regulations governing attorney \nconduct. Attorneys currently have extensive duties relating to \ndisclosures, fees, and ethical obligations. These provisions would \nmicromanage that relationship without adding any meaningful substantive \nprotection.\n  I think the intention of the bill's drafters was to prevent attorneys \nfrom tricking consumers into bankruptcy by not telling consumers from \nthe beginning that they work on bankruptcy issues, and then sort of \nspringing the idea of bankruptcy on the consumer. But rather than \nsimply prohibiting this sort of unethical behavior, the bill tries to \nmicromanage the attorney-client relationship by requiring large amounts \nof additional paperwork and disclosure. Extra paperwork substantially \nburdens the consumer and adds to the cost of bankruptcy. Given that \nattorney conduct is already regulated, I believe these provisions are \nunnecessary as applied to attorneys and provide no clear benefit.\n  As I mentioned, the American Bar Association strongly supports this \namendment. The Federal Bar Association is also strongly in favor of it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the Federal \nBar Association be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          Federal Bar Association,\n\n\n                                      Office of the President,\n\n                                Cincinatti, OH, February 28, 2005.\n     Re Attorney Liability Provisions in S. 256, The Bankruptcy \n         Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005.\n\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on the Judiciary U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Specter and Senator Leahy: As the Senate \n     prepares to consider the ``Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and \n     Consumer Protection Act of 2005'' (S. 256), I\n\n[[Page S2317]]\n\n     write to express the opposition of the Federal Bar \n     Association to several provisions in the proposed legislation \n     that would in our opinion inappropriately increase the \n     potential liability and administrative burdens of bankruptcy \n     attorneys under the Bankruptcy Code. Those provisions would \n     require attorneys to: certify the accuracy of factual \n     allegations in the debtor's bankruptcy petition and schedules \n     under penalty of court sanctions (section 102); certify the \n     ability of the debtor to make payments under a reaffirmation \n     agreement (section 203(a)); identify and advertise themselves \n     as ``debt relief agencies'' subject to a variety of \n     regulations (sections 227-229).\n       The Federal Bar Association, with over 16,000 members \n     throughout the country, is the only national association \n     composed exclusively of attorneys in the private sector and \n     government who practice within or before the federal courts \n     and agencies. Our mission is to serve our nation's federal \n     legal system. In our view, the above-referenced provisions of \n     the proposed legislation pose a serious threat to the \n     efficient operation of the bankruptcy laws and the bankruptcy \n     courts. We are joined in this opinion by many state and \n     national bar associations and bankruptcy practitioners.\n       The cumulative potential liability and additional \n     administrative burden imposed upon debtor attorneys by the \n     legislation may be expected to generate a substantial \n     negative impact on the availability of quality legal counsel \n     in the bankruptcy system. The above-referenced provisions \n     will discourage many attorneys from agreeing to represent \n     debtors and significantly increase the fees and expenses of \n     clients. The requirement that a bankruptcy attorney certify \n     the accuracy of factual allegations in the debtor's \n     bankruptcy petition and schedules, for example, will \n     essentially require the attorney to become a guarantor of the \n     petitioner's statements. The effect of these draconian \n     changes may be to drive many consumer bankruptcy \n     practitioners out of this area of practice, depriving \n     individuals of adequate legal representation and forcing them \n     to seek less responsible alternatives such as unlicensed \n     bankruptcy petition preparers or to file their petitions \n     themselves. They may not even receive adequate advice \n     regarding the necessity or advisability of filing for \n     bankruptcy. Therefore, the attorney liability and ``debt \n     relief agency'' provisions contained in the proposed \n     bankruptcy legislation may have an adverse effect on debtors, \n     creditors and the bankruptcy system itself. While these \n     changes may not be intended by the advocates of the \n     legislation, they are foreseeable.\n       The spirit of the above-referenced provisions can be better \n     satisfied by the imposition of non-dischargeability sanctions \n     upon debtors who falsify their bankruptcy schedules and \n     tougher action by bankruptcy courts and the United States \n     Trustee to enforce Bankruptcy Rule 9011 when misconduct by a \n     party exists. These reforms would reduce bankruptcy fraud and \n     abuse without unfairly harming honest debtors or the \n     bankruptcy system.\n       We call upon you to support amendments that may be offered \n     on the Senate floor that would remove the inappropriate and \n     unnecessary sanctions and burdens described above from the \n     proposed bankruptcy legislation.\n       Thank you for considering these views. If you would like \n     more information on the PBA's views, your staff may contact \n     our counsel for government relations, Bruce Moyer, at (301) \n     270-8115.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                 Thomas R. Schuck,\n                                               National President.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, another amendment I have pending is \nreally concerned with making the bankruptcy system work better for both \ncreditors and debtors. It is amendment No. 90, dealing with notice.\n  The bill contains three separate notice requirements which seem to \ncreate significantly differing procedures for notice.\n  The first provision requires debtors to send notice to the creditor \nat whatever preferred address the creditor has specified in \ncorrespondence with the debtor shortly before bankruptcy.\n  The second provision says that debtors and the court must send notice \nto the creditor at an address the creditor files in each individual \ncase.\n  And the third provision says the court must send notice to an address \nthe creditor files for all cases, with an exception if a different \naddress is filed for an individual case.\n  The first requirement, that debtors send notice that bankruptcy has \nbeen filed to creditors at the creditors' preferred address, is \nactually unworkable and unfair and serves no apparent purpose. Debtors \noften do not receive correspondence within the last 90 days prior to \nfiling for bankruptcy, and even when they do, they may not know that \nthe correspondence is significant. Essentially, debtors might end up \nhaving their cars repossessed despite the fact that they filed for \nbankruptcy and repossession should be prevented by the automatic stay \nbecause they threw away what appeared to be junk mail from the \ncreditor. And bankruptcy lawyers are forced to search through their \nclients' correspondence for an address or a change of address.\n  I think we can come up with a much more streamlined notice provision \nthat will satisfy the interests of both creditors and debtors.\n  My amendment will eliminate the first notice provision of the bill \nand instead establish a central national registry for creditors' \ncorrespondence addresses. The registry would be available to debtor's \ncounsel and the court on the Internet, as is already done for \ngovernment creditors under the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure. \nThe same address could be used for all notices, except when a creditor \nfiles and serves a different address for an individual case.\n  The bill generally provides for such a registry, and the courts are \nmoving in that direction anyway, but the bill has two significant \nflaws. First, the bill is vague about whether a registry is to be \nmaintained by each court or in a central national database, and it does \nnot provide that the registry will be made available to the public.\n  Second, the bill's current language is unworkable because counsel \nwill have to constantly check court records in every case to see if a \nnew address was filed with the court. My amendment requires parties to \nuse any address that has been filed more than 120 days previously with \nthe registry. Within that 4-month period, the addresses should be \nupdated in various software programs that bankruptcy attorneys use to \nfind addresses, or they can recheck the registry to find if addresses \nhave changed.\n  The exception to sanctions for a violation of an automatic-stay \nviolation must also be amended so it does not include creditors who \nhave clear actual notice of a stay. As it stands now, the bill creates \na loophole that will encourage rampant abuse. For example, a debtor who \nfiled for bankruptcy the previous week might return home from work to \nfind her car being repossessed. The creditor might claim the debtor did \nnot provide proper notice of the bankruptcy because notice was not sent \nto the correct address and therefore the creditor can proceed with the \nrepossession, even if the debtor has her time-stamped bankruptcy \npetition in her hand and shows it to the repo man. It would not even \nwork in that circumstance, which is an absurd result.\n\n  Finally, the language of the bill should be clarified so that actual \nnotice reasonably calculated to come to the attention of a creditor or \nits agent is sufficient to allow sanctions for violation of the stay.\n  Correcting the notice provisions will protect the interest of debtors \nand creditors. Do we really want to leave in place a provision that is \nso obviously contradictory and unworkable and that could lead to a \nresult as unjust as the example I just described? I hope not.\n  I also believe that creditor as well as debtor attorneys will \nappreciate the streamlined notice provision in my amendment and the \nestablishment of a national registry available on the Internet.\n  It is my understanding the Administrative Office of the Courts does \nnot favor the current language of the bill because it has essentially \nbeen overtaken by events. The courts are moving to electronic filing \nand notice registries. Keep in mind, this bill started about 8 years \nago. An awful lot has happened in that time to make this much more \nfeasible and, frankly, much more helpful to whoever is working on this, \nwhether it be creditor representatives or debtor representatives.\n  My amendment is consistent with that movement. The bill is not.\n  One of my amendments is just a clarification of the effect of my bill \nand should not be controversial at all. It is amendment No. 100 on \nreaffirmation.\n  Section 524(1) allows creditors to accept payments made ``before and \nafter filing'' of a reaffirmation agreement with the court. It also \nprovides that a creditor may accept payments from a debtor under an \nagreement that the creditor believes in good faith to be effective.\n  I am concerned that these provisions could allow creditors to accept \nand retain payments where the reaffirmation agreement is ultimately \nheld to be invalid.\n  In the late 1990s, in a celebrated case, the retailer Sears was \nrequired to disgorge literally hundreds of millions of dollars in \npayments made by debtors\n\n[[Page S2318]]\n\npursuant to reaffirmation agreements that were invalid because they \nwere never filed with the court. This bill would permit acceptance of \npayments before a reaffirmation agreement is filed. This will leave an \nambiguity that would potentially require courts to allow a creditor \nsuch as Sears to retain all those payments.\n  The current language in section 203 of the bill suggests that if \nSears in good faith believes those invalid agreements to be legitimate, \nit could have retained the payments. This would undermine the integrity \nof the bankruptcy system, and I can see no policy justification at all \nfor allowing creditors to retain payments made pursuant to invalid \nreaffirmation agreements.\n  This amendment would clarify that courts have the option to order the \ndisgorgement of payments made pursuant to invalid reaffirmation \nagreements or to order other appropriate remedies. Again, it is simply \na logical correction to an ambiguity in the bill. If it is not \nnecessary, I would appreciate the sponsors saying so on the record so \nthat the legislative history on this point is clear.\n\n  Finally, I hope the sponsors will consider agreeing to amendment No. \n87 on inflation adjustments. As a result of the efforts of Senator \nGrassley and my efforts, one of the provisions in this bill is a long \noverdue inflation adjustment to the dollar amounts in chapter 12, the \nchapter covering farm bankruptcies. Those dollar amounts were \noriginally set in 1986. We increase the farm bankruptcy amounts to \naccount for inflation since 1986 and then index them for future \ninflation.\n  Inflation has severely limited the usefulness of chapter 12 to family \nfarmers, and I am pleased that this bill addresses that problem as well \nas others with chapter 12.\n  Virtually all the dollar amounts in the Bankruptcy Code are now \nsubject to section 104, which provides for their adjustment every 3 \nyears in accordance with the cost of living. But not all of them are. \nThe reason that the family farm amounts needed to be increased so much \nin this bill is because they were not previously adjustable under \nsection 104.\n  This bill adds a number of new sections or subsections with dollar \namounts that are not indexed, including the family fisherman provision, \nhousehold goods, educational savings limits, certain venue thresholds, \nand the applicability in chapter 13 of the additional monthly allowance \nfor individuals over a family of four.\n  Again, this is just a commonsense technical issue. Almost all of the \ndollar values in the current bill should be added to section 104 and \nadjusted for inflation, just as the family farm values are, and the \nhomestead exemption, and many others. I implore my colleagues: Do not \nmake the same mistake that was made with respect to family farms back \nin the mid-1980s.\n  Do not set up a situation where 10 or 20 years from now some \nprovision is clearly too low, but it cannot be fixed for 7 years while \nCongress works on another big revision to the Code.\n  I do hope the sponsors can accept this amendment. If there is an \namount they have a real argument about that should not be indexed, I am \nwilling to consider that. I removed one provision in this amendment \nhaving to do with the definition of financial participant when I heard \nfrom the Bond Market Association that that one should not be indexed. \nSo I am willing to be reasonable, and I hope my colleagues who have \nworked so hard and long on this bill over the past 8 years will be \nreasonable as well, as this moves to final passage.\n  I have taken some time in going through these amendments, and perhaps \npeople watching would say: Why is this Senator waiting until the last \nminute to raise these issues?\n  Of course, that is not the case at all. I waited patiently in the \nJudiciary Committee, provided these amendments well in advance in \nalmost every case for everybody to review. I started to offer the \namendments in committee and make my arguments. We received no \nsubstantive response at all in the committee on almost every amendment.\n  When one Senator actually could not take it anymore on the other side \nand offered a substantive response to my amendment, he said, I \napologize to the chairman for making an argument, basically because \napparently they had been instructed not to talk about these amendments.\n  He asked: Senator, why are you doing this? We need to get this out of \ncommittee. Why do you not wait until the floor to offer these \ncommonsense amendments, and then we in good faith will work together to \ntry to solve these problems?\n  Well, that is not what is happening. This is just a slam dunk. There \nis no danger anymore about considering these amendments. They got \ncloture. There are plenty of votes. What is the harm of fixing the \nbill? What is the harm of doing the right thing? What is the harm of \ndoing our job as legislators and making sure we do not stick the entire \nbankruptcy community with these provisions that do not make any sense? \nCome on, we can do this now. It is safe to go back in the water. This \nis going to become law, and not a single one of my provisions will do \nany damage whatsoever to the fundamental intent or goals of this bill.\n  I do thank my colleagues for their attention in this presentation. \nThese are highly technical issues. Some may seem minor, and some may \nactually be minor. I do not want to take the Senate's time on these \namendments, which is why I attempted to get them considered in \ncommittee and have tried to make myself available at every instance to \ndiscuss them over the past week and a half.\n  I look forward to discussions over the next few hours with the \nmanagers of the bill. Perhaps we can still reach agreement that will \nmake some of these votes unnecessary.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this amendment would help to ensure that \nlegal representation remains affordable and accessible to lower income \nAmericans who are forced into bankruptcy.\n  As currently written, the bill contains provisions that would \nsignificantly increase attorney's fees and expenses related to the \nfiling of a bankruptcy petition. Under existing law, attorneys can rely \non information that a client provides regarding the extent and the \nvalue of their assets, such as the worth of a car, household furniture, \nand that sort of item.\n  In an effort to combat the perceived abuse of the bankruptcy system, \nthis proposed bill requires an attorney to certify that the attorney \nhas made an inquiry into the client's assertions, and it subjects the \nlawyers to personal liability for inaccuracies in a debtor's list of \nassets. Although the proponents of this provision may argue that the \nchange will prevent abuse, I believe it is an unnecessary change that \nwill have significant unintended consequences.\n  Under existing law, attorneys are already required to certify that \npleadings, motions, and other materials have factual support pursuant \nto bankruptcy rule 9011. Attorneys are also prohibited from knowingly \nmaking any legal or factual misrepresentation to the court or assisting \na client in any abuse. If we want to address misconduct by attorneys, \nwhat we need is better enforcement of those existing rules. If we want \nto address abuse by debtors in submitting their lists of assets, we \nshould seek to hold those individuals responsible. My amendment would \ndo that by making specific debts nondischargeable if the debtor lied \nabout them in their bankruptcy schedule.\n  With regard to the unintended consequences of these changes, in order \nto protect themselves from harsh sanctions, attorneys would be forced \nto conduct a costly investigation into the value and the actual \nexistence of the client's claimed assets. This would not only directly \nincrease the attorney's expenses, it would also likely raise very \nsignificantly other costs such as malpractice insurance. The Attorneys' \nLiability Protections Society, Inc., which is a malpractice carrier \nthat insures 15,000 lawyers in 27 jurisdictions around the country, has \nestimated that the impact of this provision could result in the \nimmediate increase of insurance premiums for bankruptcy lawyers from 10 \nto 20 percent.\n  The bankruptcy bill contains another provision with regard to \nreaffirmation agreements that will also likely result in higher \nattorney's fees and costs.\n  Current law provides that debtors can reaffirm a debt and therefore \nkeep a specific asset, as long as the attorney certifies the decision \nto do so is voluntary and will not create undue hardship for the \ndebtor.\n  As drafted, S. 256 would require attorneys, where there is a \npresumption of hardship, to certify that debtors would be able to make \nfuture payments under the agreement. Attorneys are not accountants and \nwould have to conduct extensive audits of their client's finances in \norder to determine if that client would be able to afford specific \npayments. Of course, that would drive up attorneys' fees as well.\n  These additional costs would negatively impact on the accessibility \nof legal representation and court administration in two primary ways. \nFirst, they would reduce the ability of lawyers to take on pro bono \ncases and would make these legal services unavailable to many indigent \ndebtors. In my own State, the law clinic at the University of New \nMexico Law School has said if the bill passes in its current form, it \nwould likely have to stop doing bankruptcy work for indigent clients \ndue to the additional cost and concerns related to the attorney \nsanction provision. Second, these costs would place additional \nadministrative burdens on the Nation's courts by increasing the number \nof individuals who would be representing themselves in the court \nproceeding due to their inability to afford an attorney. According to \nthe Chief Bankruptcy Judge for the District of New Mexico, cases \ninvolving pro se debtors, debtors who are representing themselves, can \ntake up to 10 times as much time to process as cases where debtors are \nrepresented by counsel. As such, even a small increase in the number of \ncases being processed without counsel could create substantial \nadministrative burdens on our bankruptcy courts.\n  So the amendment I have called up would do three things. First, it \nwould replace the attorney liability language in section 102 of the \nbill with new language that would impose nondischargeable sanctions on \ndebtors who lie on their bankruptcy schedules. Second, it would urge \nbankruptcy courts to more vigorously enforce existing rules regarding \nthe sanctioning of attorneys where misconduct has been demonstrated. \nThese changes would properly address abuse in the bankruptcy system by \nholding debtors responsible for intentional misrepresentations in \nlisting the worth of their assets and holding attorneys responsible if \nthey assist in any such abuse. Last, the amendment would maintain \nexisting law with regard to the certification of reaffirmation \nagreements by attorneys.\n  I understand the need to punish attorneys for abuse of the bankruptcy \nprocess but there are ways to do this without unnecessarily driving up \nthe cost of legal representation. This, in my view, is an amendment \nthat is reasonable. The American Bar Association has endorsed it. I \nurge my colleagues to support it as well.\n  I have talked to various of my colleagues in the Senate. I have \nwatched the amendments being defeated in the Senate for the last \nseveral days. I believe I am correct that every single amendment that \nhas been offered to this bill has been defeated, many of them on pretty \nmuch a party-line vote. So it is clear to me that offering this \namendment and actually requiring a vote on it will not be productive.\n  I do believe it is a significant issue. It is an issue that should be \naddressed before this bill is completed and goes to the President for \nsignature. I hope my colleagues will consider the need to address this \nissue and make changes in the bill. But, because of the lack of \nsupport, at this point I will not ask for a vote on the amendment.\n\n\n                       AMENDMENT NO. 51 WITHDRAWN\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the business here in the Senate is the \nbankruptcy bill. I want to talk about an amendment I had offered to \nthis legislation that does not get a vote now as a result of cloture \nbeing invoked.\n  The amendment I offered on behalf of myself and Senator Durbin was \noffered on a timely basis and the majority decided they did not want to \nhave a vote on the amendment. So when cloture prevailed--and I voted \nagainst cloture--this amendment fell also. As a result of that, I do \nnot intend to vote for the underlying bill. The Senate should have \nvoted on my amendment. It was in order. Admittedly it was nongermane to \nthe underlying bill, but still, under the rules, it was in order for me \nto offer it.\n  The amendment was an amendment that would create a special committee \nto investigate contracting waste, fraud, and abuse in the country of \nIraq.\n  We have had almost no oversight hearings here in the authorizing \ncommittees of the Senate on how money is being spent with respect to \ncontracting in Iraq. But we have held some Democratic Policy Committee \nhearings and have heard from a good many whistleblowers and others \nabout what is happening to American taxpayers' money in the country of \nIraq. Let me describe some of the testimony we have heard.\n  This picture is perhaps the best description. At the last hearing I \nchaired, this person--his face is not seen in this picture, but this \nperson standing here holding some of this money brought this photograph \nwith him. This is $2 million. This $2 million wrapped in Saran wrap in \n$100 bills was provided to\n\n[[Page S2320]]\n\na contractor. The contractor was doing business in Iraq with our \nGovernment and the Coalition Provisional Authority, which was our \nGovernment as well. Our witness, who worked for the Coalition \nProvisional Authority, said that people were told when they needed to \nget paid on their contracts: Bring a bag. Just bring the bag and you \nget loaded with cash.\n  The witness said he heard there was a vault with billions of dollars \nin cash. At any rate, on the day this picture was taken a contractor \nshowed up and collected $2 million in cash in a bag.\n  Let me describe this contractor, by the way, because there is some \nlegal action with respect to this contractor. I will not use names, but \nthe names were part of the hearing. It was on C-SPAN. This contractor \nwas a firm started by two individuals, formerly in one of the branches \nof our service, retired, who showed up in Iraq and wanted to be a \ncontractor. They didn't have any money. One of them, I guess, had $450, \naccording to news reports, and they wanted to go into business. So they \nproposed to get a contract to provide security at an airport in Iraq.\n  They got the contract. They got $2 million in cash delivered to them. \nThat is how they started the business. But their business was not \nnecessarily on the level. A couple of their employees decided to become \nwhistleblowers because they were so sickened by what they saw \nhappening. The whistleblowers allege that this company was taking \nforklift trucks off the airport property, painting them blue, and then \nselling them back to the Coalition Provisional Authority--which, by the \nway, was us: Ambassador Bremer and us, the American taxpayer.\n  So this company, these two fellows running this company, were taking \nforklift trucks, sending them off to a warehouse to paint them, and \nshipping them back and reselling them to us, the American taxpayer.\n  The people who blew the whistle on this received death threats, they \nsaid, and were quite scared. But despite all the obvious problems, this \ncompany was given $100 million in contracts in Iraq.\n  Listening to the witnesses at our DPC hearings describe what was \ngoing on in Iraq, it was unbelievable. There were brand new $85,000 \ntrucks used by contractors in Iraq. When they get a flat tire, what do \nthey do with the truck? They leave it on the road to be torched; brand \nnew $85,000 trucks. If something plugs up the fuel pump, they leave it; \njust abandon it. How about a company that decides to buy hand towels \nfor soldiers ordered by the U.S. Army, small hand towels. The company \nthat gets the contract to do it decided to nearly double the price of \nthe hand towels because they wanted to put their company logo on the \nhand towels used by American soldiers. Or the company that orders 25 \ntons--yes, 50,000 pounds--of nails to be sent to Iraq for construction. \nThe nails were the wrong size. They ordered the wrong size, and 50,000 \npounds of nails are sitting on the sands of Iraq paid for by the \nAmerican taxpayer.\n  The contractor that gets the contract to put in air conditioning \nunits in buildings in Iraq paid for by the American taxpayer goes to a \nsubcontractor, who goes to another neighborhood crew, and they pass all \nthis money along, and pretty soon what was to have been air \nconditioners is just a couple of fans in a room, while the American \ntaxpayer pays for air conditioners.\n  It is unbelievable what is happening with respect to waste, fraud, \nand abuse, and nobody cares. It is the American taxpayers that are \ntaking a bath.\n  You can't get oversight hearings in this Senate. Do you know why? \nBecause it would be embarrassing to the administration.\n  A couple of the contracts I just talked about involve Halliburton. \nPeople say when you talk about Halliburton you are going after the Vice \nPresident. Not at all. When you talk about Halliburton you are talking \nafter the company that got giant no-bid contracts, and there is no \naccountability for the way the money is spent. Halliburton was charging \nthe taxpayers for 42,000 meals a day served to U.S. soldiers. The \nproblem is they were only feeding 14,000 soldiers a day. They were \novercharging the American taxpayer by 28,000 meals a day.\n  Where is the accountability? Who cares about that? When is this \nCongress going to decide it matters?\n  We passed a nearly $20 billion reconstruction bill. I didn't support \nit. I offered the amendment to strip the $20 billion for reconstruction \nin Iraq. But the majority voted to authorize that spending. The reason \nI didn't support the funding was Iraq has the second largest reserves \nof oil in the world. A soldier told me they were standing in a \ndepression in the sand one day and the soles of their shoes got black \nfrom oil. This is a country with the second largest reserves of oil in \nthe world. It could easily securitize future oil that will be pumped \nfrom under the sands of Iraq and use that money to reconstruct Iraq. \nThat ought not be the American taxpayers' job.\n  But this Senate and this Congress crafted legislation which was \nsigned by this President that says we are going to actually send over \nnearly $18 billion. Twenty-billion dollars was the request. Senator \nWyden and I got an amendment passed that cut wasteful spending by $1.8 \nbillion. But there is still over $18 billion in the spending pipeline, \n$15 billion of which has not yet been spent.\n  I talked to this fellow holding this wad of cash which he was about \nto put in a bag for the people who have allegedly cheated the American \ntaxpayers. You talk to these folks, and they will tell you that passing \naround there is like passing an ice cube around. Pass it to three or \nfour hands, and pretty soon you have a lot less. It melts away.\n  That is what is happening to the American taxpayers' money with \nrespect to reconstruction in Iraq.\n  These are some of the headlines about Halliburton and those contracts \nwith the Department of Defense: ``Uncle Sam Looks into Meal Bills; \nHalliburton Refunds $27 million,'' February 3, 2004. On February 4, \n2004, ``Halliburton Faces Criminal Investigation; Pentagon Proving \nAlleged Overcharges for Iraq Fuel.''\n\n  By the way, the recently retired person in the Pentagon who purchased \nfuel--it was his job to purchase fuel in the world and deliver it in \nwar zones; he did it for over 30 years--testified that American \ntaxpayers are being overcharged by a dollar a gallon in Iraq. A buck a \ngallon, adding up to tens of millions of dollars. The American \ntaxpayers got hosed here. Nobody seems to care.\n  The question is, what do we do about all of that?\n  In 1941, on the eve of the Second World War, there was a Democratic \nSenator here in this Chamber. While there was a Democrat in the White \nHouse, that Democratic Senator got in a car and drove around the \ncountry to military bases and said there is massive waste and abuse \ngoing on, and we ought to get to the bottom of it. He convinced the \nCongress to create a special committee. The Senator was Harry S Truman, \nand the committee was eventually called the Truman Committee. They \nsaved an estimated $15 billion by exposing waste. That was a Democratic \nSenator with a Democrat in the White House.\n  But the fact is, you can't get hearings now because we have one party \nthat controls the White House, the House, and the Senate, and nobody \nwants to embarrass anybody.\n  It is not my intent to embarrass anybody. It is my intent to provide \naccountability and get to the bottom of how this money is being spent.\n  Remember the company that got the money shown in this picture, the \none where whistleblowers had their lives threatened? The whistleblowers \nfiled suit under the False Claims Act alleging that this company is \ndefrauding the American taxpayer. But the United States Justice \nDepartment decided they would not intervene. Do you want to know why? \nThe United States Justice Department said, Well, if they were \ndefrauding something, it was the Coalition Provisional Authority in \nIraq, and the Coalition Provisional Authority is not the same as the \nUnited States government. The Justice Department's position, according \nto an assistant U.S. Attorney, was that defrauding the United States is \nnot the same as defrauding the United States taxpayer. The Coalition \nProvisional Authority in Iraq was created by an executive order, in a \nvery specific document. To have the U.S. Justice Department take the \nposition that defrauding the Coalition Provisional Authority--\n\n[[Page S2321]]\n\nwhich is us--is not the same as defrauding the American taxpayer is \nByzantine.\n  The question is, why do we not allow a vote on an amendment to create \na special committee of the U.S. Senate? This would be a committee with \nfour members selected by the majority party and three members by the \nminority party, with subpoena power to have the kind of investigation \nand the kind of oversight that the American taxpayers ought to expect \nof this Congress. Why don't we have a vote on that?\n  I offered the amendment on time, and the majority party did not wish \nto have a vote on it.\n  Perhaps if we had oversight hearings we would hear more about that \nwhich I have already heard, the American taxpayers paying $45 for cases \nof what I call ``pop'' back home, Coca-Cola or Pepsi-Cola, $45 a case; \nor renting SUVs for $7,500 a month; $2.65 a gallon for fuel delivered \nin Iraq when the just retired head of the Defense Energy Support Center \ntestified they could have supplied it for half that price; $18.6 \nmillion of U.S. equipment missing that a company was given to manage, \nand now they can't find it, don't know where it is, and don't know what \nhappened to it.\n  The question is, does anybody here care? If so, why would we not vote \non an amendment to set up the kind of committee I would suggest?\n  As all of us know, we are rushing headlong to have a vote on \nbankruptcy. We will have that vote. But there is apparently no interest \nin trying to get to the bottom of these questions I asked. According to \nthe Inspector General of the Coalition Provisional Authority, there was \none Iraqi ministry that had 8,206 guards on the payroll, which was the \nresponsibility of the CPA. The problem is there are only 602 working \nthere; 8,206 were being paid for by the CPA, but only 602 were working. \nThe Coalition Provisional Authority actually had possession of nearly \n$9 billion in funds that actually came from Iraqi oil that belonged to \nthe Iraqi people. The inspector general says that money cannot be \naccounted for. Where did it go? What happened to it? When will someone \nstart caring about those things?\n\n  I have asked a lot of questions. We have held hearings in the \nDemocratic Policy Committee on these subjects, because the authorizing \ncommittees will not hold hearings on these subjects. I have offered an \namendment in the Senate on a timely basis. Because cloture was invoked, \nthe majority party knew they would not require Senators to vote on this \namendment to this bill. But obviously, this amendment will come back. I \nwill have the opportunity to offer it again, will offer it again, and \nwe will vote in the Senate, provided there is any appetite at all about \nwhat is happening to the American taxpayers' money.\n  I have previously supported bankruptcy legislation. I had hoped to \nsupport it this time. But because I was precluded from getting a vote \non an amendment that I offered on a timely basis, and because of other \nconcerns I have with the bill, I don't intend to vote to advance this \nlegislation. I say to my colleagues, we will vote on this amendment at \nanother time because I will offer it again. We will find a way to force \na vote in the Senate on creating a special committee to investigate \nthis waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  It is unthinkable at a time when we have massive Federal budget \ndeficits, a fiscal policy that is far off track at the same time we \nhave massive trade deficits, the combination of which is well over $1 \ntrillion a year, that no one seems to care much about waste. If ever I \nhave seen an example of waste, fraud, and abuse that is sickening and \ndisgusting, it is in this area. This Senate owes it to the American \npeople to create a committee to investigate, if the authorizing \ncommittees in the Senate will not do their job and hold oversight \nhearings.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 68\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I call up amendment 68.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the most disturbing thing about this \nsupposed bankruptcy reform is the utter lack of fairness and balance in \nthe legislation. It gets tough on working families facing financial \nhardship due to a health crisis, job loss caused by a plant closing or \noffshoring of a job, or a military callup to active duty. The laws of \nbankruptcy are being changed to wrest every last dollar out of these \nunfortunate families in order to further enrich the credit card \ncompanies.\n  However, the authors of this legislation look the other way when it \ncomes to closing millionaires' loopholes and ending corporate abuse. \nThe legislation fails to address the real crisis in corporate \nbankruptcy where reorganization plans often benefit the very insiders \nwhose greed and mismanagement brought down the company at the expense \nof the workers, the retirees, and the creditors, and it fails to \naddress the shocking abuse of millionaires hiding their assets in so-\ncalled asset protection trusts, placing them completely beyond the \nreach of creditors.\n  This bill also fails to deal effectively with the unlimited homestead \nexemptions in a few States which allow the rich to hold on to their \nmultimillion-dollar mansions while middle-class families in other \nStates lose their modest homes. We truly cannot allow this bill to pass \nwithout closing the millionaires' homestead loophole once and for all. \nIt has become a national embarrassment. Millionaire deadbeats buy a \nhuge mansion in Florida and Texas to shield their wealth from \ncreditors. The harsh rules of bankruptcy being established by this bill \nwill trap hard-working middle-class families, but the unlimited \nhomestead exemption will allow rich debtors to escape.\n  Existing bankruptcy laws allow those in bankruptcy to protect from \ntheir creditors certain assets, the nature of which is largely \ndetermined by State law. Most States make some allowance for homes or \nhomesteads people live in, but the allowance is a modest one, too \nmodest, in many States, for elderly people with large equity in the \nhomes they have lived in for most of their lives.\n  However, five States--the most notorious of which are Texas and \nFlorida--have unlimited homestead exemptions. This means debtors in \nthose States can stash away millions, even tens of millions of dollars \nin the States and leave their creditors with nothing.\n  S. 256 leaves this gaping loophole wide open. It will allow the real \nabusers of the bankruptcy system to file for bankruptcy and to still \nkeep their fortunes and properties intact while leaving their creditors \nwith nothing. S. 256 has created some minor exceptions to the homestead \nexemption, none of which would be applicable in many of the most \negregious cases. The bill fails to deal with the problem head on of \nmultimillionaires who abuse bankruptcy by stashing away wealth while \nthey declare bankruptcy.\n  My amendment caps the amount allowed for the homestead exemption at \n$300,000. This is an adequate allowance for most people. The average \nhome in the United States is $240,000, a great deal higher in many of \nthe regions of the country and lower in some parts of the country. This \n$300,000 is an adequate allowance for most people and would end the \nexploitation of the homestead exemption to hide assets from creditors. \nIt would add some measure of fairness and balance to a bill that sorely \nneeds some fairness and balance.\n  Some of the most egregious abuses we have currently and that this \nlegislation fails to deal with are the kinds of abuses that we have in \nthe case of Ken Lay, the former chairman of Enron, who owns a $7 \nmillion penthouse condominium. Mr. Lay made over $200 million from \nEnron stock and $19 million in bonuses. Other executives received \nbonuses as high as $5 million. Over 5,000 employees lost their jobs, \nand 20,000 lost an estimated $1 billion in retirement savings. Now, Ken \nLay has been able to put some $7 million in a penthouse condominium in \nHouston's exclusive River Oaks neighborhood with 12 rooms covering \n12,800 square feet.\n  We are going to find there have been hard-working men and women who \nhave had health insurance--half of all of the bankruptcies are the \nresult of dramatic health bills. Seventy-five percent of those \nindividuals had health insurance. And, as we have pointed out during \nthe course of this debate, if your family is touched by cancer, you, by \ndefinition, are going to have $35,000 to $40,000, at a minimum, out-of-\npocket expenses. And that, in many situations, is enough to drive a \nfamily into bankruptcy.\n\n[[Page S2322]]\n\n  If you have another serious health need, it will do the same. If you \nhave important needs for children, such as spina bifida, autism, or \nother kinds of significant and important children's diseases, it will \nrun into tens of thousands of dollars.\n  What we have seen in our study of these bankruptcies is half of the \nbankruptcies are caused by these medical disasters. Yet, we are \nunprepared to give any kind of consideration to these hard-working \npeople who have taken out health insurance to try to provide for their \nfamilies and, through no fault of their own, have been caught up in \nthese dramatic health care bills. They are struggling and try to avoid \nbankruptcy and meet their responsibilities. But once they get caught in \nthis net that is included in the bill, they will be punished--and I say \n``punished''--by the provisions in this bill which are unduly harsh and \nI believe unduly unfair.\n  But not Ken Lay. Not Ken Lay. Here it is: He will be out there in his \n$7 million penthouse condominium in Houston's River Oaks neighborhood, \nwith 12 rooms and covering 12,800 square feet.\n  Or Andrew Fastow, the former chief financial officer of Enron, who \nrecently built a large house in River Oaks valued in the millions, his \nhome will not be taken. He will be able to go home every night to that \nhome and be able to live there while we are seeing the homes taken from \nworking families whose only problem was that their family was hit by \ncancer or another serious illness. We are seeing their homes taken, \nwhen we see individuals who have basically violated the trust of their \ncompany and of the workers get a free ride in the form of millions of \ndollars.\n  You call that fair? You call that fair? All this amendment says is, \nwe will have a uniform standard. We have a uniform standard in this \namendment. We are going to have a uniform standard with regard to the \nequity in the house. We are not going to let these individuals go off \nand be able to shield all of their income.\n  We find Jeffrey Skilling, Enron's former president and chief \nexecutive officer, lives in a 15-room house in River Oaks valued at \nover $4 million.\n  WorldCom's chief financial officer, Scott Sullivan, who was charged \nwith falsifying the books by more than $3.8 billion, recently built a \n4-acre, $15 million estate in Boca Raton, FL, with an 18-seat movie \ntheater, art gallery, and lagoon.\n  You are telling me we are going to protect those individuals in their \nhomes when we have single mothers who cannot get the child support or \nalimony, through no fault of their own, and they are thrown into \nbankruptcy and in danger of losing their homes? And the cruelty is the \ninnocent individual, more often the wife, who is not getting the \nalimony or child support, has a very good chance of losing her home--\nbut not these individuals, not Dennis Kozlowski, the former CEO of Tyco \nInternational, who is said to have used $19 million from a no-interest \nloan from his company to pay part of the cost of a $30 million compound \nin Boca Raton, FL, called, ironically, Sanctuary. So $30 million he has \nbeen able to put away there.\n  There are hundreds of thousands of workers who have lost their jobs, \nlost their savings, lost their health care, lost their pensions--but he \nis going to be protected by this legislation. Where is the fairness in \nthis legislation when it comes to this issue in terms of homes?\n\n  We have a law firm in hock for $100 million. Former Baseball \nCommissioner Bowie Kuhn moved to a mansion in Ponte Vedra Beach, FL, \nand immediately sought protection from the creditors. And the list goes \non and on and on.\n  What is the current situation with regard to the homes and \nhomesteads? Well, if you get caught up with a claim against you, and \nyou live in any of these States--in New Jersey, in Pennsylvania, or \nMaryland--there is no homestead exemption. Your home, if you have the \nblessings to have a home, is thrown right in there, sold right off, put \nright on the market, and out you go.\n  In the State of Michigan, it is $3,500 in value. In Kentucky, it is \n$5,000 of value; Georgia, $5,000; South Carolina, $5,000; Ohio, $5,000; \nAlabama, $5,000; Virginia, $5,000, plus $500 per dependent; Tennessee, \n$5,000 in value, and $7,500 with your home if you are a married couple; \nIndiana, $7,500; Illinois, $7,500; Missouri, $8,000.\n  But there is no limitation for the Ken Lays, the Jeffrey Skillings, \nthe Dennis Kozlowskis putting aside tens of millions of dollars that is \ngoing to be protected.\n  These families will have that amount of equity that will be \nprotected. You can go into some other States: New York, $10,000; North \nCarolina, $10,000; and Wyoming, $10,000. And some States go on up to \n$75,000--Connecticut. In Montana it is $100,000. In my State of \nMassachusetts, it is $300,000. But there is no limit at all, no dollar \nlimit--some acreage amount--in Texas. In Texas, it is 10 acres in an \nurban area. It can be in downtown Dallas or downtown Houston. Or it can \nbe 200 acres in a rural area. You are protected. If you have a home on \n10 acres, wherever it is in an urban area--or 200 acres in a rural \narea--you are not touched by this legislation. And that is true in \nvarying degrees for the six States.\n  So we have to ask ourselves, why treat these six States separately \nand differently from all of the other States, and particularly where, \nin the other States, when people fall into bankruptcy, one of the first \nassets they are going to lose is their home.\n  So at the appropriate time we will have an opportunity to vote on my \namendment. As I say, this amendment closes that homestead loophole but \npermits, notwithstanding any other provision, the maximum amount of \nhomestead exemption that may be provided under State law shall be \n$300,000.\n  If you get a judgment against you for $400,000, they sell your home, \nbut at least that $300,000 is enough that you may be able to get \nsomething, particularly if you are an elderly person living on an \nincome of $1,200 or $1,500 a month, you might be able to survive.\n  But the idea outside of that is that you are effectively taking away \nthe homes and putting them at risk for 44 States and permitting 6 \nStates to effectively circumvent this legislation in a very important \nway. It is wrong. I hope our colleagues and friends can support our \nmeasure.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 70\n\n  Mr. President, I would ask that amendment be temporarily set aside, \nand I call up amendment No. 70.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment No. 70 is already pending.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is designed to protect single mothers \nand their children, who are forced into bankruptcy because they did not \nreceive the child and spousal support they were entitled to, from the \nharsh provisions of this bankruptcy bill. Single mothers are 50 percent \nmore likely than married people to go bankrupt and three times more \nlikely than childless people to go bankrupt. That statistic tells a \ngreat deal about the reality of why people are in bankruptcy.\n  The proponents of this bill argue that people file for bankruptcy \nbecause they are spendthrifts looking to escape their financial \nobligations. But this stereotype is terribly wrong. The bankruptcy \ncourts are filled with the cases of hard-working people who were pushed \nover the financial brink because of a family health crisis, a lost job, \nor a failure to receive child support. These are the people this bill \nwould turn the screws on, looking to squeeze out a few more dollars for \nthe credit card companies.\n  The amendment focuses on this last group, on single parents trying to \nraise their children without the financial support they were supposed \nto receive from the absent parent. It would exempt from the onerous \nmeans test a single parent who failed to receive child support or \nspousal support that she was entitled to receive pursuant to a valid \ncourt order totaling more than 35 percent of her household income \nwithin a 12-month period. No wonder such a person ended up in \nbankruptcy. She was never paid more than a third of the income she \nexpected over an entire year to help raise her children, to provide for \ntheir basic needs and well-being. Under those circumstances, she had no \nchoice but to fall back on borrowing to support her family. She was not \nirresponsible. What she did was unavoidable.\n  Few people realize the magnitude of this problem. In 2004, $95 \nbillion in child support--$95 billion--was uncollected. Failure to \nreceive that child\n\n[[Page S2323]]\n\nsupport put millions of single-parent families in a deep financial hole \nthrough no fault of their own, and it is the children who suffer the \nmost in these situations. Why on earth would we want to make things \neven more difficult for these families? Most single moms have to \nstruggle to make ends meet. They are working in low-wage jobs without \ngood benefits. Over three quarters, 78 percent, of them are \nconcentrated in four typically low-wage occupational categories. When \nthe economy is tough, they are often the first ones let go.\n  The poverty rate for single moms is nearly 40 percent as compared to \n19 percent for single fathers. It is no wonder that single mothers are \nnow more likely to go bankrupt than any other demographic group--more \nthan the elderly, more than divorced men or married couples, more than \nminorities or people living in poor neighborhoods. Yet this legislation \nwould deny traditional bankruptcy relief to many single-parent families \nwho never received the child support they were owed. Instead, they \nwould have to keep paying those credit card bills for another 5 years. \nIs that fair? I can't believe that a majority of my Senate colleagues \nthink it is.\n  I am asking them to extend a little compassion to these single \nmothers struggling to raise their children.\n  The following women's and children's organizations continue to oppose \nthis bill: The National Women's Law Center, the National Partnership \nfor Women and Families, National Organization for Women, Parents for \nChildren, YWCA, Business and Professional Women, the Children's Defense \nFund, Voices for America's Children. They do so because of the \nparticularly harsh provisions of this bankruptcy bill and the heavy \nweight it puts upon women generally and most particularly on innocent \nwomen who are being denied child support and alimony and because they, \nthrough no fault of their own, run into this kind of a financial \ncrisis. This legislation will impose harsh provisions upon them, and \nthey will be treated not just in bankruptcy but they will be treated \nwith the harsh provisions that will effectively put them in indentured \nservitude for the next 5 years.\n\n  The National Women's Law Center, in writing to urge opposition to S. \n256, says it is harsh on economically vulnerable women and their \nfamilies. They point out that the bill would inflict additional \nhardship on over 1 million economically vulnerable women and families \nwho are affected by the bankruptcy system each year--1 million women, \nthe majority of whose only problem is that their husbands have failed \nto provide alimony and child support. And we are going to wrap them in \nwith the spendthrifts who run amok with their credit. These are \ninnocent individuals. We are saying that the harsher provisions of this \nbankruptcy law--that is going to indenture these women for 5 years; \nthey can get judgments against them for 5 years--will exist for these \nfamilies, women forced into bankruptcy because of family breakups, \nfactors which account for 9 out of the 10 filings of women who are owed \nchild and spousal support by men who file for bankruptcy.\n  It is going to be more difficult for the women to even get the \nalimony from their husbands who may be in bankruptcy but needing to owe \nalimony to their wives, because the husbands are going to be subjected \nto the provisions in this legislation and that is going to make the \nwife compete with the credit card companies. So that is going to be \nanother burden which these individuals are going to have to face.\n  I hope we can find some support for this amendment because we are \ntalking about perhaps among the most innocent group of people who will \nbe caught in this. We have talked about single moms. We have talked \nabout the National Guard and Reserve. We have talked about those who \nhave been hit by the medical bankruptcy. All, through really no fault \nof their own or very little fault of their own, are going to be facing \na very harsh future.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 69\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, next I will address amendment No. 69, \nwhich I believe is pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, one of the extraordinary phenomenons we \nare facing at this time is the outsourcing of American jobs, the \nmovement of American manufacturing jobs out of this country--by and \nlarge to the Far East but to other countries--and the growth of what we \ncall ``temps''--companies that provide temporary workers. Those \ntemporary workers have few, if any, benefits. So, obviously, when they \nrun into challenging health crises and more limited incomes, they are \nfacing the dangers of bankruptcy.\n  That is why I am offering this amendment--to ensure that workers who \nhave lost their jobs or who have an illness or injury that prevents \nthem from working are not unfairly thrown into the harsh means test \ncreated by this bill. This means test puts additional burdens on the \ndebtors already trying to get their lives and finances back together \nafter a difficult period.\n  The means test applies to those debtors whose average income for the \n6-month period prior to filing bankruptcy is above the median income. \nSome debtors forced to file for bankruptcy because they lost their jobs \nare already exempt because they had no income in the last 6 months, but \nthose who lose their jobs within 6 months before the filing for \nbankruptcy can be fairly included in the means test based on income \nthey are no longer earning. My amendment would correct this problem. It \nprovides that income from any job in which the debtor is no longer \nemployed and income from any activity in which he can no longer engage \ndue to a medical disability will be excluded from this calculation.\n  Mr. President, if we look at what has been happening in the economy, \nparticularly to those individuals who are unemployed, many of them have \nbeen looking for employment for some period of time. If we look at the \nnumbers of unemployed workers in January 2001, it was 6 million. In \nFebruary 2005, it is 8 million. We are in a period where those who are \nunemployed are unemployed for a longer period than at any time in \nrecent history.\n  This chart shows what happens in recoveries. The recoveries before \n1991--the increase in terms of the employment and recoveries beginning \nin 1991 are here, and our current recovery shows that it is very light \nin terms of the total number of jobs that are created.\n  This is one of the important charts, Mr. President. This has 8 \nmillion Americans competing for 3.4 million jobs. That is the economic \ncondition for workers in this country: 8 million people are looking for \n3.4 million jobs. Obviously, there are going to be many millions of \nAmericans who are not going to be able to get those jobs. When they \ncan't get the jobs, they don't have the unemployment compensation, and \nthey are unable to provide for their families, what happens? They end \nup in bankruptcy.\n  We are trying to say that for those individuals--by and large \nindividuals who have lost their jobs because of outsourcing--the best \nprojection is that we are going to lose 3.4 million jobs; 3.4 million \njobs are at risk of being shipped overseas. 540,000 jobs in 2004; \n830,000 in 2005; 1.7 million in 2010; and 3.4 million in 2015. \nBasically, when the manufacturing jobs go overseas, individuals lose \ntheir income, or if they are able to get some income, it is as a part-\ntime worker with no health coverage. Their income goes down \ndramatically. What happens to those individuals? They end up in \nbankruptcy through no fault of their own. These are Americans who want \nto work.\n  From 2001, we have seen 2.8 million manufacturing jobs lost; 2.8 \nmillion jobs were lost. These are the jobs with good benefits, good \nwages, the jobs that are the backbone of America. When you take 2.8 \nmillion of these jobs out of the market and you have 8 million people \nchasing 3.4 million jobs, we know there are going to be millions of \nAmerican workers who are going to find increasing pressure in providing \nfor their families. That is what is happening today.\n\n[[Page S2324]]\n\n  What we are saying is, if these workers are going to be forced into \nbankruptcy because they have lost their jobs, they are not going to \nhave to fall into the cruelest part of the bankruptcy. That is all we \nare saying. We have done this. I have been here when we had our trade \nadjustment assistance. We said some industries were adversely affected \nbecause of imports. We provided some consideration for those workers. \nWe are finding out now that we are losing hundreds of thousands and \nmillions of jobs that are being moved overseas. The result is that many \nof these individuals are unable to have the kind of income they need, \nand they are forced into bankruptcy. When they are forced into \nbankruptcy, we are saying that they don't go into chapter 13; they go \nin and meet their responsibilities and get a fresh start. They don't go \ninto a chapter 13, which will force them to continue to pay for 5 \nyears.\n  If you look at this chart, you will see that 49 of the 50 States have \nlost manufacturing jobs. So this reaches the whole dimension of this \nlegislation because this legislation is national. This particular \nchallenge is national. There is obviously a great deal more focus on \nthis in the industrial heartland, in New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, \nIndiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, and many of those States, and \neven in Massachusetts we have lost 83,000 manufacturing jobs. There are \nplenty of other jobs, such as in North Carolina where they lost 163,000 \njobs.\n  So we have to ask ourselves, what happens to these individuals? We \nknow what happens to them. We know that if they can get a job, they are \ngoing to be paid a good deal less. If they cannot, they will run out of \nunemployment compensation. We are not providing extended unemployment \ncompensation, and we know that the final catch is that in this economy, \nthe health insurance is up, college tuition is up, housing is up, and \ngas is up. It is forcing these individuals into bankruptcy.\n  All we are saying for those individuals who have lost their jobs--\njobs that have gone overseas, lost manufacturing jobs--and are unable \nto get those jobs and are forced into bankruptcy, that they will not \nhave the harshest provisions of bankruptcy directed upon them. We ought \nto show some consideration to them. These are not spendthrifts, Mr. \nPresident. These are hard-working Americans who, 5 years ago, would not \nbe facing this particular challenge, and now they are. We ought to at \nleast give them some consideration.\n  Mr. President, I think I have until 2:45.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we in the Senate were elected to serve \nthe people. It is our solemn duty to fight for the American people \nevery single day, for the values they share and the priorities they \ncare about most. Above all else, the American people expect us to stand \nfor fairness, freedom, and opportunity. Those values are the \ncornerstone of the American dream. We believe that if you live right \nand work hard, you should be able to care for your family. You should \nbe able to afford a comfortable home in a safe neighborhood. You should \nbe able to put your children through school and in college. You should \nhave time to spend with your family, practice your faith, and \ncontribute to your community.\n  We also believe that when life throws you an unexpected setback, you \ncan count on your neighbors to pitch in. If you lose your job or you \nfall seriously ill, we all want to help out. You should be given a \nsecond chance to pick yourself up, dust yourself off, work hard, and \nreclaim the American dream for you and your family. That is the \nAmerican way. That is the American spirit. That is what our bankruptcy \ncourts should be about: giving average Americans who have lived \nresponsibly a second chance.\n  This bill before us turns the American dream into the American \nnightmare. This bankruptcy bill turns its back on our most basic values \nas Americans. It is not a bill of the people, by the people, or for the \npeople. It is a bill of the credit card companies, written by the \ncredit card companies, and for the credit card companies, and it has no \nplace in America.\n  This bill is about greed. It is about the most profitable \ncorporations in America--the credit card companies--using the Senate to \nenhance their profits, even more by shaking down hard-pressed Americans \nin bankruptcy court. It stacks the deck in favor of the credit card \ncompanies and against American families who do everything right but \nfind themselves in bankruptcy because they lose a job, fall ill with \ncancer, or get divorced.\n  I am reminded of the words of Leviticus in the 25th chapter. It \nreads:\n\n       If one of your brethren becomes poor, and falls into \n     poverty among you, then you shall help him, like a stranger \n     or sojourner, that he may live with you. Take no usury or \n     interest from him; but fear your God, that your brother may \n     live with you.\n       You shall not lend him your money for usury, nor lend him \n     your food at a profit.\n\n  But this bill ignores those words. It allows the credit card \ncompanies that charge outrageous interest rates, exorbitant fees, and \nforce you into bankruptcy to still win back almost every dime in \nbankruptcy court against Americans who have fallen on hard times. This \npillaging of the middle class must come to an end.\n  Today we will pass a bankruptcy bill that rewards the credit card \ncompanies at the expense of average Americans. Last month, we passed a \nclass action bill that makes it harder for average Americans to hold \nbig corporations accountable, and we have a President who wants to give \nyour Social Security away to Wall Street.\n  Credit card companies, big corporations, Wall Street--when is this \nPresident and this Republican Congress finally going to give the \nAmerican people just 1 minute to debate their issues? When are we going \nto make their health care more affordable so they do not have to worry \nevery night if one of their children gets sick? When are we going to \nmake college more affordable so parents can proudly send their children \nto college to build their own futures? When are we going to fight for \nclean water and clean air so we can raise our families in health? When \nare we going to compete for good jobs, not by lowering the pay but by \nraising our skills in the global economy? When are we going to fight \nfor a secure retirement for Americans who have lived responsibly and \nworked hard all of their lives? When is the Senate finally going to \nstand up and fight for the American people?\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise to encourage my colleagues to \nsupport two amendments that seek to provide some protections to \nfamilies who face the devastation of medical bankruptcy.\n  I thank Senator Kennedy for offering these amendments that I am proud \nto be a cosponsor of. The first would exempt from the means test \ndebtors whose severe medical expenses have caused their financial \nhardship and forced them to file for bankruptcy, and the second would \nprovide a homestead exemption to medically distressed debtors of \n$150,000 in equity in their primary residence.\n  These amendments are critical and will help ensure that families do \nnot have to declare bankruptcy and lose their homes just because they \nget sick.\n  Medical bankruptcy has skyrocketed in recent decades. In 1981, only 8 \npercent of personal bankruptcy filings were due to a serious medical \nproblem. In contrast, a recent study by researchers from Harvard Law \nSchool and Harvard Medical School found that half of personal \nbankruptcies filed in this country are now due to medical expenses. And \nwhat is most astonishing about this is that three-quarters of the \nmedically-bankrupt had health insurance at the onset of their illness.\n  This means that each year, 2 million families endure the double \ndisaster of illness and bankruptcy. In my State of New York, more than \n38,000 of the almost 77,000 personal bankruptcies in 2004 were caused \nby medical expenses, impacting more than 100,000 New Yorkers.\n  On average, those bankrupted by medical expenses are middle-class\n\n[[Page S2325]]\n\nAmericans with children who owned their own homes, held jobs, and have \ncompleted some college education. Medical debtors are typical Americans \nwho got sick. Their out-of-pocket costs, starting from the onset of \nillness, averaged almost $12,000, and in the year leading up to \nbankruptcy their out-of-pocket expenses averaged more than $3,500.\n  These are families who desperately tried to avoid bankruptcy: more \nthan 20 percent reported going without food; more than 30 percent had a \nutility shut off, more than 50 percent reported skipping needed doctor \nvisits; and more than 40 percent failed to fill prescriptions in the 2 \nyears leading up to their A bankruptcy filing.\n  The Harvard study also found that those driven into bankruptcy by \nmedical expenses differ in an important way from other filers: they \nwere more likely to have experienced a lapse in health coverage leading \nup to their bankruptcy filing. In fact, a lapse in health coverage at \nsome point in the 2 years before filing was a strong predictor of \nbankruptcy, with almost 40 percent of medical debtors experiencing a \nlapse in coverage, compared to 27 percent of other filers.\n  For those bankrupt by medical costs, illness caused financial \nhardship not just because of medical expenses, but also because the \nillness forced them to work less or lose their employment entirely. In \nfact, 35 percent had to work less because of illness, and in many cases \nto care for someone else. And it is likely reduced work and even the \nloss of a job because of medical problems that resulted in a lapse in \nhealthcare coverage.\n  It's easy to see how the face of medical bankruptcy is the typical \nAmerican worker. An unexpected illness or accident leaves you unable to \nwork or unable to maintain your job full-time, which in turn leaves you \nwith less income to pay your medical expenses. Over time your access to \ncare is diminished because you can't afford the cost-sharing, are not \nseeking needed care to avoid expenses, or have lost coverage because of \nreduced work hours or job loss, and ultimately your health insurance \ncoverage lapses. Now you have no assistance with medical expenses and \nlittle or no income to pay the bills. It's a vicious cycle. And all \nbecause you or a member of your family got sick.\n  Unfortunately, rapidly rising health care costs will only exacerbate \nthis problem going forward. The number of Americans spending more than \na quarter of their income on medical costs climbed from 11.6 million in \n2000 to 14.3 million in 2004. And the pressure on employers to reduce \nbenefits and increase cost-sharing as a result of rising health costs \nis no less.\n  The solution to this problem is not to punish hard working men and \nwomen who on a different day, with different luck, wouldn't be just a \ntypical American who got sick. These Americans are already confronting \ndifficulties because of circumstances beyond their control. Let's not \nmake their situations even worse. We need to adopt these amendments and \nbegin the hard work of addressing the causes of medical bankruptcy and \nthe serious problems that face this nation's health care system.\n  Again, I thank Senator Kennedy for his work on these amendments and \nurge their adoption.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 67\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this amendment was going to be voted on, \nactually, earlier this morning, but there was a reason to delay it \nuntil this afternoon. I ask unanimous consent to have 1 minute to \nexplain the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question will be \non amendment No. 67, offered by the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Dodd. \nWithout objection, the Senator will be recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this amendment is simple and \nstraightforward. More than 1 million women in the coming year will file \nbankruptcy. The overwhelming majority of these women are mothers of \nyoung children. This amendment is designed to see to it that the needs \nof children will be met as persons go through the bankruptcy act. The \ncredit card companies certainly have a right to receive what resources \nare due them, but they should not be able to trump the needs of \nchildren.\n  Too often in this bill, in a variety of places, that is exactly what \nhappens. My colleague from Utah said this bill has been 8 years in the \nmaking. It would only take a couple of minutes here to try to redress \nsome of the inequities that exist when it comes to questions of \nproviding for the basic needs of children--educational needs, utilizing \nchild support, the earned-income tax credit, the child tax credit, and \nalimony to support the needs of children.\n  For over 100 years, since 1903, women and children have come first in \nour Nation's bankruptcy laws. This will be the very first time, without \nthis amendment being adopted, that children and families will take a \nbackseat to the credit card industry. That is a wrong priority for our \nNation.\n  Every major child advocacy group in this country supports this \namendment. I urge my colleagues to support it. This is one exception we \nought to make to get right the balance in this bill of the needs of the \ncredit card companies with the needs of America's children and \nfamilies. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n67, offered by the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Dodd, on which the \nyeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez).

The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, do we have an minute on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Further time requires unanimous consent.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent for a minute on each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. First of all, I want to pay tribute to my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Kohl, who has worked on this issue for many, many \nyears. This amendment closes one of the gaping loopholes in this bill, \nbut it is a loophole millions of dollars wide and millions of dollars \ndeep.\n  Right now, because a few States have no limit on homestead, the Ken \nLays, the Jeff Schillings, and the Dennis Kozlowskis in this world can \nhide millions of dollars or tens of millions of dollars of their assets \nfrom their creditors even after they go into bankruptcy. There isn't \nmuch fairness or balance in the bill so far, but this amendment will \nput a very small measure of balance in the bill by limiting the \nhomestead exemption nationwide to $300,000.\n  I ask my colleagues to vote for balance and fairness, and agree to \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this bill is all about fairness and \nbalance. This bill, as I introduced it minus the\n\n[[Page S2326]]\n\nSchumer amendment, is exactly the bill that Democratic leaders of the \nJudiciary Committee signed off on in the summer of 2002 when they \ncontrolled the U.S. Senate. I don't know how much more compromise you \ncan get than that. But this amendment would gut one of the major \ncompromises of this legislation that has evolved over that period of \ntime going back to August 2002.\n  The bill's homestead compromise that we have would create a Federal \ncap of $125,000 on the homestead exemption, but would allow those \nStates with higher or unlimited exemptions to take advantage of them as \nlong as they comply with the 2-year residency requirements and a 10-\nyear fraud reachback provision.\n  The bill's compromise is a good one that all parties have signed off \non. The Kennedy amendment would gut it.\n  I ask you to kill this amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment, and the clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and to lay \nthat motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this bankruptcy reform bill before the \nSenate, S. 256, is a 500-page bill, which has been the dream of the \ncredit card industry, banks, and financial institutions across America \nfor almost 10 years. What they are trying to do in this bill is make it \nmore difficult for someone to have their debts discharged in \nbankruptcy.\n  Now, of course, everyone understands our legal and moral obligation \nto pay our debts. But we recognized a long time ago that some people \nget into a situation where they are swamped with debt and cannot get \nout from under it. In the old days, they were relegated to debtors' \nprisons; they literally imprisoned them. In more civilized times, the \ndecision was made to have a civil court procedure, where you could go \nin and have your debts released, surrendering virtually all of your \nassets to start over. That is happening in America today. About 1.3 \nmillion Americans go into bankruptcy court for personal bankruptcies.\n  The credit card industry and the banks say too many people are \ngetting their debts discharged. So we are going to set up a new process \nin the bankruptcy court where we are going to ask more questions than \never and try to determine whether the person filing for bankruptcy \ncould conceivably pay back, over the next 10 years, $165 a month. And \nif they can pay back $165 a month, we will not discharge their debts. \nThey will end up walking out of court with the same debt they carried \nin, in most cases.\n  Now, for a lot of people, you would say, if you can pay back \nsomething, you ought to pay it back. But for many people, it means the \ndebts they have incurred that they cannot pay back will be dogging them \nand burdening them for the rest of their natural lives. So many of us \nhave said when you take a look at this bill, at least be sensitive to \nsome people who go into bankruptcy court through no fault of their own.\n  Senator Kennedy talked about people with medical bills, because of a \nmedical crisis in their family. A woman goes to the doctor with a lump \non her breast, and a mammogram shows it is breast cancer. She goes \nthrough extensive radiation, chemotherapy, all sorts of recovery time; \nshe cannot go back to work, and the bills mount up sky high and \ncomplications ensue. That is nothing that she has done wrong. There is \nno moral failure there. If her health insurance is not good, she is \nleft in a position where she can never, ever pay back the bills. That \nis not a person who should be put through a more rigorous procedure in \na bankruptcy court.\n  Senator Kennedy said that if you don't do anything else for that poor \nwoman and her family, at least say at the end of the bankruptcy court \nhearing she will still have a home, a roof over her head. So we asked \nfor a $150,000 homestead exemption so that a person could at least have \na modest home to return to after bankruptcy from a medical illness. \nThat amendment was rejected. Everybody on the other side of the aisle \nvoted against it.\n  I offered an amendment and said, what about the men and women in \nuniform today, the Guard and Reserve who are being activated. They \njoined thinking: once a year I may have to serve my State, my country \nfor a month or so. Now we are calling them into battle for a year, a \nyear and a half, and no end is in sight.\n  What if you were a member of the Guard? You have sworn to protect \nthis Nation. You are called into combat and leave behind your family \nand your business. And what if the business fails because you are gone? \nWhat if you are forced into bankruptcy? Could we not at least include \nlanguage in this bill to give special consideration to the men and \nwomen in uniform who are answering their Nation's call and may face \nbankruptcy? I lost that amendment 58 to 38. Not a single Republican \nwould vote in favor of that amendment.\n  The last amendment I am going to offer, much to the relief of my \nRepublican colleagues, is one which asks my friends on the other side \nto take one last look at this issue. Instead of applying that special \ntreatment or giving some help to all soldiers, guardsmen, and \nreservists who serve and may lose a business or go into family \nbankruptcy because they are overseas for America, I ask my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle to consider this: How about disabled \nveterans whose indebtedness occurred primarily while they were serving \nAmerica?\n  I have met some of these veterans at Walter Reed Hospital. They have \nlost limbs. They face terrible injuries. If they face a bankruptcy that \noccurred because of debts that happened while they were in service to \nour country, should we not give these disabled veterans a fighting \nchance in bankruptcy court? Should we not spare them the hurdles, \nobstacles, paperwork, and legal bills that the credit card industry is \ndemanding for people who go to bankruptcy court? This exemption will \nespecially help recently disabled veterans who, in addition to their \nphysical loss, have terrible financial difficulties.\n  The bankruptcy bill makes petitions for debt relief under chapter 7 \nsubject to a means test. I had a chart before. It is a long chart. Not \nonly do you have to file all the documents to go into bankruptcy court, \nbut this new 500-page bill lays it on you again and makes you file \nanother ton of documents to see if maybe you could pay back $150 or \n$175 a month over the next 10 years.\n  So I am giving relief to disabled veterans. I am not going to \napologize for that. A lot of us get up on the floor and praise them for \nwhat they have done.\n\n[[Page S2327]]\n\nWe should. For goodness' sake, they are protecting us, our families, \nand our homes. Is it too much to ask that we give them a break in this \nharsh bankruptcy bill from the worst part?\n  The amendment specifies the exemption applies only if ``the debtor is \na disabled veteran and the indebtedness occurred primarily'' while they \nwere on active duty. To qualify for this exemption, a disabled veteran \nmust have incurred most of their indebtedness--more than 50 percent of \ntheir indebtedness--while on duty.\n  The Disabled Veterans of America estimates there are 2.3 million \ndisabled veterans. According to the Department of Veterans Affairs' \nannual report, the average disabled veteran receives only $7,861 in \ndisability compensation each year. That is not a lot on which to live. \nSadly, this amount varies widely. Veterans in some States do much \nbetter than veterans in others. Unfortunately, my home State falls into \nthe ``others.'' We receive less than half on average of disability \npayments paid in other States.\n  In considering whether to support this amendment, I invite my \ncolleagues to reflect for a moment on the physical and financial \nsituations some of our disabled veterans face. Their hardships today, \ncombined with their earlier service, make them twice heroes, in my \nbook. If any group of people deserves some relief from this burdensome \nprocess, it is America's disabled veterans who suffered physical and \nfinancial devastation while they were wearing a military uniform and \nrisking their lives for America.\n  I invite all my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to join me in \ncosponsoring this amendment and make this rather small but I think \ndeeply worthwhile adjustment to the bankruptcy bill.\n  It is my understanding that Senator Leahy will be coming to the floor \nmomentarily, unless Senator Grassley seeks recognition at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this would be a good opportunity for us \nto consider the general environment and the reason for this \nlegislation.\n  First of all, there has not been any major rewrite of the bankruptcy \nlegislation for more than 25 years. During that period of time, there \nhas been a dramatic change in the economy, particularly the \nglobalization of the economy. It has brought about reasons for changing \nparts of the Bankruptcy Code.\n  We have gone from around 300,000 bankruptcies a year to a high of 1.6 \nmillion or 1.7 million bankruptcies a year. So there has been an \nexplosion of bankruptcies. Even in the best of times there has been an \nexplosion of bankruptcies. It has become an economic problem where the \naverage person in America is paying an additional $550 for goods and \nservices because somebody else did not pay their bills.\n  All of these things have brought about reasons for changing the \nBankruptcy Code. This legislation that is 500 pages that has been \nreferred to is not something that just has been dropped on the Congress \nof the United States.\n  First of all, at least 10 years ago, the Judiciary Committee set up a \ncommission of experts in bankruptcy, not made up of Members of \nCongress, a commission of people from the private sector and from \nacademia to study what needed to be done with the bankruptcy laws to \nbring them up to date with the global economy, to bring them up to date \nwith the changes in our domestic economy, and to look at the problem of \nso many people filing for bankruptcy.\n  This commission worked several months--more than a year--to produce a \nproduct. That was the basis for the introduction of legislation in \n1997. In that period of time, this bill has passed the Senate in \nseveral different Congresses and has passed the House in several \ndifferent Congresses, has been worked out in conference, an agreement \nbetween the House and Senate in several different Congresses, one of \nthose even reaching President Clinton for his signature. But it was the \nend of the year, and he pocket-vetoed it. We did not have a chance to \nreconsider that veto.\n  The legislation before us, as I have introduced it, and basically the \nlegislation that is before the Senate is legislation that has been so \ncompromised, except for the Schumer amendment--and I will not go into \nwhat the Schumer amendment is--but except for that amendment, the bill \nwe introduced and maybe four or five technical changes that were \naccepted in the Judiciary Committee is the legislation that was signed \noff on by Democrats who had a majority in the conference committee in \nthe year 2002 when the Democrats controlled the Senate.\n  Is that exactly the way that I would write this legislation? No, it \nis not. There are a lot of provisions in this bill I would like to be \ndifferent. But in the Congress of the United States as a whole--and \nparticularly in the Senate where there is no limit on debate, where \nfilibusters are possible, where the minority has rights they should \nhave, and the only place minority rights are protected--you have to \nreach compromises.\n  I know no better compromise that I could put before the Senate than \nthe wording of a compromise that was worked out between a Republican \nHouse and a Democratic-controlled Senate in the year 2002. That is what \nwe have before us.\n  There are probably a lot of people who do not want any bankruptcy \nreform, but they will probably end up voting for it because this bill \nin different Congresses has passed by a margin of 97 to 1 on one \noccasion. The last time it passed the Senate, I think the vote was 85 \nto 12.\n  I think all of this is evidence of a bipartisan agreement that the \nbankruptcy laws need to be reformed. I do not know what more evidence I \ncan give the American people of the way our political system works, the \nway the Congress works, to arrive at compromise, than the compromise \nthat I lay before the Senate.\n  We recently heard from my good friend, the Senator from Illinois, the \nDemocratic whip, that there have been many opportunities to help this \ngroup of people or that group of people or another group of people. We \nrefer to that sort of helping this group or that group or another group \nas a carve-out.\n  My colleagues have seen amendment after amendment that was introduced \nto do that. We defeated that, because there ought to be uniformity of \napplication of law across the United States, not separating something \nspecial for this group or that group or another group when it comes to \njustice in the bankruptcy courts. And if we added all of that up, we \nmight not have a lot of people left who are going to be affected by \nwhat a bankruptcy judge is supposed to decide, which is justice between \ncreditors and debtors.\n  In this legislation, we preserve one of the main goals of bankruptcy \nfor the last 100 or more years, and that is the principle of a fresh \nstart, where somebody is going to bankruptcy because they have problems \nthat they cannot deal with, financial problems, natural disaster, \ndivorce, medical, whatever it takes to get into financial trouble, that \nmight not be any fault of one's own.\n  To make it clear that we are not after people who do not have an \nopportunity--when people are below the median income of their State, \nthey are practically guaranteed a fresh start under this legislation, \nand if people are above the median income for their State, there is a \nsimple process called a means test, where one puts down all of their \nincome and assets and what they owe and through that makes a \ndetermination of whether they have the ability to repay some of their \ndebt.\n  My friend from Illinois mentioned the figure of $150 or $175 that \nmaybe over the next 10 years one would have to pay. If people have the \nability to repay some of their debt, should they not have to repay some \nof their debt? It seems to me to be fair to those people to whom they \ndo pay their debt.\n  So we preserve the principle of a fresh start, but we also establish \na principle that if one has the ability to repay some their debt, they \nare not going to get off scot-free.\n  It is just not those two principles that ought to be looked at to \nunderstand whether Congress might be doing the right thing. I am not \nsaying just an overwhelming vote in support of legislation is the only \nway that one ought to judge whether that legislation is justified, but \nsurely the extent to which things are more bipartisan in the way they \nare done in this body\n\n[[Page S2328]]\n\nought to be some justification that certain tests of justice and \nfairness are being done or they would not get that kind of support, \nbecause I do not know a single Senator who for the most part is not \nconcerned about doing right for the people of his State.\n  So that is the sort of consideration I hope the people of this \ncountry will give to this legislation, the need for it, the \njustification for it, the fairness of it, and most importantly those \ntwo principles of a fresh start for those who deserve it and the \nprinciple that if one has the ability to repay some of their debt that \nthey are not going to get off scot-free.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                            AMENDMENT NO. 83\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, am I correct that amendment No. 83 is \npending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nWarner, the senior Senator from Virginia, be added as a cosponsor to \namendment No. 83.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am joined by friends and colleagues, the \nsenior Senator from Maryland, Mr. Sarbanes, and the senior Senator from \nVirginia, Mr. Warner, in offering a bipartisan amendment that will \nmoderately preserve the current conflict-of-interest standards for \ninvestment banks. We are doing this to safeguard the integrity of the \nbankruptcy process.\n  Section 414 of the underlying bill would severely weaken the \ndisinterested persons rule. That was an important conflict-of-interest \nstandard. It has actually been part of the Bankruptcy Code since 1938. \nIt has been there before I was born. We believe that the standard \nembodied in current law is critical to protecting the interests of \ninvestors and the public.\n  So our bipartisan amendment is a modest compromise. It limits the \nconflict-of-interest prohibition, not a total exclusion but just 5 \nyears prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition. In other words, a \nprohibition which has been the bankruptcy law forever would now be cut \nback just to apply in the 5 years immediately preceding the bankruptcy. \nI think it is a reasonable compromise.\n  The current disinterested persons standards are intended to ensure \nthat professionals who advise a company in bankruptcy have no conflicts \nof interest, are neutral, and when we consider how huge some of these \nbankruptcy have been, Enron and others, we want somebody without a \nconflict of interest; we want somebody who can be neutral.\n  Since bankruptcy proceedings involve reexamining prior transactions, \nan investment bank that underwrote those prior transactions could not \nbe expected to act as a neutral, disinterested party. It is almost like \nsaying, I wrote these transactions when you went into this multimillion \nor multibillion-dollar bankruptcy but do not worry, I will now be the \ndisinterested party to advise you where we go now.\n  I think the reason we have the current standard, the reason it has \nworked well for nearly 7 decades, is because it has helped maintain \npublic confidence in the bankruptcy system.\n  Section 414 of the bill before us eliminates the current conflict-of-\ninterest standard. It is a standard that prohibits investment banks \nthat have had a close financial relationship with the debtor from \nplaying a major role in the bankruptcy process.\n  I have talked to a lot of people who are far more knowledgeable on \nthis than I, and they tell me you cannot expect that an investment bank \nthat served as an underwriter of a bankrupt company's securities would \nthen provide an independent assessment of that underwriting as an \nadviser in the bankruptcy of the company. In other words, you want to \nfind somebody who can give you an independent, neutral assessment in \nbankruptcy of the underwriting. You don't go to the person who did the \nunderwriting. Of course, they are going to say: Great job. Man, that \nperson did a great job, whoever it was--oh, that was me? Boy, I did a \ngreat job.\n\n  The investors, especially in these huge bankruptcies, the pensioners \nwho have suffered financial damage through the bankruptcy, deserve \nneutrality. They don't deserve somebody where it looks as if it is such \na cozy deal there is no way they are going to recover.\n  If the bill is passed in its current form, the investment banks that \nadvised or underwrote securities for companies such as Enron or \nWorldCom prior to bankruptcy, having advised or underwritten those \nsecurities, could then be hired to represent the interests of the \ndefrauded creditors during the bankruptcy proceeding. Just think of \nthis. The people who were involved in putting the creditors and the \ninvestors and the people whose pension money was in there, the people \nwho were involved putting all their money at risk, can now be hired to \nrepresent their interest.\n  There is a blatant conflict of interest and that is why it has been \nforbidden for seven decades. Firms that had a part in those companies \ncould then end up staying on the payroll in bankruptcy and they could \nmake huge profits, sometimes from their own fraud.\n  What kind of message are we sending to those everyday Americans who \ninvested for their kids' college or their own pensions, who suffered as \na result of corporate misdeeds, if we then say that is OK, now we are \ngoing to give a whole lot of money to the people who set this mistake \nup in the first place?\n  We talked to the National Bankruptcy Review Commission. They strongly \nrecommended that Congress keep the current conflict-of-interest \nstandards in place. Actually, in their report they concluded:\n\n       Strict disinterestedness standards are necessary because of \n     the unique pressures inherent in the bankruptcy process.\n\n  These are the people who understand this better than anybody in this \nChamber.\n  Supporters of the underlying bill have voiced their opposition to the \ninclusion of section 414. I wish they would listen to what a member of \nthe Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals said, Judge Edith Jones. She is a \nmember of the commission. She asked us to remove section 414. She said:\n\n       If professionals who have previously been associated with \n     the debtor continue to work for the debtor during a \n     bankruptcy case, they will often be subject to conflicting \n     loyalties that undermine their foremost fiduciary duty to the \n     creditors. . . .\n       Section 414, in removing investment bankers from a rigorous \n     standard of disinterestedness, is out of character with the \n     rest of this important legislation and . . . it should be \n     eliminated.\n\n  Again, if you have a bankruptcy of a WorldCom, an Enron, something \nlike that, and you have all these people with the pension money in it, \nthe kids' college funds in there, their business in there, their own \nretirement in there, you cannot then turn around and say we are going \nto let the same people decide what happens to you in bankruptcy as the \npeople who did the things that put us into bankruptcy in the first \nplace.\n  William Donaldson is the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange \nCommission. He wrote to us to express the opposition of the SEC to \nsection 414 of the bill. He said:\n\n       [We] believe that it would be a mistake to eliminate the \n     exclusion in a similar one-size-fits-all manner at a time \n     when investor confidence is fragile.\n\n  Keep that in mind. It does something further. Not only do we end up \nhurting the people who have to rely on the bankruptcy court being \nhonestly run, but he also wants to keep up investor confidence. He was \njoined in that position by his predecessor Arthur Levitt, and by a \nnumber of nationally renowned experts. National consumer organizations \nhave written to us to warn of the danger of weakening conflict-of-\ninterest controls, as this bill would allow:\n\n       If the participants in Enron's earlier financial dealings \n     had managed the investigation, it is quite legitimate to \n     wonder how many of these financial misdeeds would have come \n     to light in the first place. Without existing conflict-of-\n     interest prohibitions in place, it is possible that some of \n     the same firms that have come under investigation by the SEC \n     for illegal activities in the current corporate scandals \n     might very well have been allowed to serve as ``objective'' \n     advisers in this and other bankruptcy proceedings.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent a letter from the Consumer Federation of \nAmerica, the Consumers Union, Consumer Action, U.S. Public Interest \nResearch Group, and the National Consumer Law Center be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n[[Page S2329]]\n\n       There being no objection, the material was ordered to be \n     printed in the Record, as follows:\n                                                    March 3, 2005.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy\n     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Paul S. Sarbanes\n     Ranking Member, Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs \n         Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Leahy and Sarbanes: The undersigned national \n     consumer organizations strongly support your amendment to \n     strike a little noticed provision of pending bankruptcy \n     legislation (S. 256) that would weaken current conflict-of-\n     interest standards in the bankruptcy code. This provision \n     would, for the first time, allow investment bankers to offer \n     advice in bankruptcy restructuring cases about companies with \n     which they have had a close financial relationship prior to \n     bankruptcy. As advocates for small investors, we applaud you \n     for moving to eliminate this significant threat to the \n     interests of investors, employees and pensioners.\n       Section 414 of pending bankruptcy legislation would loosen \n     the current standard for ``disinterested'' parties that are \n     allowed to advise bankruptcy management or trustees as they \n     attempt to restructure debtor companies in a manner that is \n     fair to investors and other creditors. Of the several parties \n     that are automatically banned from offering advice because of \n     obvious conflicts of interest, Section 414 removes only one: \n     investment banking firms. This means that the same firms that \n     underwrote and sold stocks and bonds for a bankrupt company--\n     firms that in some cases may have participated in structured \n     finance deals with the company or otherwise played a \n     significant role in financial decisions that helped to land \n     the company in bankruptcy--could now be allowed to offer \n     restructuring advice to the management or trustee responsible \n     for maintaining impartiality and representing the interests \n     of creditors.\n       Corporate bankruptcy experts tell us that reexamining the \n     financial transactions that led to bankruptcy is one of the \n     most significant responsibilities of the post-bankruptcy \n     management (often called debtor-in-possession, or DIP, \n     charged with the duties of a trustee to protect all creditors \n     and investors.) This review includes determining what role, \n     if any, that outside advisers and financial partners played \n     in bringing about a company's downfall. Another of DIP \n     management's most important responsibilities is determining \n     the best source of financing for any restructuring. An \n     investment banking firm has obvious conflicts in both roles \n     and is very unlikely to be an advocate for review of its own \n     previous work or the deals in which it participated. It is \n     quite possible, for example, that an investment banker would \n     discourage bankruptcy management or trustees from pursuing \n     legal claims against the banking firm for illegal activities \n     of that firm that contributed to the bankruptcy. The landmark \n     settlement with the leading investment banks over their stock \n     research practices shows just how poorly these firms have \n     handled comparable conflicts in the past.\n       Imagine how the public would have reacted if the investment \n     banks that were later found to have profited enormously from \n     structured finance deals with Enron had been hired to offer \n     advice in the Enron bankruptcy. Indeed, if the participants \n     in Enron's earlier financial dealings had managed the \n     investigation, it is quite legitimate to wonder how many of \n     these financial misdeeds would have come to light in the \n     first place. Without existing conflict-of-interest \n     prohibitions in place, it is possible that some of the same \n     firms that have come under investigation by the SEC for \n     illegal activities in the current corporate scandals might \n     very well have been allowed to serve as ``objective'' \n     advisors in this and other bankruptcy proceedings. This \n     scenario is possible because, as you know, it often takes \n     months or longer to unravel the role of investment banking \n     firms in such cases, particularly cases that do not receive \n     the media and congressional scrutiny of an Enron or Worldcom \n     collapse.\n       In response to these conflict-of-interest concerns, \n     investment banking interests offer a familiar refrain. We can \n     offer better advice, they say, because we are intimately \n     aware of the distressed company's financial situation. This \n     response is eerily similar to that offered by the accounting \n     industry, as it loudly insisted that a conflict did not exist \n     when accountants served as both internal and external \n     auditors or received lucrative consulting contracts from the \n     same companies that they audited. But, if there is one lesson \n     we should have learned from the recent corporate crime wave, \n     it is that conflicts of interest matter. Investors paid \n     dearly to learn that lesson. And the markets have paid \n     through the loss of investor confidence.\n       Representatives of the securities industry have also \n     contended that this provision will merely provide bankruptcy \n     officials with the discretion to make a judgment about \n     whether a particular investment firm should be involved in a \n     bankruptcy case. But what if the details of an investment \n     firm's involvement with a bankrupt firm do not come to light \n     for months or longer, as was true in the Enron case? By that \n     time, a lot of damage could already have been done to \n     investor interests, and the credibility of the process would \n     have been hopelessly undermined.\n       For example, the Wall Street Journal reported on May 14, \n     2003 that investment firm UBS Warburg, ``was far more \n     involved in the inner workings of HealthSouth than previously \n     disclosed and maintained an unusually close relationship with \n     HealthSouth's embattled founder, Richard Scrushy.'' Yet, if \n     Section 414 of the bankruptcy bill had been law, it is \n     entirely possible that UBS Warburg could have been allowed to \n     serve as ``objective'' advisors in the HealthSouth bankruptcy \n     case.\n       Congress and the SEC have devoted considerable time and \n     energy over the past few years to eliminating just these kind \n     of conflicts in an effort to restore investor confidence. The \n     SEC has made important strides, for example, in implementing \n     the Sarbanes-Oxley corporate reform law and in cracking down \n     on Wall Street conflicts of interest. More recently, the \n     National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) has been \n     considering whether to place new limits on investment banking \n     firms' ability to write fairness opinions for deals in which \n     they are involved, since these firms could benefit \n     financially if a merger or acquisition is approved. By \n     allowing new financial conflicts, section 414 of S.256 runs \n     completely contrary to this trend.\n       Investment firms that have previously advised a bankrupt \n     company have a prima fascia conflict of interest and should \n     continue to be automatically prohibited from offering advice \n     in a bankruptcy restructuring case. We commend you for moving \n     to eliminate the conflicts-of-interest that this bill would \n     allow.\n           Sincerely,\n     Barbara Roper,\n       Director of Investor Protection, Consumer Federation of \n     America.\n     Travis B. Plunkett,\n       Legislative Director, Consumer Federation of America.\n     Susanna Montezemolo,\n       Policy Analyst, Consumers Union.\n     Linda Sherry,\n       Editorial Director, Consumer Action.\n     Edmund Mierzwinski,\n       Consumer Program Director, U.S. Public Interest Research \n     Group.\n     John Rao,\n       Staff Attorney, National Consumer Law Center.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. This is not the time to weaken conflict-of-interest \nstandards. If we are doing anything, we ought to be strengthening \nconflict-of-interest standards. The provisions Senators Sarbanes and \nWarner and I seek to modify are fundamentally at odds with the work of \nthe Congress and the SEC, fundamentally at odds with the work to \nrestore public confidence in financial and corporate transactions. I \nthank them for offering this with me.\n  All we want to do is to make sure we increase the confidence and \naccountability in our public markets for millions of Americans whose \neconomic security is threatened by corporate greed and not have the \nSenate put an imprimatur on the use of people with enormous conflicts \nof interest, especially when consumers are hurting so badly.\n  I see the senior Senator from Maryland. He is far more familiar with \nhow these things have worked in these major corporations. He is the \nauthor of the Sarbanes-Oxley bill. I yield the floor to the Senator \nfrom Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I thank the very able Senator from \nVermont, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. I am pleased to \njoin with him in offering an amendment to the Bankruptcy Act. This \namendment addresses a provision in the bill that would drastically \nweaken the conflict-of-interest protections of the Bankruptcy Code in \nregard to investment banks.\n  Section 414 of this bill makes sweeping changes in the conflict-of-\ninterest requirements of the bankruptcy process in regard to investment \nbanks. These changes are opposed by the Securities and Exchange \nCommission, by such legal experts as Judge Edith Jones of the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, Dean Nancy Rapoport of the \nUniversity of Houston Law Center. They were rejected by the National \nBankruptcy Review Commission of 1997.\n  In my view, section 414, if allowed to stay in the legislation as it \nis now written, would significantly raise the risk of abuse and \ntherefore I think it is imperative that we undertake to modify the \nprovision in the legislation. I am pleased to join with my colleague in \nseeking to do so.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the entire \nletter\n\n[[Page S2330]]\n\nfrom Chairman Donaldson, writing on behalf of the Securities and \nExchange Commission to Senator Leahy and myself in response to our \nletter asking for the views of the Commission.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                           Securities and Exchange\n\n\n                                                   Commission,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 22, 2003.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Leahy and Sarbanes: Thank you for requesting \n     the Commission's views on Section 414 of H.R. 975, which \n     would amend the ``disinterested person'' definition in the \n     conflict of interest standards of the Bankruptcy Code to \n     remove the specific provisions covering investment bankers. \n     On May 7, in response to a question from Senator Sarbanes at \n     a hearing of the Senate Committee on Banking Housing and \n     Urban Affairs on the Impact of the Global Settlement, I \n     expressed my personal views about this amendment. Now I am \n     pleased to convey the view of the Commission, which is that, \n     while it may be possible to draft language that would address \n     some of the concerns of the proponents of the amendment, \n     Congress should proceed very cautiously before loosening any \n     conflicts of interest restriction. While we recognize that \n     this one-size-fits-all statutory exclusion is controversial, \n     we believe that it would be a mistake to eliminate the \n     exclusion in a similar one-size-fits-all manner at a time \n     when investor confidence is fragile.\n       The current ``disinterested person'' requirement was \n     adopted at least in part in response to a 1938 study by the \n     Securities and Exchange Commission that provided extensive \n     documentation and analysis of abuses in corporate \n     reorganizations. The study concluded that a firm that served \n     as underwriter for a company's securities should not advise \n     the company about distributions to those security holders in \n     a reorganization plan. It further found that such a firm \n     should not advise the company about potential claims against \n     those involved with the company prior to the bankruptcy, \n     since this often would involve an assessment of transactions \n     in which the firm participated. However, we should note that \n     in the 65 years since the 1938 study was issued, bankruptcy \n     practices and procedures have improved significantly with the \n     addition of a dedicated bankruptcy judicial system, the \n     establishment of the U.S. Trustee's office, and the \n     strengthening of active creditors' committees.\n       We are aware of the arguments of proponents of the \n     amendment that the current statutory exclusion is too broad \n     because it covers firms that participated in any underwriting \n     of the debtor, even if it was years ago and the firm has had \n     no further involvement with the debtor. However, if the \n     exclusion is eliminated entirely, we are concerned that the \n     general protection in the statute--which relies on the judge, \n     at the outset of the proceedings, to forbid those with \n     materially adverse interests to the estate, its creditors, or \n     its equity security holders from advising a company in \n     bankruptcy--may well be insufficient.\n       We appreciate the opportunity to comment on this proposed \n     amendment. If you or your staff need any further information, \n     please contact my office.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             William H. Donaldson,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Chairman writes:\n\n       Now I am pleased to convey the view of the Commission, \n     which is that, while it may be possible to draft language \n     that would address some of the concerns of the proponents of \n     the amendment, Congress should proceed very cautiously before \n     loosening any conflict of interest restriction.\n\n  Chairman Donaldson, of course, noted the fragility of investor \nconfidence and the need to be very careful in easing these conflict-of-\ninterest provisions.\n  The existing provision in the law:\n\n       . . . was adopted at least in part in response to a 1938 \n     study by the Securities and Exchange Commission that provided \n     extensive documentation and analysis of abuses in corporate \n     reorganizations.\n       The study concluded that a firm that served as underwriter \n     for a company's securities should not advise the company \n     about distributions to those security holders in a \n     reorganization plan. It further found that such a firm should \n     not advise the company about potential claims against those \n     involved with the company prior to the bankruptcy, since this \n     often would involve an assessment of transactions in which \n     the firm participated.\n\n  We have strengthened, of course, bankruptcy practices and procedures \nover the years. We now have a dedicated bankruptcy judicial system, the \nestablishment of a U.S. Trustees Office, and strengthening of active \ncreditors committees. But, nevertheless, I think we continue to have a \nvery real conflict-of-interest problem here.\n  My colleague has pointed out the letter of Judge Edith Jones of the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, a very distinguished \nmember of the 1997 National Bankruptcy Review Commission. She pointed \nout that they had been asked to modify the disinterestedness standard \nin order to accommodate the geographic growth and increasing \nsophistication of professional firms of all kinds involved in Chapter \n11 bankruptcy. She said they rejected that in the Commission by a \nlopsided majority.\n  These were expert people on bankruptcy law. It was the wise and \nprudent way to proceed when we are considering making important changes \nof this sort. They noted that in order to protect the integrity of the \nbankruptcy process, it was important to maintain this disinterestedness \nstandard, so you don't have conflicting loyalties that may undermine \nthe fiduciary duties of the creditors.\n  Furthermore, it was noted--I think this is an important point--that a \nstandard of disinterestedness is necessary to maintain public \nconfidence in the integrity of the bankruptcy system.\n  We ought not to have a situation in which allegations can be made \nthat the conflict-of-interest situation is preventing a fair, reasoned, \nand objective judgment as to what ought to be done, and then they end \nup imputing hidden motives to the actors in the case.\n  It has been noted by Dean Rapoport, the Dean of the University of \nHouston Law Center, that one of the duties of the debtor in a \nbankruptcy case is to take a good, hard look at the pre-petition \nbehavior of those who dealt with or ran the debtor to see whether that \nbehavior contributed to the downfall of the debtor. Another duty is to \nsee how the debtor can raise new post-petition funds in order to \nfinance an effective reorganization. But those are two very important \nduties or responsibilities of the debtor in the bankruptcy case. Dean \nRapoport goes on to state that both of these duties--taking a good, \nhard look at the pre-petition behavior of those who dealt with the \ndebtor and also a good, hard look at how the debtor can raise new post-\npetition funds in order to help finance an effective reorganization--\nboth of these duties would be compromised if the same investment \nbankers that were involved with the pre-petition debtor were allowed to \nserve as the ``objective, post-petition investment bankers.''\n  Stop and think about that for a moment. Clearly, it highlights a \npotential conflict of a very significant dimension.\n  There is an argument made that the bankruptcy court would still have \nto review this and could make a factual finding that there was not \ndisinterestedness present. But she noted, and I quote, ``the current \nstandard saves the bankruptcy court from having to make time-consuming, \nfactual findings regarding the disinterestedness of those categories \nwhich by their very nature are rife with conflicts of interest. \nRemoving investment bankers from the exclusion list will increase the \ntime, cost and attorneys fees for every bankruptcy case without \nincreasing the benefits to the estate as a whole.''\n  The final report of the National Bankruptcy Review Commission pointed \nout the strict disinterestedness standards are necessary because of the \nunique pressures in the bankruptcy process. The trustee and his \nprofessionals are required to act as a fiduciary to the estate, its \ncreditors, and other parties in interest, and the court. The \ndisinterestedness standard is designed to ensure that all issues \nrelevant to the administration of the estate are properly raised and \nvented before the court. Therefore, we are trying to avoid a situation \nin which there could be a perception or an allegation of favoritism to \nfavor one party over another, the charge that they are taking it easy \non one group or group of creditors, or to refuse to pursue possible \nclaims or avenues of inquiries because of any indirect or direct \npressures.\n\n  The proponents of the provision that is in the legislation which we \nare seeking to modify by this amendment argue\n\n[[Page S2331]]\n\nwe should simply give the discretion to the bankruptcy judge to allow \ninvestment banks to serve as advisers even if those banks underwrote \nsecurities with companies that subsequently filed for bankruptcy, \nleaving it to him to make a determination in that regard.\n  The SEC in its letter to us on that point said:\n\n       If the exclusion is eliminated entirely--\n\n  Which is what this legislation does----\n\n     we are concerned that the general protection in the statute \n     which relies on the judge, at the outset of the proceedings, \n     to forbid those with materially adverse interests to the \n     estate, its creditors, or its equity security holders from \n     advising a company in bankruptcy--may well be insufficient.\n\n  Dean Rapoport of the University of Houston Law Center pointed out \nthat the current disinterestedness standard saves the bankruptcy court \nfrom having to make time-consuming, factual findings regarding the \ndisinterestedness of those categories which by their very nature are \nrife with conflicts of interest. Removing investment bankers from the \nexclusion list will increase the time, cost and attorney fees for every \nbankruptcy case without increasing the benefits to the estate as a \nwhole.\n  The amendment seeks to address one of the arguments that has been \nraised by the proponents of section 414, which is that the current per \nse prohibition on investment banks that have underwritten securities of \na company in bankruptcy remains in effect as long as those securities \nremain outstanding, no matter how many years ago it may have taken \nplace. It may well have been many years prior to the bankruptcy and the \ninvestment bank involved might no longer have a close connection to the \nbankrupt company.\n  Senator Leahy and I have modified the original amendment which we \nplanned to offer which would simply go back to the current law \nprohibition, and instead in this amendment we are offering a \nprohibition on investment banks that have underwritten securities of a \ncompany within 5 years prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If the Senator will yield for a question without losing \nhis right to the floor, I ask the Senator from Maryland, if the bill \nwas passed in its current form, could investment banks that advised or \nunderwrote securities for companies such as Enron or WorldCom that \nfiled bankruptcy, which ended up defrauding investors, could they then \nbe hired to represent the interests of the same defrauded creditors \nduring the bankruptcy proceeding?\n  The way the bill is now written, without our amendment, could they \nthen be hired to represent the interests of the defrauded creditors?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I was going to say that is absurd, but as far reaching \nas that sounds, the answer to the question is yes. That is one of the \nreasons the potential that results from this legislation is so far \nreaching.\n  Gretchen Morgenson, on April 6, 2003, had an article in the New York \nTimes headlined ``Advisers May Get Second Chance To Fail.'' She starts \nthe article as follows:\n\n       Do you think Salomon Smith Barney, the brokerage firm that \n     bankrolled WorldCom and advised it on a business and \n     financial strategy that failed rather spectacularly, should \n     be allowed to represent the interests of the company's \n     employees, bondholders and other creditors while WorldCom is \n     in bankruptcy?\n\n  She goes on to say:\n\n       If you answered no, you win a gold star for common sense \n     and for knowing right from wrong.\n\n  We are just trying to get a ``no'' answer put into section 414 of \nthis bill.\n  We have tried to make a reasonable and balanced modification that \nessentially preserves the basic conflict of interest protection but \ndoes allow this greater flexibility for investment banks that have not \nrecently underwritten securities for the company to serve as advisers \nin the bankruptcy. But to simply remove the existing provision in the \nlaw altogether is to open up the possibility for abuses of major \ndimensions. Therefore, I very strongly support the amendment being \nsponsored by Senator Leahy and by Senator Warner.\n  There is no public purpose that will be served by allowing section \n414 to remain in this legislation as it is currently written. In fact, \nto the contrary, it runs very counter to important public purposes.\n  Other articles of note include one by Alan Sloan in the Washington \nPost: ``Proposed Changes In Bankruptcy Law Twist Meaning Of `Reform' \nBeyond Recognition.'' He goes on to point out the potential \nimplications of this change.\n  There is also an article by Michael Krauss in the Washington Times \nheaded, ``Bankruptcy Reform . . . With a Thorn.'' He goes on to say \nthat he supports bankruptcy reform legislation but does not support \nsection 414 of the bill because it removes from the excluded list of \npeople not allowed to be employed in the bankruptcy the investment \nbankers who have had a connection with the company.\n  The amendment before the Senate is a reasoned and balanced proposal. \nWe have tried to listen to the arguments being made on the other side \nand respond to those that we think have some merit to them without \ncompletely doing away with the ``disinterestedness'' standard. You have \nto have confidence in the integrity of the bankruptcy system. The total \nelimination of the investment bankers in terms of being precluded \nbecause they have a conflict of interest situation is not going to \nbolster consumer and creditor confidence.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. It is a fair and \nbalanced amendment. It is badly needed. To fail to enact it will carry \nwith it a tremendous risk in terms of how our bankruptcy process \nfunctions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The chairman of the committee, the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania, is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I have secured the agreement of the managers to speak \nvery briefly about another matter. It involves the Coal Act, which has \nprovided benefit for many miners in Pennsylvania and throughout the \ncountry.\n  The Coal Act of 1992 mandated coal operators to fulfill their promise \nto provide their employees and families with health benefits, and those \nobligations could not be modified. As an original cosponsor of this \nlegislation, along with the Senators from West Virginia, Senator \nRockefeller, and Senator Byrd, I am very closely aware of the effect on \n14,000 retired coal miners and their dependents in Pennsylvania. \nNationally, this act affects over 60,000 individuals, including every \nState except for Hawaii. These health benefits form a central \nunderpinning for the medical care structure of the coalfield community.\n  It is a tough job being a coal miner. I have, in the course of my \nrepresentation of the coal miners, gone 30-stories-deep underground, \nridden in a cable car, crunched over like a corkscrew to avoid being \nhit by the ceiling as the cars moved in on the long wall to perform the \nmining operation.\n  The issue came forcefully home to me when I visited several hundred \nof the coal miners in Washington County, PA, more than a decade ago \nalong with Richard Trumka, distinguished Pennsylvanian who had been \npresident of the United Mine Workers and is now secretary-treasurer of \nthe AFL-CIO. We went to court to verify this program, which is vital \nfor the health care of these miners.\n  I was very surprised to see a Federal judge enter an order which said \nthat the bankruptcy proceeding in a case captioned Horizon Natural \nResources trumped the Coal Act. It is a surprise to me that that would \nhappen under the existing law.\n  I know we are operating under a unanimous consent agreement where \nthere has been a series of amendments set aside and we are in \npostcloture. Senator Rockefeller earlier made comments about this \namendment and was unable to secure agreement. In working through this \nbankruptcy bill we are laboring under a great many complications, a \ncomplication that if there are amendments unacceptable to the House, \nthere will be a conference, and a conference resulted in the defeat of \nthis bankruptcy bill several years ago.\n  This amendment is technically precluded at this time, but I wanted to \ntake the floor. And I have discussed it with the distinguished chairing \nofficer, Senator Grassley, the principal proponent of the bankruptcy \nbill. In my capacity as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I yielded \nto him because he\n\n[[Page S2332]]\n\nis the principal author. We have talked about it.\n  I understand we are not going to be able to get this amendment \nthrough at this time for technical reasons, but I wanted the 14,000 \nPennsylvania coal miners and the 60,000 coal miners nationally to know \nof the concern of Senator Rockefeller, Senator Byrd, and others. I have \nnot had a chance to catch Senator Santorum on the floor, but he has \nbeen very solicitous and very concerned about coal miners' \ninterests. But until I speak to him specifically, I would make only the \ngeneralized comment about his concern for the coal miners.\n\n  So what I intend to do at this time, recognizing there will be a \nsuccessful objection, is to send this amendment to the desk and offer \nthis amendment to the pending bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to laying aside the pending \namendments?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I \nwill object, but I would like to take just 30 seconds to explain that \nthere are problems with the Coal Act. They are within the jurisdiction \nof the Senate Finance Committee, and we ought to look at all these \nissues in the context of a comprehensive review and a comprehensive \nsolution.\n  So I would see a piecemeal approach, as is being done now through the \nbankruptcy bill, as, first of all, intervening in the jurisdiction of \nthe Finance Committee, which as chairman I should protect, and, \nsecondly, making more difficult the comprehensive solutions that we \nought to find. So I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, first, I thank my colleague from Iowa, \nwith whom I have served since January 3, 1981. We came to the Senate at \nthe same time, the sole survivors of 16 Republican Senators. I \nappreciate what he has said about taking a look at it.\n  I will be filing legislation to correct this, and I will be looking \nforward to the opportunity for a hearing in the Finance Committee. And \nI think other Senators will be joining me as well.\n  I understand the reasons we cannot have it in now, but let the 60,000 \ncoal miners nationwide take heart, and the 14,000 Pennsylvania coal \nminers, that this is an issue which we will pursue and I think prevail \non. We will ultimately win this, although not today.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues for letting me intervene.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 83\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I stand to speak in opposition to the \npending amendment. The pending amendment has been discussed as if it \nwere seeking to stop investment banking interests who are involved in \nworking with companies that face bankruptcy from continuing some kind \nof fraud or inappropriate conduct that helped to lead to the bankruptcy \nby prohibiting them from serving as investment bankers or investment \nadvisers following the bankruptcy proceedings or during the pendency of \nthe bankruptcy proceedings.\n  The fact is, however, section 414 of the bankruptcy bill and of the \nbankruptcy law does not eliminate the disinterested test for investment \nbanks. Let me explain the way the law works at this point.\n  For whatever reason, when our current bankruptcy laws were put into \nplace, a complete bar was put in place, so when a company goes into \nbankruptcy, its investment bankers cannot then function on behalf of \nthe company. They cannot be appointed by the judge to continue to work \nas the company that works out its bankruptcy difficulties, whether it \nbe in some kind of an ongoing bankruptcy proceeding or in a chapter 7 \nproceeding. Therefore, the disinterested test simply never applied \nbecause there was never any opportunity for an investment bank to serve \nin this role if it had had any relationship whatsoever to the company \ngoing into bankruptcy.\n  That posed a couple very serious problems. The first one is that \ninvestment banks that have no current relationship with the company and \nare possibly best suited to help them through their financial \ndifficulties are conflicted due to having some minor role in the \nunderwriting or some underwriting relating to the company years and \nyears and years ago. That is under current law. What this bankruptcy \nreform we are trying to put through is seeking to do is to address that \nproblem.\n\n  Similarly, investment banks that are most familiar with the issues \nfacing a distressed company and are actually working with that company \nin an attempt to avoid bankruptcy are then compelled to walk away from \ntheir clients in their biggest hour of need if bankruptcy becomes \nnecessary and the company has to make the bankruptcy filings. That is \nwhat this legislation that is being proposed is seeking to address.\n  The amendment would strike that and, instead of having a perpetual \nban, would have a 5-year ban. Now, admittedly, the 5-year ban would \nsolve one problem because it would make it so a company that 20, 30, \n40, 50 years ago was involved in an underwriting would not be \ndisqualified, but it still leaves disqualified all of the investment \nbanks that may have been involved even in a bundled underwriting or in \nsome effort to help this company in its financial dealings over the \nlast 5 years prior to bankruptcy. It eliminates those investment banks, \ntheir expertise, and their knowledge of the failing company, from \nconsideration in helping that company as it seeks to work through a \nbankruptcy.\n  Let me make it very clear: The proposed change in the statute does \nnot eliminate the disinterested test. In other words, a question was \nposed a moment ago on the floor as to whether, in the case of Enron, an \ninvestment bank that had been involved in an underwriting for Enron \ncould then have been appointed by the court, under the change in the \nlaw proposed here, to continue working with Enron after it went into \nbankruptcy proceedings. And the answer that was given on the floor was, \nyes, that is a possibility.\n  Well, first of all, the question assumes that any investment bank \nthat had been involved with Enron was somehow involved in fraud because \nEnron was involved in fraud. We do not necessarily know that. But that \ngets to the point of what the bill we are proposing is seeking to do.\n  The bill maintains current bankruptcy law requirements that if an \ninvestment bank is to be appointed by the court to work with the \nbankrupt company, the court must make a determination that this \ninvestment bank is disinterested, that it passes the disinterested \ntest. I would presume that if there were a participant in fraud, the \ncourt would not consider that to pass the disinterested test.\n  But the key point here is that what the proposal in the underlying \nbill seeks to accomplish is to have a judge take evidence, evaluate the \nissue, and make the determination of which investment bank is the best \nsuited, passing a disinterested test, to help this company as it seeks \nto work through the bankruptcy issues. And there will be many cases \nwhen the best suited financial advisers are those who have a history of \nworking with the company, of knowing the company's business, and of \nknowing the company's financial dealings, and being able to work with \nthem.\n  In fact, in many cases, I would assume it might be a financial \nadviser, an investment bank that has been working with the company for \nthe last 3 or 4 years to help them try to work through their problems, \nand for some reason, with what I consider to be a cookie-cutter \nsolution being proposed by this amendment, they would be disqualified \nsimply because they tried to help or were hired to help beforehand.\n  In fact, what we see here in this amendment is a chilling impact on \ncompanies going out and seeking investment bank advice before \nbankruptcy, if they know that bankruptcy is a possible outcome they may \nface, because they have a choice: Do we seek the best competent \ninvestment banking advice we can get before the bankruptcy, knowing \nthat the bankruptcy law will prohibit us from ever having that advice \nif we do end up having to file or do they say: ``We may have to file \nand, therefore, we will seek less competent advice or our second \nalternative so we can have our first alternative when we file \nbankruptcy''? Why put companies into that kind of a complex problem?\n  Section 414 would subject investment banks to the same disinterested \ntest as\n\n[[Page S2333]]\n\nother professionals. This is important to know. A company's legal \nadvisers are not subjected to an automatic ban; they are subjected to a \ndisinterested test. A company's accounting advisers are not subjected \nto an automatic ban; they are subjected to a disinterested test. And \nyet the effort here seems to say that for some reason we do not want to \nlet the investment bank advisers be subjected to the same disinterested \ntest. Instead, we want to presume that they are guilty of some \ninappropriate conduct because the company has not financially made it, \nand ban them from being able to work with the company once a bankruptcy \nfiling takes place.\n  It is another one of those one-size-fits-all cookie cutter solutions \nthat is coming from Washington, DC that is telling every bankruptcy \njudge across the country that they have no alternative in terms of \ntheir choice of who can be the investment bank advisers and supporters \nfor a company that goes into bankruptcy, if there is any connection in \nthe last 5 years between that investment bank and the company that had \nto file.\n  Bankruptcy courts currently review disinterestedness for all \nprofessionals, and 414 would allow judges the same discretion with \ninvestment banks as they have for attorneys and accountants. The \ncurrent law has created a market, frankly, in which a small club of \nrestructuring boutiques dominates the market for restructuring services \nin bankruptcy. In other words, they realize that if they even get close \nto a company before bankruptcy, then they won't be able to serve as a \npart of the restructuring effort for that company coming out of \nbankruptcy. So this sort of boutique business has developed where the \nonly alternatives the judge has to turn to are those companies that \nspecifically don't help until after the bankruptcy filing.\n  That is the issue we need to address. Do we want to create a system \nof investment bank advice for companies that are facing financial \ndifficulties in which those companies have to make a choice as to who \nthey will contact for support before the bankruptcy filing, knowing \nthat whoever they choose to help them in their investment banking will \nbe automatically prohibited from helping them if they do end up having \nto go into a bankruptcy?\n  Professionals are required to perform a firmwide review and disclose \nall actual and potential conflicts in their application to the court to \nbe retained by the debtor. All parties in interest, including \ndebtholders and shareholders, have the opportunity to make their \nposition known before the judge.\n  Another important point is, somewhere in the debate that has been \ngoing on today, we heard: The judge may not know; the judge may make a \nmistake; the judge may not be aware of all the facts; it is going to be \nvery expensive for the judge to have to go through and look at these \ninvestment banks to be sure that he knows whether they are culpable or \nwhether they are simply competent investment advisors.\n  The fact is, the costs that are being put onto the system now by \nthese blanket bans on investment banks are generating more costs to the \nrestructuring process than any cost that could be generated by having \nthe judge make a disinterested analysis. But even if the judge somehow \nmade a mistake, even if we want to hypothesize that judges are going to \nmake mistakes and bad actors might be allowed to be an investment bank \nadviser or participant in a bankruptcy, any time information becomes \navailable to make it evident that the disinterested test was not \nsatisfied, the judge can change that ruling and terminate the \nprofessional's engagement.\n  It seems to me what we need to do in our bankruptcy laws is to \npromote more flexibility. We need to give opportunities for all \ninvestment banks to participate with those companies in our economy, \nwhether they be strong or facing financial difficulties, and help them \nto the maximum of their abilities. And if it turns out some of those \ncompanies end up having to make a bankruptcy filing, then it is \nimportant that we protect the flexibility for the bankruptcy judge to \nselect the most qualified investment bank support to work out that \nbankruptcy circumstance.\n\n  That is what is in the best interest of our shareholders, in the best \ninterest of our economy, and in the best interest of the debtor and the \ncreditors. We must make certain that we don't allow one more very rigid \nFederal standard to continue to create this kind of difficulty in the \nbankruptcy process.\n  Two other points. First, all Senators have received a copy of this \nletter. There is a letter that was sent out which was signed by those \nin the industry who are involved in this, who very strongly indicate \nthat the reform and the flexibility this bankruptcy proposal promotes \nshould be supported. That includes the American Bankers Association, \nthe Bond Market Association, the Financial Services Roundtable, the \nFutures Industry Association, and the Securities Industry Association.\n  Frankly, although I know Chairman Donaldson has been quoted here, I \nam not aware that the SEC itself has ever taken a position on this \nissue. If that is the case, I stand corrected.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield on that?\n  Mr. CRAPO. I will yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The letter we submitted reflected the opinion of the \ncommission. Chairman Donaldson had indicated a personal view in a \nhearing, and then I sent a letter asking him for the commission's view.\n  Mr. CRAPO. And he responded on behalf of the commission?\n  Mr. SARBANES. It begins: ``Thank you for requesting the Commission's \nviews on section 414 of H.R. 975.''\n  Mr. CRAPO. I stand corrected on that.\n  Mr. SARBANES. In response to a question from me, he expressed his \npersonal views. He writes:\n\n       Now I am pleased to convey the view of the Commission . . .\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Reclaiming my time, I stand corrected on that.\n  This will not be the first time, even in recent months, that I have \ndisagreed with the SEC. Although I understand that your letter does \nspeak for the SEC, the fact is, there is one other point I want to \nmake. That is, as is the case with a number of the amendments we have \ndealt with in debate over the bankruptcy bill, which we have been \ntrying to move forward for 8-plus years, we face a situation in which \nwe are trying to keep this bankruptcy bill clean and not have \namendments that are objectionable to the House included in it so that \nwe again run into the problem of not being able to move the \nlegislation. This is one of those amendments. I am confident and I have \nan understanding that this is one of the amendments the House would not \nallow and would cause us to then have to go into conference and bring \ndown the bill.\n  The bottom line is, it is bad policy. We have bad policy in current \nlaw. The bill seeks to create the flexibility that will allow a \njudicial determination as to the best and most highly qualified and \ndisinterested investment bank advice for companies involved in \nbankruptcy. We should not change the underlying bill by substituting a \nrigid 5-year ban prohibiting many companies that are in the best \nposition possible to do the best good for the company that needs their \nhelp at this point from being able to serve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to respond to \nthe Senator from Idaho. I think this is important.\n  Elizabeth Warren, who is a distinguished professor at Harvard Law \nSchool and an expert on bankruptcy, has said there is a reason why the \nprofessionals who have worked for a business that collapses in a \nbankruptcy are not permitted to stay on. The company must go back after \nbankruptcy and reexamine its old transactions. Having the same \nprofessionals review their own work is not likely to yield the most \nsearching inquiry.\n  She goes on to say about the provision in the bill: It is not a \nprovision to ensure investor confidence or to enhance protection for \nemployees, pensioners, or creditors of failing companies.\n\n[[Page S2334]]\n\n  Let me make one other point which needs to be understood. To the \nextent an investment bank--and it needs to be understood that an \ninvestment bank has been viewed as integrally related to the financial \narrangements of the company, similar to creditors, security holders, \nand insiders--advised on the creation of a company's capital structure \nbefore a bankruptcy filing, it may itself be exposed to potential \nliability. As it works out the deal that permits the company to emerge \nfrom bankruptcy, it may be tempted to prefer the creditors who have a \npotential claim against the investment bank.\n  Now, that is the very sort of conflict that we simply ought not to \npermit. We address one point made by the Senator about a connection a \nlong time ago that is no longer relevant in the 5-year provision, and \nthe amendment takes care of that.\n  Beyond that, I think we would be making a grave mistake to allow this \nradical change to take place. I very much hope my colleagues will \nsupport the amendment offered by Senator Leahy, Senator Warner, and \nmyself.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we have had a good debate. I mentioned to \nthe Senator from Iowa, I don't know if other people wish to speak, but \nI am perfectly willing to go ahead and have a vote. I know the \nleadership is trying to move things along and get things going. I am \nwilling to have a vote.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I would like to speak for a short time.\n  Mr. President, under current law, investment banks are not allowed to \ncompete on the same playing field as other professionals. Right now, \ninvestment banks are precluded per se, in many circumstances, from \nrepresenting a debtor in a business bankruptcy if the investment bank \nacted as the investment banker for the company before it filed for \ncourt protection.\n  I think this is a draconian rule. The bill would give the bankruptcy \njudge the ability to determine whether an investment banker is \ndisinterested, just as the judge determines whether other professionals \nare disinterested. The provision in the bill, it seems to me, is not \nonly fair, but it will also safeguard the proceedings from any conflict \nof interest. Do we trust our Federal judges, or don't we, to make this \ndetermination? After all, the environment for this is in the \njudiciary--before judges. We happen to trust them for all other \nprofessionals involved in the bankruptcy proceedings, whether there is \nany conflict of interest for anyone involved. So then the question \nbecomes, why should it be different for investment banks?\n  I think the provision in the bill is fine as it is. It is part of the \ncompromise. We should allow a judge to make this determination and, \nthus, protect the integrity of the bankruptcy process. So I ask my \ncolleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, since we have the list of cosponsors of the \npending amendment, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from \nVirginia, Mr. Warner, be removed as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I checked with the majority staff and they \nhave no objection to my seeking to be recognized for up to 10 minutes \nas in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Indictment of Ramush Haradinaj\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, yesterday the International Criminal \nTribunal for the former Yugoslavia at the Hague, known by the acronym \nICTY, indicted a fellow that I met several years ago, a guy who was \nvery much involved in the carnage that took place at the time of the \nwar in Kosovo. His name is Ramush Haradinaj. This is a young man who \nlooks like he could lift an ox out of a ditch. A very hard, tough guy.\n  Until yesterday he happened to be the Prime Minister of Kosovo. He \nwas indicted for war crimes in Kosovo during the period of 1998 and \n1999. Mr. Haradinaj declared himself entirely innocent but resigned as \nPrime Minister, surrendered voluntarily, and flew to the Netherlands \ntoday to turn himself in. He also did something highly unusual in the \nBalkans. He issued a statement calling for calm in Kosovo.\n  From the creation of the Hague Tribunal a decade ago, I have \nsupported its vitally important work. Beginning with Judge Goldstone, \nmy staff and I have met with its chief prosecutors over the past \ndecade. I have great respect for Carla Del Ponte, the current chief \nprosecutor and for the court's judges.\n  I am confident that Haradinaj will receive a fair trial. Without \npresuming to pass judgment on his innocence or guilt, though, I would \nlike to comment--this is the first time I have ever done this--on my \npersonal impressions of him and also to put his arrest in a larger \ncontext relating to the entire territory of the former Yugoslavia.\n  Let me begin with my meeting with him in Pristina in January of 2001. \nWe discussed Kosovo's future, and he seemed genuinely to recognize that \nthe only way forward was for the rights of the Kosovo Serbs, and of \nother non-Albanian minorities to be guaranteed. During that trip, I \nflew by helicopter to western Kosovo where I visited the Serbian \nOrthodox Visoki Decani Monastery, a 14th century architectural \nmasterpiece which last year was named a UNESCO World Heritage site.\n  During the fighting in 1999, the Serbian Orthodox monks of this \nmonastery had saved Kosovar Albanians from persecution by Serb forces. \nAgain, these were Serbian Orthodox monks saving Kosovar Albanians most \nof them Muslims--from persecution by Serb forces.\n  Nevertheless, when I visited the Visoki Decani Monastery nearly 2 \nyears later, Father Sava and other monks told me that they were in \ngreat danger. In fact, Italian KFOR armored personnel carriers were \nlined up in the snow just outside the monastery's stone walls as a \ndeterrent.\n  Knowing that the territory around Decani is Mr. Haradinaj's political \nbase, I sent him a confidential letter after I returned to Washington. \nIn it I wrote that I was counting on him to personally guarantee and \nprotect the Serbian Orthodox monastery I had just visited.\n  In March of 2004, serious riots against Serbs and other non-Albanian \nminorities broke out across Kosovo. Hundreds of homes were destroyed, \nand many medieval Serbian Orthodox churches and monasteries were burned \nto the ground. KFOR proved unable or unwilling to prevent this \ndestruction. In fact, in several cases, the outrages occurred while \nEuropean KFOR troops stood by. One of the few venerable monasteries \nthat remained untouched was Visoki Decani. Mr. Haradinaj had kept his \npromise.\n  During the 1998-1999 war, Haradinaj was a leading commander of the \nKosovo Liberation Army, the KLA. Hence, his election as Prime Minister \nlast year was greeted with considerable skepticism. From all reports, \nhowever, in his brief tenure, he has earned nearly unanimous praise, \nincluding from the head of the U.N. mission in Kosovo, for his \nconstructive and effective leadership. I am told that even Serbian \nleaders in Belgrade privately acknowledge that of all of the Kosovar \npolitical leaders, it is Haradinaj with whom they could potentially \nnegotiate with the greatest degree of confidence.\n  Mr. Haradinaj's call for calm, which so far has been heeded, was \nbased upon a realization that a repeat of the violence of March 2004 \nwould deal a fatal blow to the Kosovars' hope that the process toward \nnegotiations on the final status of Kosovo can begin later this year.\n  I have said repeatedly that self-determination by the people of \nKosovo is ultimately the only realistic solution to\n\n[[Page S2335]]\n\nthe problem. Since more than 90 percent of the population is ethnic \nAlbanian, as is Mr. Haradinaj, with a collective memory of extreme \npersecution by the Serbian government of Slobodan Milosevic, I can't \nimagine they would ever vote for a return to being governed by \nBelgrade.\n  On the other hand, I have coupled my advocacy of self-determination \nfor Kosovo with the precondition that the personal safety and freedom \nof movement of all Kosovo Serbs, Roma, Ashkali, Egyptians, Turks, \nBosniaks, Gorani, and other non-Albanian minorities are being provided \nand are guaranteed for the future. As yet, unfortunately, this has not \noccurred. Mr. Haradinaj's statesman-like actions are intended to keep \nKosovo on the path toward Final Status negotiations.\n  In the overall post-Yugoslav context, Mr. Haradinaj's willingness \nafter his indictment to surrender voluntarily and go to The Hague is \nstriking. It stands in glaring contrast to the behavior of the three \nmost infamous individuals indicted by The Hague, all of whom are still \nfugitives, resisting arrest: former Bosnian Serb General Ratko Mladic, \nformer Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, and former Croation \nGeneral Ante Gotovina.\n  By their evasion of ICTY's indictments, all three are blocking their \ncountries' progress toward entering Euro-Atlantic institutions, a \nnecessary precondition for stabilizing the Western Balkans. The \nsurrender of Mladic, who is thought to be in Serbia, is necessary for \nSerbia's joining NATO's Partnership for Peace and for eventual NATO and \nEU membership.\n  Karadzic's unwillingness to give himself up is blocking Partnership \nfor Peace membership for Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n  Gotovina's fugitive status is holding up Croatia's promising \ncandidacy for EU membership.\n  Whatever the eventual adjudication of his indictment, Ramush \nHaradinaj by his dignified departure and public statement has proven \nhimself to be a patriot. The same cannot be said of Mladic, Karadzic, \nand Gotovina, whose selfish actions are standing in the way of much \nneeded progress for Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Croatia.\n  Whatever Mr. Haradinaj's fate, I want to publicly salute him for his \npersonal courage, for the statesmanship he has demonstrated over the \nlast two days, and for having kept his word by doing exactly what he \ntold me he would do with regard to the monastery. I wish him well. I \nhope justice is served, and I applaud him for his wise decision to \ncooperate with the Hague Tribunal.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be excused \nfrom voting for the remainder of the day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, those Americans who have been watching \nthis debate on bankruptcy reform for the last 8 days must wonder what \nin the world is happening in the Senate this evening where we have had \nthese prolonged quorum calls. We have had a series of votes over the \ncourse of the day. We had tentatively planned to have another series of \nvotes on amendments at 5 o'clock this evening.\n  But then because of the concern of our Republican colleagues on one \nparticular amendment, an amendment that would have addressed the \nprovisions in the underlying legislation that repeals the conflict-of-\ninterest provision for major banks, suddenly the quorum call goes in \nand there is no further action on the issue of bankruptcy.\n  This is absolutely amazing. Many of us have pointed out how this is \nspecial interest legislation. It was written by the credit card \ncompanies for the credit card companies. They are the principal \nbeneficiary.\n  The argument for this legislation, according to the proponents, was: \nLook, we have a number of spendthrifts in the United States. People \nought to act responsibly. This legislation will deal with it.\n  That was their argument. And that is an argument that those of us who \nhave differed with this legislation would gladly accept. The percentage \nof spendthrifts, so to speak, is anywhere from 5 to 7 percent of the \ntotal number of people who go into bankruptcy. Those of us who have \nbeen battling this legislation for the past several days all agree, we \nwould join up with our colleagues in a bipartisan way to address that \nissue. But that isn't what this bill is about.\n  This bill is about encumbering working families, primarily, who fall \non difficult times, as we have pointed out during the debate. We have \noffered a series of amendments. A number of my colleagues have offered \namendments. Every one of them has been defeated by our Republican \ncolleagues.\n  Now in the final hours of consideration of this legislation, because \none particular amendment is going to touch the banking industry and \nthey are unsure of the votes, they effectively call off all the votes \nfor this evening. That is what is going on here in the Senate.\n  If you want to put your finger on special interests, look what is \nhappening in the Senate at this moment. We have the Sarbanes-Leahy-\nWarner amendment, the authors of which were prepared to vote on. But \nno, the Republicans say, no, we are not going to let the Senate vote on \nthat, because they are not sure of the votes.\n  They are not sure of the votes. They are not sure that they have the \nvotes to defeat that particular provision that would override a \nprovision that is in the banking bill that repeals some conflict of \ninterest for banking interests. Isn't that something? Doesn't that \nreally show what this legislation is all about? Sure it does.\n  Why not call the roll? Why not call the roll? We have been listening \nabout let's move the banking legislation along; let's move it along. \nWhy do you have to take time when you are talking about what the impact \nof this legislation is going to be on the members of the National Guard \nand Reserves, who go overseas--the 20,000 that would be bankrupt this \nyear and subject to the harsh provisions of this legislation.\n  And then we had a phony amendment that was accepted here that will do \nvirtually nothing to protect them. What about the homestead exemption, \nwhich says that those who exist in five States are going to be able to \nsquirrel tens of millions of dollars away so that if they go into \nbankruptcy they would be able to protect their million dollar homes? \nWhy not have fairness across the country? Oh, no, we cannot do that \nbecause we have a delicate compromise. What is that delicate compromise \nthey are talking about? I thought this legislation was going after \nspendthrifts. We agree to go after them, but when we know half of the \npeople going into bankruptcy are going there because of health care \nbills that are run up, with 75 percent of those individuals covered \nwith health insurance, but because they have a heart attack in their \nfamily or because they have a stroke in their family, or because they \nhave a child who has spina bifida in their family, they are subject to \nthe harsh provisions of this legislation that will virtually make them \nan indentured servant of the credit card companies for the next 5 \nyears. That is what is in this bill. We have pointed that out. No, we \nwill vote that down. We will vote down any consideration for the \nNational Guard and any consideration for the Reserve if they happen to \nbe individuals who may be running a family business, one or two working \nin a particular employment or a mom-and-pop store, and they go overseas \nand they are going to serve for many months, and the store bellies up, \nthen they are subject to the harsh provisions of this. No, we are not \ngoing to give consideration to those veterans. What about those \nindividuals? It could happen to any family--except Members of the \nSenate, who have very good health care. It would not happen to us. But \nwe cannot get health care for the rest of\n\n[[Page S2336]]\n\nAmericans. No, that is just too bad, that they have a heart attack in \ntheir family, or a stroke, or that they have a sick child, they are \ngoing into bankruptcy, and they are going through the harsh provisions \nof bankruptcy that are going to make them pay for the next 5 years to \n10 years $15 or $20 a week, and continue to bleed them. That is what is \nin this bill.\n  The American people are beginning to understand it. We talked about \nall the single women who go into bankruptcy because their ex-husbands \ndo not pay them money for child support. Do you think we could have \nsome understanding or some sensitivity to their particular problem? \nAbsolutely not. No way. Let's take those spendthrifts and put it right \nto them. That is what this bill does. No, we cannot deal with that. \nWhat's your next amendment? Let's go on, it is getting late. Let's have \ntime. Time, they say. What has happened here for the last 3 hours? The \nclock has run and they cannot figure out whether they have the votes to \nprotect the banking industry. That is what is going on. The Republicans \nare trying to find out whether they have the votes to protect the \nbanking industry, and they get all worked up when we call this special \ninterest legislation. You have not seen special interest legislation \nuntil you see this bill.\n  We used to, around here, look at a piece of legislation and say, who \nbenefits and who suffers with this? Well, it is very easy to find out \nhere who benefits. It is the credit card companies. They are the ones \nwho are going to be put in the catbird's seat. Their estimate in the \npassing of this bill--listen to me--this legislation makes the \nbankruptcy courts of the United States the collection agencies for the \ncredit card industry of America. Who do you think pays for the \nbankruptcy courts? You do, Mr. America. Ordinary Americans pay for \nthose bankruptcy judges and the bankruptcy courts, and they are going \nto be out there as a collecting agency for the credit card companies. \nThat is what this is about.\n\n  It has been difficult to get anyone on the Republican side to \nunderstand that. Well, we voted on this some years ago. We have a \nchanged condition from some years ago. Sure, we have the problems of \nbankruptcy. What about Enron and WorldCom? What about Polaroid in my \nown State? When they went belly up, the people not only lost their \nhealth insurance and pensions, they also lost their investments in what \nwas called an ESOP--their requirement to invest in the companies. They \nall lost out on it. We are sure of one thing: Ken Lay and all of the \npeople at Enron have big houses all sheltered away in places like River \nOaks in Houston, TX. They have all those protected, tens of millions of \ndollars. What happened to the other people?\n  So we do have a problem, but this bill doesn't address it. It does \nnothing about WorldCom or Enron or about Polaroid and what happened to \nthose workers. Zero. Zip. Nothing. And then, when we found out that \nthere is another loophole where, when wealthier people know they are \ngoing into bankruptcy, they can get a clever lawyer and put their money \nin trust and be free from the reaches of the bankruptcy court, that was \naddressed. No, we are not going to change this legislation. We are \nconcerned about these spendthrifts--whoever they are. I have been on \nthe floor for most of the time in this debate, and I still have not \nheard who they are. All I heard is that we passed this several years \nago, and we have to pass it again.\n  Well, there have been many changes since the last time we addressed \nthis bankruptcy bill, and the major companies and corporations have \nbasically done in the workers with their pensions, with their health \ninsurance, with their life insurance; they have done them in, but this \nbill doesn't do anything about that. And then we have the issue of the \nuse of these trusts to protect the assets of these wealthy debtors who \nare going into bankruptcy. But this bill doesn't do anything about \nthat. We have the inequities where people in at least 20 or 25 States \nacross the country, their investment in their homes will be protected \nup to $5,000 or $7,000, but not in Texas or Florida, where you can have \ntens of millions. Fair? Equitable? No, we are not going to do anything \nabout that. No, we have not done anything about any of these issues.\n  What we are basically saying is that those people who have worked \nhard, have health insurance, and had a serious health challenge or need \nin their family--just enough to tip them over--is that we are not going \nto show them any mercy. Absolutely, no, put the wood to them. Veterans, \nput the wood to them. Single moms who are not getting their payments of \nchild support and alimony, put the wood to them.\n  If you happen to fall below the median line, so you are outside--you \nwould think that if you could show that your total certified income was \nbelow the median income of your State, you are supposed to be free from \nrepaying. That is what you heard on the floor of the Senate. Yet when \namendments are offered to make sure that all the other punitive \nprovisions that are added to that--you have to go out there and enlist \nin some course on credit. Find a course on credit counseling. These are \npeople who average $12,000 to $15,000 a year in terms of income--you \nare going to require them to take a credit course? They have to \ndemonstrate that they graduate from that course; otherwise they will be \nsubject to the $5 or $10 a week in terms of payment.\n  This bill is all about $5 billion dollars in additional profits to \nthe credit card companies. That is what this bill is all about. Where \ndo you think it comes from? People who have gone into bankruptcy. Who \nare those people? They are the people that have the heart attacks. They \nare the men and women whose jobs have been outsourced.\n  They are the mothers, single moms who are not getting paid alimony \nand child support. Those are the people who are being hurt, and those \nare the people who are hard-working Americans and who are going to have \ntheir final drops of blood drawn out of them with payments. That is \nthis bill.\n  We have been saying this is a special interest bill; tonight \nreaffirms it. The Republicans will not vote to restore a provision in \nthis bill that was existing law that dealt with conflicts of interest \nfor banks. They do not want to risk a vote in the Senate tonight. Why \ndon't they explain it? Where is their shame? Why don't they explain it \nto the American people? Where are they? Where are all these proponents \nof this wonderful bill to explain why it is so difficult for them to \ndecide tonight? This is just seamy, just a terrible way to legislate.\n  We have seen these votes, as I mentioned, over time. We have seen who \nthe vulnerable people are. We have seen who the beneficiaries are. We \nhave pointed out what has been happening in America, across the \nlandscape, over the last 4 or 5 years with the loss of jobs, the loss \nof extending unemployment compensation to people who paid into the \nunemployment compensation fund for a long time. The jobs are not out \nthere. We have 8 million people who are unemployed, and there are 3.4 \nmillion jobs out there. There are going to be people who cannot work, \ncannot find work.\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend yield for a parliamentary inquiry?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Would the Senator from Massachusetts want an hour of my \ntime?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator very much. I appreciate it.\n  Mr. REID. I yield the Senator from Massachusetts an hour of my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  What has happened out there? We have seen the economic challenge for \nworkers as a result of outsourcing, the mergers that have taken place, \na number of them in my own State that are having a direct impact.\n  There are two important industries that are the fastest growing \nindustries in America. One is the collection industry. That is right, \nthe collection industry, the people who spend their time dialing people \nwho owe money on credit cards. They keep dialing--talk to the \nprincipal, talk to their children, talk to them at 3 o'clock in the \nafternoon when the children come back from school. That industry is \ngrowing.\n  The second industry is part-time workers. That is what is happening. \nWe find with part-time workers that they do not have coverage. People \nare ready to work. They want to work. They want these benefits. They \nhave fought for these benefits over their lifetimes, the primary \nbenefit being health insurance.\n\n[[Page S2337]]\n\n  We find out that what has happened in the United States today is the \ncollapse of the pension system. What we are finding today is the lowest \nrate of savings in 40 years. And what does this administration want to \ndo? They want to give Social Security to Wall Street. They want to give \nWall Street Social Security and privatization. They took care of the \nmajor companies with the class action bill just a week ago, and now \nthey are ready to take care of the credit card companies. But they \ncannot quite make up their mind whether the vote in the Senate that \nwould restore existing conflict-of-interest provisions, which are \nexisting law and which, I might point out, the Securities and Exchange \nCommission supports--not what is in this bill, but the amendment of \nSenators Sarbanes, Leahy, and Warner. They support that position. The \nSEC supports it because of conflict of interest. But not our Republican \nfriends. No, they cannot make up their mind. If they add that to it, \nthe power of the banking industry would be so strong over in the House \nof Representatives, they will have a stalemate, and then they will not \nget their goodies. They will not get their goodies. This is what has \nbeen happening.\n\n  Look at the profits of the industry that is going to benefit, the \ncredit card industry. In 1990, 6.4; 1995, 12.9, 2000, 20; 2004, look at \nthis, $30 billion, between 2000 and 2004. Find an industry like that in \nAmerica, except maybe the Guaranteed Student Loan Program, where we \nhave a loan guaranteed by the Federal Government and lenders make 9% on \nsome student loans. Parents wonder why the cost of going to school at \nthe universities are so high, because the government is padding the \npockets of student loan providers with tax payer dollars. These are the \nprofits.\n  Who are the people affected, as I mentioned before, during the course \nof this debate? We have 1.5 million bankruptcies annually and half of \nthem are as a result of illness. Nonmedical causes, 54 percent; medical \ncauses, 46 percent. But we are not going to show those. This bill was \nsupposed to go after the spendthrifts. We can get the spendthrifts. We \ndo not have to put these people through the mill. That is what this is \nreally about.\n  We are here this evening waiting until the clock moves down. We are \nat our offices constantly wondering when we are going to start the \nvotes. Two votes were supposed to be at 5 o'clock--one to deal with \nsingle women who are in bankruptcy because they are not being paid \ntheir alimony and child support. That was dismissed out of hand; you \nwill have to take that to a vote. We are prepared to take it to a vote, \nand we will certainly continue to take it to a vote. If we are not \nsuccessful on this, anyone who thinks we are going to let these issues \ngo away just does not understand those of us who are opposed to this \nparticular program.\n  We are also going to have an opportunity to vote on what has happened \nto so many of our American families as a result of outsourcing and how \nthey have faced the economic challenges over recent weeks and months. \nMore than 450,000 jobs have been outsourced. Over the next 10 years, we \nare expecting close to 3.4 million jobs to be outsourced, going outside \nthe country.\n  We have seen what is happening in manufacturing all across this \ncountry. We all know that manufacturing jobs are the ones that have the \nhigher pay. That has been part of the phenomenon. Do you think that \nconcept is of any importance to the proponents of this legislation? \nAbsolutely not. No way.\n  Health care prices have gone through the roof by 59 percent and the \ncost of prescription drugs 65 percent, and the fact we are an aging \npopulation with our parents, children, almost a third disabled who need \nthose prescription drugs, and the prices are going up through the \nroof--are we giving them any consideration? Absolutely not. We do not \ncare about the workers who have gotten shortchanged. We do not care \nabout those who have needed prescription drugs and have been bankrupted \nin paying the prices.\n  This is the same Republican Senate that would not permit the \nSecretary of HHS to negotiate prices downward--do you hear me--like we \ndo in the Veterans Administration. Here we have hundreds of thousands \nof people who are going bankrupt because of increases in the cost of \nhealth care and prescription drugs, and we--most of us on this side--\nwho are opposed to these harsh provisions tried to make some difference \nseveral months ago to permit the Secretary of HHS to negotiate prices \ndownward, as they do in the Veterans Administration. But, no, we are \nnot going to let you do that. So that was defeated. You cannot import \ncheaper drugs from outside the country. You cannot get cheaper prices \nhere. And what happens? You end up going into bankruptcy and end up \nwith the harsh provisions of this legislation.\n\n  This legislation is not fair, it is not just, and tonight we have \nseen what this is all about.\n  The bankruptcy bill as written contains a provision, section 414, \nwhich would repeal the provision in current law on investment banks \nwhich underwrote a security of the company in bankruptcy from now \nserving as adviser to the bankruptcy. This is a basic conflict-of-\ninterest prevention in current law, which this bill would repeal. It is \none of the many shameful special interest provisions in this bill.\n  To their credit, Senators Leahy and Sarbanes offered an amendment to \nremove this provision and maintain the current law against conflicts of \ninterest by the investment banks. It appears that it may have the votes \nto pass, so to protect the investment banks the Republicans have \neffectively shut down the process. There should be no doubt, when \npeople finally vote tomorrow, what this bill is all about, who it was \nfor. When it is a fight for the real people, then we hear from the \nother side saying, no, no. But when it is their friends in the banks \nwho are threatened, it shuts down debate in the Senate.\n  Clearly, there is no room in the Republican agenda for the real needs \nof the real people, the veterans, the workers, the mothers, the \nchildren, and the widows.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I will have a little bit to say about what \nthe distinguished Senator from Massachusetts has been talking about, \nbut I rise in opposition to the Kennedy amendment to S. 256, the \nBankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005.\n  Now, it is important that colleagues on both sides of the aisle fully \nunderstand what this amendment does to our bankruptcy laws and what it \ndoes to the prospects for reform. Before I start, I will take a few \nminutes to remind everyone what this bill is all about. The short \nanswer is fairness. Those who can pay their bills should pay their \nbills. That is the American way.\n  All law-abiding, bill-paying consumers pay when some do not repay \ntheir obligations. You and I and every citizen of this country is going \nto pay if we allow people who can pay to escape their obligations, and \nthis bill stops the gaming.\n  This is not too revolutionary an idea, but to listen to some of the \nopponents of this legislation on the floor these last few days, one \nwould think we are trying to square a circle.\n  I have been down on this floor quite a bit over the last few days and \nI have heard many of the arguments from the few Senators against this \nbill, and I emphasize the ``few Senators against this bill.'' It sounds \npretty familiar. I have been around this place for a long time and I \nonly know one thing for sure. At the end of the day, some on the losing \nside will think that the underlying bill is without any merits at all \nand that their concerns have not been treated with the seriousness they \nfeel they deserve.\n  The principal substantive argument we have heard is that this bill \ngoes too far and too fast; we have to take it slow; we have to rethink \nthis; this bill is too extreme, they say. For some of my colleagues \nacross the aisle, this is the same old song we have heard now for 8 \nsolid years that we have tried to put this bill together and it has \nalways had huge bipartisan support. That is bipartisan support, \nDemocrat and Republican support.\n  I am a bit confused by some of the arguments that have been used on \nsome of the same old amendments and against the bill itself. Sure, \nthere are places we could have done better in this bill, as in every \nother legislation. There are always things we could do better. But the \nvotes we have gotten on this bill, on its amendments in committee, and \nin previous Congresses are\n\n[[Page S2338]]\n\nas good an indication as we can ever have of the underlying \nreasonableness of these proposals.\n  As a long-time supporter of the bankruptcy bill, I was extremely \npleased by the strong bipartisan vote we had on cloture yesterday, 69 \nto 31. That is not just Republicans; there are a lot of Democrats who \nknow this bill is the answer to a lot of the problems we have in \nbankruptcy in our society, and who have been working with us for 8 \nsolid years in a bipartisan fashion. But to hear some of our critics, \none would think that everybody concerned, all 69 of us, are nutcakes \nwho do not know what is going on in our society or do not care for the \npoor, or for the weak, or for the worker, or for the union man. Give me \na break.\n  I am one of the few people in this body who ever held a union card. I \nworked for 10 years in the building construction trade unions, earned \nmy journeyman's card as a wood, wire, and metal lather, now a carpenter \ntoday, and I am darned proud of that. I think a lot about people who \nare not as fortunate as we are in the Senate.\n\n  As a long-time supporter of the bankruptcy bill, I was extremely \npleased by the strong bipartisan vote, 69 to 31, on cloture. That was a \nbig bipartisan vote by any measure. This vote is in keeping with the \nlong record of bipartisan support for this bill over the life of the \nlegislation.\n  I will briefly review this history: We held our first meeting on this \nin a Judiciary subcommittee in 1998. I want to make sure everyone heard \nthat right: 1998. Early on, the good-faith compromises began. To give \neverybody an idea, these are some of the amendments we accepted in \ncommittee over the last 7 years. We modified the homestead exemption. \nWe modified the means test. We allowed for sanctioning of attorneys who \nfile abusive claims. We made privacy concessions for filers. We \nprevented creditors from demanding repayment for debts incurred through \npredatory lending practices, something that has long been overdue for \nthe poor, the weak, and the unfortunate. All of these were amendments \nfrom my Democratic colleagues. I could go through dozens of others.\n  Two weeks ago, the Judiciary Committee held another markup on the \nbankruptcy legislation. We adopted five more amendments proposed by our \nDemocratic colleagues. If some of the amendments that have been \nproposed on the floor sound similar to the matters I listed, that is \nbecause they are. Taken in a vacuum, as it might sound to anyone who \nrandomly tunes in on C-SPAN, these amendments might sound reasonable. \nYet in proper context of past history and compromises, many of these \namendments should be understood for what they are: more of the same.\n  Many of the amendments address issues we have already negotiated \npreviously. Frequently, these amendments make this a better bill. But \nnow after so many years of hearing the same complaints, even after we \nattempted to address concerns by accepting or modifying amendments, \nincluding, I repeat, five in their latest and hopefully last markup of \nbankruptcy reform in the Judiciary Committee, it is less than clear \nthat some of these remaining amendments will improve this already fully \nvetted bill.\n  The five amendments adopted in the markup ran the gamut. One was a \ntechnical fix that created a more restrictive inflation adjustment \nplan. We decided to prevent corporate executives--that is corporate \nexecutives, by the way--from declaring bankruptcy to avoid paying fines \nfor securities fraud. That does not sound like something that hurts the \nlittle guy. We are trying to stop this type of fraud.\n  We accepted three amendments from the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts, Mr. Kennedy. We clarified the means test, even in an \ninstance where we sincerely believed that the means test was already \nmore than clear, to explain that without any debt, health and \ndisability expenses will not be included against a filing for \nbankruptcy. We allowed for a trustee in cases of fraud involving \npersons representing the debtor. In an amendment that many think we \nwent too far on, we even accepted a compromise version of an amendment \nthat restricted payments to executives and businesses going through a \nbankruptcy. Unfortunately, this amendment may discourage senior \nofficials from taking on the task of seeing a company through a \ndifficult financial reorganization. The unintended consequences of this \nmight be to further limit the ability of damaged companies to emerge \nfrom bankruptcy and to keep thousands of employees on the job. They may \nlose those employees. Those employees may lose their jobs if we cannot \nkeep good, competent executives there. I think this issue deserves more \nattention. But we agreed to it.\n\n  I am hopeful. I have been chatting with my good friend from \nMassachusetts and he has indicated he thinks we might be able to \nresolve that problem so people will not lose their jobs. But it depends \nupon what he thinks, not on what I think, because I accepted the \namendment in committee, as the person who was in charge of the \ncommittee at that time.\n  Fairness demands that we work with our colleagues in the minority but \nthis is a two-way street. Fairness also demands that large bipartisan \nmajorities, after they have done all they can to reach agreements with \nthe other side, be allowed to move on. That is why we invoked cloture, \nso we can move on.\n  This bill is a case study in such accommodation. I could go through \ndozens and dozens more accommodations we made to the other side, and to \npeople on this side as well. This bill first passed all the way back in \nthe 105th Congress. Let me refer to this chart. In the 105th Congress \nwe passed this bill 97 to 1. I don't think everybody who voted for this \nwas an idiot, who did not care for the poor and the weak and the infirm \nand the downtrodden. No. We are trying to solve some of their problems. \nThis bill passed the Senate by a 97 to 1 vote. You cannot get much more \nsupport than that. There is no denying the bipartisanship of that vote.\n  When we came back to the issue in the 106th Congress, we again had \nmassive bipartisan support for this bill. The Senate passed H.R. 833 on \nFebruary 2, 2000, 83 to 14. I think that was a pretty good bipartisan \nvote. It is virtually the same bill. Then the conference report came \nback and on December 7, same year, 2000, we passed this same bill 70 to \n28. That was a big bipartisan vote--which was right. That bipartisan \nconference report was supported by Democrats and Republicans. That was \nvetoed with a pocket veto by President Clinton. He had a right to do \nthat, but he pocket-vetoed it because it didn't have an abortion \namendment on it.\n  What about the 107th Congress? Did we give up hope? I can tell you \nthat I did not. I just could not believe, I still cannot believe that a \nbill with such wide support could repeatedly fail to become law. So \nwhat did we do in the 107th Congress? Let me refer to this chart. In \nthe 107th Congress, on March 15, 2001, this bill passed again, 83 to \n15, and then passed again, 82 to 16. Those are bipartisan votes. I \ndon't think the Democrats who voted with us are idiots or did not care \nfor the poor. I don't think they failed to acknowledge that we have to \ntake care of those who are unfortunate in our society. They did \nacknowledge that it cost every family in America $400 extra because of \nwhat is going on in this system.\n  All in all, the full Senate has voted favorably on bankruptcy reform \nlegislation five times. Five times, all sweeping bipartisan votes, and \nthe bill is not yet signed into law.\n  If we adopt any of these amendments from people who will never vote \nfor this bill no matter what we do--they would rather criticize it than \nvote for it. I can criticize aspects of this bill myself, I believe. \nBut it is a classic working together in the best methodology that we \nhave, to bring everybody together and get legislation done that will do \na lot of good. It will cause people, who can afford to, to pay their \nbills, or at least pay some of their bills.\n  It seems to me that is the American way. We want to teach our \nchildren, our young people, that it is important to pay your bills. It \nis important to live up to your responsibilities.\n  We do a lot to make sure corporate America lives up to their \nresponsibilities in this bill as well. The bill is not signed into law \nyet, but we hope we can get it through--apparently not tonight, but by \ntomorrow. If not tomorrow, then Friday. If not Friday, Saturday. As far \nas I am concerned, whatever it takes to get it done.\n  These reform-minded votes are not just coming from the Senate. Here \nis\n\n[[Page S2339]]\n\nhow the House voted over the years, just so everybody knows. There are \n535 Members of the House. Here is how they voted: 300 to 125; 313 to \n108; 306 to 108. Overwhelming bipartisan votes, because this bill is \nthe best we can do. It will do a lot of good, to make things right in \nour society. With all due respect, these are not even close calls. They \nare consistent, bipartisan blow-outs. But, to listen to the opposition, \nyou would think this legislation is supported by only a small minority \nof Representatives in the House of Representatives or in the Senate. \nNothing could be further from the truth.\n  I really do not know what else we can do. We have compromised when it \nwas reasonable to do so. As a matter of fact, in our very first \nsubcommittee debate on this issue we accepted an amendment from my \ndistinguished colleague, the Senator from Illinois, that adjusted the \nrequirements for being subject to the means test. That amendment \ncreated a safety valve for those who fall below the national median \nincome.\n\n  This was an important amendment. This bill does not track it exactly, \nbut our exclusion of those who fall below the State median income takes \nthis original amendment as a guide. It materially limited the reach of \nthe means test. It allowed a fresh start to those poor people who are \ndrowning in a sea of debt with no way to pay it back.\n  I said many times during this debate and I will say it again: 80 \npercent of bankruptcy filers will be excluded from the means test--80 \npercent. They will be permitted to file chapter 11, which will \ncompletely wipe out their debts. The supposed draconian means test has \nresults in only one half of the mere 20 percent that it even applies \nto. It allows those with incomes that remain above the State median \nincome, after numerous health and education and other exceptions, to \npay back some of their debt over the course of 3 or 5 years. It gives \nthem even a break there.\n  When all is said and done, the means test in this bill will only \nresult in about 1 in 10 individuals who file bankruptcy from ever \nhaving to pay some of their past debts with future earnings. So 10 \npercent of 100 percent will have to do some payback because they can \nafford to do it. It is only right. They should not saddle all America \nwith their debts when they can afford to pay them back. But in the \nfirst markup, the man who is now the minority whip, my friend from \nIllinois, proposed the amendment that remains at the heart of the means \ntest in this bill, and we accepted it.\n  What is amazing to me is that when my colleagues want to raise taxes \nthey are always talking about how great the means test is. But when we \nwant to make sure that people who can pay can pay, suddenly the means \ntest is not a good test. You can't have it both ways. It is amazing to \nme. It is almost hypocrisy.\n  I am pleased that cloture has been invoked, giving us the opportunity \nto once again pass this bill. It is getting to the point where some \nmight even forget why we initiated this legislation. We have been at it \nfor 8 years now. Some of those who oppose the bill and are offering \nfinal postcloture amendments are flying in the face of years and years \nof hard work and bipartisan compromise. By the way, the ones who bring \nup the amendments will never vote for this bill no matter what you do, \nunless it is a complete cave-in, so we cannot solve the problems that \nare eating our country alive in bankruptcy. And they do it under the \nguise that they are trying to protect the weak and the infirm and those \nwho really cannot help themselves.\n  Give me a break. We over here get so tired of those populist \narguments. We hear them over and over and sometimes I think they think \nthe more they yell and scream the more people must think their \narguments are serious. I hope people are listening because, my gosh, \nafter 8 years of compromising and working and bringing people together \nand listening to both sides and doing everything we can to accommodate, \nwhy do we have to go through all the same amendments over and over \nagain; they have been defeated time and time again because they deserve \nbeing defeated. Yet it happens every time--they get up and act like the \nworld is coming to an end because their populist rhetoric is not being \nlistened to. Unfortunately, there are people out there who really \nbelieve this stuff when somebody starts yelling, screaming, and \nshouting on the Senate floor.\n\n  The fact is that many of these final amendments being proposed during \nthis debate are just further adjustments of adjustments to adjustments \nthat were already made during this process. We have made further \nadjustments and refinements when we found broad consensus. These \namendments have been brought up postcloture.\n  You would think there would be a time when you admit that you have \nhad your shot, you have had 8 years of your shot; you have had \namendment after amendment, the same thing over and over again, and the \namendments have been defeated. You would think sooner or later they \nwould come to the conclusion to stop holding up the Senate and the \npeople's business and let this bill go; we lost this bill even though \nwe as liberals don't like it. But there are liberals who do like it \nbecause they know it is right. They know what we are trying to do here \nwill work to the betterment of the bankruptcy laws of the country.\n  I would like to add that during the course of the floor debate over \nthe last week and a half we accepted more amendments that will improve \nthis bill.\n  The Senate agreed to the Sessions amendment that makes clear that \nbankruptcy judges must consider military and veteran status and health \ncare costs when determining whether a portion of future income must be \nused to pay past debt.\n  The Sessions amendment addressed many of the issues presented by \nSenator Durbin with respect to military personnel and veterans, and \nSenator Kennedy with respect to health care costs.\n  We accepted the Specter amendment that made clear how bankruptcy \njudges will be paid through increased filing fees. This important \namendment stands for responsible government and eliminates any \nobjection to the legislation based on a budget point of order.\n  In addition, we adopted an important amendment by Senator Leahy that \ncorrects some potential problems that relate to privacy of certain \npersonal information, including Social Security numbers.\n  In short, we have improved this bill on the floor in a number of \nimportant aspects. We have been open to our colleagues. We have tried \nto accommodate them where we can. But there are areas where we can't \nand have this bill became law.\n  I think that the cloture vote we just took is evidence of those \nchanges to this already moderate legislation. I understand some \nSenators do not think they have had an adequate hearing. At the \nbeginning of this process, I gave them my word to at least consider \namendments from all sides, and I believe we have done so. This \ninstitution is rather unwieldy, though. I think anybody who watches it \nor thinks about it has to admit that. That is probably putting it \nmildly. Unfortunately, even decent arguments, if they come at the wrong \ntime, are going to have an uphill climb.\n  As I said earlier, since I was first elected I have tried my best to \nreach out to the other side as a good-faith actor. That is no less true \nwith this bankruptcy bill. I have listened to more proposals and voted \non more amendments that I can recall, and so has Senator Grassley and \nSenator Sessions and others who have worked so hard on this issue. My \nhope is that as we move forward the opposition remembers the bigger \npicture. Even those few Senators who will not vote for final passage \nknow that this bill was made better because we have accepted their \namendments over the years.\n  At this late date, though, it is difficult to accept many more for \nprocedural reasons. I oppose the amendment offered by the distinguished \nSenator from Massachusetts for all of these substantive reasons.\n  Let me give a couple more substantive reasons. I accept Senator \nKennedy's argument that health care costs are the key factor in \nbankruptcy. I have heard that for days around here; that most people go \ninto bankruptcy because of health care costs. Much of his argument \nstems from the so-called Warren study. Let me talk about the Warren \nstudy cited by Senator Kennedy and give a response to it by the\n\n[[Page S2340]]\n\nDepartment of Justice. Here is what the Department of Justice said. I \nwould suggest that the Warren study has been greatly overplayed here on \nthe floor.\n  They said:\n\n       Professor Warren, a long-time opponent of bankruptcy \n     reform, and her so-called ``studies,'' should be approached \n     with skepticism.\n       Though Ms. Warren's study claims that more than half of \n     consumer bankruptcies are medically related, the DOJ has told \n     us that only ``the conclusion that almost 50 percent of \n     consumer bankruptcies are `medical related' requires a broad \n     definition and is generally not substantiated by the official \n     documents filed by debtors.''\n\n  In other words, this claim that 50 percent of the bankruptcies are \ncaused by medical expenses is pure bull.\n  The means test doesn't apply to the poor or anyone without the \nability to re-pay.\n  Anyone under the median income for their State is automatically \nexempt from the means test.\n  They can go right into chapter 7 and have every one of their debts \nremoved; that is, the poor.\n  To the extent that ``above median'' families have ongoing medical \nexpenses, they are permitted to use those expenses as a reason to not \npay their debts. These are people above the median income level.\n  GAO's 1999 analysis of the expenses allowed under the means test \nclearly shows that the means test permits all debtors to account for \nhealth care expenses.\n  For people with repayment capacity and financial resources, the \nbankruptcy legislation prevents abuse by requiring some of their bills \nto repaid in exchange for not having to pay the full amount.\n  This is fair. If they can pay some, they ought to pay some. We \nshouldn't just stick the hospitals and the doctors and everybody in \nmedical care with these unpaid debts.\n  I was talking to one of the large hospital chains the other day. I \nasked them how much uncompensated debt they had every year; in other \nwords, medical care that you have given that you receive no \ncompensation for. It was almost $1 billion a year that they have given \nin free medical care for the poor and for some who game the system. \nGuess who pays for that. You and I, and everybody else in the final \nanalysis because it is going to have to come back in most cases to \nMedicaid and Medicare. These are Federal programs that wind up with \nthose debts. By the way, we pay for them for a variety of reasons. We \ndon't pay almost $1 billion to those hospitals. They don't get anything \nin most cases. That uncompensated debt means they are not getting paid. \nThey are giving emergency care. That is why some hospitals are now \ndoing away with emergency care facilities, because they can't keep \ndoing it. People who do not pay their bills raise the cost of \neverything for all of us. That is OK when they can't pay their bills \nwhen they are poor. But when they can, and when they think they can \njust escape them by going into bankruptcy and they are capable of \npaying some or all of their bills, they ought to help to do it.\n  For people with repayment capacity and financial resources, the \nlegislation prevents abuse by requiring some of the bills to be repaid \nin exchange for not having to pay the full amount.\n  If someone can't pay health care debts, the bill does not force them \nto. This bill will not force them to. If they can pay health care \ndebts, they should repay those debts and those bills just like \neverybody else has.\n  The Sessions amendment we adopted last week addresses this \nproblem. It simply addresses the problem.\n\n  Let me close by addressing the investment banker provision my \ncolleague from Massachusetts has strenuously commented upon. I am not \nsure if strenuous is quite the word, but I will use that word here \ntonight. It seemed to me a little more than strenuous.\n  Companies in financial distress need the ability to retain good help. \nThey need to be able to keep people on who know the company best and \nwho will enable that company to emerge from reorganization a more \nhealthy outfit that can continue providing for its employees and \ncontribute to the economy.\n  Under current law, investment bankers alone among professionals in \nthe business world were deemed, per se, interested persons who could \nnot work for a company after filing for bankruptcy if they had served \nas banker for any outstanding security of the corporation. This bill \nsimply extends the test, one of the materially adverse interests that \napplies to lawyers, accountants, and other professionals to investment \nbankers.\n  This amendment makes sense. It continues to provide the courts with \ndiscretion to exclude bankers from participation in a reorganization \nwhile giving companies more flexibility as they attempt to reorganize \nand save themselves.\n  The amendment under consideration would undo this flexibility by \nimposing a strict 5-year exclusion on participation by investment \nbankers. This makes little sense. I will be voting against the \namendment. I urge my colleagues to do the same. I especially make the \ncase that this is not special interest legislation, as my colleague \nsays it is. This is a classic message amendment. The message we should \nsend tomorrow is to vote ``no'' on this amendment. When we talk about \nmessage amendments, these are amendments that our colleagues know we \ncannot take for very good reasons, but they are trying to score \npolitical points with the Nation. Anyone who looks at these matters \ncarefully and understands the law would say, let's not let these \nmessage amendments take over a good bill that can do so much good for \nour society. We then should vote ``yes'' on final passage because this \nis a good, balanced, bipartisan, bicameral bill.\n  What gets me down is I have heard these arguments for 8 solid years. \nMost of them do not make sense. Most of them are message arguments for \npolitical reasons by people who will never vote for this bill, \nbasically have not helped bring this bill about, who have not \ncooperated in trying to bring both Houses together, who are not part of \nthe huge bipartisan consensus on this bill, and who are trying to score \npolitical points, hoping we will never come on the floor and refute \nthem.\n  I could not sit back and not come to the Senate tonight because we \nhave to quit making political points. We ought to pass this bill so we \ncan help this country and its people go forward in ways it should.\n  People who can pay their debts ought to. Companies that are doing \nwrong ought to pay for that. Where there is fraud, this bill will \nattack it.\n  We can go through so many good aspects of this bill. Could it be \nbetter? I have never seen a bill pass here of any magnitude that could \nnot be improved. But we have had 8 years of improvements and this is \nthe bill that will pass if we do not amend it. We should pass it. We \nshould move forward from here.\n  Having said that, that does not mean we should not immediately start \nwork on the next bankruptcy bill to see if there are ways we can \nimprove even this. As this bill becomes law, we will find ways that it \nmay not work as well as we contemplated and we ought to continually \noversee this and make sure this bill works in the best interests of all \nAmericans, that it works in the best interests of the poor, and the \nworking people, our union men and women, people who have to make a \nliving all over this country, and for investors and everybody else in \nour society. We ought to make sure we do the best we can. I assure you \nwe will continue to try and work to continue to improve our laws in \nthis country. That is what this body is all about.\n  I will briefly mention an important issue that arose from the \namendment at the markup. This amendment offered by my friend from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kennedy, seeks to prevent unfair and unnecessary \nretention bonuses to insiders in chapter 11 companies. The goal here is \ncertainly laudable and I agree with the desire to try to do that, but \nit has come to light since our markup that this amendment may act to \neffectively prohibit responsible companies undergoing reorganization--\nin other words, trying to save themselves--from keeping key employees \nwho may best be able to steer the company back into solvency.\n  I have a letter from the Association of Insolvency and Restructuring \nAdvisors enumerating these concerns in further detail and I ask \nunanimous consent it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S2341]]\n\n\n                                     Association of Insolvency and\n\n\n                                       Restructuring Advisors,\n\n                                                    March 1, 2005.\n     Sen. Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The undersigned are financial and legal \n     professionals who serve as the Board of Directors of the \n     Association of Insolvency and Restructuring Advisors (AIRA). \n     As board members we work to further the AIRA's goal of \n     increasing industry awareness of the organization as an \n     important educational and technical resource for \n     professionals in business turnaround, restructuring, and \n     bankruptcy practice, and of the Certified Insolvency and \n     Restructuring Advisor (ClRA) designation as an assurance of \n     expertise in this area.\n       We write to make you aware of serious concerns we have \n     regarding a provision contained in S. 256, the ``Bankruptcy \n     Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005.'' The \n     provision in question effectively prohibits the use of key \n     employee retention plans in Chapter 11 reorganizations. It \n     was added during the Judiciary Committee mark-up of the bill \n     and elicited little attention at the time. However, we \n     believe this provision will cause considerable harm to a \n     number of companies that will become subject to bankruptcy \n     proceedings, and, most importantly, to their employees, \n     customers, and creditors.\n       When a company is operating in Chapter 11, a primary \n     responsibility of management is to maintain and grow the \n     company's value for the benefit of all of its stakeholders. A \n     company that is well-managed through its restructuring \n     benefits its creditors, employees, retirees, unions and the \n     local communities of which the company is a part. Companies \n     that fail to successfully reorganize in Chapter 11 are \n     liquidated. Creditors receive pennies on the dollar and \n     employees see their jobs and retirement savings destroyed.\n       When companies enter Chapter 11, it is critical that they \n     attract and retain top management talent. But Chapter 11 is \n     also the most difficult time to attract and retain such \n     talent. Managers of Chapter 11 companies are faced with \n     intense scrutiny, stress, insecurity, and an enormously \n     complex process. Compensation and incentive tools used by \n     non-bankrupt companies such as equity compensation programs \n     are not available to assist with attracting and retaining the \n     type of management talent necessary to bring the company \n     successfully through the Chapter 11 process--this is because \n     the pre-petition equity is almost always without value. Key \n     employee retention plans (``KERPs'') have become common \n     practice since the early 1990's and have been viewed by \n     courts, debtors, and creditors alike as an important and \n     useful way to help reorganization by retaining key employees.\n       Bankruptcy courts have agreed with this reasoning, and many \n     judges have used their judicial discretion to approve KERPs. \n     For a court to approve a KERP under existing law, however, a \n     debtor must use proper business judgment in formulating the \n     program, and the court must find the program to be reasonable \n     and fair. Creditors have the right to object to proposed \n     KERPs, and judges are presented with a full evidentiary \n     record upon which to make a determination. If a KERP is \n     not appropriate or if it is not in the best interest of \n     the company's creditors, the judge can refuse to approve \n     it.\n       In the last few years, there has been a trend, with which \n     we agree, towards stricter judicial scrutiny of proposed \n     KERPs by bankruptcy judges. Such a trend seems appropriate in \n     the wake of numerous high profile bankruptcy filings where \n     management's misconduct or mismanagement has led to the \n     Chapter 11 filing. Judges have discretion to deny KERPs in \n     these circumstances, and they do so when the facts and \n     circumstances warrant.\n       Unfortunately, S. 256 as reported by the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee includes an amendment authored by Senator Edward M. \n     Kennedy (the Kennedy amendment) that places significant \n     limits on retention bonuses and severance payments to \n     employees of companies in Chapter 11. It would prohibit a \n     bankruptcy judge from approving retention bonuses in every \n     Chapter 11 case unless he or she finds that the company in \n     question has proven that the employee has a bona fide job \n     offer at the same or greater rate of compensation; was \n     prepared to accept the job offer; and the services of that \n     employee are ``essential to the survival of the business''. \n     The amendment also places significant caps on the amount of \n     such bonus and payments.\n       The Kennedy amendment appears to be motivated by a desire \n     to combat KERPs in Chapter 11 cases where employee-related \n     fraud substantially contributed to the bankruptcy of the \n     company. Yet, by painting with such a broad brush, the \n     Kennedy amendment will, if enacted, effectively eliminate all \n     companies' ability to ever receive court approval for a KERP. \n     Federal bankruptcy judges would have little or no discretion \n     to approve KERPs. In turn, bankrupt companies would have less \n     flexibility in trying to retain or attract necessary \n     employees. This result will cause considerable harm to \n     companies in bankruptcy, their employees, and their \n     creditors.\n       It is apparent that the Kennedy amendment is designed to \n     prevent abuses of the system, where creditors' employees' and \n     retirees' monies are unnecessarily expended for the \n     enrichment of management. Whether there currently is or is \n     not sufficient judicial scrutiny of KERPs is a valid \n     question, insofar as the overall bankruptcy system allows \n     debtors a fair amount of flexibility in exercising reasonable \n     judgment--but there must be an approach better than \n     handcuffing the judiciary and stakeholders in bankruptcy \n     cases by essentially precluding all use of KERPs. The proper \n     use of KERPs requires an analysis of all facts and \n     circumstances of the case, and not what is essentially a \n     blanket proscription of these tools.\n       Senator Kennedy has advanced an important public policy \n     discussion with his amendment. Managers who have had \n     responsibility for driving a company into bankruptcy should \n     not be paid a bonus to remain. Similarly, if the retention of \n     an employee would not enhance a company's value for its \n     stakeholders, they should not be paid a bonus to stay. \n     Current law provides bankruptcy judges with the discretion \n     necessary to deny a KERP in such circumstances and bankruptcy \n     judges do deny KERP payments in these circumstances. Still, \n     if the Congress wishes to improve the operation of current \n     law while still safeguarding the ability of the courts to \n     approve legitimate KERPs, we would welcome a discussion on \n     how best to achieve that end. Unfortunately, S. 256, as \n     reported by the Committee, goes too far and should be amended \n     so as not to unnecessarily limit the bankruptcy court's \n     ability to determine what is in the best interest of each \n     individual bankruptcy estate.\n       Mr. Chairman, we thank you for considering our views on \n     this important matter. We would be pleased to address any \n     questions you or other members of the Committee on the \n     Judiciary may have.\n           Sincerely,\n       The members of the board and management of the Association \n     of Insolvency and Restructuring Advisors.\n         Soneet R.

This language also keeps the burden on chapter \n11 companies to prove that retention bonuses are ``necessary, fair and \nreasonable,'' and ``likely to enhance a successful reorganization.''\n  This seems like a reasonable fix to me and I hope we include this \nlanguage in the bill. I appreciate any help my friend from \nMassachusetts would give on that particular issue because if we are \ninterested in doing what is right, this will do what is right.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I am in support of the Kennedy-Kohl \namendment. It would eliminate the most flagrant abuse of the bankruptcy \nsystem under current law--the unlimited homestead exemption. This \nexemption allows debtors in five states to purchase expensive homes and \nshield millions of dollars from their creditors. All too often, \nmillionaire debtors take advantage of this loophole by buying mansions \nin states with unlimited exemptions like Florida and Texas, and \ndeclaring bankruptcy and yet continue to live like kings. Our measure \nwill generously cap the homestead exemption at $300,000--that is: it \npermits a debtor to keep $300,000 of equity in his or her home after \ndeclaring bankruptcy.\n  This amendment, with even lower threshold amounts, has been adopted\n\n[[Page S2342]]\n\ntwice by the Senate by wide margins in the course of considering \nprevious bankruptcy bills, in both the 106th and 107th Congresses. As a \nresult of my efforts in the past bankruptcy debates, the underlying \nbill that we are debating already contains a provision on the homestead \namendment that gets at the worst abusers of this loophole, including \nfelons. In fact, it will be the first Federal law ever on the homestead \nexemption.\n  The provision included in the bill, however, while obviously better \nthan the current law's allowance of an unlimited homestead exemption, \nis still not a comprehensive solution to the current abuses of the law. \nIt would allow those who establish their residence in an unlimited \nhomestead state more than 3 years and 4 months before a bankruptcy \nfiling to shelter an unlimited amount of money in their residences. All \nit would take for a greedy or unscrupulous individual to take advantage \nof this provision to defraud his or her creditors is some planning and \nforesight. And it does nothing to stop lifelong residents of these \nstates from taking advantage of the unlimited homestead exemption to \nprotect their assets from creditors.\n  A review of a few examples in recent years show how willing \ndisreputable debtors are to engage in such planning to hide their \nassets. Let me give you just a few of the many examples:\n\n       John Porter, WorldCom's cofounder and former Chairman, \n     bought a 10,000 square-foot ocean front estate in Palm Beach, \n     Florida in 1998, a home featured on the cover of the November \n     2004 issue of Luxury Homes magazine, and now worth nearly $17 \n     million. The IRS says he owes more than $25 million for back \n     taxes, and he is the defendant in several multi-million \n     dollar securities fraud lawsuits resulting from the failure \n     of WorldCom. Porter filed for bankruptcy in May 2004. \n     Florida's homestead exemption allows Porter to keep most of \n     the value of the house.\n       The former Executive Vice President of Conseco has sought \n     to avoid repaying $65 million in loans from Conseco by \n     selling 90% of her and her husband's assets and buying a $10 \n     million home on Sunset Island in Miami Beach, FL.\n       In 2001, Paul Bilzerian--a convicted felon--tried to wipe \n     out $140 million in debts and all the while holding on to his \n     37,000 square foot Florida mansion worth over $5 million--\n     with its 10 bedrooms, two libraries, double gourmet kitchen, \n     racquetball court, indoor basketball court, movie theater, \n     full weight and exercise rooms, and swimming pool.\n       The owner of a failed Ohio Savings and Loan, who was \n     convicted of securities fraud, wrote off most of $300 million \n     in debts, but still held on to the multi-million dollar ranch \n     he bought in Florida.\n       Movie star Burt Reynolds wrote off over $8 million in debt \n     through bankruptcy, but still held onto his $2.5 million \n     Florida estate.\n\n  Sadly, those examples are just the tip of the iceberg. Several years \nago, we asked the GAO to study this problem. At that time, they \nestimated that 400 homeowners in Florida and Texas--all with over \n$100,000 in home equity--profited from this unlimited exemption each \nyear. And while they continued to live in luxury, they wrote off an \nestimated $120 million owed to honest creditors. This is not only \nwrong; it is unacceptable.\n\n  In stark contrast, in most States debtors may keep only a reasonable \namount of the equity they have in their homes. For example, in my home \nState of Wisconsin, when a person declares bankruptcy, he or she may \nkeep only $40,000 of the value of their home. This permits creditors \naccess to any additional funds that could be used to repay outstanding \nloans, yet allows the debtor to preserve $40,000 which is more than \nenough for a fresh start. Most States reasonably cap their homestead \nexemptions at $40,000 or less.\n  The bankruptcy reform bill is intended to wipe out abuse by debtors \nwho run up large bills and then use the bankruptcy laws as a method of \nfinancial planning. Our amendment does exactly that.\n  Unlike the compromise version currently in S. 256, this amendment \ncompletely closes this inexcusable loophole that allows too many \ndebtors to keep their luxury homes, while their legitimate creditors--\nlike kids owed child support, ex-spouses owed alimony, state \ngovernments, small businesses and banks--get left out in the cold.\n  While the unlimited homestead exemption may not be the most common \nabuse of the bankruptcy system, it is clearly the most egregious. If we \nreally want to restore the stigma attached to bankruptcy, these high \nprofile cases are the best place to start.\n  In both the 106th and 107th Congresses, an overwhelming number of our \ncolleagues agreed with us and voted to cap the homestead exemption by \nwide margins. In the 106th Congress, this proposal was adopted in the \nSenate by a vote of 76-22. In the 107th Congress, a motion to table \nthis proposal was defeated in the Senate by a vote of 60 to 39, and \nthis amendment was then adopted by voice vote. The vote this year is \nexactly the same as the one in the 106th and 107th Congresses. If you \nwere against rich debtors avoiding their creditors the last two times, \nthen you should be against rich debtors avoiding their creditors this \ntime.\n  The simple hard cap that we propose with this amendment is not only \nthe best policy; it also sends the best message: bankruptcy is a tool \nof last resort, not financial planning. Even though I would prefer that \nthis amendment include an exemption for family farmers, it does address \nthe need to go after the worst abusers, no matter how wealthy.\n  In closing, we should remember that one of the central principles of \nthe bankruptcy bill is that people who can pay part of their debts \nshould be required to do so. But the call to reform rings hollow when \nthe bill creates an elaborate, taxpayer funded system to squeeze an \nextra $100 a month out of middle class debtors and yet allows people \nlike Burt Reynolds to declare bankruptcy, wipe out $8 million in debt, \nand still hold on to a $2.5 million Florida mansion. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate National \nSchool Breakfast Week. For the past 30 years, the School Breakfast \nProgram has provided nutritious morning meals to our Nation's neediest \nyouth. Today, over 1 million children across the United States are \nmalnourished, and the School Breakfast Program is a first line of \ndefense against this growing epidemic.\n  The School Breakfast Program was established through the Child \nNutrition Act of 1966. Despite this law, many low-income children still \ngo without breakfast each day. Every student eligible for a free or \nreduced-price school lunch is also eligible for a free or reduced-price \nbreakfast.\n  In my home State of Illinois, during the 2003-2004 school year, over \n1 million children from lower-income families participated in the \nNational School Lunch Program, yet only about 200,000 children received \na school breakfast on an average day through the National School \nBreakfast Program.\n  This disparity is not unique to Illinois. Nationally, 43 students \nreceive a free or reduced-price school breakfast for every 100 students \nthat receive a school lunch. To receive a free school breakfast or \nlunch, a family's income must be at or below 130 percent of the poverty \nline, and to receive a reduced-price school breakfast or lunch, the \nfamily income must be at or below 185 percent of the poverty line.\n  Students who are unable to eat breakfast experience negative \nphysical, emotional and educational effects. Children who do not eat \nbreakfast tend to produce low math and reading scores, have trouble \nrecalling information, and are more likely to have disciplinary and \npsychological problems.\n  On the other hand, when children eat a nutritious breakfast, like the \nmeals provided through the National School Breakfast Program, their \nstandardized test scores tend to increase and their memory skills \nimprove. They are less inclined to visit the school nurse complaining \nof headaches and stomach pangs throughout the school day. They are also \nless likely to become obese later in life and are more likely to eat \nmore fruit, drink more milk, and consume less saturated fat than \nstudents who do not eat meals provided by the school.\n  From 1989 to today, the number of children participating in the \nSchool Breakfast Program has doubled from around 3 million to over 6 \nmillion, and if the breakfasts were available to more children, the \nnumbers would likely increase.\n  In Illinois, the State legislature and the Governor recognized the \nneed for this vital program. On February 15, 2005, Governor Rod \nBlagojevich signed the Childhood Hunger Relief Act, stipulating that \nall schools in which at least 40 percent of the students are eligible \nfor free or reduced-price lunches must also provide a breakfast \nprogram. This action will hopefully increase the academic as well as \nphysical and psychological well-being of Illinois school children.\n  Today, I ask that we recognize States like Illinois--States that are \nproviding school breakfasts to their neediest children. I ask that we \ncontinue to push toward higher nutritional standards throughout the \nUnited States to ensure the well-being of our Nation's youth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/09/senate-section/article/S2381-2", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT of 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Tom \nBrennan on an outstanding career as the head coach of the men's \nbasketball team at the University of Vermont. As he departs UVM after \n19 years, I wish to recognize the contribution he has made to both the \nUniversity and to the State of Vermont.\n  Tom began his distinguished career at UVM in 1986. Within just 5 \nyears, in 1991, he was named the America East Coach of the Year, the \nfirst of three times he would receive that honor. Throughout his tenure \nat UVM, Tom worked to improve the basketball program, which became one \nof the best in the America East under his watch. Tom also became a \nlocal favorite on the airwaves as the cohost of ``Corm and the Coach,'' \na morning radio show that makes us all appreciate just how hard life \ncan be for Tom's opposing coaches.\n  In recent years, UVM basketball has been marked by enthusiastic \nsupport throughout Vermont and sold-out crowds at Patrick Gym as Tom \nguided the Catamounts to unprecedented success. In both 2003 and 2004, \nthe Cats captured the America East Championship and secured a trip to \nthe NCAA tournament. On Saturday, the Cats will play for their third \nstraight America East Championship and third straight trip to the NCAA \ntournament. Tom will retire with at least 262 career victories at UVM, \nmore than any basketball coach in school history.\n  Cats fans everywhere have grown to respect and admire Tom for the \nresults he produced on the court, the integrity of the program he led, \nand the character of the young men he helped to shape.

MORRISS\n\n   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and pay \ntribute to CAPT David M. Morriss, Judge Advocate General's Corps, \nUnited States Navy. Captain Morriss will retire from the Navy on March \n11, 2005, having completed a distinguished 26-year career of service to \nour Nation.\n  Captain Morriss was born in Elizabethtown, TN and is a graduate of \nthe United States Naval Academy and the University of Virginia School \nof Law.\n\n[[Page S2382]]\n\nHe also earned a Master of Laws degree from Harvard Law School.\n  During his military career, Captain Morriss excelled at all facets of \nhis chosen professions of law and Naval service. As a line officer, he \nserved both as Fire Control Officer onboard USS Bowen, FF-1079, and as \nSupporting Arms Coordinator/Assistant Operations Officer for Amphibious \nSquadron EIGHT. He qualified as a Surface Warfare Officer before being \naccepted in the law education program.\n  As a judge advocate, Captain Morriss has served in a variety of \nchallenging assignments. Like many judge advocates that have come \nbefore and have followed him, Captain Morriss began his legal career as \na defense counsel and legal assistance attorney at the Navy Legal \nServices Office, Charleston, SC. Later in his career, he was given the \nhonor of leading young judge advocates as the commanding officer, Navy \nLegal Services Office National Capital Region.\n  As Force/Fleet Judge Advocate he provided critical legal advice for \noperations in the Central Command's area of operations. His keen \nintellect and integrity led to Captain Morriss' services as the \nAssistant for Legal and Legislative matters for the Vice Chief of Naval \nOperations. This would not be the last time Captain Morriss was asked \nby the Department of the Navy for his advice and counsel on \nlegislation.\n  I am sure that many of my colleagues know and appreciate Captain \nMorriss' service as Director of Legislation in the Navy's Office of \nLegislative Affairs and his prior service as a Legislative Counsel in \nthat same office. During these assignments, he directly contributed to \nclear and concise communication between Congress and the Departments of \nthe Navy on a broad range of legislative matters. His talents, \nknowledge, and legal acumen are such that I have asked him to serve on \nthe staff of the Senate Armed services Committee. The Navy's loss is \ncertainly the Senate's gain, and we look forward to working with Dave \nMorriss for many years to come.\n  The Nation, the United States Navy, and the Judge Advocate General's \nCorps have been made better through the talent and dedication of CAPT \nDavid M. Morriss. I know all of my colleagues join me in congratulating \nDave, his wife Mary Elizabeth, and sons John, Will, and Graham, on the \ncompletion of an outstanding military career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/09/senate-section/article/S2382-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME\n\n  The following bill was read the first time:\n\n       S. 570.

A bill to amend title XVIII and XIX of the Social Security \nAct and title III of the Public Health Service Act to improve access to \ninformation about individuals' health care options and legal rights for \ncare near the end of life, to promote advance care planning and \ndecisionmaking so that individuals' wishes are known should they become \nunable to speak for themselves, to engage health care providers in \ndisseminating information about and assisting in the preparation of \nadvance directives, which include living wills and durable powers of \nattorney for health care, and for other purposes; read the first time.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I am introducing the \nInformation Security and Protection Act. It has to do with a subject \nmatter about which we have had breaking news over the course of the \nlast several days, and that is identity theft.\n  Two weeks ago we found out a company named ChoicePoint, a Georgia \ncompany, because of the conviction in a plea bargain with someone who \nhad under false pretenses broken into the database of this information \nbroker, had 400,000 individual records stolen and thus subject to the \ntaking of the personal identity of those 400,000 people. Of those we \nknow of, 10,000 of them are in my State, and I can tell you, having met \nwith a group of Floridians we picked at random in the central Florida \narea I met with a week and a half ago, it has been a tale of \nextraordinarily horrific circumstances for these Americans when their \nidentity was stolen to, No. 1, stop the theft, and then, No. 2, to \nreclaim their identity and to get back their identity, for example, \nwith a credit card on which bills have been run up and therefore their \ncredit becomes bad. Trying to get back their good name and their good \ncredit has become a horrific process.\n  One of the central Floridians I met with is a truckdriver who has a \nspecial license to drive trucks with hazardous materials. This \nparticular individual is so frustrated because whenever he goes to this \nGovernment agency or that Government agency, they always send him to \nanother one, saying we can't help you. There is someone out there with \nhis identity who keeps violating traffic rules and laws all over the \ncountry and he keeps getting summonses to courts in States all over the \ncountry, and he can't get back his identity.\n  That is just one example. Or take the example of the mom recently \nwidowed, so her grown daughter takes over the paying of her bills, and \nbecause the mom has always been frugal, the daughter sees a charge on \nthe credit card for $10,000 and thinks, well, my mom is suddenly going \nto start spending a little on herself. The daughter continues to pay \nthese kinds of bills until she finally gets a call from a store in San \nFrancisco and the clerk says, I want to see if you will approve this \n$26,000 charge for your mother. And she says, well, that is not my \nmother because my mother is not in San Francisco, she is here with me \nin Cocoa, FL right now. Fortunately, the game was up. They stopped that \nprocess, but that daughter had already paid $40,000 worth of bills \nthinking they were legitimate charges by her mother, and she will never \nget back that $40,000.\n  These are just a couple of examples of identity theft. But now the \nproblem has gotten to be so much larger because these data collectors, \nwhich I call information brokers, with the advance of technology are \nable to gather billions and billions of records. This particular \ncompany that has come to light over the last couple of weeks with the \ntheft of 400,000 records--ChoicePoint is the name of the company--has \nstored, now listen to this, 17 to 19 billion--that is with a B--\nrecords. With that amount of data, they virtually have information on \nevery American. It is not just credit reports that are protected by the \nFair Credit Reporting Act. It is Social Security numbers and driver's \nlicenses. It is job applications. It is DNA tests. It is medical \nrecords.\n  With this kind of information, centralized under the control of one \ncompany, if there is a penetration of the security of that company, \nthen you see what the invasion of our privacy is about to cause.\n  Indeed, we are going to be in a situation where no American has any \nprivacy, and we are going to continue to go through this process until \nwe say, enough already, and the people stand up and say: You have to \nprotect our privacy.\n  That is what the bill I am introducing, the Information Security and \nProtection Act, sets out to do. It is going to require legal \nsafeguards, put some teeth in the law, that is going to require not \njust credit reports, which is covered by existing Federal law, but it \nis going to require these collectors of information who sell them for a \nprofit-making business to have the safeguards to protect the consumers.\n  Additionally, it is going to have the safeguards for the consumers so \nthey can have access to those records and see if, in fact, they are \ncorrect, and if they are not, correct them and have a list of the \npeople who are seeking the information about them.\n  We had another case come to light a week ago, and that was the case \nof records that are missing. We do not know if they were destroyed, if \nthey were lost, or if they were stolen, but they are the records of \ncustomers of the Bank of America. We are talking about 1.2 million \ncustomers. And, oh, by the way, some of those customers\n\n[[Page S2386]]\n\nare Federal employees who happen to have this particular card. It is \nthe Federal travel card. This card is distributed additionally to the \nMembers of the Senate.\n  On that stolen or missing information is the very personal and \nprivate information of 60 Senators in this Chamber. Let's hope we do \nnot become the victims of identity theft and that we have to go through \nall of these horrific experiences I have heard in talking with some of \nmy constituents. But, in fact, we may. Until we find out what happened \nto those records of 1.2 million individuals, Federal employees, then we \nare subject to these kinds of traumas that come from identity theft.\n  Today we have learned of a major breach at the Boca Raton based \ncompany called SizeNet. It is a part of Lexis-Nexis. Information that \nwas accessed included names, addresses, Social Security and driver's \nlicense numbers; not the credit history, medical records, or financial \ninformation. This group said--and they put out a statement to the \nLondon Stock Exchange--that this was information on 32,000 U.S. \ncitizens. It may have been accessed from one of the databases. The \ncompany said the breach, made on its legal and business information \nservice, Lexis-Nexis, which had recently acquired this SizeNet unit, \nwas being investigated by staff and U.S. law enforcement authorities. \nSo here we have another 32,000 U.S. citizens who could possibly be the \nvictims of identity theft.\n  Are we going to do anything about it? I sure hope so, and I am \nhopeful that we are going to have the Congress start to take action on \na bill Congressman Markey in the House, a Member of the House Commerce \nCommittee, and I, a Member of the Senate Commerce Committee, have \nintroduced.\n  This bill requires the Federal Government to begin to regulate the \nproducts offered by information brokers. Under the legislation, the \nFederal Trade Commission would pass regulations that would empower \nconsumers to have control over the personal information they have \ncompiled in these databases. Consumers would be given, for the first \ntime, the right to find out what files information brokers keep about \nthem, and they would be given the right to make sure the information in \nthe files is correct. They would be given the right to promptly correct \nthe inaccurate information. They would be permitted to find out which \npeople have asked for copies of their personal information.\n  What would be the responsibility of the information broker? It would \nrequire the Federal Trade Commission to come up with standards to \nensure that those brokers know to whom they are selling that consumer \ninformation and the purposes for which it is being used. Those \ninformation brokers would be required to safeguard and protect the \nprivacy of the billions of consumer records they hold.\n  Under present law, there is no protection unless you fall under a law \nsuch as the Fair Credit Reporting Act which protects consumer credit \nrecords. But all the amassing of this additional data is not protected \nunder current law.\n  This bill I am filing also allows Government law enforcers and \nconsumers to bring tough legal actions against the brokers if they \nviolate the new regulations that the FTC would promulgate. Then it \nclearly gives a nod to the States to pass their own laws that they \nbelieve are necessary to effectively regulate information brokers.\n  This bill is not a catchall bill. This bill is meant to focus very \nnarrowly on information brokers. It instructs the FTC to carve out \nappropriate regulatory exemptions that are in the public interest. So \nthere is flexibility for the FTC to adjust to different circumstances.\n  After the FTC passes its new regulations, then the FTC, in our \noversight capacity, would be reporting back to us and specifically \nwould be reporting to our committees--the Commerce Committees in both \nthe House and the Senate--and then Congress would determine whether \nfurther statutory changes were necessary, as is the prerogative to \nadjust and adapt as circumstances change.\n  I want to work with all the people who are involved in this \nsituation. We do not want something that is overreaching, but were are \ngetting to the point that with the advance of technology, something has \nto be done or virtually none of us will have any privacy.\n  By the way, there is another reason to pass this legislation. We are \nin a new kind of war, and that war is against terrorists. The terrorist \ndeals by stealth, and one way is to assume the identity of someone \nelse. If we do not have the protections of all our identities, there is \nanother source for the terrorist.\n  What is it going to take to spur the Congress into action? I thank \nthe time is here. We have three examples in the last 2 weeks--\nChoicePoint, Bank of America, and today Lexis-Nexis. I ask for the \nsupport of the Senate in passing the Information Protection and \nSecurity Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 570\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Every year 2,500,000 people die in the United States. \n     Eighty percent of those people die in institutions such as \n     hospitals, nursing homes, and other facilities. Chronic \n     illnesses, such as cancer and heart disease, account for 2 \n     out of every 3 deaths.\n       (2) In January 2004, a study published in the Journal of \n     the American Medical Association concluded that many people \n     dying in institutions have unmet medical, psychological, and \n     spiritual needs. Moreover, family members of decedents who \n     received care at home with hospice services were more likely \n     to report a favorable dying experience.\n       (3) In 1997, the Supreme Court of the United States, in its \n     decisions in Washington v. Glucksberg and Vacco v. Quill, \n     reaffirmed the constitutional right of competent adults to \n     refuse unwanted medical treatment. In those cases, the Court \n     stressed the use of advance directives as a means of \n     safeguarding that right should those adults become incapable \n     of deciding for themselves.\n       (4) A study published in 2002 estimated that the overall \n     prevalence of advance directives is between 15 and 20 percent \n     of the general population, despite the passage of the Patient \n     Self-Determination Act in 1990, which requires that health \n     care providers tell patients about advance directives.\n       (5) Competent adults should complete advance care plans \n     stipulating their health care decisions in the event that \n     they become unable to speak for themselves. Through the \n     execution of advance directives, including living wills and \n     durable powers of attorney for health care according to the \n     laws of the State in which they reside, individuals can \n     protect their right to express their wishes and have them \n     respected.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to improve \n     access to information about individuals' health care options \n     and legal rights for care near the end of life, to promote \n     advance care planning and decisionmaking so that individuals' \n     wishes are known should they become unable to speak for \n     themselves, to engage health care providers in disseminating \n     information about and assisting in the preparation of advance \n     directives, which include living wills and durable powers of \n     attorney for health care, and for other purposes.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to give \nadditional biosecurity responsibilities to the Department of Homeland \nSecurity; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 573. A bill to improve the response of the Federal Government to \nagroterrorism and agricultural diseases; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two bills to \nincrease the security of the Nation's agriculture and food supply: the \nHomeland Security Food and Agriculture Act and the Agriculture Security \nAssistance Act. Both measures build on legislation I sponsored in the \n107th and 108th Congresses. I would like to thank my good friend, \nSenator Durbin, who cosponsored my agriculture security bills last \nsession, for continuing his support of this legislation.\n  The first bill, the Homeland Security Food and Agriculture Act, will \nenhance coordination between the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) \nand other Federal agencies responsible for food and agriculture \nsecurity. The Agriculture Security Assistance Act will increase \ncoordination between Federal and State, local, and tribal officials and \noffer financial and technical assistance to farmers, ranchers, and \nveterinarians to improve preparedness.\n  The Nation's agriculture industry represents about 13 percent of GDP \nand nearly 17 percent of domestic employment. Yet, this critical \neconomic sector is not receiving adequate protection from accidental or \nintentional contamination that would damage our economy, and, most \nimportantly, could cost lives. Such contamination could be devastating \nto states such as Hawaii which generates more than $1.9 billion in \nagricultural sales annually.\n  Just last week, the President of Interpol warned that the \nconsequences of an attack on livestock are ``substantial'' and \n``relatively little'' is being done to prevent such an attack.\n  The introduction of my bills coincides with the release of a report I \nrequested from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) entitled \n``Much is Being Done to Protect Agriculture from a Terrorist Attack, \nbut Important Challenges Remain.'' The report reviews the current state \nof agriculture security in the United States and makes recommendations. \nWhile GAO reported some accomplishments, such as conducting \nvulnerability assessments of agricultural products, establishing the \nFood and Agriculture Sector Coordinating Council, and funding two \nuniversity-based Centers of Excellence to research livestock and \npoultry diseases, GAO found that critical vulnerabilities still exist.\n  Even though veterinarians may be the first to spot outbreaks of \ndiseases, Department of Agriculture (USDA) certified veterinarians are \nnot required to\n\n[[Page S2388]]\n\ndemonstrate any knowledge of foreign animal diseases. This is short \nsighted given how easily animal diseases can travel from country to \ncountry as we have seen with the avian flu over the past few years. It \nis important that veterinarians, who will be our first responders in \nthe event of an agroterrorist attack, be able to identify symptoms of a \nforeign disease in U.S. livestock.\n  GAO also highlights USDA's inability to deploy vaccines within 24 \nhours of an animal disease outbreak as required by Homeland Security \nPresidential Directive 9 (HSPD-9). According to GAO, the vaccine for \nfoot-and-mouth disease (FMD), which is the only animal disease vaccine \nthat the United States stockpiles, is purchased from Britain in a \nconcentrate form. To use the vaccine the concentrate must be sent back \nto Britain to be activated, which adds at least three weeks to the \ndeployment time.\n  According to a scenario from Dr. Tom McGinn, formerly of the North \nCarolina Department of Agriculture, FMD would spread to 23 States five \ndays after an initial outbreak and to 40 States after 30 days. By the \ntime the vaccine is deployed, FMD could spread across the country. We \ncannot afford to wait three weeks to start vaccinating livestock. Why \nis the United States outsourcing this critical security function? USDA \nshould either store ready-to-use vaccines in the U.S. or examine ways \nto activate the vaccines in this country.\n  Equally troubling is that over the past 2 years, the number of \nagricultural inspections performed by the U.S. has declined by 3.4 \nmillion since DHS took over the border inspection responsibility from \nUSDA. Mr. Kim Mann, a spokesman from the National Association of \nAgriculture Employees (NAAE), expressed similar concerns at a February \n10, 2005, hearing conducted by the Senate Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight of Government \nManagement, the Federal Workforce, and the District of Columbia (OGM). \nMr. Mann testified that of the approximately 2,100 Agriculture \nQuarantine Inspection positions that were transferred from USDA to DHS \nin 2003, only about 1,300 of those positions are currently filled. \nAccording to Mr. Mann, agriculture inspectors have left DHS to return \nto USDA because of DHS's lack of commitment to its agriculture mission, \nand DHS is not filling these vacancies. I recently wrote Undersecretary \nfor Border and Transportation Security Asa Hutchinson expressing my \nconcern over these reports because agriculture inspections are crucial \nto the economy of Hawaii which is home to more endangered species than \nany other State.\n\n  GAO also reported a lack of communication between DHS and states \nregarding the development of emergency response plans, grant guidance, \nand best practices. States agriculture officials were given as little \nas three days to provide input on the National Response Plan and the \nNational Infrastructure Protection Plan. In addition, the State \nHomeland Security Grant Program grant guidance puts little emphasis on \nagriculture as a sector eligible for assistance. In fact, agriculture \nonly became eligible in fiscal year 04 and many states are unaware that \nfunds can be directed towards agriculture security. In addition, State \nand industry officials reported that there is no mechanism to share \nlessons learned from exercises or real-life animal disease outbreaks.\n  GAO further notes that shortcomings exist in DHS's Federal \ncoordination of national efforts to protect against agroterrorism. \nFederal officials claim that there is confusion in interagency working \ngroups as to which responsibility falls with whom. DHS reportedly also \nhas been unable to coordinate agriculture security research efforts \ngovernment-wide as is required by HSPD-9. While some program staff from \nDHS, USDA, and Health and Human Services have engaged in preliminary \ndiscussions, there is no overall departmental coordination of policy \nand budget issues between the various Federal agencies.\n  My bills address many of the concerns raised by GAO. The Homeland \nSecurity Food and Agriculture Act will: increase communication and \ncoordination between DHS and state, local, and tribal homeland security \nofficials regarding agroterrorism; Ensure agriculture security is \nincluded in state, local, and regional emergency response plans; and \nestablish a task force of state and local first responders that will \nwork with DHS to identify best practices in the area of agriculture \nsecurity.\n  The Agriculture Security Assistance Act will: provide financial and \ntechnical assistance to states and localities for agroterrorism \npreparedness and response; increase international agricultural disease \nsurveillance and inspections of imported agricultural products; require \nthat certified veterinarians be knowledgeable in foreign animal \ndiseases; and require that USDA study the costs and benefits of \ndeveloping a more robust animal disease vaccine stockpile.\n  The United States needs a coordinated approach in dealing with the \npossibility of an attack on our food supply, which could affect \nmillions. While improvements have occurred since I first voiced my \nconcerns over food and agriculture security in 2001, critical \nvulnerabilities remain. I urge my colleagues to join me in protecting \nAmerica's breadbasket and support these vital pieces of legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of both bills be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered tobe printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 572\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na refundable credit for certain education expenses; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the ``Educational \nOpportunity for All Act.'' The core of the American Dream is getting a \ncollege education and I want to make sure that every student has access \nto that dream. I want to help families who are trying to send their \nchildren to college and adults who are going back to school--for their \nfirst degree or their third. This $4,000 tuition tax credit will help \nstudents who are taking one night class at a community college to \nupdate their skills or four classes at a university to get their \nbachelor's degree. And my tax credit is refundable so it helps families \nwho don't owe taxes.\n  Our middle class families are stressed and stretched. Families in my \nState of Maryland are worried--they're worried about their jobs and \nthey're terrified of losing their healthcare when costs keep \nballooning. Many are holding down more than one job to make ends meet. \nThey're racing from carpools to work and back again. But most of all, \nthey don't know how they can afford to send their kids to college. And \nthey want to know what we in the United States Senate are doing to help \nthem.\n  That's why I want to give every family sending a child to college a \n$4,000 per student per year tuition tax credit. My bill would give help \nto those who practice self help--the families who are working and \nsaving to send their child to college or update their own skills.\n  College tuition is on the rise across America. Tuition at the \nUniversity of Maryland has increased by almost 40 percent since 2002. \nTuition for Baltimore Community College rose by $300 in one year. The \naverage total cost of going to a 4-year public college is $10,635 per \nyear, including tuition, fees, room and board. University of Maryland \nwill cost more than $15,000 for a full time undergraduate student who \nlives on campus.\n  Financial Aid isn't keeping up with these rising costs. Pell Grants \ncover only 40 percent of average costs at 4-year public colleges. \nTwenty years ago, Pell Grants covered 80 percent of average costs. Our \nstudents are graduating with so much debt it's like their first \nmortgage. The average undergraduate student debt from college loans is \nalmost $19,000. College is part of the American Dream; it shouldn't be \npart of the American financial nightmare.\n  Families are looking for help. I'm sad to say, the President doesn't \noffer them much hope. The Republican budget has all the wrong \npriorities. President Bush proposed increasing the maximum Pell Grant \nby just $100 to $4,150. I want to double Pell Grants. Instead of easing \nthe burden on middle class families, the Republican budget helps out \nbig business cronies with lavish tax breaks while eating into Social \nSecurity and creating deficits as far as the eye can see.\n  We need to do more to help middle class families afford college. We \nneed to immediately increase the maximum Pell Grant to $4,500 and \ndouble it over the next 6 years. We need to make sure student loans are \naffordable. And we need a bigger tuition tax credit for the families \nstuck in the middle who aren't eligible for Pell Grants but still can't \nafford college.\n  A $4,000 refundable tax credit for tuition will go a long way. It \nwill give middle class families some relief by helping the first-time \nstudent at our 4-year institutions like University of Maryland and the \nmid-career student at our terrific community colleges. A $4,000 tax \ncredit would be 60 percent of the tuition at Maryland and enough to \ncover the cost of tuition at most community colleges. My bill would \nhelp make college affordable for everyone.\n  College education is more important than ever: 40 percent of new jobs \nin the next 10 years will require post-secondary education. College is \nimportant to families and it's important to our economy. To compete in \nthe global economy, we need to make sure all our children have 21st \ncentury skills for 21st century jobs. And the benefits of education \nhelp not just the individual but society as a whole.\n  To have a safer America and a stronger economy, we need to have a \nsmarter America. We need to invest in our human capital to create a \nworld class workforce. That means making a college education \naffordable.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n                                 S. 575\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to restore the prohibition on the commercial sale and \nslaughter of wild free-roaming horses and burros; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, President Reagan was often fond of saying \nthat ``there's nothing better for the inside of a man than the outside \nof a horse.'' So he surely would have been proud when, on November 18, \n2004, during the closing days of the 108th Congress, the Senate passed \na resolution introduced by our former colleague Senator Ben Nighthorse \nCampbell that designated December 13, 2004, as ``National Day of the \nHorse.'' The resolution encouraged the people of the United States to \nbe mindful of the contribution of horses to the economy, history, and \ncharacter of our great Nation. The resolution, S. Res. 452, included a \nprovision that stated ``horses are a vital part of the collective \nexperience of the United States and deserve protection and \ncompassion.''\n  Beginning in the 1950's, public awareness was raised about the cruel \nand inhumane manner in which wild horses and burros were being rounded \nup on public lands and subsequently sent to slaughter. Velma B. \nJohnston, later known as Wild Horse Annie, led an effort to protect \nthis symbol of the American West that captured the imagination of \nschool children across the country. In 1959, which was my first year in \nthe Senate, Congress passed legislation I was pleased to support that \nprohibited the use of motorized vehicles to hunt wild horses and burros \non all public lands. But the bill, which came to be known as the ``Wild \nHorse Annie Act,'' did not include a program for the management of wild \nhorses and burros in the United States.\n  It was not until 1971 that Congress passed the Wild Free-Roaming \nHorse and Burro Act. The law, which I also supported, established as \nnational policy that ``wild free-roaming horses and burros shall be \nprotected from capture, branding, harassment, and death'' and that ``no \nwild free-roaming horses or burros or their remains may be sold or \ntransferred for consideration for processing into commercial \nproducts.''\n  The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the U.S. Forest Service were \ntasked with enforcement of the law on public lands. Unfortunately, \nseveral reports have documented the failure by the agencies to properly \nmanage these animals. As a result, the BLM currently has approximately \n22,000 wild horses and burros in holding facilities where their feeding \nand care use up nearly half of the agency's budget for wild horse and \nburro management.\n  The Wild Free-Roaming Horse and Burro Act had been the law of the \nland until President Bush signed the FY 2005 Omnibus Appropriations \nbill on December 8, 2004. Included in the omnibus appropriations bill \nwas a provision that would require the BLM to put up for public sale \nany wild horse taken off the range that is more than 10 years old and \nany horse that has been unsuccessfully offered for adoption three \ntimes. The BLM has estimated that about 8,400 mustangs out of 22,000 \nbeing kept on seven sanctuaries meet that criteria.\n  Surely there are actions that can be taken by the BLM to ensure the \nproper operation of the wild horse and burro program without resorting \nto the slaughter of these animals. Instead of taking the time to make \nthe changes necessary to ensure the proper management of wild horses, \nthis provision reaches for the butcher knife instead.\n  In response, my friend and colleague from West Virginia, Rep. Nick \nJoe Rahall, has introduced H.R. 297, a bill that would restore the \nprohibition on the commercial sale and slaughter of wild free-roaming \nhorses and burros. I am pleased to join with him in his effort to \noverturn this egregious provision and reinstate Federal protections for \none of the enduring symbols of the American frontier.\n  In closing, I quote from British poet Ronald Duncan's Ode to the \nHorse:\n\n       Where in this wide world can a man find nobility without \n     pride, friendship without envy or beauty without vanity? \n     Here: where grace is laced with muscle and strength by \n     gentleness confined. He serves without servility; he has \n     fought without enmity. There is nothing so powerful, nothing \n     less violent; there is nothing so quick, nothing less \n     patient. England's past has been bourne on his back. All our \n     history is his industry. We are his heirs; he our \n     inheritance. The Horse.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mr. Feingold):\n  S. 577. A bill to promote health care coverage for individuals \nparticipating in legal recreational activities or legal transportation \nactivities; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague \nfrom Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, in introducing legislation to \nprohibit health insurers from denying benefits to plan participants if \nthey are injured while engaging in legal recreational activities like \nskiing, snowmobiling, or horseback riding.\n  Among the many rules that were issued at the end of the Clinton \nAdministration was one that was intended to ensure non-discrimination \nin health coverage in the group market. This rule was issued jointly on \nJanuary 8, 2001, by the Department of Labor, the Internal Revenue \nService and the Health Care Financing Administration--now the Centers \nfor Medicare and Medicaid Services--in accordance with the Health \nInsurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996.\n  While I was pleased that the rule prohibits health plans and issuers \nfrom denying coverage to individuals who engage in certain types of \nrecreational activities, such as skiing, horseback riding, snowmobiling \nor motorcycling, I am extremely concerned that it would allow insurers \nto deny health benefits for an otherwise covered injury that results \nfrom participation in these activities.\n  The rule states that: ``While a person cannot be excluded from a plan \nfor engaging in certain recreational activities, benefits for a \nparticular injury can, in some cases, be excluded based on the source \nof the injury.'' A plan could, for example, include a general exclusion \nfor injuries sustained while\n\n[[Page S2393]]\n\ndoing a specified list of recreational activities, even though \ntreatment for those injuries--a broken arm for instance--would have \nbeen covered under the plan if the individual had tripped and fallen.\n  Because of this loophole, an individual who was injured while skiing \nor running could be denied health care coverage, while someone who is \ninjured while drinking and driving a car would be protected.\n\n  This clearly is contrary to Congressional intent. One of the purposes \nof HIPAA was to prohibit plans and issuers from establishing \neligibility rules for health coverage based on certain health-related \nfactors, including evidence of insurability. To underscore that point, \nthe conference report language stated that ``the inclusion of evidence \nof insurability in the definition of health status is intended to \nensure, among other things, that individuals are not excluded from \nhealth care coverage due to their participation in activities such as \nmotorcycling, snowmobiling, all-terrain vehicle riding, horseback \nriding, skiing and other similar activities.'' The conference report \nalso states that ``this provision is meant to prohibit insurers or \nemployers from excluding employees in a group from coverage or charging \nthem higher premiums based on their health status and other related \nfactors that could lead to higher health costs.''\n  Millions of Americans participate in these legal and common \nrecreational activities which, if practiced with appropriate \nprecautions, do not significantly increase the likelihood of serious \ninjury. Moreover, in enacting HIPAA, Congress simply did not intend \nthat people would be allowed to purchase health insurance only to find \nout, after the fact, that they have no coverage for an injury resulting \nfrom a common recreational activity. If this rule is allowed to stand, \nmillions of Americans will be forced to forgo recreational activities \nthat they currently enjoy lest they have an accident and find out that \nthey are not covered for needed care resulting from that accident.\n  The legislation that we are introducing today will clarify that \nindividuals participating in activities routinely enjoyed by millions \nof Americans cannot be denied access to health care coverage or health \nbenefits as a result of their activities. The bill should not be \ncontroversial. In fact, it passed the Senate by unanimous consent last \nNovember. Unfortunately, however, the House did not have time to act \nbefore the end of the Congress.\n  I am therefore hopeful that we will be able to move quickly on this \nlegislation this year, and I urge all of my colleagues to join us as \ncosponsors.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we have the benefit of many resources \nthat provide us with a wealth of information: our dedicated staffs, the \nagencies of the Federal Government, and the many interested citizens \nand groups who follow issues.\n  We rely every day on the information we get from all these sources. \nBut we also rely on plain old common sense. I rise today to introduce a \nbill that is based on common sense.\n  The premise is this: if we think somebody is a terrorist or has ties \nto terrorism, and that person purchases a deadly weapon, we need to \nknow about it and keep track of it.\n  The bill I am introducing is called the ``Terrorist Apprehension \nRecord Retention (TARR) Act.'' I am introducing it in response to a \nreport that Senator Biden and I requested from the Government \nAccountability Office (GAO).\n  The report examined the practices of the National Instant Criminal \nBackground Checks system (NICS) in conducting background checks of \npeople who are on the Federal terrorist watch list and who try to \npurchase firearms.\n  The GAO found that from February 3 through June 30 of last year--a \nperiod of just five months--a total of 44 known or suspected terrorists \nattempted to purchase firearms. The GAO Report is available at http://\nwww.gao.gov/new.items/d05127.pdf.\n  In 35 of these cases, the FBI authorized the transactions to proceed \nbecause its field agents were unable to find any disqualifying \ninformation, such as felony convictions or illegal immigrant status, \nwithin the federally prescribed three business days.\n  FBI officials told GAO investigators that from June through October \n2004, the FBI's NICS handled an additional 14 transactions involving \nknown or suspected terrorists. Of these 14 transactions, the FBI \nallowed 12 to proceed and denied 2 based on prohibiting information.\n  These people who are on the terrorist watch list are not even allowed \nto board a commercial airliner. Yet most of them were allowed to \npurchase firearms.\n  Some would say that defies common sense--but it gets worse.\n  After most of the people with suspected terrorist connections were \nallowed to purchase these deadly weapons, the FBI was forced to destroy \nthe records of the transactions within 24 hours after the FBI had \napproved the sale.\n  These records were destroyed pursuant to the ``Tiahrt Amendment'' \nwhich was implemented last July.\n  The GAO also found that Department of Justice procedures prohibit the \nNICS from sharing information about gun sales to suspected terrorists \nwith counterterrorism officials.\n  This restriction of information-sharing is based on the belief at DOJ \nthat information gathered by NICS should not be used for law \nenforcement purposes or to fight the war against terror. This is \ndespite the fact that FBI counterterrorism officials said that it would \nhelp them fight the war on terror if they were to routinely receive all \navailable personal identifying information and other details from \nvalid-match background checks of known or suspected terrorists.\n  So, not only are people suspected of having links to terrorism \nallowed to purchase deadly weapons, but then we don't even tell our \ncounterterrorism agents about it--and we destroy the records!\n  This doesn't seem like common sense to me.\n  In fact, it seems like a policy that not only allows terrorists to \nacquire weapons, but then helps them cover their tracks.\n  In light of the findings in this report, Senators Corzine, Schumer, \nClinton, Feinstein, Mikulski, Reed and Kennedy are joining me in \nintroducing the TARR Act, which would do two very important things.\n  First, the bill would require the Federal Government, specifically \nthe NICS and FBI, to maintain for 10 years all records related to a \nNICS transaction involving a valid match to the VGTOF terrorist \nrecords--a suspected or known terrorist.\n  It is outrageous that one unit of the FBI--NICS--has information that \ncould help us win the war against terrorism, but that information is \ndeleted.\n  Second, the TARR Act would require all information related to the \ntransactions involving a valid match to the VGTOF terrorist records \nmust be shared with all appropriate Federal and State counterterrorism \nofficials. Both FBI counterterrorism agents and State counterterrorism \nagencies should have access to this potentially valuable information. I \nencourage my colleagues to support this common sense legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord. I also ask unanimous consent that an article from the March 8, \n2005 edition of the New York Times be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 578\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

In all, officials approved \n     47 of 58 gun applications from terror suspects over a nine-\n     month period last year, it found.\n       The gun buyers came up as positive matches on a classified \n     internal F.B.I. watch list that includes thousands of \n     terrorist suspects, many of whom are being monitored, trailed \n     or sought for questioning as part of terrorism investigations \n     into Islamic-based, militia-style and other groups, official \n     said. G.A.O. investigators were not given access to the \n     identities of the gun buyers because of those investigations.\n       The report is to be released on Tuesday, and an advance \n     copy was provided to The New York Times.\n       Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, who \n     requested the study, plans to introduce legislation to \n     address the problem in part by requiring federal officials \n     to keep records of gun purchases by terror suspects for a \n     minimum of 10 years. Such records must now be destroyed \n     within 24 hours as a result of a change ordered by \n     Congress last year. Mr. Lautenberg maintains that the new \n     policy has hindered terrorism investigations by \n     eliminating the paper trail on gun purchases.\n       ``Destroying these records in 24 hours is senseless and \n     will only help terrorists cover their tracks,'' Mr. \n     Lautenberg said Monday. ``It's an absurd policy.''\n       He blamed what he called the Bush administration's \n     ``twisted allegiances'' to the National Rifle Association for \n     the situation.\n       The N.R.A. and gun rights supporters in Congress have \n     fought--successfully, for the most part--to limit the use of \n     the F.B.I.'s national gun-buying database as a tool for law \n     enforcement investigators, saying the database would amount \n     to an illegal registry of gun owners nationwide.\n       The legal debate over how gun records are used became \n     particularly contentious months after the Sept. 11 attacks, \n     when it was disclosed that the Justice Department and John \n     Ashcroft, then the attorney general, had blocked the F.B.I. \n     from using the gun-buying records to match against some 1,200 \n     suspects who were detained as part of the Sept. 11 \n     investigation. Mr. Ashcroft maintained that using the records \n     in a criminal investigation would violate the federal law \n     that created the system for instant background gun checks, \n     but Justice Department lawyers who reviewed the issue said \n     they saw no such prohibition.\n       In response to the report, Mr. Lautenberg also plans to ask \n     Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales to assess whether people \n     listed on the F.B.I.'s terror watch list should be \n     automatically barred from buying a gun. Such a policy would \n     require a change in federal law.\n       F.B.I. officials acknowledge shortcomings in the current \n     approach to using gun-buying records in terror cases, but \n     they say they are somewhat constrained by gun laws as \n     established by Congress and interpreted by the Justice \n     Department.\n       ``We're in a tough position,'' said an F.B.I. official who \n     spoke on condition of anonymity because the report has not \n     been formally released. ``Obviously, we want to keep guns out \n     of the hands of terrorists, but we also have to be mindful of \n     privacy and civil rights concerns, and we can't do anything \n     beyond what the law allows us to do.''\n       After initial reluctance from Mr. Ashcroft over Second \n     Amendment concerns, the Justice Department changed its policy \n     in February 2004 to allow the F.B.I. to do more cross-\n     checking between gun-buying records and terrorist \n     intelligence.\n       Under the new policy, millions of gun applications are run \n     against the F.B.I.'s internal terrorist watch list, and if \n     there is a match, bureau field agents or other \n     counterterrorism personnel are to be contacted to determine \n     whether they have any information about the terror suspect.\n       In some cases, the extra review allowed the F.B.I. to block \n     a gun purchase by a suspected terrorist that might otherwise \n     have proceeded because of a lag time in putting information \n     into the database, the accountability office's report said.\n       In one instance last year, follow-up information provided \n     by F.B.I. field agents revealed that someone on a terror \n     watch list was deemed ``mentally defective,'' even though \n     that information had not yet made its way into the gun \n     database. In a second case, field agents disclosed that an \n     applicant was in the country illegally. Both applications \n     were denied.\n       Even so, the report concluded that the Justice Department \n     should clarify what information could and could not be shared \n     between gun-buying administrators and terrorism \n     investigators. It also concluded that the F.B.I. should keep \n     closer track of the performance of state officials who handle \n     gun background checks in lieu of the F.B.I.\n       ``Given that these background checks involve known or \n     suspected terrorists who could pose homeland security \n     risks,'' the report said, ``more frequent F.B.I. oversight or \n     centralized management would help ensure that suspected \n     terrorists who have disqualifying factors do not obtain \n     firearms in violation of the law.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself, Mr. Brownback, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. \n        Santorum, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Ensign):\n  S. 579. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to authorize \nfunding for the establishment of a program on children and the media \nwithin the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development to \nstudy the role and impact of electronic media in the development of \nchildren, to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with \nSenators Brownback, Clinton, Santorum, Landrieu, Ensign and Durbin, the \nChildren and Media Research Advancement Act, or CAMRA Act. We believe \nthere is an urgent need to establish a federal role for targeting \nresearch on the impact of media on children. From the cradle to the \ngrave, our children now live and develop in a world of media--a world \nthat is increasingly digital, and a world where access is at their \nfingertips. This emerging digital world is well known to our children, \nbut its effects on their development are not well understood. Young \npeople today are spending an average of 6 and a half hours with media \neach day. For those who are under age 6, two hours of exposure to \nscreen media each day is common, even for those who are under age 2. \nThat is about as much time as children under age 6 spend playing \noutdoors, and it is much more time than they spend reading or being \nread to by their parents. How does this investment of time affect \nchildren's physical development, their cognitive development, or their \nmoral values? Unfortunately, we still have very limited information \nabout how media, particularly the newer interactive media, affect \nchildren's development. Why? We have not charged any Federal agency \nwith ensuring an ongoing funding base to establish a coherent research \nagenda about the impact of media on children's lives. This lack of a \ncoordinated government-sponsored effort to understand the effects of \nmedia on children's development is truly an oversight on our part, as \nthe potential payoffs for this kind of knowledge are enormous.\n\n[[Page S2395]]\n\n  Consider our current national health crisis of childhood obesity. The \nnumber of U.S. children and teenagers who are overweight has more than \ntripled from the 1960's through 2002. We think that media exposure is \npartly the cause of this epidemic. Is it? Is time spent viewing screens \nand its accompanying sedentary lifestyle contributing to childhood and \nadolescent obesity? Or is the constant bombardment of advertisements \nfor sugar-coated cereals, snack foods, and candy that pervade \nchildren's television advertisements the culprit? How do the newer \nonline forms of ``stealth marketing'', such as advergaming where food \nproducts are embedded in computer games, affect children's and \nadolescents' purchasing patterns? What will happen when pop-up \nadvertisements begin to appear on children's cell phones that \nspecifically target them for the junk food that they like best at a \nplace where that food is easily obtainable? The answer to the obesity \nand media question is complex. A committee at the National Academy of \nSciences is currently charged with studying the link between media \nadvertising and childhood obesity. Will the National Academy of \nSciences panel have the data they need to answer this important \nquestion? A definitive answer has the potential to save a considerable \namount of money in other areas of our budget. For example, child health \ncare costs that are linked to childhood obesity issues could be reduced \nby understanding and altering media diets.\n  Or take the Columbine incident. After two adolescent boys shot and \nkilled some of their teachers, classmates, and then turned their guns \non themselves at Columbine High School, we asked ourselves if media \nplayed some role in this tragedy. Did these boys learn to kill in part \nfrom playing first-person shooter video games like Doom where they \nacted as a killer? Were they rehearsing criminal activities when \nplaying this game? We looked to the research community for an answer. \nIn the violence and media area, Congress had passed legislation in the \npast so that research was conducted about the relationship between \nmedia violence and childhood aggression, and as a result, we knew more. \nEven though much of this data base was older and involved the link \nbetween exposure to violent television programs and childhood \naggression, some answers were forthcoming about how the Columbine \ntragedy could have taken place. Even so, there is still a considerable \namount of speculation about the more complex questions. Why did these \nparticular boys, for example, pull the trigger in real life while \nothers who played Doom confine their aggressive acts to the gaming \ncontext? We need to be able to answer questions about which children \nunder what circumstances will translate game playing into real-life \nlethal actions. Investing in media research could potentially reduce \nour budgets associated with adolescent crime and delinquency as well as \nreduce real-life human misery and suffering.\n  Many of us believe that our children are becoming increasingly \nmaterialistic. Does exposure to commercial advertising and the ``good \nlife'' experienced by media characters partly explain materialistic \nattitudes? We're not sure. Recent research using brain-mapping \ntechniques finds that an adult who sees images of desired \nproducts demonstrates patterns of brain activation that are typically \nassociated with reaching out with a hand. How does repeatedly seeing \nattractive products affect our children and their developing brains? \nWhat will happen when our children will be able to click on their \ntelevision screen and go directly to sites that advertise the products \nthat they see in their favorite programs? Or use their cell phones to \npay for products that they want in the immediate environment? Exactly \nwhat kind of values are we cultivating in our children, and what role \ndoes exposure to media content play in the development of those values?\n\n  A report linked very early television viewing with later symptoms \nthat are common in children who have attention deficit disorders. \nHowever, we don't know the direction of the relationship. Does \ntelevision viewing cause attention deficits, or do children who have \nattention deficits find television viewing experiences more engaging \nthan children who don't have attention problems? Or do parents whose \nchildren have difficulty sustaining attention let them watch more \ntelevision to encourage more sitting and less hyperactive behavior? How \nwill Internet experiences, particularly those where children move \nrapidly across different windows, influence attention patterns and \nattention problems? Once again, we don't know the answer. If early \ntelevision exposure does disrupt the development of children's \nattention patterns, resulting in their placement in special education \nprograms, actions taken to reduce screen exposure during the early \nyears could lead to subsequent reductions in children's need for \nspecial education classes, thereby saving money while fostering \nchildren's development in positive ways.\n  We want no child left behind in the 21st century. Many of us believe \nthat time spent with computers is good for our children, teaching them \nthe skills that they will need for success in the 21st century. Are we \nright? How is time spent with computers different from time spent with \ntelevision? What are the underlying mechanisms that facilitate or \ndisrupt children's learning from these varying media? Can academic \ndevelopment be fostered by the use of interactive online programs \ndesigned to teach as they entertain? In the first six years of life, \nCaucasian more so than African American or Latino children have \nInternet access from their homes. Can our newer interactive media help \nensure that no child is left behind, or will disparities in access \nresult in leaving some behind and not others?\n  The questions about how media affect the development of our children \nare clearly important, abundant, and complex. Unfortunately, the \nanswers to these questions are in short supply. Such gaps in our \nknowledge base limit our ability to make informed decisions about media \npolicy.\n  We know that media are important. Over the years, we have held \nnumerous hearings in these chambers about how exposure to media \nviolence affects childhood aggression. We passed legislation to \nmaximize the documented benefits of exposure to educational media, such \nas the Children's Television Act which requires broadcasters to provide \neducational and informational television programs for children. Can we \nfoster children's moral values when they are exposed to prosocial \nprograms that foster helping, sharing, and cooperating like those that \nhave come into being as a result of the Children's Television Act? We \nacted to protect our children from unfair commercial practices by \npassing the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act which provides \nsafeguards from exploitation for our youth as they explore the \nInternet, a popular pastime for them. Yet the Internet has provided new \nways to reach children with marketing that we barely know is taking \nplace, making our ability to protect our children all the more \ndifficult. We worry about our children's inadvertent exposure to online \npornography--about how that kind of exposure may undermine their moral \nvalues and standards of decency. In these halls of Congress, we acted \nto protect our children by passing the Communications Decency Act, the \nChild Online Protection Act, and the Children's Internet Protection Act \nto shield children from exposure to sexually-explicit online content \nthat is deemed harmful to minors. While we all agree that we need to \nprotect our children from online pornography, we know very little about \nhow to address even the most practical of questions such as how to \nprevent children from falling prey to adult strangers who approach them \nonline. There are so many areas in which our understanding is \npreliminary at best, particularly in those areas that involve the \neffects of our newer digital media.\n  In order to ensure that we are doing our very best for our children, \nthe behavioral and health recommendations and public policy decisions \nwe make should be based on objective behavioral, social, and scientific \nresearch. Yet no Federal research agency has responsibility for \noverseeing and setting a coherent media research agenda that can guide \nthese policy decisions. Instead, Federal agencies fund media research \nin a piecemeal fashion, resulting in a patch work quilt of findings. We \ncan do better than that.\n  The bill we are introducing today would remedy this problem. The\n\n[[Page S2396]]\n\nCAMRA Act will provide an overarching view of media effects by \nestablishing a program devoted to Children and Media within the \nNational Institute of Child Health and Human Development. This program \nof research, to be vetted by the National Academy of Sciences, will \nfund and energize a coherent program of research that illuminates the \nrole of media in children's cognitive, social, emotional, physical, and \nbehavioral development. The research will cover all forms of electronic \nmedia, including television, movies, DVDs, interactive video games, \ncell phones, and the Internet, and will encourage research involving \nchildren of all ages--even babies and toddlers. The bill also calls for \na report to Congress about the effectiveness of this research program \nin filling this void in our knowledge base. In order to accomplish \nthese goals, we are authorizing $90 million dollars to be phased in \ngradually across the next five years. The cost to our budget is minimal \nand can well result in significant savings in other budget areas.\n  Our Nation values the positive, healthy development of our children. \nOur children live in the information age, and our country has one of \nthe most powerful and sophisticated information technology systems in \nthe world. While this system entertains them, it is not harmless \nentertainment. Media have the potential to facilitate the healthy \ngrowth of our children. They also have the potential to harm. We have a \nstake in finding out exactly what that role is. We have a \nresponsibility to take action. Access to the knowledge that we need for \ninformed decision-making requires us to make an investment: an \ninvestment in research, an investment in and for our children, an \ninvestment in our collective future. The benefits to our youth and our \nnation's families are immeasurable.\n  By passing the Children and Media Research Advancement Act, we can \nadvance knowledge and enhance the constructive effects of media while \nminimizing the negative ones. We can make future media policies that \nare grounded in a solid knowledge base. We can be proactive, rather \nthan reactive. In so doing, we build a better nation for our youth, \nfostering the kinds of values that are the backbone of this great \nnation of ours, and we create a better foundation to guide future media \npolicies about the digital experiences that pervade our children's \ndaily lives.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n                                 s. 579\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Children and Media Research \n     Advancement Act'' or the ``CAMRA Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Congress has recognized the important role of \n     electronic media in children's lives when it passed the \n     Children's Television Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-437) and \n     the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-104), both \n     of which documented public concerns about how electronic \n     media products influence children's development.\n       (2) Congress has held hearings over the past several \n     decades to examine the impact of specific types of media \n     products such as violent television, movies, and video games \n     on children's and adolescent's health and development. These \n     hearings and other public discussions about the role of media \n     in children's and adolescent's development require behavioral \n     and social science research to inform the policy \n     deliberations.\n       (3) There are important gaps in our knowledge about the \n     role of electronic media and in particular, the newer \n     interactive digital media, in children's and adolescent's \n     healthy development. The consequences of very early screen \n     usage by babies and toddlers on children's cognitive growth \n     are not yet understood, nor has a research base been \n     established on the psychological consequences of high \n     definition interactive media and other format differences for \n     child and adolescent viewers.\n       (4) Studies have shown that children who primarily watch \n     educational shows on television during their preschool years \n     are significantly more successful in school 10 years later \n     even when critical contributors to the child's environment \n     are factored in, including their household income, parent's \n     education, and intelligence.\n       (5) The early stages of childhood are a critical formative \n     period for development. Virtually every aspect of human \n     development is affected by the environments and experiences \n     that one encounters during his or her early childhood years, \n     and media exposure is an increasing part of every child's \n     social and physical environment.\n       (6) As of the late 1990's, just before the National \n     Institute of Child Health and Human Development funded 5 \n     studies on the role of sexual messages in the media on \n     children's and adolescent's sexual attitudes and sexual \n     practices, a review of research in this area found only 15 \n     studies ever conducted in the United States on this topic, \n     even during a time of growing concerns about HIV infection.\n       (7) In 2001, a National Academy of Sciences study group \n     charged with studying Internet pornography exposure on youth \n     found virtually no literature about how much children and \n     adolescents were exposed to Internet pornography or how such \n     content impacts their development.\n       (8) In order to develop strategies that maximize the \n     positive and minimize the negative effects of each medium on \n     children's physical, cognitive, social, and emotional \n     development, it would be beneficial to develop a research \n     program that can track the media habits of young children and \n     their families over time using valid and reliable research \n     methods.\n       (9) Research about the impact of the media on children and \n     adolescents is not presently supported through one primary \n     programmatic effort. The responsibility for directing the \n     research is distributed across disparate agencies in an \n     uncoordinated fashion, or is overlooked entirely. The lack of \n     any centralized organization for research minimizes the value \n     of the knowledge produced by individual studies. A more \n     productive approach for generating valuable findings about \n     the impact of the media on children and adolescents would be \n     to establish a single, well-coordinated research effort with \n     primary responsibility for directing the research agenda.\n       (10) Due to the paucity of research about electronic media, \n     educators and others interested in implementing electronic \n     media literacy initiatives do not have the evidence needed to \n     design, implement, or assess the value of these efforts.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to enable the \n     National Institute of Child Health and Human Development to--\n       (1) examine the role and impact of electronic media in \n     children's and adolescent's cognitive, social, emotional, \n     physical, and behavioral development; and\n       (2) provide for a report to Congress containing the \n     empirical evidence and other results produced by the research \n     funded through grants under this Act.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \ncertain modifications to be made to qualified mortgages held by a REMIC \nor a grantor trust; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Real Estate \nMortgage Investment Conduit Modernization Act. I am pleased to join my \ncolleague and friend, Senator Kent Conrad, in introducing this \nlegislation to accelerate economic growth for America.\n  A Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduit (REMIC) is a tax vehicle \ncreated by Congress in 1986 to support the housing market and \ninvestment in real estate by making it simpler to issue real estate \nbacked securities.\n  By pooling real estate loans into mortgage backed securities, REMICs \noffer residential and commercial real estate borrowers access to \ncapital that would not otherwise be available. REMICs enable commercial \nbanks and other lenders to sell their loans in the capital markets, \nthereby freeing up assets for additional lending and investments. \nBecause they contribute to the efficiency and liquidity of the U.S. \nreal estate markets, REMICs help to minimize the costs of residential \nand commercial real estate borrowing and to spur real estate \ndevelopment and rehabilitation.\n  REMICs play a critical role in providing capital for residential and \ncommercial mortgages. As of September 30, 2004, the value of single-\nfamily, multi-family and commercial-mortgage backed REMICs outstanding \nwas $2.2 trillion. While the current volume of REMIC transactions \nreflects their important role in this market, certain changes to the \ntax code will eliminate impediments and unleash even greater potential. \nCurrent rules that govern REMICs often prevent many common loan \nmodifications that facilitate loan administration and ensure repayment \nof investors.\n  Unfortunately, the legislation that created REMICs has not changed in \nnearly 20 years. Our legislation will update the REMIC provisions of \nthe tax code. These proposed changes are simple, non-controversial, and \nwill greatly enhance the ability of commercial real estate interests to \nobtain capital for financing new construction projects.\n  These changes would ultimately benefit the entire real estate \ncommunity, including local real estate owners, builders, construction \nmanagers as well as engineering, architectural and interior design \nfirms that provide real estate services. Firms that offer services to \nsupport real estate sales will also be assisted. The end result is that \nthese changes would accelerate the creation of jobs and economic \nactivity throughout the U.S., and would have a positive effect on \nfederal and state tax revenues. By encouraging property renovations and \nexpansions, these changes would strengthen the local property tax base \nin towns and cities across America.\n  We urge our colleagues to work with us to enact this legislation to \nspur economic and employment growth in real estate, the construction \ntrades, and the building materials industry.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 580\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor the proper tax treatment of certain disaster mitigation payments; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, tax day is right around the corner; just \nover a month away. For most Americans, April 15 is rather routine. You \nspend several days or weeks determining the amount you owe and you pay \nit. But for Christina and Raymond F., two of my constituents--I will \nnot use their last name to maintain their privacy--of Avondale, LA, \nthis upcoming tax day is going to be anything but routine. Earlier this \nyear, Christina and Raymond received a letter from their parish \ngovernment informing them that they must add $45,000 to their gross \nincome this year.\n  You see, Christina and Raymond's home is located in a flood zone. \nThat is not unusual in Louisiana. Twenty percent of the coastal zone of \nmy state lies below sea level, including 80 percent of our largest city \nNew Orleans. In order to protect their home from rising waters, they \napplied to their local parish to get flood mitigation assistance to \nraise their home above the base flood elevation in their area. To \nqualify, they had to raise $20,000, which they did by refinancing their \nhome, and the parish paid the remaining $45,000 through FEMA's National \nFlood Insurance Program. What Christina and Raymond did not realize was \nthat at the very same time that they were having this work done on \ntheir home, the Internal Revenue Service had decided that FEMA disaster \nmitigation assistance should be taxable. So now, this couple is going \nto have to pay taxes on $45,000 even though they never saw a dime of \nthis money.\n  This news hit this family like a Category 4 hurricane. When Christina \ncalled my office she thought she said she would have to sell her house \nin order pay the IRS. This is a family with modest means, living in a \nneighborhood that they describe as working class. Her husband's medical \ncosts are astronomical--$1,400 per month for his medication alone. The \nhouse is worth about $100,000 and the mitigation work did not add a \nsignificant amount to its value according to an appraisal they \nreceived. You can imagine that under these circumstances, the taxes on \nan additional $45,000 would wipe them out.\n  In a place like Louisiana where hurricanes and floods are as much a \npart of life as crawfish boils and Mardi Gras, the key to our peace of \nmind is the National Flood Insurance Program administered by FEMA. In \nLouisiana, 377,000 property owners participate in the National Flood \nInsurance Program. It is a real Godsend to the people of my state.\n  In addition, the National Flood Insurance Program provides funding \nfor property owners to flood-proof their homes through the flood \nmitigation grant program. FEMA distributes these grant funds to the \nstates which then pass them along to local communities. The local \ncommunities select properties for mitigation and contract for the \nmitigation services. Communities use these funds to put homes on \nstilts, improve drainage on property, and to acquire flood proofing \nmaterials. These mitigation grants encourage property owners to take \nresponsible steps to lessen the potential for loss of life and property \ndamage due to future flooding. The grants also have the added benefit \nof saving money in the long term for the Flood Insurance program.\n  But the IRS has turned this valuable disaster preparedness and \nprevention program into a financial disaster for responsible property \nowners by making these payments taxable. The first time Christina and \nRaymond learned that this funding was taxable was when their local \ncommunity sent them a letter at the beginning of this year.\n  All the people in my state ask for is a warning and an opportunity to \nprotect themselves, their homes, and their loved ones from these \ndisasters. Through the state-of-the-art systems developed by the \nNational Weather Service, we can get a warning about a hurricane. We \nhave sophisticated radar to track these storms as they move through the \nGulf of Mexico, or up the East Coast. When a Category 4 is coming we \ncan prepare and pray. The IRS is making us prepare and pay.\n  This tax is unfair, unexpected, and an unfortunate policy decision. \nUnfair and unexpected because no one told Christina and Raymond that \nthey would be taxed for accepting FEMA disaster mitigation assistance. \nThe local officials in their parish were just as surprised as the \nproperty owners were. It is unfortunate policy because in the long \nterm, the IRS will undercut the effectiveness of using mitigation as a \nmeans of decreasing future costs to the flood insurance program. It \nwill force people to take risks that they will not be hit by a \ndisaster.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation to protect these responsible \nproperty owners from this unfair tax. My bill excludes disaster \nmitigation assistance from gross income. I have made it retroactive to \nlast year in order to protect those property owners who received \nassistance in 2004.\n  I understand that a companion measure has been introduced in the \nHouse of Representatives by Congressman Mark Foley of Florida. It is \nsupported by a number of House members from states with high incidents \nof flooding and other natural disasters, many from Louisiana. I applaud \ntheir efforts.\n  But this is not a regional, special-interest bill. FEMA makes \nmitigation grants for a variety of hazards in addition to flooding: \nfire, tornadoes, earthquakes, thunderstorms, dam failures, and a host \nof others. This is not a problem just for properties that flood. So if \nyour citizens have used a federal disaster mitigation program to help \nmake their properties safer, the tax man will come for them too.\n  It is essential that the Congress consider this legislation and pass \nit as soon as possible. As I said at the start of my remarks, tax day \nis coming. We need to act to protect responsible property owners from \npaying this unfair tax.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SALAZAR:\n  S. 584. A bill to require the Secretary of the Interior to allow the \ncontinued occupancy and use of certain land and improvements within \nRocky Mountain National Park; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SALAZAR:\n  S. 585. A bill to better provide for compensation for certain persons \ninjured in the course of employment at the Rocky Flats site in \nColorado; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two pieces of \nlegislation important to my great State of Colorado.\n  Last week, I introduced one bill and proudly cosponsored two others \nto make good on our Nation's promise to honor and care for our \nveterans. Today, I am introducing a bill to discharge our debt to \nanother group of patriotic Americans who served our Nation during the \ncold war--our nuclear weapons workers.\n  Many Americans contributed to our victory over communism in the cold \nwar, including dedicated and brave men and women working in the \nlaboratories and factories that fashioned the nuclear weapons that \nhelped bring the former Soviet Union to its knees. As a result of this \npatriotic service, many of these nuclear weapons workers contracted \ncancer and other disabling and fatal diseases.\n  In 2000, Congress recognized the sacrifices made by our nuclear \nweapons\n\n[[Page S2399]]\n\nworkers by enacting the Energy Employees Occupational Injury \nCompensation Act to provide benefits to nuclear weapons workers for \ntheir work-related illnesses, or to their survivors when these \nillnesses took their lives\n  But today, a combination of missing records and bureaucratic red tape \nprevents many nuclear weapons workers from receiving the benefits that \nCongress intended, including many workers who served at the Rocky Flats \nfacility in Colorado\n  Through five decades, men and women worked at Rocky Flats, producing \nplutonium, one of the most dangerous substances in creation, and \ncrafting it into the triggers for America's nuclear arsenal. These men \nand women served a critical role in a program deemed essential to our \nnational security by a succession of Presidents and Congresses. We owe \nthem an enormous debt of gratitude.\n  These men and women were exposed to radioactive elements and other \ntoxic compounds that we are still trying to identify, in amounts that \nwe can only guess at. We don't know what they were exposed to, how much \nor when. Part of the problem is that the existing science and \ntechnology did not allow us to monitor accurately. Part of the problem \nis that critical records have been lost or, in many cases, were never \ncreated by the government and its contractors.\n  Thankfully, Congress had the foresight in the Energy Employees Act to \nrealize that some workers might not be able to prove that their cancers \nwere caused by their work in nuclear weapons facilities, whether due to \nthe lack of records or other problems that make it difficult or \nimpossible to determine the dose of radiation they received.\n  To protect these workers, Congress designated a Special Exposure \nCohort to receive benefits if they suffered from one of the specified \ncancers known to be linked to radiation exposure\n  The bill I am introducing today would extend Special Exposure Cohort \nstatus to workers employed by the Department of Energy or its \ncontractors at Rocky Flats according to the stringent requirements of \nthe 2000 Act\n  As a result of this designation, a Rocky Flats worker suffering from \none of the 22 listed cancers can receive benefits despite the \ninadequate records maintained by the Department of Energy and its \ncontractors\n  My bill is a companion bill to the bipartisan House bill introduced \nby my friends, Congressman Mark Udall and Congressman Bob Beauprez from \nColorado. I look forward to bipartisan support in the Senate.\n  I am also proud to introduce a separate bill, this one to re-inject a \nsmall dose of humanity into our Federal bureaucracy.\n  Betty Dick is an 83-year-old woman who has spent much of the past 25 \nyears on property within the boundaries of Rocky Mountain National \nPark. Over the course of those 25 years, Betty Dick has become a \ncherished part of the Grand Lake community. She has been a good citizen \nand has been happy to share her family's beautiful cabin for civic \nevents, and she has been a good neighbor to the National Park.\n  But now, the National Park Service believes that it is compelled to \nevict Betty Dick. My bill, and a bipartisan companion bill introduced \nby Congressman Mark Udall and supported by Congressman Tom Tancredo, \nwill authorize and instruct the Park Service to allow Mrs. Dick to \nspend her last few summers at her cherished Grand Lake home.\n  Mrs. Dick has been living on this property subject to a 25 year lease \nwith the Park Service. Fred Dick, Betty's husband, died in 1992. Mrs. \nDick knows she doesn't have too many summers left, but she would like \nto spend them in her home.\n  The Park Service is apparently concerned that it does not have the \nauthority to extend or renew this lease or it is worried that to do so \nwould set a bad precedent. On this, I respectfully disagree with my \nfriends at the Park Service. I think evicting an 83-year-old woman from \nher family cabin would set a bad precedent.\n  My bill would simply require the Secretary of the Interior, as boss \nof the National Park Service, to enter into an agreement that will \nallow Betty Dick to continue to occupy her family cabin and property \nwithin Rocky Mountain National Park for the rest of her life. Mrs. Dick \nwill continue to pay the rent that has been due under the prior lease. \nMrs. Dick's children and grandchildren will have no right to occupy the \nproperty after her death, and the cabin and property will then be \nmanaged by the Park Service.\n  I hope we haven't reached the point where we can't find a way to play \na role in helping Betty Dick spend her last summers on the land that \nshe loves.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of these two bills be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 584\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Betty Dick Residence \n     Protection Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) before their divorce, Fred and Marilyn Dick, owned as \n     tenants in common a tract of land that included the property \n     described in section 5(b);\n       (2) when Fred and Marilyn Dick divorced, Marilyn Dick \n     became the sole owner of the tract of land, but Fred Dick \n     retained the right of first refusal to acquire the tract of \n     land;\n       (3) in 1977, Marilyn Dick sold the tract to the United \n     States for addition to Rocky Mountain National Park, but Fred \n     Dick, asserting his right of first refusal, sued to cancel \n     the transaction;\n       (4) in 1980, the lawsuit was settled through an agreement \n     between the National Park Service, Fred Dick, and the heirs, \n     successors, and assigns of Fred Dick;\n       (5) under the 1980 settlement agreement, Fred Dick and his \n     wife, Betty Dick, were allowed to lease and occupy the 23 \n     acres comprising the property described in section 5(b) for \n     25 years;\n       (6) Fred Dick died in 1992, but Betty Dick has continued to \n     lease and occupy the property described in section 5(b) under \n     the terms of the settlement agreement;\n       (7) Betty Dick's right to lease and occupy the property \n     described in section 5(b) will expire on July 16, 2005, at \n     which time Betty Dick will be 83 years old;\n       (8) Betty Dick wishes to continue to occupy the property \n     for the remainder of her life and has sought to enter into a \n     new agreement with the National Park Service that would allow \n     her to continue to occupy the property;\n       (9) the National Park Service has not been willing to enter \n     into a new agreement with Betty Dick and is demanding that \n     she vacate the property by July 16, 2005;\n       (10) since 1980, Betty Dick--\n       (A) has consistently occupied the property described in \n     section 5(b) as a summer residence;\n       (B) has made the property available for community events; \n     and\n       (C) has been a good steward of the property;\n       (11) Betty Dick's occupancy of the property has not--\n       (A) been detrimental to the resources and values of Rocky \n     Mountain National Park; or\n       (B) created problems for the National Park Service or the \n     public; and\n       (12) under the circumstances, it is appropriate for Betty \n     Dick to be allowed to continue her occupancy of the property \n     described in section 5(b) for the remainder of her natural \n     life under the terms and conditions applicable to her \n     occupancy of the property since 1980.\n\n     SEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Rocky Flats Special Exposure \n     Cohort Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation \n     Program Act of 2000 (42 U.S.C. 7384 et seq.) (hereinafter in \n     this section referred to as the ``Act'') was enacted to \n     ensure fairness and equity for the civilian men and women \n     who, during the past 50 years, performed duties uniquely \n     related to the nuclear weapons production and testing \n     programs of the Department of Energy and its predecessor \n     agencies by establishing a program that would provide \n     efficient, uniform, and adequate compensation for beryllium-\n     related health conditions and radiation-related health \n     conditions.\n       (2) The Act provides a process for consideration of claims \n     for compensation by individuals who were employed at relevant \n     times at various locations, but also included provisions \n     designating employees at certain other locations as members \n     of a special exposure cohort whose claims are subject to a \n     less-detailed administrative process.\n       (3) The Act also authorizes the President, upon \n     recommendation of the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker \n     Health, to designate additional classes of employees at \n     Department of Energy facilities as members of the special \n     exposure cohort if the President determines that--\n       (A) it is not feasible to estimate with sufficient accuracy \n     the radiation dose that the class received; and\n       (B) there is a reasonable likelihood that the radiation \n     dose may have endangered the health of members of the class.\n       (4) It has become evident that it is not feasible to \n     estimate with sufficient accuracy the radiation dose received \n     by employees at the Department of Energy facility in Colorado \n     known as the Rocky Flats site for the following reasons:\n       (A) Many worker exposures were unmonitored over the \n     lifetime of the plant at the Rocky Flats site. Even in 2004, \n     a former worker from the 1950s was monitored under the former \n     radiation worker program of the Department of Energy and \n     found to have a significant internal deposition that had been \n     undetected and unrecorded for more than 50 years.\n       (B) No lung counter for detecting and measuring plutonium \n     and americium in the lungs existed at Rocky Flats until the \n     late 1960s. Without this equipment, the very insoluble oxide \n     forms of plutonium cannot be detected, and a large number of \n     workers had inhalation exposures that went undetected and \n     unmeasured.\n       (C) Exposure to neutron radiation was not monitored until \n     the late 1950s, and most of those measurements through 1970 \n     have been found to be in error. In some areas of the plant \n     the neutron doses were as much as 2 to 10 times as great as \n     the gamma doses received by workers, but only gamma doses \n     were recorded. The old neutron films are being re-read, but \n     those doses have not yet been added to the workers' records \n     or been used in the dose reconstructions for Rocky Flats \n     workers carried out by the National Institute for \n     Occupational Safety and Health.\n       (D) Radiation exposures for many workers were not measured \n     or were missing and, as a result, the records are incomplete \n     or estimated doses were assigned. There are many inaccuracies \n     in the exposure records that the Institute is using to \n     determine whether Rocky Flats workers qualify for \n     compensation under the Act.\n       (E) The model that has been used for dose reconstruction by \n     the Institute in determining whether Rocky Flats workers \n     qualify for compensation under the Act may be in error. The \n     default values used for particle size and solubility of the \n     internally deposited plutonium in workers are subject to \n     reasonable scientific debate. Use of erroneous values could \n     substantially underestimate the actual internal doses for \n     claimants.\n       (5) Some Rocky Flats workers, despite having worked with \n     tons of plutonium and having known exposures leading to \n     serious health effects, have been denied compensation under \n     the Act as a result of potentially flawed calculations based \n     on records that are incomplete or in error as well as the use \n     of potentially flawed models.\n       (6) Achieving the purposes of the Act with respect to \n     workers at Rocky Flats is more likely to be achieved if \n     claims by those workers are subject to the administrative \n     procedures applicable to members of the special exposure \n     cohort.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to revise the \n     Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program \n     Act so as to include certain past and present Rocky Flats \n     workers as members of the special exposure cohort.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nlegendary playwright Arthur Miller, who passed away on February 10, \n2005 at the age of 89.\n  Anyone who has experienced ``Death of a Salesman,'' ``A View from the \nBridge,'' ``The Crucible,'' or any of his innumerable masterpieces \nwould certainly agree that Arthur Miller established himself as one of \nthe preeminent American playwrights of our time. A literary genius may \nhave left us, but his work will live forever, from Broadway to the \nlocal high school or college theater.\n  Today my colleague from Massachusetts and I submit a resolution \nrecognizing the genius of this literary giant, a man who not only \ncaptivated our souls with his art but also motivated us to protect the \nfreedom to speak and write with conviction and courage.\n  I do not want to take up the Senate's time with a long biographical \nor literary commentary on the life and works of Arthur Miller because I \nknow I would inevitably fail to do justice to him. Instead, I would \nlike to share a personal experience that demonstrated the amazing and \nunique qualities of this wonderful man.\n  As some in the Senate will remember, one of Arthur Miller's last \npublic speaking appearances was at a hearing before the Judiciary \nCommittee last year, at which he advocated passage of the Hatch-Kennedy \nPlaywrights Licensing Antitrust Initiative Act.\n  The day of the hearing, I had the opportunity to meet privately with \nMr. Miller in my Senate office. Though well into his eighties, he spoke \nwith passion and eloquence about the critical importance of live \ntheater and writers to social, intellectual, and political discourse in \nour country. He also demonstrated his delightful--and occasionally \ndevilish--wit and prodigious intelligence, both of which he had \nretained in extraordinary abundance.\n  Although we came from very different backgrounds, and radically \ndifferent political perspectives, it was an honor and a sincere \npleasure to come to know--however briefly--a man of his stature, \naccomplishments, and surpassing intellect.\n  Our lives were enriched by Arthur Miller, and we--as individuals, as \na people, and as a Nation--are diminished by the passing of so \nmagnificent an American talent. He will be sorely missed, and will be \nremembered with reverence and affection by those--like me--whose lives \nhe touched.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me and Senator Kennedy--who is \nthe leading cosponsor of this resolution--in recognizing and honoring \nthe life and accomplishments of Arthur Miller by supporting swift \npassage of this resolution.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the remarks of Arthur Miller before the \nSenate Judiciary Committee on April 28, 2004, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Mr. Chairman. Members of the Committee. It is indeed an \n     honor to appear before you today in support of S. 2349, The \n     Playwrights Licensing Antitrust Initiative Act of 2004.\n       In preparing for this testimony today, I am reminded of \n     Muriel Humphrey's admonishment to her husband: ``Hubert, a \n     speech does not need to be eternal to be immortal.'' I will \n     take that advice to heart as I testify today.\n       It has been some time since I was last asked to testify \n     before Congress. But, I have to tell you, today I am actually \n     happy to appear on behalf of what I believe is truly an \n     important topic worthy of Congressional debate and action--\n     the future of the American theater.\n       I have been blessed to be lucky enough to be a successful \n     playwright. Many of my plays, I am proud to say, have won \n     critical acclaim--Death of a Salesman and The Crucible won a \n     Pulitzer and a Tony award respectively.\n       I raise these plays, and my success, not to brag, but to \n     emphasize an important point: I and my colleagues before you \n     today are here not for ourselves, but for others. We are \n     speaking on behalf of the up and coming playwrights: The \n     Arthur Millers, the Stephen Sondheims and the Wendy \n     Wassersteins\n\n[[Page S2402]]\n\n     as young playwrights. Indeed, the American theater risks \n     losing the next generation of playwrights to other media and \n     opportunities as the pressures on playwrights increase and \n     their power to protect their economic and artistic interests \n     diminish. The legislation we are advocating isn't for us, \n     it's for them. And it's for the theater-going public.\n       The legislation introduced by you, Chairman Hatch and \n     Senator Kennedy, is meant to keep the legacy of aspiring \n     playwrights who write for the theater alive. It will help \n     ensure that American playwrights, through the theater, can \n     speak to the hearts and minds of the audience. That we can \n     challenge social morays, ideology, beliefs, or simply \n     entertain. Drama is one of civilization's greatest art forms \n     and we must do all that we can to promote its vitality.\n       The American theater has undergone enormous changes over \n     the years. From its entrepreneurial start it has become \n     increasingly dominated by corporate interests. Sure, business \n     is changing in virtually every sector of our economy and \n     there is no reason that the theater should be immune from \n     business pressures.\n       But, unfortunately, in the midst of these increasing \n     pressures, only one entity does not have a seat at the \n     bargaining table: the playwrights. The status of the \n     playwright is difficult to discern as it has fallen under the \n     long shadow of questionable and conflicting legal opinions. \n     The result is that all other entities have the collective \n     power and ability to fight for their rights. As a result, it \n     is the playwright who gets squeezed.\n       The Playwrights Licensing Antitrust Initiative Act of 2004 \n     would provide a very limited legislative fix that would allow \n     for the standard form contract that was last negotiated in \n     1982 to be updated to take account of today's market \n     realities and intellectual property protection climate. It \n     does not force producers to hire any playwrights, but it does \n     allow playwrights with a willing producer to protect their \n     economic and artistic interests.\n       Today many new playwrights are presented with take-it-or-\n     leave-it contracts. In their hunger to get their plays \n     produced, many have no choice. Others, facing the economic \n     pressures that face all-too-many people in today's economy, \n     are abandoning their dreams of writing for the theater as \n     they go to Hollywood or write for other media.\n       Some may say that this is just basic economics. But, the \n     legislation the Chairman and Senator Kennedy have introduced \n     is not intended to change the laws of economics. It simply \n     says that playwrights should have a seat at the table. \n     Failure to pass the legislation will continue the unfair \n     bargaining situation that the playwrights find themselves in \n     and not only will the playwright and the theater suffer, but \n     society as a whole.\n       It was Senator Kennedy's brother, President Kennedy, who \n     once said: ``I look forward to an America which will reward \n     achievement in the arts as we reward achievement in business \n     or statecraft. ``\n       Unfortunately, under today's legal shadows, the up and \n     coming playwrights must offer their wares at a discount.\n       I understand that antitrust exemptions are not easy to come \n     by. And I believe that amending our laws should not be done \n     at the drop of a hat.\n       But, where there the national interest demands that change \n     occur, I believe it is appropriate.\n       Mr. Chairman. Members of the Committee. I urge your prompt \n     approval of this legislation.\n\n  Statement of Senator Kennedy in Support of the Resolution Honoring \n                             Arthur Miller\n\n       Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is my privilege to join my \n     colleague from Utah in sponsoring this resolution to honor \n     one of America's foremost playwrights. Arthur Miller spoke to \n     all of us about the quiet struggles in each life and the \n     dignity in those struggles.\n       Arthur Miller was a soft-spoken man whose voice was heard \n     around the world. It was a voice of courage, insight, candor, \n     and integrity, and the quality of the arts in America was \n     greatly enriched by his extraordinary plays, as anyone who \n     has had the opportunity to attend a performance of Death of a \n     Salesman well knows. The hero of that play, Willy Loman, \n     became an American icon--the struggling family man in \n     lifelong pursuit of the American dream.\n       At one point in the first act of the play, a character says \n     of Willy Loman,\n       I don't say he's a great man. Willy Loman never made a lot \n     of money. His name was never in the paper. He's not the \n     finest character that ever lived. But he's a human being, and \n     a terrible thing is happening to him. So attention must be \n     paid. He's not to be allowed to fall into his grave like an \n     old dog. Attention, attention must be finally paid to such a \n     person.\n       That sums up much of what we do in public life. We try to \n     help those who need our help the most. We insist that \n     attention must be finally paid to such persons in our \n     society, and we try to make it happen, and Arthur Miller \n     helps us to understand why.\n       In his long and brilliant career, he earned wide public and \n     critical acclaim for his work. He was honored with the \n     Pulitzer Prize, the Drama Critics' Circle Award, and the Tony \n     Award. He also received the Kennedy Center Honors Award for \n     lifetime achievement as a playwright. The National Endowment \n     for the Humanities selected him to present the prestigious \n     Jefferson Lecture, an honor given to writers and historians \n     of extraordinary achievement.\n       Arthur Miller was a gifted writer, and he was also a \n     passionate advocate of providing greater encouragement for \n     emerging writers in our society. Last year, he testified \n     before the Judiciary Committee in support of the Playwright \n     Licensing Antitrust Initiative, which would provide important \n     new protections for the artists who actually create the plays \n     and musicals that are such an extraordinary part of the \n     nation's modem life.\n       It was the third time that Arthur Miller had testified \n     before Congress. He had previously appeared before the \n     infamous House Unamerican Activities Committee, and before \n     the Senate on behalf of literary and journalistic freedoms \n     around the world.\n       Senator Hatch and I were both impressed by the articulate \n     passion of this unique American artist. I look forward to \n     working with Senator Hatch and many other colleagues in \n     Congress to realize the goals that Arthur Miller so \n     eloquently described in his testimony, and encourage more \n     creative artists in our country to write their stories and \n     have them presented on the stages of America.\n       American theater is admired and respected throughout the \n     world and we should honor those whose genius and hard work \n     have contributed to that success.\n       This resolution honoring the life of Arthur Miller is an \n     opportunity for all of us to express our appreciation for the \n     extraordinary and eloquent gift he brought the Nation. His \n     great works have enriched the lives of all Americans, and of \n     theater-lovers around the world.

Res. 16\n\n       Whereas the Mexican cities of Ciudad Juarez and Chihuahua \n     have been plagued with the abduction, sexual assault, and \n     brutal murders of more than 370 young women since 1993;\n       Whereas there have been at least 30 murders of women in \n     Ciudad Juarez and the city of Chihuahua since 2004;\n       Whereas at least 137 of the victims were sexually assaulted \n     prior to their murders;\n       Whereas more than half of the victims are women and girls \n     between the ages of 13 and 22, and many were abducted in \n     broad daylight in well-populated areas;\n       Whereas these murders have brought pain to the families and \n     friends of the victims on both sides of the border as they \n     struggle to cope with the loss of their loved ones;\n       Whereas many of the victims have yet to be positively \n     identified;\n       Whereas the perpetrators of most of these heinous acts \n     remain unknown;\n       Whereas the Mexican Federal Government has taken steps to \n     prevent these abductions and murders in Ciudad Juarez, \n     including setting up a commission to coordinate Federal and \n     State efforts, establishing a 40-point plan, appointing a \n     special commissioner, and appointing a special prosecutor;\n       Whereas the Federal special prosecutor, in her ongoing \n     review of the Ciudad Juarez murder investigations, found \n     evidence that over 100 police, prosecutors, forensics \n     experts, and other State of Chihuahua justice officials \n     failed to properly investigate the crimes, and recommended \n     that they be held accountable for their acts of negligence, \n     abuse of authority, and omission;\n       Whereas in 2003 the El Paso Field Office of the Federal \n     Bureau of Investigation and the El Paso Police Department \n     began providing Mexican Federal, State, and municipal law \n     enforcement authorities with training in investigation \n     techniques and methods;\n       Whereas the United States Agency for International \n     Development has begun providing assistance to the State of \n     Chihuahua for judicial reform;\n       Whereas the government of the State of Chihuahua has \n     jurisdiction over these crimes;\n       Whereas the Governor and Attorney General of the State of \n     Chihuahua have expressed willingness to collaborate with the \n     Mexican Federal Government and United States officials in \n     addressing these crimes;\n       Whereas the Department of State has provided consular \n     services on behalf of the American citizen and her husband \n     who were tortured into confessing to one of the murders;\n       Whereas Mexico is a party to the following international \n     treaties and declarations that relate to abductions and \n     murders: the Charter of the Organization of American States, \n     the American Convention on Human Rights,\n\n[[Page S2403]]\n\n     the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International \n     Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International \n     Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the \n     Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination \n     Against Women, the United Nations Declaration on Violence \n     Against Women, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the \n     Convention of Belem do Para, the Inter-American Convention to \n     Prevent and Punish Torture, the Inter-American Convention on \n     Forced Disappearance, and the United Nations Declaration on \n     the Protection of All Persons From Enforced Disappearance; \n     and\n       Whereas continuing impunity for these crimes is a threat to \n     the rule of law in Mexico: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) condemns the ongoing abductions and murders of young \n     women in Ciudad Juarez and the city of Chihuahua in the State \n     of Chihuahua, Mexico, since 1993;\n       (2) expresses its sincerest condolences and deepest \n     sympathy to the families of the victims of these murders;\n       (3) recognizes the courageous struggle of the victims' \n     families in seeking justice for the victims;\n       (4) urges the President and Secretary of State to \n     incorporate the investigative and preventative efforts of the \n     Mexican Government in the bilateral agenda between the \n     Governments of Mexico and the United States and to continue \n     to express concern over these abductions and murders to the \n     Government of Mexico;\n       (5) urges the President and Secretary of State to continue \n     to express support for the efforts of the victims' families \n     to seek justice for the victims, to express concern relating \n     to the continued harassment of these families and the human \n     rights defenders with whom they work, and to express concern \n     with respect to impediments in the ability of the families to \n     receive prompt and accurate information in their cases;\n       (6) supports efforts to identify unknown victims through \n     forensic analysis, including DNA testing, conducted by \n     independent, impartial experts who are sensitive to the \n     special needs and concerns of the victims' families, as well \n     as efforts to make these services available to any families \n     who have doubts about the results of prior forensic testing;\n       (7) condemns the use of torture as a means of investigation \n     into these crimes;\n       (8) encourages the Secretary of State to continue to \n     include in the annual Country Report on Human Rights of the \n     Department of State all instances of improper investigatory \n     methods, threats against human rights activists, and the use \n     of torture with respect to cases involving the murder and \n     abduction of young women in the State of Chihuahua;\n       (9) encourages the Secretary of State to urge the \n     Government of Mexico and the State of Chihuahua to review the \n     cases of murdered women in which those accused or convicted \n     of murder have credibly alleged they were tortured or forced \n     by a state agent to confess to the crime;\n       (10) strongly recommends that the United States Ambassador \n     to Mexico visit Ciudad Juarez and the city of Chihuahua for \n     the purpose of meeting with the families of the victims, \n     women's rights organizations, and Mexican Federal and State \n     officials responsible for investigating these crimes and \n     preventing future such crimes;\n       (11) encourages the Secretary of State to urge the \n     Government of Mexico to ensure fair and proper judicial \n     proceedings for the individuals who are accused of these \n     abductions and murders and to impose appropriate punishment \n     for those individuals subsequently determined to be guilty of \n     such crimes;\n       (12) encourages the Secretary of State to urge the State of \n     Chihuahua to hold accountable those law enforcement officials \n     whose failure to adequately investigate the murders, whether \n     through negligence, omission, or abuse, has led to impunity \n     for these crimes;\n       (13) recognizes the special prosecutor has begun to review \n     cases and encourages the expansion of her mission to include \n     the city of Chihuahua;\n       (14) strongly supports the work of the special commissioner \n     to prevent violence against women in Ciudad Juarez and \n     Chihuahua City;\n       (15) condemns all senseless acts of violence in all parts \n     of the world and, in particular, violence against women; and\n       (16) expresses the solidarity of the people of the United \n     States with the people of Mexico in the face of these tragic \n     and senseless acts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/09/senate-section/article/S2403-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 138.
