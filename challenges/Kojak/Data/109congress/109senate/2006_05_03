Mr. President, last week I spoke on the floor \nconcerning the rising cost of gasoline and diesel fuel--in fact, all \nfuels. We have all been talking about the price of energy in this \ncountry for the past several weeks. Over the weekend, I was at a soccer \ngame, and that was the conversation. Everyone had their horror stories \nabout what they were paying to fill up their vehicles and discussion \nabout how bad is it going to get.\n  My comments this morning are directed in a vein that unless this \nNation gets serious about its energy and how we move forward with a \ntruly balanced approach, it is going to get worse before it gets \nbetter.\n  There have been a lot of proposals and a lot of discussion. There is \na sense that perhaps there is some easy fix out there that we in the \nCongress have overlooked. It is clear to those of us who have really \nbeen following this issue that there is no easy fix. We didn't get here \nin a week. We are not going to get out of this in a week. We are not \ngoing to get out of this through quick congressional action. We have to \ndo more when it comes to furthering our conservation of our current \nsupply. We have to speed the development of our alternative and \nrenewable fuels. We have to produce more energy at home rather than \nbuying from unstable and unreliable sources abroad.\n  Yesterday, the European nations voiced support for a U.N. Security \nCouncil resolution that could produce sanctions against Iran to slow \ntheir nuclear program. We may have a ways to go to convince Russia and \nChina that sanctions are appropriate, but the hint that sanctions could \nendanger the roughly 2 million barrels of oil a day that Iran exports, \nit is this type of unrest that can spook or scare off the international \noil markets, thus driving the price of oil higher.\n\n  Yesterday, following in the footsteps of Venezuelan Hugo Chavez, \nBolivia nationalized its natural gas industry. Almost certainly this is \nnot going to result in lower prices for natural gas in the future.\n  I made some comments this weekend that Congress can pass and repeal \nlaws, but we don't have the ability to repeal the law of supply and \ndemand. With demand for oil edging dangerously close\n\n[[Page S3934]]\n\nto the maximum production levels, with the developing nations \nincreasing their demand for energy supplies, with the unrest we see in \nNigeria, the standoff over Iran's nuclear programs, we simply have to \nconserve more and produce more. It is not an either/or situation.\n  I have heard some people suggest that the only way out of this is \nconservation, renewables or alternatives. It has to be everything. It \nhas to be a full, comprehensive approach. It is not an either/or \nsituation.\n  On the conservation side, the Republican leadership last week \nintroduced legislation to give the President the authority to raise the \nCAFE standards for passenger vehicles. I am one of those who is willing \nto do more in this area. People want to know: What can we do now, what \ncan we do today that is going to help offset the high prices? There are \nsome very simple things we can do from the conservation side to \nconserve fuel and save money.\n  Individuals can make sure that their tires are properly inflated, \nthat their cars are tuned, and reduce speed. All of these improve fuel \nefficiency.\n  We all need to do more to conserve all different types of energy, \nincluding our electricity, since much of it is made from oil. Look at \nyour thermostat this summer. Don't crank up that air-conditioning as \nmuch as you might want.\n  In the intermediate run, over the next 5 to 10 years, we have to \nexpand the use of our renewable energy, whether it is wind, geothermal, \nbiomass, ocean, solar, and hydroelectric. We need to get to the next \ngeneration of nuclear powerplants, get these off the drawing boards, \nand fund research on everything from hydrogen cars to improved \ntechnology for clean coal and carbon sequestration to lock up \ngreenhouse gas emissions.\n  But the other component we must focus on is increasing our domestic \nsupplies of oil and natural gas because it truly will take everything, \na truly balanced energy approach, to stop America from being ``over a \nbarrel'' when it comes to high energy prices. And the foremost thing, \nthe No. 1 thing we can do to prevent this country from being in the \nsame situation 5, 7, 10 years out from now is to stop wasting our time \nand to open up a small portion of the Arctic Coastal Plain in our State \nof Alaska to oil and gas development.\n  We have about 10.4 billion barrels or more of oil sitting up in ANWR \nthat can be developed in an environmentally friendly, sane, responsible \nmanner. We do this utilizing the technology that has been developed \nover the past several decades, whether it is the 3-D seismic that helps \nus pinpoint where the deposits are or the directional drilling that \nallows us to go underneath the surface so there is no surface \ndisturbance. We can do this without harm to the wildlife, without \nharming the porcupine caribou herd or without displacing a polar bear \nor moving a muskoxen.\n  The legislation we have discussed opening up ANWR would limit the \nsurface impact to 2,000 acres--2,000 acres out of 19.5 million acres--\nin the ANWR area. This is one-tenth of 1 percent of the area we are \ntalking about for development.\n  Opening ANWR could produce up to 1 million barrels a day of \nadditional oil for 30 years to meet this country's domestic demand and, \nthus, help drive down the prices. When we look at the laws of supply \nand demand, 1 million barrels of oil is nothing to sneeze at. When we \nlook at the equivalent, 1 million barrels a day is the equivalent of \nthe energy we would obtain from a 3.7-million acre wind farm. To put it \nin context, if we took the whole State of Connecticut and the whole \nState of Rhode Island, combine them and put a wind farm on all of that \nlandmass, that is what it would take, generating wind for 1 year--and \nyou have to have a steady wind supply--to equal 1 million barrels a \nday.\n  Mr. President, 1 million barrels a day would be equivalent to one-\nfifth of America's oil production by the year 2025. One million barrels \na day for 30 years will be one of the largest finds in the world in the \npast 40 years and perhaps the largest field in North American history.\n  In this morning's ``Investor's Business Daily,'' a comment is made in \nthe editorial section. I will read it:\n\n       A million barrels a day could make a big dent in today's \n     prices. More importantly, it would help defend the U.S. from \n     oil blackmail by terrorist Arab regimes and leftist enemies \n     like Venezuela's Hugo Chavez and now Bolivia's Evo Morales.\n\n  A million barrels a day makes a difference.\n  The revenue to be gained from ANWR, again, is nothing to sneeze at. \nThe Congressional Research Service this week released a report that \nfound that the Federal Treasury is likely to gain $90 billion from the \ntaxes on oil produced from ANWR when oil is at 60 bucks a barrel. And \nthat number does not take into account any Federal money from the \nproduction of natural gas, which is also likely to be found in the \narea. It does not include any of the bonus bids or the royalties that \nthe Government will get upfront before the oil is even found.\n  Mr. President, you know about this issue more than anybody in the \nSenate. That $90 billion figure is based on the assumption that ANWR \ncontains the medium estimate for oil production of 10.4 billion \nbarrels--1 million barrels a day for 30 years.\n  At today's prices--and the price this morning is a little over $74--\nat today's prices, and assuming the industry's expectation that ANWR \nmay hold 16 billion barrels of recoverable oil, the Federal tax take \nmay hit $173 billion over the life of the field. Now that is not an \ninsignificant chunk of change.\n  I know there are those who will say that ANWR cannot come online in \ntime to help our current price problem, but I suspect that as a \ncountry, when we finally commit to getting serious about our energy \npolicies, we will send a signal to the commodities traders, and that \nwill have an immediate impact on our prices. We took a significant step \nforward along those lines last year when we passed the Energy Policy \nAct. I compliment the chairman of the Energy Committee for his hard \nwork, but we need to do more. Anyone who thinks that 5 or 10 years from \nnow we are not going to see more hurricanes, we are not going to see \nmore supply disruptions, or more production impediments is not being \nrealistic.\n\n  For the past 19 years, this Nation has been waiting for Congress to \nact to increase our fuel supplies. If we don't do it now, motorists \nwill have full justification, as they stand in the summer's heat \nwaiting to pay $3.50 or perhaps $4 a gallon for gasoline, wondering: \nWhat in the world is wrong with us? Where is our common sense?\n  We have to look at the facts--not the emotional appeals--involving \nANWR. We need to look at the improved technology that will protect the \nArctic's environment while we produce the fuel to help lower the \nprices--maybe not today, maybe not tomorrrow, but in the not too \ndistant future. We need to start reducing domestic fuel supplies now.\n  Mr. President, I see that my colleague from Idaho is here, and I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Alaska for her \ndedication and the Chair's dedication to the development of ANWAR. We \ncan all look back at the time when this Congress actually passed it and \nit was vetoed by President Clinton. If that had not happened, today \nANWR would be producing and would be feeding at least a million barrels \na day of oil into the system, and the refineries at Anacortes, WA, \nwould be operating at full capacity. My guess is that gas would not be \n$3 at the pump, and we would be in a much stronger position worldwide \ntoday if we were allowed to produce.\n  It is a supply-and-demand issue. We all know that. We are going to \ncreate greater transparency in those markets so that the American \npeople can rest assured that there is no gouging. We, the same, want to \nunderstand that. But I think that when that is understood, if that is \nwhat we find, then the world begins to really look at why $3, why \n$3.10, why $4? Why is demand outstripping supply, and all of those \ntypes of things? It is so darned important.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/03/senate-section/article/S3934-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3934-S3935]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              FISCAL YEAR 2006 SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, as most of my colleagues know, \ncongressional recesses are not times during which Senators and \nCongressmen do nothing. In\n\n[[Page S3935]]\n\nfact, recess is a critical time for citizen legislators like ourselves. \nRecess is an opportunity for many of us to go home and live for a \nlittle while under the laws that we have passed. We talk with our \nneighbors. We visit local restaurants, grocery stores, and spend a lot \nof time with constituents all across our states. We hear what the \npeople think about our work. I must say that while I was in Idaho over \nthe Easter recess, the feedback I got on spending by this Congress was \nnot good.\n  We have before us another emergency supplemental funding bill. The \nchairman of the Senate Budget Committee has called these emergency \nfunding bills ``shadow budgets.'' I agree with his view. We are simply \nfunding outside of the regular budget process the known costs of our \nwar on terror. That has to end. In the case of hurricane relief, I \nunderstand the need to provide emergency funding as quickly as \npossible, and I know we cannot always budget exactly for an emergency. \nHowever, I am increasingly frustrated with this Congress's refusal to \nmake any adjustments to other spending priorities to account for the \nneed to rebuild the gulf coast. We are now into our fourth emergency \nsupplemental in less than a year for the rebuilding efforts along the \ngulf coast. It is time that we start paying for some of this spending.\n  Before I left for the recess, I voted in favor of the emergency \nsupplemental appropriations bill that was before the Appropriations \nCommittee. I cast a ``yes'' vote with some hesitation, in light of the \nconcerns I have just mentioned. The bill I voted for would have \nprovided $96 billion in emergency spending, mainly for our efforts in \nthe war on terror in Afghanistan and Iraq and the continued \nreconstruction of the badly damaged gulf coast region.\n  The President submitted a request to Congress for $92.2 billion. Yet \nI was voting to add $4 billion to the amount requested by the \nPresident. But I voted yes because I recognize that not all wisdom is \nfound at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. Congress has a \nresponsibility to scrutinize and improve upon the administration's \nrequest. And we certainly have the right and the responsibility to add \nor subtract from that request based on needs that we identify. I \nbelieve the bill I voted for in committee did just that.\n  Chairman Cochran and Senator Byrd held hearings on the \nadministration's request. They identified shortcomings and they changed \nthe bill to address those needs. So I supported $96 billion as the \nlevel of funding needed to address urgent needs across this country \nrelated to our war on terror and our disaster recovery efforts.\n  Unfortunately, a series of amendments adopted by voice vote by the \ncommittee after I left have pushed the cost of the legislation now \nbefore us to over $106 billion. That is $14 billion above what the \nadministration requested and $10 billion above what Chairman Cochran \nand ranking member Byrd recommended to all of us.\n  Every Member of this institution has to draw the line and decide how \nmuch is too much. In my mind, and in the minds of many Idahoans, this \nlevel of funding is simply too high.\n  In fact, last week I joined with 34 of my Senate colleagues in \nsending a letter to President Bush saying we will vote to support his \nveto if the price tag of this bill does not come down. Enough is \nenough, and I am proud to stand with my colleagues and say so.\n  The people of Idaho are honest, hard-working Americans who will \ncontinue to staunchly support our military and compassionately lend a \nhelping hand to our fellow citizens on the gulf coast. That message has \nbeen loud and clear to me over this and other congressional recesses. \nHowever, when Congress tries to take advantage of their patriotism and \ngenerosity, the people of Idaho deserve to know that their Senator will \nstand up and say no. I believe that this bill is irresponsible, and \nthat is why I am standing up and saying no.\n  I want to be clear so that all of my colleagues and my constituents \nunderstand my position and why I am voicing my frustration with this \nbill. My frustration is not about supporting our military. I support \nour military and I am committed to providing them with the tools they \nneed. My frustration is not about supporting recovery efforts in the \ngulf coast. I am committed to helping the people in that region rebuild \nand move on with their lives. My frustration is with the Senate \nspending billions upon billions of dollars in such an irresponsible \nmanner. The people of Idaho have charged me with being a good steward \nof their taxpayer dollars, and they expect me to work hard and make \nsure those dollars are being spent wisely. This bill does not do that. \nWe can meet the needs of our military, the gulf coast, and other \nnational priorities in a fiscally responsible manner. We have to be \nwilling to make tough decisions and tighten our belts. Together, we can \nget spending under control and regain the confidence of the American \ntaxpayers.\n  Mr. President, I also wish to talk a little bit about the budget as \nit relates to where we are on the supplemental, along with this \nimportant issue of energy because, when I was home over the recess, as \nmost of us were, the public was talking about a lot of issues. They \nwere talking about energy, although it hadn't spiked the way it is \nspiking now. But they were also talking about deficits and responsible \nspending on the part of Government and making sure we do it right. And \nit is tremendously important that we do.\n  The supplemental is too big at this moment. The President has sent us \na message, as he should have--and I support that message--that we have \nemergencies, and we ought to address emergencies. But we ought not put \non emergency budgets those kinds of expenditures that could well be \nutilized and brought into the appropriate budget. I have said to our \nchairman--and I respect his work, and I am on the Appropriations \nCommittee--that we have to bring this supplemental down a bit and get \nour deficits under control. We have a war, we have Katrina, we have a \nnational disaster beyond anything we have ever faced.\n  Americans understand belt-tightening. They also understand sharing. \nThis is about belt-tightening; it is about sharing. It is not about \nfunding every idea that comes along, as worthy as it might be, against \nmaking sure that we get Louisiana and we get Mississippi responsibly \nfinanced in a redeveloping, restructuring mode--not excessively--and \nthat we make sure our men and women in Iraq are appropriately funded. \nThose are the critical issues.\n  My time is limited, but I have said to our chairman and I say it \nagain: It is important we understand that the $92 billion to $96 \nbillion range is where we have to get this supplemental, and I am going \nto work hard with the chairman to do it, to do it appropriately, to be \nselective in that which we fund but to be responsible in that which we \nsend to the President in our work with the House to assure that we have \nthe emergencies funded.\n  Supplemental emergency funding ought not be a shadow budget. Here we \nare now in our fourth emergency supplemental within a budget cycle. I \ndon't think our budget system works very well if we can't do better \nthan that and argue that everything is an emergency and, therefore, \nsomehow it doesn't fit under the caps. That is not the way our public \nand our taxpayers who finance this big government of ours want us to \noperate. Somehow we have to get that under control.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/03/senate-section/article/S3935-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3935-S3937]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ENERGY\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, today as I stand here, back in Michigan \nthe gas prices have risen to $3.10 a gallon. At $3.10 a gallon, that is \nthe highest price at the pump that folks are paying than ever before as \nthey get up to go to work, take the kids to school, as our farmers are \npreparing the fields, and as our business people are on the road. Folks \nare feeling the squeeze--one more squeeze.\n  We already have in Michigan a situation where we are seeing job loss \nor wages being reduced, health care costs going up, pensions that may \nnot be there for people; things that are squeezing people on all \nsides--the higher cost of college. Part of that is due to actions taken \nin the Congress and at the White House. To add insult to injury, we are \nseeing now over $3 a gallon for gasoline, and I know in other States we \nhave seen as much as $4 for folks who are just trying to make it, just \ntrying to get to work, just trying to take care of their families.\n  When they look at this picture, they see several things. They see the \nhighest\n\n[[Page S3936]]\n\npossible profits ever recorded in the history of the country by our oil \ncompanies, particularly ExxonMobile, which recorded the highest profits \never. They see incredible salaries. They see the former CEO of \nExxonMobile making about $110,000 a day, when most Michiganians don't \nmake $110,000 a year. And now we were told about a $400 million \nretirement package, and we hear when you count everything, it could be \n$700 million. Unbelievable. People have had enough. People have had \nenough of a set of policies that are squeezing them on all sides.\n  Then, today, we read that the conference committee is dealing with a \nseries of tax cuts and tax proposals and have decided to delay \nrepealing accounting procedures known as ``last and first out'' that \nwere included in the bill that we passed, including loopholes that we \nclosed for oil companies that would equal about $4.3 billion in tax \nbreaks that we said didn't make sense and we need to close them. \nInstead, those tax breaks are going to keep rolling on. I know there \nare going to be hearings in the Finance Committee. But the reality is \nthat when the priorities are set, when the values are reflected about \nwhat will be done, the oil companies' tax breaks continue. High prices \ncontinue. These outrageous CEO salaries continue. The people in \nMichigan have said: Enough is enough.\n  On top of that, we see foreign tax credit loopholes that may be \ncontinued so that we as taxpayers will subsidize the oil companies \ndoing business in other countries. We see royalty relief that Senator \nWyden spoke about last week which comes to the tune of anywhere from \n$20 billion to $80 billion in tax breaks to the oil companies that they \nsaid they didn't even need anymore. Yet this royalty relief and the tax \nbreaks continue. We see the Energy bill that was passed last August and \nhad a lot of positive things in it, that I supported, but in that were \n$2.6 billion in tax subsidies by American taxpayers for the oil \ncompanies, and that continues.\n  In total, we are looking at somewhere between $28 billion and $88 \nbillion in taxpayer dollars being used to subsidize an industry with \nthe highest profits and arguably the highest salaries, or certainly \nsome of the highest salaries in the world. At the same time, folks are \ntrying to make it every day.\n\n  I believe, and my colleagues on the Democratic side of the aisle \nbelieve, that we need to shut down those tax breaks to oil companies \nand put money directly back into the pockets of taxpayers. We also \nbelieve and, in fact, I was proud to lead an effort that resulted in a \nrequired investigation by the Federal Trade Commission. I was proud to \nauthor that in the Energy bill last August and they are finally doing \nit and they will have an investigation done and recommendations by May \n21. They are doing a law enforcement investigation.\n  I call on the President and all of our colleagues to do everything \npossible to support the FTC to get the right conclusion. We know price \ngouging is going on. It is not rocket science. People see what is going \non. We don't need to call for an investigation. We already have one \ngoing on. Let's make sure they have the tools and the resources and the \nsupport to do what is right for the American consumer.\n  Americans are subsidizing one of the wealthiest industries in the \ncountry and in the world, with the highest CEO salaries, at the same \ntime they are trying to figure out how to get 2 or 3 gallons in the \ntank of their car so they can get to work. This is the wrong set of \nvalues. These are the wrong priorities for our country.\n  I say, along with many others, enough is enough. We know we have \nlong-term issues to address, and we have worked together in the Energy \nbill on new support and tax incentives for renewable fuels. We are \nseeing in Michigan the outgrowth of that: five new ethanol plants by \nthe end of the year, biodiesel plants, and we are seeing wonderful \nefforts going on with our American auto companies. I am very proud of \nwhat General Motors is doing with E-85 ethanol and Ford moving ahead \nwith their hybrids and Daimler Chrysler with biodiesel B-20 and all of \nthe efforts that are moving forward to get us off of foreign oil \ndependence. And I am hopeful that all of those policies together will \nresult not only in more jobs in my State, because I believe Michigan \nwill be the leader in this area, but more support for our farmers, \nbetter policies for our environment, and the opportunity to give big \noil the competition they ought to be having, which is by using home-\ngrown fuels.\n  I believe our goal ought to be to make sure the people of this \ncountry have the opportunity to buy their fuel from Middle America \ninstead of the Middle East. I am committed to that, as many of my \ncolleagues are, and I believe we need to get about the business of \ngetting that done. In the process, we ought to close some tax loopholes \nwith the oil companies. We ought to go back on this tax bill and get it \nright and worry more about putting money back in the pockets of the \nfolks who are paying the bill at the gas pump. Folks have said enough \nis enough, and I agree with them.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on the \nDemocratic side in morning business?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 7 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from the State of \nMichigan because she has been a leader when it comes to the issue of \nhelping consumers across America. Many people say it is morning in \nAmerica, but not if you stop at a gas station. It feels like it is the \ndead of night, and it is getting pretty cold and windy outside.\n  What the Senator from Michigan has said is that instead of this \nmeaningless $100 which has been suggested on the other side of the \naisle and which has become something of a joke, she suggested a \nsignificant amount: $500. Clearly, that is not going to make up for all \nof the added expenses of gasoline for people across America, but \nSenator Stabenow has been a leader in suggesting that the oil companies \nshould give up their subsidies and tax breaks, which they continue to \nbeg for with record profits, and instead we should take that money and \ngive it back to the consumers. It is a rebate that would go not to the \nTreasury that would be lost in the sauce but would go back directly to \nfamilies and consumers across America. I thank the Senator from \nMichigan for her leadership.\n  A little later this morning, many of us are going to have a gathering \nwith farm groups across America. It is often overlooked. I know the \nSenator from Michigan has mentioned it about her State, but our farmers \nare facing a tremendous hardship because of the increased cost of \nenergy, not just diesel fuel but also the gasoline they need for the \nwork of the farm, and added costs, as well, for items like fertilizers \nand pesticides. We estimate that over the last 5 years, Illinois \nfarmers on an average are going to pay an additional $24,000 because of \nthese additional energy costs, the natural gas component of \nfertilizers, as well as the fuel to use in their tractors and in their \nvehicles. That $24,000 right off the bottom line for farmers can be the \nbreaking point for some, and many may not survive. That is why this \ndebate is important and why it is timely and why we should not waste \nany time addressing it.\n\n  I am afraid we have reached the point where we have to acknowledge \nthe obvious. The shortest attention span in America is right here in \nthis Chamber because Senators have an attention span that lasts as long \nas the headlines last and as long as the phones are ringing and the e-\nmails are coming in. When that diminishes, we tend to move to the next \nissue, whatever that might be, even if we have not addressed or \nresolved the issue before us.\n  I think my friends and colleagues in the Senate will look at the \nenergy issue and dismiss it at their peril. What we find is, as we ask \nAmericans across the board what causes you the greatest concern--this \nis a poll which came out just a few days ago from NBC and the Wall \nStreet Journal--how about leaking classified information by the Bush \nadministration? Eighteen percent of Americans say it causes them \nconcern. How about Iraq? Twenty-three percent. How about the issue of \nimmigration? Twenty-six percent. How about Iran building a nuclear \nweapon? Thirty-three percent. How about gas prices reaching $3 a \ngallon? Forty-five percent of Americans say that causes them concern.\n  We ignore this political and economic reality at our peril. It is not\n\n[[Page S3937]]\n\nenough for us to give speeches on the floor and do nothing, and this \nweek we will do nothing when it comes to the energy issue. There are \nthings we must do. First, we have to acknowledge that what we have done \nhas not worked. It has failed. The energy plan that was endorsed by the \nRepublican majority and signed by the President last August has failed. \nIt has failed and obviously so.\n  During the heating season this last winter, we saw dramatic runups in \nthe cost of home heating, whether it was fuel oil in the Northeast or \nnatural gas in the Midwest. Then, of course, came the sticker shock at \nthe gas pump every single day, now up to $3-plus a gallon in my part of \nthe world, in the Midwest and Illinois, and $4 a gallon or more in \nCalifornia or other places. To think that we passed an energy bill 8 \nmonths ago and patted ourselves on the back about what a great job we \ndid, now look at the reality. The reality is it failed. It failed.\n  We need a new direction. We need a significant change in direction. \nThe energy policy of the Bush administration has failed America. The \ncost of energy is too high. We are importing too much. We are being \npushed around by these little tinhorn dictators who happen to have oil \nreserves and now want to dictate foreign policy to the world. Why would \nthe United States ever tolerate this situation?\n  What we need to do is to be very forceful. First, let's start at \nhome. Let's acknowledge the fact that, even though there are clearly \nelements that gave rise to the increase in the cost of energy, there is \nprofiteering taking place, and it is obvious. The big five had over \n$110 billion in profits last year, $1,000 for every household in \nAmerica in oil company profits; $1,000. When this administration talked \nabout cutting your taxes, there has been another invasion of home \nbudgets, and it isn't the tax man, it is the oil man. It is the oil man \nwho is taking money out of every family's budget, almost $100 a month \nfor additional energy costs, so they can have recordbreaking profits, \nso their shareholders can applaud, and so Mr. Lee Raymond, the former \nCEO of ExxonMobil, as a parting gift for his wonderful work at \nExxonMobil, can get $400 million. As I said before, he didn't even have \nto buy a Powerball ticket--$400 million. Sayonara, farewell, Mr. \nRaymond, thank you for your great service--$400 million at the expense \nof the American economy and American consumers. The oil companies don't \nget it. They don't understand what they are doing to America.\n  The other day, George Will, who is on one of the talk shows, chided \nme for saying that what is happening with energy costs is going to put \na chill on the American economy. I will stand by that statement. It is \ntrue we have not seen it immediately. We will. You just can't increase \nthe input cost in business or farming as dramatically as these energy \nrunups are doing without hurting the bottom line, forcing farmers out \nof business, forcing businesses to lay off employees. Of course, those \nbusinesses depending on energy couldn't even dream of expanding at this \npoint because they have to find a way to deal and cope with this \nreality.\n  What do we need to do? We need to punish the profiteers. We to need \nto say to these oil companies: This is intolerable.\n  It is time for the President of the United States to call the oil \ncompany executives into the Oval Office, to sit down and in very quiet \nand reasoned tones tell them enough is enough. You cannot continue to \nprofiteer at the expense of workers and businesses and farmers across \nAmerica.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 1 hour \nfor debate with 30 minutes under the control of the Senator of Oklahoma \nand 15 minutes under the control of the Senator from California and 15 \nminutes under the control of the other Senator from California.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, what is the pending business of the \nSenate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is H.R. 4939.\n\n\n              Amendment No. 3641, Division XIX, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I would resume where we were last night, if I could get \nrecognized on amendment No. 3641, division XIX.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right, to speak to that \nissue.\n  Mr. COBURN. I had planned on withdrawing that amendment, but I wish \nto make one last point. California received $753 million in earmarks \nlast year. This amendment was to eliminate almost $11 million on levee \nreconstruction. Seventy times that amount went to California in \nearmarks. That is the problem.\n  I ask unanimous consent to withdraw this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 3817, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask that the pending amendment be set \naside and amendment No. 3817 be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3817.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To strike a provision relating to the Office of Job Corps)\n\n       Strike section 7017 (relating to the Office of Job Corps).\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I intend on withdrawing this amendment. I \nwish to make a few points before I do so.\n  In the supplemental bill, the Job Corps receives a direction that the \nDepartment of Labor can't manage it, can't use the resources to manage \nit. There are documented errors and documented fraud within it. Mr. \nPresident, section 7017 of the Emergency Supplemental would mandate \nthat Job Corps operate with less accountability. Specifically, the \nlanguage would make Job Corps the only program out of 100s to be \noperated out of the Secretary's office with direct contracting \nauthority.\n\n  The Office of the Secretary of Labor does not have the staff or \nresources to effectively manage and conduct oversight on the Job Corps. \nThe language of Section 7017 forbids the Secretary from shifting \noversight and management personnel from any other support office in the \nDepartment of Labor. Secretary Chao is forbidden to utilize the same \noversight and management that every other program normally receives \nfrom other support offices within the Department.\n  Section 7017 ignores recommendations from the Government \nAccountability Office and the Inspector General that warn against the \ndangers of waste, fraud, and abuse that will go undetected in the Job \nCorps program when one office controls all aspects of a contract-\ndrafting, soliciting, bidding, and managing. The incestuous \nrelationship between the contractors who operate the Job Corp program \nand the program officers operating the program will have no independent \noversight to guard against improper payments, improper use of \nresources, fraudulent performance reporting resulting in fraudulent \nsalary bonuses, and non-compliant accounting and record keeping.\n  Secretary Chao is trying to clean up the Job Corps program so that it \neffectively serves low income teenagers and young adults with a \nresidential job training program. The Job Corps program needs \naccountability. According to the Office of Job Corps, the program \nfailed to have aggressive monitoring of performance data making \nevaluations of the program's effectiveness unreliable. The Job Corps \ncontractors are reporting misinformation regarding the number of \nstudents that successfully graduate or receive GEDs. The contractors \nfail to report that almost 40 percent of the students who go through \nthe program fail to obtain a GED or diploma. This results in fraudulent \nbonus increases to the contractor's pay. The program fails to report \nthat the median stay of a student at a Job Corps location is 8 months, \nwhile it takes at least 12 months to successfully obtain a GED. The \nprogram also fails to accurately report how many students successful \nreceive job placement into the skilled jobs for which the Job Corps is \nsupposed to equip the students. They fail to report that only 5 percent \nof the graduating students are placed in apprenticeships for skilled \njobs. The contractors incorrectly consider job placement in unskilled \njobs and the military--(obtainable without a high school education)--as \nbenchmarks for success. This results in fraudulent bonus increases to \ntheir pay.\n  Examples of mismanagement illustrated in past Inspector General \nReports include doctoring of program performance resulting in bonus \npay, unethical use of resources, lack of cost controls and resource \nmanagement. These examples makes the point for Secretary Chao--that the \nJob Corps program is in desperate need for accountability and \noversight.\n  The September 30, 2005 Inspector General report, San Diego Job CORPS \nCenter: Student Attendance and Training Data Overstated, stated that \nthe number of vocational completions was overstated by over 50 percent. \nTraining records did not support that students had completed all the \nvocation's tasks with an appropriate level of proficiency.\n  In the March 30, 2005 Inspector General report, Kittrell Job Corps \nCenter: Manipulation of Student Attendance and Training Records, the \nInspector General found that Kittrell managers manipulated student \nattendance and training records to improve the center's reported \nperformance. Reported performance of high school diploma attainment and \njob placements was also was not reliable. This unreliable data affected \nJob Corps financially because reimbursed operating expenses and \nincentive fees paid to contracted center operators are based on \nreported performance.\n  In the 2001 independent auditor's report on the schedule of Job Corps \nexpenses for the Turner Job Corps Center, the Inspector General found \ninadequate controls over payroll processing, that included hiring two \ninstructors without proper credentials and keeping inaccurate records \nof leave. There was also lack of accountability over inventories of \nconsumable supplies, evidence that the center underreported medical and \ndental expense, and the purchase of property and equipment that \nDepartment of Labor did not approve prior to acquisition.\n  In the January 31, 2000 report entitled OIG Questions $1.3 Million of \nAdditional Costs Claimed by Contractor Report No. 18-00-003-03-370, the \nInspector General found that the contractor Will H. Hall & Son, Inc. \nreceived an additional $2,365,622 due to delays at their construction \nsite. The Inspector General found that this contractor failed to \nsubstantiate its claim that various events under the Department of \nLabor's contract constituted compensable construction delays caused by \nthe Department of Labor. Certain amounts claimed were either double \ncounted as both direct and indirect costs, already covered under the \noriginal firm fixed-price contract, or based on estimates instead of \nactual costs incurred.\n  Section 7017 of the Emergency Supplemental will virtually guarantee \nthat we will see many more examples of\n\n[[Page S3939]]\n\nwaste, fraud and abuse within the Job Corp program. Furthermore, why is \nthe Senate being asked to make a program change to a 40-year-old \nprogram within an Emergency Supplemental bill? Why hasn't the \nDepartment of Labor been consulted in making this unprecedented move \naway from accountability? Why hasn't the Appropriations Committee or \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions held a single \nhearing about this radical change to the Job Corps program?\n  Due to time constraints and my desire to move Senate business \nforward, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, what is the pending business before the \nSenate?\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3777, as modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is amendment No. 3777, as \nmodified\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Brownback as a \ncosponsor to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I know of no Senators seeking recognition \nfor discussing the amendment any further. The amendment has been \ndescribed by the distinguished Senator from New Jersey. The Senate is \nwell aware of its intent. These are funds that are being directed to \nthe situation in Darfur in the Sudan. There is a U.N. mission there \nwith responsibilities for helping to deal with the misery and \nchallenges to life that exist there.\n  I ask the author of the amendment if that is the purpose of the \namendment? It is money that would go for the purpose of supporting the \nwork of the U.N. mission in Darfur?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I thank the distinguished chairman for his inquiry. The \nanswer is yes, our effort is to ensure the ability of the U.N. work to \ncontinue and to ultimately have the wherewithal when a peacekeeping \nforce is called for to be able to have that move forward so we can \nhopefully end the genocide in Darfur.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the distinguished Senator for his explanation \nand his description of the language.\n  I know of no requests for yeas and nays on the amendment. I suggest \nwe proceed to a voice vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on April 6, I spoke on the floor about the \nhumanitarian catastrophe in Darfur where more than 200,000 people have \nperished from genocidal violence, hunger and disease. Today I rise to \nstrongly support the amendment offered by Senator Menendez to help meet \nthe emergency need for additional funding for peacekeeping in Darfur.\n  President Bush, this Congress, and the international community have \nrecognized the need for double the number of peacekeeping troops in \nDarfur to stabilize the crisis and begin to lay the groundwork for a \nresolution to this conflict. But the President has not requested the \nfunds to support additional troops. Rhetoric is cheap, but when the \nissue is the survival of thousands of vulnerable people, words do not \nsuffice. The $60 million proposed by the Senator from New Jersey is the \nminimum needed.\n  In addition to Sudan, there are 12 other U.N. peacekeeping missions \nthat face severe funding shortages in fiscal year 2006. The State \nDepartment will be $383 million short in the next few months and will \nhave no alternative but to defer those bills into next year, which \ncreates a problem for our fiscal year 2007 appropriations process. The \nPresident's inadequate budget request, which is supported by the \nmajority in Congress, ensures that we are perpetually behind in our \nU.N. peacekeeping payments.\n  This supplemental does not fund a U.N. mission to Darfur, which is \nwhat we all recognize is needed. Senator Menendez's amendment would at \nleast provide initial funding for such a mission. Nor does this bill \nfund other U.N. peacekeeping missions in the Democratic Republic of the \nCongo, Liberia, and Haiti.\n  The U.S. does not contribute troops to any of these missions. But by \nnot paying our share of peacekeeping dues on time the countries that \ncontribute the troops are less willing to do so.\n  The amount we pay is a tiny fraction of what we would have to spend \nto deploy our own troops. The GAO recently found that it would ``cost \nthe U.S. about twice as much as the U.N. to conduct peacekeeping'', and \nthe U.S. only contributes 25 percent of the cost. That makes the \nsavings 8 times less--the U.N. is half as expensive and we only pay a \nquarter of the costs. We are not prepared to put our troops into these \ncountries and the costs would be far higher to the U.S. if we did.\n  The fiscal year 2006 budget we passed last year under-funded the U.S. \ndues for peacekeeping by $383 million. The U.S. has voted to expand the \ntroop level in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, yet our share is \nunderfunded by approximately $80 million in fiscal year 2006. Ensuring \na smooth transition after the recent presidential election in Haiti is \na stated priority of the administration, yet the peacekeeping mission \nto Haiti is underfunded by at least $40 million. Liberia, Cote \nd'Ivoire, and Kosovo are all underfunded in the next year by about $383 \nmillion.\n  So what happens when the U.S. or other donors do not pay or defer \ntheir peacekeeping bills? The U.N. adjusts its bill paying to keep its \ncore missions running. And like anyone who hasn't been paid on time, \nthe U.N. pays those accounts which have immediate needs and defers \npaying bills where creditors will grant it leeway. In the first half of \nthe year, the U.N. system is relatively flush with cash from other \ncountries' dues payments. It can and does shift from general accounts \ninto those with funding shortfalls. But by mid-year, if major \ncontributors are behind on their bill payments, the U.N. will resort to \nother tactics like paying for equipment, travel, and short-term \nlogistical expenses while deferring payments to troop contributing \nnations that tend to be more forgiving of late U.N. payments.\n  Nations that contribute troops to U.N. peacekeeping bear the primary \nburden of covering for U.S. shortfalls to the U.N. peacekeeping \naccount. When the U.S. repaid its arrears to the U.N. under the Helms-\nBiden deal, for example, the U.N. repaid fourteen to fifteen countries \nfor up to 3 years' worth of deferred troop contributing costs.\n  Additionally, the United States' lack of payment for peacekeeping in \nthe past has created significant resistance to U.S. efforts to change \nassessment rates and enact reform at the U.N. During the Helms-Biden \nera and before the U.S. committed to repaying its dues, the U.S. lost \nseats on key U.N. governing bodies because of its arrearages.\n  Over the course of the last several years, the United States has \nincreasingly seen the need for U.N. peacekeeping. This has led to an \nunprecedented demand for peacekeeping troops. If we want to continue to \nincrease this burden sharing arrangement, we need to pay troop \ncontributing nations--like Pakistan, India, and South Africa--for \nservices rendered. After all, they are putting their troops into harm's \nway so United States troops don't have to.\n  We face a situation where commitments were made, funds are needed, \nthese countries are very unstable, and the commitment of U.S. troops is \nnot an option. We must pay our share so the U.N. can send peacekeepers \nto Sudan, but also to support U.N. missions in other critical areas in \nthe world.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

As others may know, there have been two \namendments that I know of that were going to be debated and voted on \nthis morning which have been withdrawn. We are making good progress in \nthe consideration of Senators' amendments. If Senators have amendments, \nthis is the time now to let us know.\n  As you know, we are under cloture. We are not going to permit \nnongermane amendments to be brought up. So there will be objections \nmade as a general proposition to accelerate the further discussion and \nconsideration of this bill. We hope to complete action on the bill \ntoday. That certainly is possible with the fact that Senators are \nproceeding to let us know about their amendments that are germane. \nThere is a list of amendments Senators have told us about that we \nexpect to be called up. This is the time to do that. So we urge \nSenators to help us proceed on an orderly basis to complete action on \nthe bill today.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I respectfully ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I would like to make some remarks about \nthe supplemental appropriations bill now on the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my opposition to \nthe emergency supplemental bill. It has, unfortunately, become routine \nto see emergency spending bills on the floor. But I understand the \npressing need for this legislation to defend America from terrorism and \nrespond to one of the worst natural disasters in America's history.\n  These reasons are why we have emergency supplemental legislation in \nthe first place. I strongly support the President's $92 billion \nrequest. His request includes essential funding to pay the men and \nwomen serving in our Armed Forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. It also \nprovides the funding needed to restore damaged military equipment and \npurchase new state-of-the-art technology.\n  For fiscal year 2007, we have budgeted for much of the cost of the \nwar on terror, but this emergency supplemental is important to provide \nour American Armed Forces the additional funding they need today.\n  I want to stand shoulder to shoulder with the men and women serving \nin Iraq and Afghanistan by supporting the defense portion of this \nlegislation. And I would like to roll up my sleeves and help the \nAmericans who were so devastated by Hurricane Katrina rebuild their \nhomes and communities. I believe strongly in these two missions, and I \nwill fight to ensure they are properly funded.\n\n  But today we are looking at legislation that has billions of dollars \nof extra spending in nonemergency areas. In fact, it has everything but \nthe kitchen sink. As I read through the programs that will provide $20 \nmillion for oyster fishermen in New England and $4 million for erosion \ncontrol projects in California and Michigan, I am starting to believe \nthe kitchen sink must be in there, too, somewhere.\n  It saddens me to see in this legislation that States outside of the \ngulf coast are trying to latch on to the people who suffered from last \nyear's hurricanes. Emergency spending should be just that--used for \nemergency purposes. We should not just add in billions of dollars of \nextra funding because this is a moving legislative vehicle.\n\n[[Page S3942]]\n\n  The legislation before us includes some programs like the Community \nDevelopment Block Grant Programs which are funded significantly higher \nthan the President's request. While I support this program, I do not \nthink this emergency spending bill is the appropriate place to increase \noverall funding for CDBG. I do not see the need to spend an extra \nbillion dollars and expand CDBG's scope beyond States affected by \nKatrina.\n  The legislation further limits the CDBG money by requiring States to \nspend nearly 20 percent on affordable rental housing. I believe it is a \nmistake to take community planning decisions out of the hands of local \nand State officials.\n  And there are other examples of States not affected by the hurricanes \ntrying to obtain emergency funding. Everyone who has had some form of \nnatural disaster in their State is trying to get a piece of the pie. I \ndo not want to diminish the tragedy of any disaster, but the Federal \nbudget process includes funding for these isolated events which were \nnever intended to be funded with emergency spending.\n  For example, there were a series of bad storms in California in 2002 \nthat flooded Los Angeles roadways and flooded buildings with hail. The \nlegislation before us would provide $51 million for transportation \nrepairs--repairs that the State of California has already paid for. \nThat is right, this emergency bill contains money to repay States for \nnatural disasters that occurred years ago. This is unacceptable.\n  I have long supported congressionally directed projects and am \nprepared to defend my projects in the fiscal year 2007 appropriations \nbills. As a member of the Budget Committee, I can tell you firsthand \nhow important it is to set targets and plan ahead. That is how we \nmaintain accountability.\n  We need to remember that every dollar we spend in this supplemental \ncame from some hard-working American taxpayers. The American people \ndeserve a Government that is careful with their money. That is why I \nwill vote against this legislation.\n  I have also told the President I will support his veto of this \nlegislation if it passes Congress above his $92-plus billion request. I \nbelieve we need to cut spending and work out a responsible plan that \nmeets the needs of the war on terror and rebuilding in the gulf coast \nregion.\n  I urge my colleagues to curb spending in this emergency spending \nbill. I ask for them to consider their vote and what will happen if we \npass this legislation. I urge those who are on the fence or on the \nborder or about not to vote for this bill, not to vote for it but if \nthey do, to support the President's veto when it comes.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3688\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Senator from Washington was kind \nenough on a previous occasion to offer amendment No. 3688. I call for \nthe regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is now \npending.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  For any of my colleagues who had the chance last evening to look at \nthe national news, the story that led virtually all of the national \nnetworks was the concern that our public health officials and worldwide \npublic health officials have, with regard to the dangers of an avian \nflu pandemic. We listened to the Secretary of HHS talk about the \nnumbers of Americans who would be affected, some 2 million people. With \na pandemic, we would face the potential of closing down airlines, \nclosing airports, dangers in the workplace, health dangers.\n  This is something the Subcommittee on Bioterrorism and Public Health \nPreparedness has been very concerned about, and I pay special \ncommendation to the chairman of our committee, Senator Burr, who has \nhad a series of hearings not only on the dangers of avian flu and flu \ngenerally but also on the dangers of bioterrorism.\n  There are some very important common threats that come from \nbioterrorism and from an avian flu danger. Obviously the first thing \nthat a nation has to do is to be able to detect these pathogens in \ncountries where they may be developing, and then, secondly, to detect \nthem here at home. That is why development and support for a public \nhealth system is so important.\n  Then there is the challenge of containment, to try to contain any of \nthe dangers. And then, obviously, there is the treatment for \nindividuals who are affected. That can be treating individuals who are \naffected or trying to provide a vaccine for individuals, so the dangers \nto those individuals are minimized. These challenges all fall under the \nrubric of the development of a national plan. I will come back to that \nin a moment. We in the United States have not had that kind of \neffective plan developed that would be necessary to deal with the \ncentral challenge of a public health emergency.\n  This amendment I offer is a simple but vital amendment. It is a \nlinchpin in any kind of battle against the dangers of avian flu. That \nis, if we are expecting our drug industry to be able to develop the \nvaccines--and we have given a good deal of flexibility to the Food and \nDrug Administration in these kinds of emergencies, to provide approval \nto vaccines that might not have been and probably would not have been \ngiven the kind of safety evaluations that other prescriptions drugs \nwould have taken through--we have to ask: Who is going to receive these \nvaccines or treatments? Primarily, they will be individuals whom we \ncall first responders. What are they going to do? They are going to go \ninto the infected area and try to contain it.\n  It is one thing to invest hundreds of millions and billions of \ndollars in developing the vaccines and treatments to minimize the \nhealth impact of the dangers of avian flu, but if we are going to ask \nfirst responders to go in and risk their lives, their health, and the \neconomic stability and security of their families, we ought to be \nwilling to say to these individuals: If you are going to get sick, and \nyou are going to lose your job, or if there is going to be danger to \nyour health as you serve as the frontline defenders for the rest of \nsociety, then we are going to compensate you for the loss of income you \nare going to have as a result of taking this vaccine. That is what this \namendment does. It provides for a compensation program for first \nresponders, the people on the front lines of a pandemic.\n  One can say: Is this necessary? All we have to do is look at history, \nand we will find that when you do not have a compensation program, you \ndo not have volunteers willing to serve as first responders, and \nwilling to take on these challenges. This amendment protects our first \nresponders, and so it protects the rest of society as well. It is a \nvery limited amendment. That is the reason it is so important. You can \nask: Is this really an emergency? No one can look at the news last \nnight, and see the lead story on all three networks, saying there is a \nreal danger that is coming at you, and say we ought to treat this as \nbusiness as usual. That is why I believe this amendment is appropriate \nto this supplemental.\n  The administration seems to be suffering from a condition that could \nbe called ``CDD,'' competence deficit disorder. Whether in Iraq or \nKatrina or any other major crisis, the administration has been \nincompetent, including the issue of dealing with avian flu. Our HELP \nCommittee has analyzed the administration's regular failure to prepare \nfor a flu pandemic, and today we are releasing a report showing that \nthey have failed to take the steps needed to see that America is ready \nfor this national challenge. They have failed to invest in the hospital \nsurge capacity, in needed information technology, and in the public \nhealth surveillance and training programs that are needed for an \neffective response.\n  The endless challenges outlined in the pandemic flu plan are a symbol \nof the administration's failure. The preparations for avian flu have \nbeen in such prolonged disarray that they are releasing their third new \nplan this week. The Bush administration has known of the need for a \nplan to prepare for a flu\n\n[[Page S3943]]\n\npandemic since the day it took office. But 2001 came and went without a \nplan, then 2002, 2003, 2004, and almost all of 2005, and still no plan. \nIn each of these years, the warnings of a potential pandemic grew \nlouder but were ignored.\n  This chart shows the warnings that have been offered by health \nexperts around the world. From May 2002, the World Health Organization:\n\n       Authorities must understand the potential impact and threat \n     of pandemic influenza.\n\n  This is from the GAO, November 2000:\n\n       Federal and State influenza plans do not address the key \n     issues surrounding the purchase and distribution of vaccines \n     and antivirals.\n\n  From the Institute of Medicine in 1992:\n\n       Policymakers must realize and understand the magnitude of \n     the influenza pandemic.\n\n  Then we had the series of flu outbreaks: December 2003, outbreak in \nSouth Korea; outbreak in Vietnam, 2004; outbreak in 2006 of avian flu \nin Britain. This chart shows all the outbreaks in the most recent \nyears.\n  What have other nations done on the pandemic? First, let's look at \nother countries around the world that have developed a comprehensive \nplan for the pandemic. In October 1997, we had a program by the \nJapanese; Canada in February 2004; Czechoslovakia in April 2004; \nFebruary 2005, Hong Kong; March of 2005, Great Britain.\n  I will not include these plans in the Record, but let me show the \nextent of the British pandemic flu program. I have illustrated this at \nother times during similar discussions. Here is the Canadian plan. \nThese are enormously comprehensive programs. They are programs that \ndeal with rural areas, urban areas, training programs. And not only are \nthere programs, they are being implemented. Our strategy was issued in \nNovember 2005, and it has remained incomplete since then. The \nadministration has sent a second plan to us now.\n  What is it basically that we are trying to do? We are trying to get a \ncomprehensive plan from the administration, a plan that has been \nimplemented. Let me show one other chart. This isn't just what I \nbelieve. From the GAO report, November 2000:\n\n       Federal and State influenza plans do not address the key \n     issues surrounding the purchase and distribution of vaccines \n     and antivirals.\n\n  From June 2005:\n\n       The draft plan does not establish the actions the Federal \n     Government would take to purchase and distribute the vaccine \n     during an influenza pandemic.\n\n  This is from a GAO June 2005 report. That is the current situation.\n  Right now, we have in this legislation resources to pruchase the \nvaccines in an emergency. But we do not have a compensation program. We \nhave a compensation program in name, but that is all it is. It is not \nfunded. Well, you can say we will try to find a way to fund it in the \nfuture. Tell that to the downwinders out in Utah. Tell that to my \nfriend, Senator Hatch, who has been absolutely brilliant in terms of \nlooking after those individuals, whose lives were so affected by the \nexperiments with nuclear materials so many years ago. He, to his \ncredit, developed a compensation program. I welcomed the opportunity to \nwork with him to try to help these people whose health had been \nabsolutely destroyed by exposures, in the national interest, as we \ndeveloped various nuclear weapons.\n\n  Here is our majority leader, Senator Frist, who said:\n\n       Too many health care workers have been deterred from \n     receiving the smallpox vaccine--in part because of the \n     uncertainties about what would happen, and how they would \n     provide for themselves, if they suffered a serious adverse \n     reaction to the vaccine.\n\n  That states it as clearly and succinctly as one could possibly say \nit. We do not have a guaranteed compensation program for pandemic flu \nvaccines in this legislation or in any other place in our health care \nsystem. This amendment provides a down-payment for the compensation \nprogram. You can say: Well, why should we do that for this particular \nprogram? All we have to do is look at other vaccine programs, other \npublic health programs, for swine flu, childhood vaccines, and, after \nCongress acted, for smallpox. We had a compensation plan for people \ninjured by those experimental vaccines. But for the new ones, we only \nhave an empty sham of a compensation, with no funding.\n  So, Mr. President, that is what this amendment does. It provides some \n$289 million for the development of that compensation program. It is \neffectively the same kind of program that has been essential in the \npast, and it is essential now if we expect our front-line responders to \nbe willing to take experimental vaccines and to risk their lives for \nthe common good of the community that may well be threatened by avian \nflu or bioterrorism. Individuals who are well trained as front-line \nresponders ought to have the assurance that if they take an \nexperimental drug and they go out there to protect the public, if \nsomething is going to happen to them, there will be a compensation fund \nto compensate them for their health care needs and their immediate \nneeds, if that should turn out to be the case. Nothing more, nothing \nless. That is essentially what this amendment does.\n  Mr. President, I see our floor managers here. I am glad to \naccommodate whatever they would like. I would like to get a yea or nay \nvote at some time. I know they have a full program. I ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I am checking \nwith the chairman and ranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee \non Labor, Health and Human Services to see what the reaction is to the \namendment. They are having a hearing as we speak over in the \nAppropriations Committee. So I feel obliged to get their advice and \ncounsel as to what response ought to be made, if any, to the Senator's \namendment. We have no objection to proceeding or to having a vote on \nthe amendment, but the Senate is entitled to know what the reaction \nmight be.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is fine and understandable. I will wait until we \nhear from the chairman and ranking member. I don't intend to extend the \ndiscussion. I think it is pretty understandable. I am glad to wait \nuntil the leader lets us know when they want to address it and complete \naction on it. I will be available.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator very much for that \nindulgence. If there are others who wish to offer amendments, I am \nprepared to ask unanimous consent to temporarily lay aside the \namendment of the Senator from Massachusetts to permit other amendments \nto be offered. I do ask unanimous consent for that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I would like to offer two amendments and have a moment \nto speak about two amendments that are germane.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for that purpose.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3750\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I will bring up for a brief discussion \nmy amendment No. 3750.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Ms. Landrieu] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3750.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n      (Purpose: To direct the Secretary of the Army to develop a \ncomprehensive plan for the deauthorization of deep draft navigation on \nthe Mississippi River Gulf Outlet and address wetland losses and other \n                    issues relating to that Outlet)\n\n       On page 159, strike lines 1 through 10 and insert the \n     following:\n\n     $7,250,000, to remain available until expended: Provided, \n     That the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of \n     Engineers, shall use $3,500,000 to develop a comprehensive \n     plan, at full Federal expense, that, at a minimum, will \n     deauthorize deep draft navigation on the Mississippi River \n     Gulf Outlet established by Public Law 84-455 (70 Stat. 65, \n     chapter 112) (referred to in this matter as the ``Outlet)'', \n     extending from the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf Intracoastal \n     Waterway, and address wetland losses attributable to the \n     Outlet, channel bank erosion, hurricane and storm protection, \n     saltwater intrusion, navigation, ecosystem restoration, and \n     related issues: Provided further, That the plan shall\n\n[[Page S3944]]\n\n     include recommended authorization modifications to the Outlet \n     regarding what, if any, navigation should continue, measures \n     to provide hurricane and storm protection, prevent saltwater \n     intrusion, and re-establish the storm buffering properties \n     and ecological integrity of the wetland damaged by \n     construction and operation of the Outlet, and complement \n     restoration of coastal Louisiana: Provided further, That the \n     Secretary shall develop the plan in consultation with the \n     Parish of St. Bernard, Louisiana, the State of Louisiana, the \n     Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Commerce, the \n     Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and the \n     National Academy of Sciences: Provided further, That the \n     Secretary shall seek input, review, and comment from the \n     public and the scientific community on the plan: Provided \n     further, That the Secretary shall ensure that an independent \n     panel of experts established by the National Academy of \n     Sciences reviews and provides written comments on the \n     proposed plan: Provided further, That, not later than 1 year \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall \n     submit an interim report to Congress comprising the plan, the \n     written comments of the independent panel of experts, and the \n     written explanation of the Secretary for any recommendation \n     of the independent panel of experts not adopted in the plan: \n     Provided further, That the Secretary shall refine the plan, \n     if necessary, to be fully consistent, integrated, and \n     included in the final technical report to be issued in \n     December 2007 pursuant to the matter under the heading \n     ``investigations'' under the heading ``Corps of Engineers--\n     Civil'' of title I of the Energy and Water Development \n     Appropriations Act, 2006 (Public Law 109-103, 119 Stat. 2247; \n     Public Law 109-148, 119 Stat. 2814): Provided further, That \n     the amount provided under this heading is designated as an \n     emergency requirement pursuant to section 402 of H. Con. Res. \n     05 (109th Congress), the concurrent resolution on the budget \n     for fiscal year 2006: Provided further, That, of the amount \n     made available under this heading, $3,750,000 shall be \n     available only to the extent that an official budget request \n     for a specific dollar amount, that includes designation of \n     the entire amount of the request as an emergency requirement, \n     is transmitted by the President to Congress.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, this amendment that I offer tries to \nmove forward a very difficult situation that we are faced with in \nLouisiana about how to protect not just the New Orleans city proper but \nthe greater metropolitan area and parts of south Louisiana from \nflooding in the future.\n  As you know, Mr. President, because you have been gracious enough to \nbe one of the Senators to go walk through the neighborhoods and see the \nflooding, being a firsthand witness, it wasn't just the hurricanes, \nKatrina and Rita, but it was the breaking of levee systems. Some of \nthose levees were long industrial canals that served this great port \nwhich, together with the South Louisiana Port, is the largest port \nsystem in America. Some of these levees were along the lake. Some of \nthem were along what we call the London Avenue Canal.\n  There was a project that was designed and structured by the Corps of \nEngineers back in the 1930s and 1940s called the Mississippi River gulf \noutlet. I think you actually stood on that levee, Mr. President, and \nlooked to see where that breach occurred. This avenue was thought--at \nthe time we built it and designed it, like so many large civil works \nprojects we have done in this Nation--to be a positive effort to help \nexpand the opportunities for the port for trade and commerce. For a \nwhile, it did serve that purpose. But what has happened is that over a \ndecade, it has caused such erosion in the great expanse of marshland \nthat it was placed in--or the marsh was dredged through and created, \nthat it really is causing, according to everyone who has looked at how \nthe flooding occurred in our area, it is causing serious--not only \nenvironmental--damage but is now a real threat to life and property.\n  So there has been an effort underway between port officials, parish \nofficials in St. Bernard, and the business community to try to come up \nwith a way to close the Mississippi River gulf outlet but to do it in a \nway that protects the parish of St. Bernard primarily and the lower \nninth ward, as well as trying to give some period of time for the few \nbusinesses that are along the gulf outlet to make arrangements to move.\n  My amendment would simply provide a de minimis $3.5 million for the \nCorps of Engineers to develop a closure plan because the consensus at \nhome is that the Mississippi River gulf outlet, which is demonstrated \nhere on the map, which served at one time as a very important shipping \nchannel--it is significant that shipping has greatly diminished as its \nthreat to the environment has substantially increased. Because we have \nnot had the Federal or State resources to actually protect these \nmarshlands the way we should, this channel has become quite wide, much \nwider than any of us had anticipated--even the Corps. And the \npossibilities of flooding have been increased because the channel has \nbeen expanded and these marshes have been eroding from many different \nfactors, not just this.\n  So this very modest $3.5 million would allow a study--a plan, not \nreally a study, because the studies are completed--and this will become \npart of our overall protection system for this region. Again, the point \nis that we are not just building levees to protect southern Louisiana \nand southern Mississippi and other places. It is a combination of some \nlevees, some coastal restoration, and some smart navigation channel \nwork, or rework, that is integrated--much more of a sophisticated, \ncoordinated approach than in the past.\n  I offer this amendment by way of explanation to show that the studies \nhave been done. There has been a lot of evaluation of past storms. This \nwill allow the Corps to come up with a plan to close MRGO, provide for \nshipping and good environmental restoration, and, most importantly, \nprotect St. Bernard Parish and the lower part of ward 9 in Orleans \nParish and New Orleans east from flooding in the future.\n  So that is the amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3752\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3752.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Ms. Landrieu] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3752.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To direct the Secretary of Commerce to provide a grant to the \nPort of New Orleans to mitigate increased costs resulting from the loss \n of deep draft navigation access to certain facilities at the Port in \n                  the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina)\n\n       On page 178, after line 21, add the following:\n\n                  Economic Development Administration\n\n       For an additional amount for the mitigation of increased \n     costs resulting from the loss of deep draft navigation access \n     to certain facilities at the Port of New Orleans in the \n     aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, $8,500,000, to remain \n     available until September 30, 2007, to be provided by the \n     Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Assistant Secretary \n     for Economic Development, to the Port of New Orleans in the \n     form of a grant: Provided, That the Secretary shall \n     administer the grant under this section in accordance with \n     section 209 of the Public Works and Economic Development Act \n     of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 3149): Provided further, That the amount \n     provided under this heading is designated as an emergency \n     requirement pursuant to section 402 of H. Con. Res. 95 (109th \n     Congress), the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal \n     year 2006.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, this amendment is a 1-year grant of $8.5 \nmillion to the Port of New Orleans to mitigate the increased costs \nresulting from the loss of deep-draft navigation access to certain \nfacilities and ports. This is part B of this amendment. We worked to \ncreate a plan to close this from large deep-draft vessels. They still \nhave access, obviously, through the inner harbor canal lock through the \nGIWW. We still have to find a way to help offset some of the costs to \nsome of these companies that are located here as a transitional plan, \nso that we can make these arrangements that the Corps is recommending \nfor safety of the port facilities and the people around it. That is \nbasically what amendment No. 3752 will accomplish.\n  As I have said before, this was created back many decades ago when we \ndidn't realize the environmental impact. It has caused not just \nproblems from Katrina and Rita, but it prompted a great deal of \nflooding back in 1965 with Hurricane Betsy, one of the worst in this \nregion, well before Katrina and Rita. So we have known for a long time \nthat this had to be done.\n  With these two amendments, I believe the port can have some money for \nthe transition, the Corps can get the plans done to ready the closure, \nand we will be well on our way to protecting a\n\n[[Page S3945]]\n\ngreat number of people at a minimal expense to the Federal Government \nor to the local and State governments and having a great benefit for \nshipping, the environment, and the community that lives along this \nindustrial channel.\n  I thank the chairman for the time to discuss the amendments. We will \nfollow his direction as to when these amendments come up for a vote. I \nyield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, to respond to the Senator's comments, in \nlooking at the list of amendments that are not germane, these two \namendments appear to be not germane postcloture and therefore not in \norder. We are checking to see what the reaction is from the authorizing \ncommittee. What that would amount to is this is an authorization that \nhas not been approved. The language amounts to an authorization of a \nwater project that has not been approved by the committee that has \nlegislative jurisdiction over the issues. So we are awaiting a response \nand a reaction from the legislative committee to the amendments.\n\n  I suggest we move on to other amendments that may be in order. The \nKennedy amendment was temporarily laid aside so the Senator could \ndiscuss her two amendments. Having done so, I think we can return to \nthe Kennedy amendment and then let the Senate work its will on that \namendment. The Senator from Massachusetts has asked for the yeas and \nnays on his amendment, and we could proceed to a vote.\n  We were trying to get a reaction from the chairman of the \nappropriations subcommittee having jurisdiction over the pandemic \ninfluenza vaccine issue, the Labor, Health and Human Services \nAppropriations subcommittee. They are having a hearing right now and we \nhaven't had a response to our inquiry about the reaction. We also think \nthe leaders are entitled to notice that this could be subject to a \nrecorded vote to get the reaction as to whether this is the time to do \nthat or if they are available to discuss it, if the leader wants to \ndiscuss the issue. So awaiting those advices, I suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I understand that two other amendments \nhave now been cleared for the consideration of the Senate.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3713, As Modified\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up \namendment No. 3713.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this is an amendment that was offered \nlast evening by the distinguished Senator from North Carolina, Mr. \nBurr. As I say, it has been cleared on both sides. I ask unanimous \nconsent the amendment be modified with the modifications at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 238, line 23, strike ``Control and Prevention, \n     and'' and insert ``Control and Prevention, $5,000,000 shall \n     be for the Smithsonian Institution to carry out domestic \n     disease surveillance, and''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment, as \nmodified? If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment, as \nmodified.\n  The amendment (No. 3713), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I now advise that we can call up an \namendment of Senator Kennedy regarding democracy in Iraq.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3686, As Modified\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3686, on behalf \nof Senator Kennedy and others, regarding democracy in Iraq.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran], for Mr. \n     Kennedy, for himself, Mr. Biden, and Mr. Leahy, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3686.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 126, between lines 12 and 13, insert the following:\n\n\n          UNITED STATES STRATEGY TO PROMOTE DEMOCRACY IN IRAQ\n\n       Sec. 1406. (a) Of the funds provided in this chapter for \n     the Economic Support Fund, not less than $96,000,000 should \n     be made available through the Bureau of Democracy, Human \n     Rights, and Labor of the Department of State, in coordination \n     with the United States Agency for International Development \n     where appropriate, to United States nongovernmental \n     organizations for the purpose of supporting broad-based \n     democracy assistance programs in Iraq that promote the long \n     term development of civil society, political parties, \n     election processes, and parliament in that country.\n       (b) The President shall include in each report submitted to \n     Congress under the United States Policy in Iraq Act (section \n     1227 of Public Law 109-163; 50 U.S.C. 1541 note; 119 Stat. \n     3465) a report on the extent to which funds appropriated in \n     this Act support a short-term and long-term strategy to \n     promote and develop democracy in Iraq. The report shall \n     include the following:\n       (1) A description of the objectives of the Secretary of \n     State to promote and develop democracy at the national, \n     regional, and provincial levels in Iraq, including \n     development of civil society, political parties, and \n     government institutions.\n       (2) The strategy to achieve such objectives.\n       (3) The schedule to achieve such objectives.\n       (4) The progress made toward achieving such objectives.\n       (5) The principal official within the United States \n     Government responsible for coordinating and implementing \n     democracy funding for Iraq.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I send a modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  Without objection, the amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 3686), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 126, between lines 12 and 13, insert the following:\n\n\n                           DEMOCRACY IN IRAQ\n\n       Sec. 1406. (a) Of the funds provided in this chapter for \n     the Economic Support Fund, not less than $104,500,000 should \n     be made available through the Bureau of Democracy, Human \n     Rights, and Labor of the Department of State, in coordination \n     with the United States Agency for International Development \n     where appropriate, to United States nongovernmental \n     organizations for the purpose of supporting democracy \n     assistance programs in Iraq that promote the long term \n     development of civil society, political parties, election \n     processes, the rule of law, reconciliation activities, and \n     parliament in that country: Provided, That the Secretary of \n     State shall consult with the Committees on Appropriations \n     prior to the initial obligation of funds made available under \n     this section on the uses of such funds: Provided further, \n     That of the funds made available under this heading, up to \n     $8,500,000 should be made available for the United States \n     Institute of Peace for programs in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n       (b) The President shall include in each report submitted to \n     Congress under the United States Policy in Iraq Act (section \n     1227 of Public Law 109-163; 50 U.S.C. 1541 note; 119 Stat. \n     3465) a report on the extent to which funds appropriated in \n     this Act support a short-term and long-term strategy to \n     promote and develop democracy in Iraq, including:\n       (1) A description of the objectives of the Secretary of \n     State to promote and develop democracy at the national, \n     regional, and provincial levels in Iraq, including \n     development of civil society, political parties, and \n     government institutions.\n       (2) The schedule to achieve such objectives.\n       (3) The progress made toward achieving such objectives.\n       (4) The principal official within the United States \n     Government responsible for coordinating and implementing \n     democracy funding for Iraq.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as the senior Senator from Kentucky \nknows, the Kennedy-Biden-Leahy amendment sets aside $104.5 million in \neconomic support funds in the supplemental for U.S. nongovernmental \norganizations for democracy building programs that promote the long-\nterm development of civil society, political parties, election \nprocesses, the rule of law, reconciliation activities, and parliament \nin Iraq.\n\n[[Page S3946]]\n\n  Currently, there are six nongovernmental organizations doing \nexcellent democracy work in Iraq under extremely difficult and \ndangerous conditions. Our expectation is that $96 million of the funds \nin our amendment would be allocated among the six organizations in the \nfollowing way to continue their work in Iraq:\n  IFES would receive $20 million. The International Research and \nExchanges Board would receive $6 million. The National Endowment for \nDemocracy would receive $10 million. The America's Development \nFoundation would receive $16 million.\n  The National Democratic Institute and the International Republican \nInstitute would each receive $22 million. These funds would be in \naddition to the $15 million that the administration has requested for \nthese activities in fiscal year 07.\n  In each case, the additional funds are intended to be used by the \norganizations over the next 18 months to continue their current \noperations. I understand that each organization will need to submit a \nproposal to justify the use of funds before they can be made available.\n  Does the Senator from Kentucky agree with this allocation of funds?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes, I do.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Does the Senator from Vermont agree with this allocation \nof funds?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes, I do. And I would add that the amendment also \nprovides that up to $8.5 million should be made available to support \nthe activities of the United States Institute of Peace in Iraq.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from Kentucky, \nMr. McConnell, and the Senator from Vermont for their assistance on \nthis amendment.\n  The amendment provides $104.5 million for American nongovernmental \norganizations helping Iraqis to create the essential building blocks of \ndemocracy. It is cosponsored by Senators Biden and Leahy.\n  Last year, Iraq passed several important milestones on the long road \nto democracy. However, as important as the two elections and the \nreferendum on the constitution were, they were not decisive, and it is \nfar from clear that democracy is being firmly established in Iraq.\n  The process of building democratic institutions is different and \nrequires patience in developing effective governmental structures, a \ngenuine rule of law, political parties committed to peaceful means, an \nactive civil society, and a free press. Constructive international \nengagement is essential as well in the case of Iraq. For a country as \nheavily repressed as long as Iraq, democracy will take even longer to \ntake root.\n  It is far from clear, however, that the Bush administration has a \nlong-term strategy--or even a short-term strategy--to solidify and \ncontinue the democratic gains that have been made so far.\n  American nongovernmental organizations such as the National \nDemocratic Institute, the International Republican Institute, the \nNational Endowment for Democracy, IFES, formerly known. as the \nInternational Foundation for Election Systems, the International \nResearch and Exchanges Board and America's Development Foundation are \nwell respected in Iraq and throughout the world. Each has substantial \noperations in Iraq, and their work is essential to the administration's \ngoal of building a stable democracy in Iraq.\n  Yet despite their success so far in helping to promote democracy and \nthe enormous risks their employees take by working in the war zone, the \nadministration has made no long-term commitment to provide funding \nfor their work in Iraq. Each organization operates on pins and needles, \nnever knowing when their funding for Iraq operations will dry up.\n\n  The American nongovernmental organization IFES has been in Iraq since \nOctober 2003. It has provided technical assistance in each of Iraq's \nelections so far, and it has been asked to provide such assistance for \nregional and provincial elections scheduled for April 2007.\n  It is also preparing for a possible second referendum on the \nconstitution, and is assisting as well in the enactment and \nimplementation of legislation governing the operations of a new \nelection council for local elections.\n  Inexplicably, funding will run out in June, and the administration \nhas not yet committed any additional funds. None of the funds in this \nsupplemental spending bill are set-aside for it, and none of the meager \n$63 million requested in the fiscal year 2007 budget for democracy-\nbuilding is intended for IFES either. Our amendment would provide $20 \nmillion to sustain its democracy work in Iraq for the next 18 months, \nthrough the end of fiscal year 2007.\n  An independent media is also essential to a successful democracy. A \nU.S. nongovernmental organization, the International Research and \nExchanges Board--IREX is working in Iraq to see that the Iraqi people \nhave independent, professional, high quality news and public affairs \ninformation. To create an environment in which a free press can \nflourish, it is also seeking to establish a legal, regulatory, and \npolicy environment that supports independent media.\n  IREX's funding for these important programs is also running out, and \nit will be forced to close its operations this summer, which would pull \nthe rug out from under many struggling new press organizations in Iraq. \nOur amendment would provide $6 million to sustain IREX's democracy work \nin Iraq for the next 18 months.\n  In addition, the nongovernmental organization America's Development \nFoundation provides essential aid to support and sustain civil society \nin Iraq. ADF and its partner civil society organizations in Iraq have \nprovided training and assistance to thousands of Iraqi government \nofficials at the national, regional, and local level on issues such as \nanticorruption, transparency, accountability, fiscal responsibility, \nwhistleblower protection, and the development of nongovernmental \norganizations.\n  ADF wants to continue its work, but its funding will end in June. \nUSAID supports this work and has a contract pending, but it doesn't \nhave the resources to fulfill it. Our amendment provides $16 million to \nsustain its work over the next 18 months. Similarly, the National \nEndowment for Democracy has no clear sense of what the future holds for \nthem in Iraq.\n  Two of the endowment's core grantees--the Center for International \nPrivate Enterprise and the Labor Solidarity Center in Iraq--have \nimportant democracy promotion functions.\n  Since opening a regional office in Baghdad in October 2003, the \nCenter for International Private Enterprise has worked to build \ncapacity for market oriented democratic reform in Iraq. It has provided \ntraining and grant support to approximately 22 Iraqi business \nassociations and chambers of commerce.\n  The Labor Solidarity Center works directly with Iraqi trade unions to \ndevelop skills in strengthening independent and democratic trade \nunions.\n  In addition, the endowment partners with 32 local organizations on \nthe ground in Iraq to promote and sustain civil society projects on \npolitical development, raising awareness of women's rights, and \nencouraging the free flow of information to Iraqi citizens.\n  The endowment wants to continue working directly with the Iraqi \npeople and be able to guarantee continuity in its democracy grants to \nIraqi organizations. But no funding is set aside in this bill or in the \nfiscal year 2007 budget for its programs.\n  Our amendment provides $10 million to sustain the democracy programs \nof the Center for International Private Enterprise, the Labor \nSolidarity Center, and the Endowment for Democracy's local partners for \n18 months. Similarly, the International Republican Institute and the \nNational Democratic institute--are doing truly impressive work in Iraq \nunder extraordinarily difficult circumstances.\n  The International Republican Institute programs in Iraq have focused \non three principal goals: development of an issue-based political party \nsystem; establishment of the foundation for a more transparent and \nresponsive government; and the emergence of an active and politically \ninvolved civil society.\n\n  The National Democratic Institute supports a number of democracy \nprograms in Iraq as well, with emphasis on political parties, \ngovernance, civil society and women's rights. It has four offices in \nIraq to promote these essential\n\n[[Page S3947]]\n\nbuilding blocks of strong democracy, and it works directly with Iraqi \npartners and hundreds of local civic organization.\n  Both IRI and NDI want to continue to build these essential links \nbetween the government and political parties, in order to enable the \ngovernment become more responsive and effective in addressing the needs \nof Iraq's people.\n  Despite the impressive contribution of these two Institutes to \ndemocracy in Iraq, neither is guaranteed steady future funding for its \nprograms. The administration's budget provides only $7.5 million for \neach Institute--enough for just 2 months of operating expenses. Our \namendment provides an additional $22 million for each institute's \nessential democracy programs in Iraq for the next 18 months.\n  The amendment also provides $8.5 million for the U.S. Institute of \nPeace for its important work to promote reconciliation.\n  This amendment has broad support in the democracy community, and I \nask unanimous consent to print letters supporting it in the Record at \nthe end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (see exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Thousands of Iraqis are working hard, often at great \nrisk to themselves, to develop civic groups, participate in political \nparties and election, and run for and serve in political office. The \ndramatic pictures of Iraqis waving their purple fingers after voting in \npast elections remind us of the enormous stakes.\n  Progress to avoid civil war and defeat the insurgency is directly \nrelated to progress on democracy-building, and ongoing work on this \nall-important issue must be a top priority.\n  We must be clear in our commitment to stand by these organizations \nthat are working on the front lines in the struggle for democracy in \nIraq every day. We also need to demonstrate to Iraqis and others that \nwe are committed to Iraq's long-term democratic development. We need a \nlong-term plan and a long-term strategy that is backed by appropriate \nresources.\n  President Bush has called for patience in Iraq. He should heed his \nown advice. He can't speak about having patience for democracy in Iraq, \nand then cut funding for the groups that are assisting so capably in \nits development.\n  Our financial commitment to the organizations at the forefront of the \ndemocracy effort must be strong and unambiguous. By failing to \nguarantee continuity for their programs, we send a confusing signal \nthat can only be harmful for this very important effort.\n  We are now spending more than $1 billion a week for military \noperations for the war in Iraq. At this rate, it would take the \nmilitary less than one day to spend the $104.5 million provided in this \namendment for democracy promotion. Surely, we can commit this level of \nfunding for democracy programs over the next 18 months.\n  Regardless of whether we supported or opposed the war, we all agree \nthat the work of building democracy requires patience, skill, \nguaranteed continuity, and adequate resources.\n  It makes no sense to shortchange Iraq's political development. We \nneed a long-term political strategy, and we must back up that strategy \nwith the needed resources, if we truly hope to achieve a stable, \npeaceful and democratic Iraq.\n  Our amendment provides the resources necessary to ensure continuity \nin these democracy programs in Iraq. I thank Senators McConnell and \nLeahy for their hard work on this provision, and I am delighted that it \nwill become part of this legislation.\n\n\n                             National Endowment for Democracy,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 24, 2006.\n     Hon. Ted Kennedy,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: On behalf of the Board of Directors \n     of the National Endowment for Democracy, we are writing to \n     thank you for your commitment to creating a viable and \n     sustainable democracy in Iraq.\n       As you know; the National Endowment for Democracy received \n     the first of several awards from the Department of State in \n     February 2004 to support programs carried out by our four \n     core institutes, the International Republican Institute \n     (IRI), the National Democratic Institute (NDI), the Center \n     for International, Private Enterprise (CIPE), and the \n     Solidarity Center. In addition, NED directly funds local \n     Iraqi groups focusing on the promotion of women in the \n     democratic process, strengthening an independent media, and \n     increasing youth participation in the political process. \n     After our September 2006 Board meeting, NED will not be able \n     to maintain its current program in Iraq without renewed \n     funding.\n       Should funding for democracy programs in Iraq be available \n     for the remainder of Fiscal Year 2006 and into Fiscal Year \n     2007, the Endowment will facilitate the development of a \n     nationwide coalition of local groups that crosses geographic, \n     ethnic and confessional lines, which will advocate for \n     political tolerance, accountable governance, rule of law and \n     rational use of national resources. Also, NED will continue \n     to fund CIPE, which has a developed network of over 40 \n     business associations and chambers of commerce. CIPE's \n     program will support Iraqis in building a platform for \n     moderate and market-oriented approaches in Iraq's political \n     process. Further, NED will provide funding to the Solidarity \n     Center to support local Iraqi trade unions in developing \n     policy platforms and advocating for labor legislation, and \n     working with the Iraqi oil unions to develop their capacity \n     to be a force for promoting transparency, anti-corruption, \n     and the rule of law in Iraq's largest economic sector.\n       The Endowment is committed to supporting the Iraqi people \n     in developing a democratic culture and creating institutions \n     that will promote individual rights and freedoms. This will \n     be a long-term endeavor, and we thank you for your continuing \n     support and dedication on this important issue.\n           Sincereely,\n     Vin Weber,\n                                             Chairman of the Board\n     Richard A. Gephardt,\n     Vice-Chair of the Board.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                National Democratic Institute,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 25, 2006.\n     Hon. Edward Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: I am writing to express our deep \n     appreciation for your commitment to long-term democracy \n     building efforts in Iraq. Your leadership in this issue has \n     allowed non-profit organizations such as NDI to continue to \n     help courageous Iraqis struggling for a more democratic and \n     open society. The long-term success of America's efforts in \n     Iraq will ultimately rest on our ability to empower these \n     Iraqis to overcome a long history of isolation, dictatorial \n     rule, and ethnic division.\n       With the support of Congress, the National Endowment for \n     Democracy, USAID, and the Department of State's Bureau for \n     Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, NDI has, since 2003, \n     developed a sizeable program that works to strengthen civil \n     society, political parties, governing-institutions, and \n     women's political participation and leadership. With seven \n     offices throughout the country, NDI employs more than 200 \n     Iraqi program staff and 30 full-time international staff from \n     Canada, Ecuador, Egypt, France, Serbia and the United States. \n     An additional 30 practitioners from the U.S. Canada, Eritrea, \n     the Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom have regularly \n     visited Iraq to share expertise with their Iraqi \n     counterparts.\n       NDI's program works directly with Iraqis almost exclusively \n     outside the Green Zone to build the critical linkages between \n     Iraqi citizens and government that are necessary for long-\n     term legitimacy of, and participation in the country's new \n     democratic system. The Institute has trained more than 6,000 \n     political party and 3,000 women activists, provided best \n     international practices on issues such as federalism and \n     human rights to key Iraqi decision-makers and the \n     Constitutional Drafting Committee, and helped more than 150 \n     nascent NGOs deploy more than 30,000 election monitors for \n     the two national elections and constitutional referendum. \n     Many of the same NGOs have, with NDI support, led town hall \n     meetings for more than 300,000 Iraqis on the new constitution \n     and the workings of the parliament.\n       Building democratic institutions and processes, beyond \n     elections is a long-term proposition. In parts of Eastern \n     European alone, the United States, through organizations such \n     as NDI, continues to be engaged after the region's initial \n     transition 16 years ago. Iraq will likely require an even \n     longer international engagement. With the recent election of \n     the first parliament under a new constitution, the real work \n     in Iraq is just beginning. And, NDI remains committed to the \n     long-term democracy programs needed to meet this challenge.\n       Such a sustained commitment would not be possible without \n     continued U.S. government support; and the leadership and \n     vision that you and your colleagues have shown for ongoing \n     democracy promotion efforts is greatly appreciated by NDI and \n     other organizations involved in Iraq.\n       With best regards.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Kenneth Wollack,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            International Research\n\n\n                                          and Exchanges Board,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 20, 2006.\n                                              Hon. Edward Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: I am writing to thank you for your \n     strong support for democracy assistance in Iraq and your \n     efforts to ensure that this support from the United\n\n[[Page S3948]]\n\n     States continues. IREX, a non-profit organization dedicated \n     to education, civil society, and media, has been working to \n     support Iraq's nascent independent media sector as part of a \n     USAID civil society project--the Iraqi Civil Society and \n     Independent Media Program.\n       We strongly believe that a vibrant and professional \n     independent media sector is crucial to a stable and \n     democratic Iraq. Capable Iraqi individuals and organizations \n     are working with U.S. support and risking their lives for the \n     sake of media freedom, but much work remains to be done. \n     However, our work is slated to end on June 30, 2006 due to \n     lack of funding for democracy initiatives. Key media \n     initiatives and successes supported by the U.S. Government \n     that face closure with an end of U.S. assistance, include:\n       The National Iraqi News Agency (www.ninanews.com), the \n     first independent commercial news agency in the Arab World. \n     After only 7 months, approximately 1500 NINA stories are \n     carried by more than 50 Iraqi media outlets each month. NINA \n     sets a standard of professionalism for the media sector and \n     has survived the effects of two bombings yet carried on its \n     work unimpeded.\n       Iraqis for Public Broadcasting is a group of dedicated \n     civil society and media professionals who have served as a \n     public watchdog to fight government and political \n     interference in the Iraqi Media Network. The group has \n     developed a new public broadcasting law that could help \n     develop IMN into the Arab world's first independent public \n     broadcaster.\n       The Iraqi Media Network, meant to be the public broadcaster \n     for Iraq, has been beset by attempts at political control of \n     its news and public affairs programming. IREX is one of the \n     few organizations that has been able to work inside IMN with \n     its journalism staff, assisting in development of programming \n     on the elections and the constitution, providing citizens a \n     forum for debate. IREX is currently advising IMN on two new \n     programs that will link the different regions of Iraq as a \n     contribution to building a sense of a democratic Iraqi \n     identity spanning ethnic and religious divides.\n       Training and support for journalists and media outlets \n     throughout Iraq will end. The program has provided training \n     to Kurds, Sunnis, Shiias, in many cases bringing the groups \n     together. Women have been a key target for the trainings.\n       We welcome and commend your ongoing commitment to democracy \n     assistance for Iraq, not only independent media development, \n     but also in other key components of democratic development \n     such as civil society, elections, political processes, and \n     labor and business development.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Mark Pomar,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                         IFES,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 13, 2006.\n     Hon. Edward Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: On behalf of IFES and our experts \n     working on election related projects in Iraq, I am writing to \n     thank you for the thought and attention you have devoted to \n     sustaining a steady stream of funding for critical democracy \n     promotion activities in Iraq. As a non-profit organization \n     with an active presence in Iraq, we greatly appreciate your \n     efforts to highlight the democratic needs of the Iraqi people \n     for lawmakers and policymakers alike.\n       As you know, IFES has been involved with the \n     democratization process in Iraq since October 2003 when we \n     first conducted an assessment of the political situation \n     followed by the development of electoral scenarios and cost \n     models for Coalition Provisional Authority. Since September \n     of 2004, IFES has provided technical assistance to the \n     Independent Election Commission of Iraq (IECI), while at the \n     same time providing significant technical and material \n     support for the conduct of three electoral processes in the \n     country as part of the UN-led International Election \n     Technical Assistance Team (TEAT).\n       Helping democratic institutions find the strength and \n     creativity to work in hostile political environments is one \n     of the most difficult tasks in democracy assistance, but it \n     is a task with which we have experience and through which we \n     have achieved notable successes. Going forward, Iraqi \n     election organizers face a number of challenges surrounding \n     the creation of a new and permanent election management body \n     by the Council of Representatives, the design and \n     implementation of a new voter registration system, conduct of \n     local elections in April 2007, and post-election support for \n     possible referenda on the constitution and regional issues. \n     Our work in Iraq, which has merely begun, has given us a \n     unique, firsthand perspective on the post-invasion political \n     and electoral transition in Iraq. It is our strong view that \n     there has never been a more critical time to sustain and \n     strengthen Iraq's democratic process. Continued support for \n     our work after July 1, 2006, when IFES' current programming \n     is set to end, will help to ensure the future of a fair and \n     transparent electoral process in Iraq.\n       Your commitment and engagement on this matter is timely and \n     essential and we commend you for your sustained vision and \n     focus to promote not only our work, but that of other key \n     democracy promotion organizations.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Richard Souderiette,\n                                          President and CEO, IFES.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment, as \nmodified?\n  Hearing none, the question is on agreeing to the amendment, as \nmodified.\n  The amendment (No. 3686), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3688, as Modified\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I understand there is an understanding that we vote at \nnoontime and I have 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the Senator is correct. It is the \nintention the pending amendment be set aside so we can consider Kennedy \namendment No. 3688, as modified, upon which the yeas and nays have been \nordered. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Massachusetts be \nrecognized until the hour of 12 o'clock, at which time we will have a \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. In the 45 seconds remaining, I indicate to the Members \nof the Senate this amendment has the complete support of all the public \nhealth officials and departments virtually across the country; the \npublic health community virtually universally appreciates and \nunderstands the importance of this program. It does also have the \ncomplete support of the first responders. If we want to do something \nthat is going to help to protect our first responders, in public health \nemergencies and with the dangers of a pandemic, this is an amendment to \ndo so.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields the floor.

Madam President, reserving the right to object, I do so \nonly for the purpose of checking to be sure that this is an amendment \nthat has not been made out of order because of the invocation of \ncloture by the Senate.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, if I can respond to my colleague, I have \nbeen told that the amendment is germane under cloture.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

Although it does not appear on our list at the \ndesk, after a review, it appears to be germane.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I say to my friend from Mississippi, I do \nnot plan on speaking to it now. I was instructed to get it in line. I \nwill be back to speak to it. It relates to permanent bases in Iraq and \ncalls for no permanent bases in Iraq.\n  As the Chair says, it is germane, but I do not intend to call it up \nright now.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, continuing to reserve the right to \nobject, it is my understanding this amounts to legislation and may be \nsubject to a point of order. For that reason, authorization of basing \non a permanent basis in a foreign country--it is not an appropriation \nof funds, as I understand it. It is strictly legislation and may very \nwell be subject to a point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Democratic leader.\n\n\n                          House Ethics Reform\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, at the beginning of this year, we found a \nsituation in Washington that was very uncomfortable. The Chair will \nrecall, as all members recall, the majority leader in the House of \nRepresentatives had been convicted, within a period of a year, of three \nethics violations. He was under indictment. For the first time in 135 \nyears, someone in the White House was indicted. The person in charge of \ncontracting, Mr. Safavian, was led away literally in handcuffs as a \nresult of his sweetheart deals with many people, including the infamous \nJack Abramoff.\n  We had many stories written about the K Street Project: If you were a \ntrade association or a business that wanted to hire a Democrat, you had \nto get clearance from the K Street leaders. It was a situation that was \nvery uncomfortable for everyone, as it should have been.\n  The culmination of all of this was learning Duke Cunningham had taken \nmore than $2 million in bribes.\n  I try today to express my opposition and grave disappointment of the \nlobbying and ethics reform bill that the House of Representatives is \nexpected to pass today. This is a bill pushed by the Republican \nleadership in the House. It is simply not much of anything. This House \nreform legislation is another example of the Orwellian world in which \nmy friends in the majority live, I am sorry to say, starting with the \nPresident himself. Whatever he says, believe just the opposite.\n  The Clear Skies bill led to more pollution. The Healthy Forests \nInitiative, clear-cutting the forests, is damaging our forests. The No \nChild Left Behind Act has left millions of children behind. The Budget \nDeficit Reduction Act increases the deficit. And now they are lobbying \nthe Accountability and Transparency Act, which has the potential to \nwipe transparency out of the political process.\n  House Republicans have completely abandoned the idea of reforming \nWashington. Instead, like a wolf in sheep's clothing, they are using \nthe cover of the word ``reform'' to advance blatant partisan changes to \ncampaign finance laws, changes that will hurt Democrats and help \nRepublican candidates in the coming elections.\n  Their approach to reform stands in sharp contrast to what we did on a \nbipartisan basis. About a month ago, Republicans joined Democrats to \npass a lobbying reform bill, an ethics reform bill, the Honest \nGovernment and Open Leadership Act. It was passed by a large margin. \nThe bill was based largely on a bill Democrats introduced the first \nweek of the session. The legislation the Senate passed was not as good \nas the Democratic bill standing alone, but it was an improvement, a \ntremendous improvement over the status quo and imposed needed reforms \nso that Government serves the people, not the special interests. It was \nthe most significant change in lobbying ethics in this country in a \nquarter of a century.\n  Unfortunately, the bipartisan commitment to reform we had in the \nSenate has been completely abandoned in the House. Instead of passing a \nsubstantive smart and tough bill as we did in the Senate, the House \nRepublicans have ignored the wishes of millions of Americans, gutted \nall lobbying ethics reform from their legislation, and instead filled \nit with partisan campaign finance measures that are intended to help \nthem in the coming election.\n  Essentially, they have opened the floodgates so they can pour money \ninto Republican campaigns. The McCain-Feingold legislation that passed \nCongress and was signed by the President was important. It took away \nfrom campaigns corporate money, soft money. It was a reform measure \nthat improved the political process in a significant way.\n  And this McCain-Feingold legislation, if the House measure is allowed \nto become law, will have been corrupted. It seems House Republicans do \nnot believe they can convince the American people to send them back to \nWashington if they play by the rules. So like their old leader, Tom \nDeLay, they are seeking to change the rules in the middle of the game. \nThey are seeking to change the rules to influence the fall election.\n  Here is an example. The House bill aims to disable so-called 527 \ngroups. These are groups that operate independently and apart from the \nparties and bring more people into the political process. They fund \nget-out-the-vote activities and help register voters, among other \nthings.\n\n[[Page S3950]]\n\n  Notably, the House bill would not shut down spending by all \nindependent groups but only certain independent groups. No, the House \nwould leave Republican-leaning 501(c)6)trade associations free to raise \nand spend money, soft money, corporate money, money over and above \nMcCain-Feingold spending limits. That is what this is about.\n  These trade associations, such as Americans For Job Security, spend \nmillions of dollars in ads to help elect Republican candidates. Nearly \nevery Republican Member of the Senate elected last cycle will benefit \nby ads run by this group. Those ads were funded with soft money.\n  If the people who want to change the present campaign financing laws \nwant to do it, let's do it the right way: take a look at everything, \nnot just take out of the blue certain things they may not like such as \nthe 527s.\n  What about these 501(c)(6) organizations? You will not find trade \nassociations, though, mentioned in their bill, in the House bill. That \nmakes no sense. We know less about these Republican groups than we do \nof 527 organizations. That is because 527s are required to disclose \ndonors and how they spend that money. There is no such requirement for \nthese trade associations.\n  Here is another even more significant example of the tricks House \nRepublicans are playing. The House bill repeals the critical limits on \nnational party giving to individual campaigns. Right now, the \nRepublican National Committee may only direct a limited amount of \nfunding to individual congressional and Presidential campaigns \naccording to a specified formula that is in the McCain-Feingold law. \nThe House would do away with these limits.\n  What would that mean? It would mean, instead of the limited amount of \nmoney that is available now, thousands--hundreds of thousands--of \ndollars could be given. It would mean that the Republican National \nCommittee could give unlimited amounts to candidates in this cycle and \nto Presidential candidates in 2008. What we did in McCain-Feingold \nimproved the system. Now, if the RNC can give unlimited amounts to \ncandidates in this cycle and Presidential candidates in 2008, that is \nno small matter when you consider the RNC has roughly $40 million on \nhand right now.\n  This provision made its way into an amendment filed by Senator McCain \non lobbying reform we did in this body, an amendment which would weaken \nthat bill associated with his name. On his behalf, I say he did the \nright thing: He never offered the amendment, never called up the \namendment, and the Senate bill remained clean of such rollbacks.\n  Democrats and Republicans alike have supported these restrictions \nbecause they are critical to protecting our political process from \ncorruption in fact and in appearance. The authors of the last major \nreform bill--Senators McCain and Feingold--in an amicus brief with the \ncourt involving these limits called them ``essential . . . to maintain \nthe public's confidence in the integrity of our political system'' and \n``indispensable to any [campaign finance] regulatory program.'' That is \nwhat they said.\n  Without such limits, the Senators argued that ``the public's faith \nand participation in the political process will continue to decline.'' \nThat also is another quote. Such expenditures, they argued ``create at \nleast the perception that those who donate large sums to political \nparties . . . may enjoy positions of `improper influence.'''\n  These were wise words by Senators McCain and Feingold. I think we all \nshould live by them.\n  In the wake of Abramoff, DeLay, and Cunningham, Americans are looking \nfor us to change course. The House bill will keep us headed in the \nwrong direction. For that reason, Democrats will stand opposed.\n  If there is going to be an attempt to do campaign finance reform \nabove and beyond what was done with McCain-Feingold, then let's do it. \nLet's have committee hearings. Let's have a bill reported to the Senate \nand have a fair debate on what we need to do to clean this up, not just \ntake one particular aspect of it. The Congress must not ignore the \nAmerican people's desire to do a better job in ethics here in \nWashington.\n  In January, when Americans across the country were crying for reform, \nwe took the lead and fundamentally changed the debate on ethics and \nlobbying reform. I think it is commendable--as I have said here on the \nfloor on a number of occasions, Madam President--I think it is \ncommendable that we were able to pass this lobbying reform bill on a \nbipartisan basis. Thanks to our work, on a bipartisan basis, we passed \nsome significant reforms that will ensure the Government of the people \nfocuses on the needs of the people.\n  It would be unfortunate to see these efforts sabotaged and ultimately \nfail because the House majority has backed away from real reform and \ninstead has decided that this legislation should be a vehicle to \nadvance a partisan campaign finance agenda. If the trial of Tom DeLay \nand prison terms for Jack Abramoff and Duke Cunningham do not convince \nthe Republican Party to clean up its act, Americans should begin to \nwonder what will.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would like to ask my good friend, the Democratic \nleader, if his concern here is that the House bill overruled what we \ncall the Colorado II decision in the Supreme Court, which basically \nwould allow political parties which are now restricted to raising 100 \npercent hard money to spend in coordination with the campaigns whatever \nthey choose to spend. Is that the complaint I hear from my good friend, \nthe Democratic leader?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I apologize, through the Chair, to my \nfriend. I do not know what Colorado II is. Is that what you said?\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. What the Supreme Court held in Colorado II was that \nthe prohibition on parties spending above what we call the coordinated \namount remained intact and that parties could spend whatever they \nwanted to as independent expenditures, meaning they could not consult \nwith the campaigns.\n  I was listening to my good friend, the Democratic leader, and I \nunderstand he was decrying a provision in the House bill that, in \neffect, overturned that Supreme Court decision and allowed the parties \nto spend, in coordination with their campaigns, money beyond what is \ncalled the coordinated. And the Senator from Nevada was suggesting that \nwas somehow, I gather, corrupting the process, if that money, which \ncould now be spent independently of the campaigns, was spent in \ncoordination with the campaigns.\n  Did I understand correctly?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, through the Chair to my friend, the senior \nSenator from Kentucky, your explanation of asking me a question points \nout my problem with what the House is doing. I believe what we need is \nto have reform legislation in the House comparable to what we did here \nin the Senate. I think there are a number of us who would like to have \ngone further than what we did, but I would be satisfied with that. But \nfor the House to call this lobbying and ethics reform is wrong. What \nthey have tried to do is reform campaign finance laws.\n  I say to my friend, if we are going to do a reform of campaign \nfinance laws, then what we should do is have the committees of proper \njurisdiction hear what changes they think should be made, with the \nadvocates of this, bring it to the floor, and have a debate.\n  As my friend indicated, talking about Colorado II, this is very \ncomplicated stuff. And I think if we are going to reform a little piece \nof it, let's look at it all. Let's look at how trade associations work. \nLet's look at everything. I am happy to do that. But what I am not \nhappy to do is have the House call something lobbying and ethics reform \nwhen it is campaign finance reform. That is my concern.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, could I ask my friend one further \nquestion?\n  Mr. REID. Of course.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Is it still the position of the leader and the \nmajority of those on that side of the aisle that the position they used \nto hold, which was that these so-called 527 groups should be treated \nlike political parties and therefore have their contributions kept like \na political party--that used to be the position of the majority of the \nDemocrats, that the 527 groups which operate like parties should be \ntreated like parties in terms of the contribution levels--I now gather \nthat my good friend and a number of his colleagues\n\n[[Page S3951]]\n\non that side of the aisle have the opposite position, that somehow to \ntreat a 527 like a political party, and therefore cap contributions \nlike they are to parties, would somehow be a violation of free speech? \nIs that the position now that the Democratic leader is taking?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, every question the distinguished Senator \nfrom Kentucky asked indicates how important it is to have a full, \ncomplete process here in the Senate about campaign finance. Every \nquestion he asks is more complicated than the last. Him asking me how \nthe Democrats stand on this issue is something I cannot answer. These \nseats have changed back and forth since we took up McCain-Feingold.\n  I will say this: Having worked as a candidate prior to the passage of \nMcCain-Feingold and after it passed--as far as I am concerned, what \nhappened in 1998, when I had a very difficult race in Nevada with my \ndear friend, the junior Senator from Nevada, John Ensign, we had a \ntough election, a tough election. But in the little State of Nevada, \nback in 1998, we did not have many people there. We are approaching 3 \nmillion there now. We did not have 2 million then. John Ensign spent \n$10 million; Harry Reid spent $10 million. But the vast majority of the \nmoney was corporate money. People could give us hundreds of thousands \nof dollars. Now, that may not have corrupted John Ensign or corrupted \nHarry Reid, but it is a process that does not look good, and it is \ncorrupting, it could corrupt an individual.\n  Having run in 2004--it was a good election--I went out and raised \nmoney, as I did when I first started in this process. I would go to \nsomebody. They would give me whatever the limits were: $1,000, $2,000. \nThat limit would be printed, and everyone in the world knew what that \nperson did for an occupation, where they lived, how much money they \ngave me. I felt so much better in 2004 than I did in 1998 because I did \nnot have to go around asking people for these corporate donations.\n  I have not talked to my friend, Senator Ensign, but I will bet you he \nagrees with me because I do not think either one of us felt comfortable \nwith those huge corporate contributions that were coming into the State \nof Nevada. The purpose of it: the Republicans ran vicious ads against \nme. He had bad ads that were run against him.\n\n  I think the process is better. If we are going to change the McCain-\nFeingold process, let's do it by looking at everything, not just 527s. \nLet's look at trade associations. Let's look at State parties. Let's \nlook at this PAC situation where we have all these leadership PACs. \nThere are a lot of things we need to look at.\n  But what the House is doing--disguising campaign finance reform as \nlobbying and ethics reform--is wrong. We did not do that here. And I \nthink that speaks well of John McCain. He had an amendment prepared. He \ndid not do it because he knows it would have corrupted McCain-Feingold. \nI would assume that is why he did not offer it. It would have corrupted \nthe legislation we now have that we call McCain-Feingold, which I think \nhas improved the process. I am glad the Supreme Court ruled that it was \nconstitutional.\n  Now, I know my friend, the distinguished majority whip. He did not \nlike McCain-Feingold. He worked very hard against it. He did a good \njob. He is a fine lawyer and a good advocate. He lost. Those of us who \nsupported McCain-Feingold won. And if we are going to change it, let's \nhave another fair fight like we had with McCain-Feingold, where my \nfriend from Kentucky can be on one side, I can be on the other. We may \neven wind up on the same side.\n  But that is what kind of debate we should have, not what is happening \nin the House now, disguising it as lobbying and ethics reform, and \nreally it is not.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, just one final observation with \nregard to this discussion in which the Democratic leader and I have \nbeen engaged. And I am glad he is still on the Senate floor because I \nwould not want to say this with him not being here. I noticed that he \nwas glad the days of large corporate and individual soft money \ndonations were gone from parties. I wish he would be equally offended \nby the fact that large donations are still available for the 527s. What \nis good for the goose is good for the gander.\n  If large contributions--corporate and individual contributions--to \nparties were outlawed because of the, ``corrupting potential'' of that, \nit seems to me entirely inconsistent to argue that they should not be \neliminated from 527s.\n  I think the reason our good friends on the other side of the aisle \nhave had an epiphany about 527s is because they now believe these \nactivities are beneficial to them. So the consistency is something that \nis hard to find in the course of this debate.\n  It will be interesting to see what the final House bill includes. To \nsimply allow political parties to spend money in coordination with the \ncandidates wearing their party label, it is hard to conclude it would \nin any way corrupt the system.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, just one final comment.\n  I believe that if 527s are doing things that are wrong, maybe we need \nto take a look at 527s but in conjunction with all the rest of the \nthings that happen in campaign finance. I have no problem with that--\nbut not 527s alone. If we want to look at trade associations and all \nthe other things, I am happy to do that, but let's not just single shot \none of these because there are a lot of other things that need to be \nlooked at at the same time.\n  The distinguished Senator from Kentucky and I have had longstanding \npersonal discussions off the Senate floor about campaign finance. We \nhave had them on the floor. As I have indicated already, I have the \ngreatest respect for how he feels. He is a real advocate for his \nposition.\n  I try to do the best I can for mine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I had the good fortune early in my \npolitical life to meet and work as an intern for Paul Douglas, a \nSenator from Illinois from 1948 to 1966. He wrote several books about \nethics in government that are still widely quoted. I was fortunate to \nmeet him and then to meet a man who counted him as a mentor, Senator \nPaul Simon. Both inspired me to do a few more things in my public life \nthan I might otherwise have done.\n  For instance, Paul Douglas had a rule in his office for staff that \nthey couldn't take anything they couldn't drink. I assume that meant \nthey could have an expensive drink at some local restaurant, but they \ncertainly couldn't take a meal or a gift or anything like that. He had \na personal rule that he wouldn't take a gift in his office that was \nworth more than $2.50. I can recall some angry constituent who sent \nSenator Paul Douglas a handmade, tooled leather belt with Paul Douglas' \nname on it which he returned. I am sure the donor was offended, but \nthat was his rule. He made complete disclosure of his income and net \nworth, as did Paul Simon. I have tried to follow their example.\n  We need meaningful ethics reform, but I agree with Senator Reid that \nwe also need to have a serious conversation about campaign financing. \nThey are related issues, but they are not the same. The issue we \ndecided to vote on in the Senate on lobbying and ethics reform was \ntimely and important. We know what happened. Mr. Jack Abramoff created \na scandal across Washington with the excesses in which he was involved. \nHe has pled guilty on some and is working with the Government, and \nthere may be further indictments and convictions as a result. At least \none Member of the House, Tom DeLay of Texas, was indicted and \nultimately resigned before his trial. Others in both political parties \nare under suspicion.\n  Neither political party has a monopoly on virtue. I know honest and \nhard-working people on both sides of the aisle. We should do our level \nbest to restore the confidence of America in the process and the people \nwho participate in it.\n  The effort now by some House Republicans to inject campaign finance \nreform into this is a poison pill. They know if they can complicate the \nissue, ultimately nothing will happen. We would like to see our \nconference strictly set on lobbying and ethics reform.\n\n[[Page S3952]]\n\n  My personal feeling--and it may only be mine; maybe a few others \nshare it--is that when it comes to campaign financing, we need to do \nsomething dramatic, something that States have already proven can make \na significant difference. I am talking about public financing. I didn't \ncome to this idea quickly. In fact, I didn't like the idea when I was \nfirst elected. I thought it was unconscionable that somehow we would \ncreate a system of public financing that would finance some of the \nstrange and extreme candidates who appear from time to time. But I have \ncome to realize that unless and until we make a significant change in \nthe way we finance campaigns, we are not going to restore the integrity \nof this institution and others. We are not going to restore the \nconfidence of the American people.\n  It is dangerous to walk the streets around the Capitol because of all \nthe traffic, all the visitors. It is even more dangerous during the \ncourse of the day as Members of the House and Senate race to their \nparty headquarter buildings to make fundraising telephone calls, which \nwe have to do; it is the only way to raise the funds so that people of \nmodest means have a chance to compete in the campaign arena. It takes \nmore and more of our time and more time away from what we should be \ndoing on the floors of our respective Chambers. Public financing is an \nappropriate way to address that. If we did it on a comprehensive basis, \nwe could have genuine reform.\n  Senator Reid of Nevada has said that is a worthy goal, campaign \nfinance reform, but let's do it the right way, not have something \nparachuted into the conference committee by House Republicans as a \npoison pill to real ethics reform. I will do everything I can to defeat \nwhat is so-called ethics reform out of the House that does little or \nnothing to clean up our act on Capitol Hill and tries to inject a \nclearly political issue into this debate. We need to pass the kind of \nreform that will restore confidence. Complicating it with campaign \nfinance reform is not the way to do it at this moment.\n  Let's do it the right way. Let's have hearings, deadlines. Let's \ncreate a bill. I would like to join with other Senators, perhaps from \nboth sides of the aisle, to make sure public financing is part of the \ndebate.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, some housekeeping items have been cleared \non both sides.\n\n\n          Amendment Nos. 3618, 3619, 3714, and 3716, withdrawn\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to withdraw amendment No. 3618, the subject \nof which was addressed by division II of Coburn amendment No. 3641.\n  I also ask unanimous consent to withdraw amendments numbered 3619, \n3714, and 3716.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3855\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the second-degree \namendment of the Senator from Delaware to his first-degree amendment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I think we are ready to proceed to agree to that on a \nvoice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate on that \namendment, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3855) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is now on agreeing to the \nunderlying amendment, as amended.\n  The amendment (No. 3717), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we continue to make good progress. We \nhope to complete action either this evening or tomorrow on the bill. It \ncould be, in consultation with the leader, possible to complete action \non the bill today and have a vote on final passage tomorrow if we are \ngoing to go a little late this evening, but we don't anticipate a late \nevening. We hope to be able to adjourn at a reasonable hour. With the \ncooperation of Senators, we can do that.\n  We have cloture, which has been invoked, which limits amendments for \nconsideration to germane amendments. We have entered into colloquies \nand we think some of these amendments are going to be withdrawn. We \nhope if Senators have an intention of disposing of their amendments, if \nthey want a vote, now is a good time to come to the floor and make that \nrequest known. We can dispose of those amendments.\n  We urge the cooperation of Senators, and if we get to some point, we \nmay offer amendments for Senators, if they are in order and pending and \nhave not yet been called up. As a matter of notice, we intend to press \nahead and complete action on the bill within a reasonable time. And we \nwill, with the cooperation of all Senators.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I will take just a moment of the Senate's \ntime to thank a few people who worked hard to put together a colloquy. \nThis is a very important conversation between three Senators that deals \nwith the critical issue of the health of our soldiers who are coming \nback from combat. So I will read this for the Record.\n  This colloquy is about a Comprehensive Casualty Care Center at the \nSan Diego Naval Medical Center, and this is the colloquy. It starts off \nwith myself saying:\n\n       I would like to thank the Senator from Alaska and the \n     Senator from Hawaii for their outstanding leadership on this \n     bill and especially for their commitment to providing care \n     for our Nation's combat-wounded servicemembers.\n       I understand that I have a commitment from both Senators \n     that they will work to ensure that $6.2 million in funding is \n     included in this bill for the establishment of a \n     Comprehensive Combat Casualty Care Center at the San Diego \n     Naval Medical Center.\n       This vitally important funding will ensure that for the \n     first time, combat-wounded servicemembers from the West \n     Coast--who have endured approximately 25 percent of all \n     casualties--will be able to receive treatment and recover \n     from their wounds closer to their home.\n       Since many of the most severely wounded require months of \n     treatment and rehabilitation, this will alleviate significant \n     hardship on our servicemembers and their families. No longer \n     will they have to travel to Texas or to the East Coast for \n     treatment.\n       This ``West Coast Walter Reed'' will be able to treat \n     approximately 200 patients per year, including 160 nonamputee \n     patients and 40 to 50 amputee patients. While I lament that \n     even one more servicemember will be wounded in combat, I look \n     forward to opening the center and to working with the Navy to \n     ensure that our servicemembers are afforded the very best \n     possible medical care.\n\n  That concludes my portion of this colloquy. I have been working with \nthe Navy on this matter since they explained to us that so many of our \nwest coast families have to be trekked all the way to the east coast \nfor rehabilitation for these very severe injuries. The rehab is very \nintensive, and the whole family really needs to be included and \ninvolved in it. So now it is going to be so much easier for these \nactive military from the State of Washington, from the State of Oregon, \nand I believe from Alaska, Hawaii, and even some other States such as \nNevada that are east of California, to be able to avail themselves of \nthe best treatment. I believe the Navy has been so focused on this that \ntheir dreams are becoming a reality. They are going to serve the \nmilitary from all the various branches who get injured. It isn't just \nfor the\n\n[[Page S3953]]\n\nNavy; it is for everyone who gets injured in a severe way and needs \nthis extended rehabilitation.\n  So Senator Stevens, at the end of my remarks, said:\n\n       The Senator from California is correct. She has my \n     commitment that I will work in conference to ensure that \n     these funds are provided for the Comprehensive Combat \n     Casualty Care Center.\n\n  Senator Inouye then said:\n\n       I too support the Senator's request. She has my commitment \n     that I will do my best to ensure funding is included in \n     conference.\n\n  I believe, after speaking with them--and I have spoken to Senators \nMurray and Cochran about this--that this is something that just cries \nout for funding because our people are hurting, and it doesn't help \nthem to be separated from their families and to have to make the trek \nacross the country to learn how to live with these very disabling \ninjuries. So we pray that the war will end soon. We pray that our \nsoldiers will be coming home soon. I myself am working to see that we \ncan begin redeploying troops immediately.\n  I think as the Iraqis move forward, this is a year of major \ntransition, and they need to prove that they want freedom as much as we \nwant it for them. They now have their government getting into place, \nand I would like to see the end of these casualties. I know we all feel \nthat way. But we have to also be realistic in that we have to serve \nthose who are continuing to come back in great need of this kind of \nhelp.\n  So, again, I hope all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nwill support this effort. I look forward to working with all of you so \nthat we can tell the Navy that their hopes and dreams for this \nComprehensive Combat Casualty Care Center in San Diego at the Naval \nMedical Center, will, in fact, be a reality. The $6 million we need is \na very small amount when you look at the overall size and scope of this \nparticular bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3616\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3616 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment would strike $74.5 million \nfor grants to States based on their production of certain types of \ncrops, livestock, and dairy products, which were not included in the \nadministration's emergency supplemental request.\n  Let me point out again a statement of administration policy where it \nsays:\n\n       The administration is seriously concerned at the overall \n     funding level and the numerous unrequested items included in \n     the Senate bill that are unrelated to the war or emergency \n     hurricane relief needs.\n\n  Obviously, this and others have been put into this bill in a very \nunacceptable fashion. It has been a longstanding policy in the Senate \nto prohibit the practice of adding authorizing language to an \nappropriations bill. Nevertheless, this bill includes a massive $3.94 \nbillion agricultural assistance program. None of this funding under \nthis agricultural title is included in the administration's \nsupplemental request.\n  Interestingly, this nearly $4 billion add-on, title III of the \nunderlying bill--remember, this is a $4 billion add-on--received a one-\nparagraph mention in the entire committee report accompanying the bill; \none paragraph to describe 31 pages of legislative language with a $4 \nbillion price tag.\n  Let me read it for the benefit of my colleagues.\n\n       The committee recommends $3.944 billion for emergency \n     agriculture disaster assistance. These funds will help \n     farmers and ranchers in States affected by recent hurricanes, \n     drought, flood, wildfire and other natural disasters recover \n     from resulting production losses. These funds will also \n     assist in the removal of debris from watersheds in order to \n     minimize the threat of flooding from future storm events. In \n     addition, the funds will provide economic assistance to \n     producers to compensate for high energy costs relating to \n     agricultural production.\n\n  That last sentence is interesting. This will help farmers who have \nhigh energy costs related to agricultural production. I wonder what we \nare doing for the airlines, the trains, the American automobile owner, \nany other industry in America. We aren't doing anything for them in \nthis emergency supplemental, but we are going to give the farmers \nnearly $4 billion additional.\n  I am all for helping the appropriate farmers and other victims \nbattered by hurricanes, but the agricultural assistance added in this \nbill is far more expansive than merely offering to help areas hit by \nthe 2005 hurricanes, and at least the limited report language doesn't \nhide that fact. As my colleagues know, the USDA currently has a range \nof disaster assistance programs, including crop insurance programs, \nthat are already available. Yet this bill is going to add nearly $4 \nbillion on top of the existing programs. In my view, the agricultural \nassistance funding is being used more as a vehicle to fill a voter wish \nlist than it is to meet the urgent needs of the victims of the 2005 \nhurricane season. Taxpayer dollars are being allocated for agricultural \nsubsidies and bailouts which in some cases have nothing to do with \nhurricane recovery.\n  This recovery would strike an earmark which provides $74.5 million in \nagricultural assistance for grants to States, based not on the \nhurricane damage, not on any emergency, but based on their production \nof ``specialty of crops, livestock and dairy products.''\n  Why is this necessary? Have the hurricanes wiped out the specialty \ncrop industry? What even is a specialty crop, and why does it need \n$74.5 million of taxpayer funding? I hope that a specialty crop is a \nmoney tree because that is what is going to be needed to pay for this \nbill.\n  My colleagues may be interested to know that the bill defines \nspecialty crops as anything but wheat, feedgrains, oilseeds, cotton, \nrice or peanuts--anything but. Why do we exclude those commodities from \nreceiving this funding? Is sugarcane made ineligible? Are my colleagues \naware that the USDA already has a specialty crop block grant program \nwhich was authorized in 2004? Under the existing program, specialty \ncrops are defined as fruits, vegetables, tree nuts, dried fruits, and \nnursery crops including floriculture. The program is funded at $17 \nmillion for the current fiscal year, and it provides for $100,000 for \neach State that applies. Is there a problem with that program that I am \nnot aware of that gives it just cause to providing it with an emergency \nsupplemental appropriation to the tune of more than 1,000 percent above \nits annual appropriation?\n  This bill provides $74.5 million that is to be used to award grants \nbased on ``the share of each State's total value of specialty crop, \nlivestock, and dairy production of the United States for the 2004 crop-\nyear, multiplied by $74.5 million. That means the more you produce, if \nyour crops have not been hit by a natural disaster or flooding \nor drought, the more money you get. That is the polar opposite of what \nthe USDA disaster assistance programs are about.\n\n  Doesn't that fly in the face of what an emergency supplemental is \nfor? An emergency supplemental is supposed to be about addressing needs \nand not about providing rewards for productivity. More importantly, why \nis what obviously is designed to be a nationwide agricultural funding \nassistance program, a program not requested by the administration, \nsingled out in the statement of administration policy as objectionable, \nbeing included in a must-pass emergency spending bill that is supposed \nto address the global war on terror and hurricane recovery?\n  My colleagues may be interested to know that under this legislation, \nStates can use the grant to ``promote the purchase, sale or consumption \nof agricultural products.''\n  I am not making this up. I am not making this up. Under this \nemergency supplemental bill, States can use the grant to ``promote the \npurchase, sale, or consumption of agricultural products.'' Last week, I \nmentioned that Federal dollars had been used to paint\n\n[[Page S3954]]\n\nsalmon on airplanes. Maybe that $74.5 million will be used to paint \nvegetables on airplanes or maybe a pretty flower.\n  Upon closer reading of the legislative language, I notice that the \nbill actually creates a $100 million program for specialty crops. In \naddition to the $74.5 million that this amendment addresses, it \nprovides for $25.5 million to make grants to ``the several States, the \nDistrict of Columbia and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, to be used to \nsupport activities that promote agriculture.''\n  I would like to repeat that for my colleagues: ``$25.5 million to \nmake grants to the several States, the District of Columbia. . . .''\n  I admire and respect the District of Columbia enormously. I know of \nno agricultural enterprise--well, maybe an illegal one, but I never \nknew of an agricultural enterprise in the District of Columbia. But \nthey are going to be eligible for grants to be used to ``support \nactivities that promote agriculture.'' As I say, I am not making this \nup.\n  I hope the sponsors of the legislation will correct me if I am wrong. \nI would like to be corrected if I am wrong. I am confident they will. \nBut it appears that with respect to the $25.5 million funding, the bill \nprovides that all 50 States will each receive $500,000 of that money, \nwhile Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia each will receive \n$250,000. What specialty crops are grown in the District of Columbia? \nWhat specialty crops are grown here? What kind of campaign should we \nexpect?\n  The funding is not needed. It should be noted that, according to OMB, \n``In 2005, many crops had record or near record production, and the \nU.S. farm sector cash receipts were second highest ever.'' Can an \nunrequested $74.4 million grant program truly be sold as an urgent \nemergency spending needed at this time? I know my colleagues have the \nhighest hopes for the success and safety of our troops and for the \nspeedy recovery of the hurricane-ravaged gulf. But when the American \npeople hear of these special interest riders, they are going to \nquestion their priorities, and rightly so.\n  Again, I would like to refer to this poll. A 39-percent plurality of \nAmericans, in a poll the day before yesterday, say the single most \nimportant thing for Congress to accomplish this year is curtailing \nbudgetary earmarks benefiting only certain constituents. This amendment \ncertainly fits that concern that Americans have.\n  I was going to come back and talk before we voted on this bill. I am \nsure this amendment will be voted down, again, because others have that \nare similarly outrageous. But I want to say, we are sending a very bad \nmessage to the American people. I saw recent polls showing our approval \nrating at around 22 percent. I am glad to see that there are now some \ncandidates who are running for office against pork barrel projects and \nearmarks and museums, taking that out of highway funds.\n  They are sick and tired of seeing their children's futures mortgaged \nby this rampant, out-of-control spending.\n  I will vote against this bill. When the President vetoes it, which I \nam reasonably confident he will, I will vote to sustain his veto.\n  I believe that once the President vetoes this bill, the American \npeople will strongly support that veto and that the American people \nwill demand that we bring some kind of sanity to this system where, in \nthe name of recovery from hurricane damage, and in the name of funding \nthe war in Iraq, we spend billions--not millions, not hundreds of \nmillions but billions--on unwanted and unnecessary products.\n  I want to assure my colleagues that I will support anything to help \nrepair the damage caused by the hurricanes. I will do what is necessary \nto spend my taxpayers' dollars to fight and win the war in Iraq, which \nI still strongly believe is a noble cause, but I cannot go back to my \nconstituents in Arizona and say that this is anything but a shameful \nexercise we are engaged in by taking their tax dollars in the name of \nan emergency and spending them on those projects, many of which we have \ndiscussed and debated at some length.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, there are some Senators who are in a \nmeeting with the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State. We \nare not going to go to a vote right now because of that conflict with \nsome Senators. But we have an opportunity for those who want to speak \non this amendment or any other pending amendment that has not been \nadequately discussed at this point.\n  Let me say with regard to the amendment of the Senator from Arizona \nthat I can remember in my State time and time again when we have had \nsevere weather disasters; wet-weather-related disasters. The pecan \ngrowers, in particular, would inevitably have a difficult time making a \ncase for the losses they sustained when Federal disasters have been \ndeclared and eligibility for Federal assistance had been promised \nbecause it is not the kind of program crop, so-called, such as cotton, \nrice, wheat, corn, that are traditionally supported by Federal \nprograms.\n  It almost takes someone at the local level who understands yield, \nproduction, and how records are kept where the State governments are \nmuch better situated in those States to have knowledge and \nunderstanding of the crops and of the values of trees and the crops \nthey produce. Peaches is another example. In my part of Mississippi \nwhere I grew up, we had a good many peach orchards. We had a good many \npecan orchards. And those who live in the rural areas of our State \ntraditionally depend upon these crops to help sustain them.\n  We are talking about not the kind of agriculture that produces \nmillions of dollars of income but small amounts of income to supplement \nfamily needs. Workers in the area can move from orchard to orchard \nvolunteering to help harvest these crops.\n  I can remember as a young boy my grandparents who lived near Utica, \nMS, would traditionally kind of let the word go throughout the \ncommunity that they were going to be picking up pecans on a certain \nday. And some of the workers would come and pick up pecans and in \npayment would get part of the pecans. They would get a part of the \nharvest. That was the payment. Money was short.\n  We are not talking about wealthy landowners. We are talking about \nsubsistence production in many cases which will qualify for the \nbenefits under this title. If this amendment is approved, they won't \nget anything.\n  These funds are going to the States so that at the local level a \ndetermination can be made as to the amount of compensation and support \nthose who are disaster victims in these areas of agriculture are \nentitled to receive.\n  I am hopeful the Senate will reject this amendment. I just spoke to \ntwo parts of it--orchards and the pecan trees--because from my personal \nexperience I know a little bit about that.\n  But driving through my State after these disasters, I can testify to \nthe widespread damage to orchards, to pine forests on which people \ndepend for their livelihood.\n  In that part of the State where the storm's destruction was the \ngreatest, there is very little of the traditional large cotton \nplantation areas. That is not that part of the State. That would be up \nin the mid to northern part of the State along the Mississippi Delta. \nThat is where the heavy production of cotton is. It may be up in the \nprairie area of northeast Mississippi and north central Mississippi.\n  Where this storm's destruction was the heaviest, there are a lot of \npeople who lost pecan orchards, trees, or peach orchards.\n  Dairy farms were seriously damaged, and dairy is included in this \npart of the title. Beef cattle production and those things that are \ngrown to sustain those herds of cattle and to feed them were damaged \nseverely.\n  I am hopeful the Senate will understand that this is not something \nthat the committee made up, either. I am not making this up. These are \nthe facts as I saw them and that I can say to the Senate justify the \ninclusion of these funds in this bill.\n  I urge the Senate to reject the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to join the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee to oppose the amendment that has just been \noffered. Our\n\n[[Page S3955]]\n\nspecialty crop producers are confronted with a number of challenges \nthat threaten their viability and in some cases their ability to \nsurvive. It is no secret that my State of Washington is a major \nspecialty crop State. We, in fact, rank No. 1 in the Nation in the \nproduction of a number of specialty crops--from apples to pears to \ncherries to raspberries to concord grapes, just to name a few of them, \nwith 250 other fruits and vegetables produced in Washington State. The \nspecialty crop industry represents a large segment of the agricultural \ncommodities which serve the economic backbone of my State and many \nothers.\n  Unlike row crops such as corn, soybeans, cotton, there is virtually \nno support by the USDA for these fruits, and vegetable producers do not \nhave access to crop insurance for their crops. Specialty crop producers \nhave been hurt as the chairman of the committee enunciated.\n  There has been a lot more--from fires and droughts, hailstorms, and \nwind. Our fruit and vegetable producers have faced some major \nchallenges during the last two years. These same industries have been \nvery hurt--and in some cases decimated--by the inflow of specialty \ncrops from overseas, as well as a lack of access to labor and pests and \ndiseases.\n  I believe there is a need to make the commitment to help growers in \nall of our States and provide them with the assistance they desperately \nneed.\n  Many Americans don't realize that specialty crops represent 51 \npercent of all farm cash receipts in the United States. That is more \nthan $41 billion in annual farm value.\n  Although our fruit and vegetable industry is large, it is not larger \nthan other commodities. They have access to relatively little of the \noverall agricultural disaster programs.\n  The section 32 grants to States to help specialty crops will help our \nfruit and vegetable producers survive these difficult conditions. \nWhether this is supporting research which is important, or promotion or \nmarketing that is critical, these funds will help our fruit and \nvegetable farmers in business in every single State.\n  I think everyone in the Senate knows that the United States should \nproduce as much domestic food product as it can. And the $75 million \nthat is targeted by this McCain amendment to help keep our fruit and \nvegetable producers in business is simply a modest investment, and it \nis a commitment to keep our farmers in business in very difficult and \nchallenging times.\n  I urge my colleagues to make the commitment to support the specialty \ncrop farms and the farmers and the families who depend on it, and I \nurge them to vote against the McCain amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3728\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \nbusiness be temporarily set aside and that we call up amendment No. \n3728 for consideration, which has been ruled germane.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Vitter], for himself, and \n     Ms. Landrieu, proposes an amendment numbered 3728.\n\n  Mr. VITTER.

I \nwill not speak to it again. I will simply underscore several things.\n  First of all, Senator Landrieu joins me in presenting this amendment \nwhich goes to the essential levee and hurricane protection needs of the \ngreater New Orleans area.\n  Second, the entire amendment is offset. So this amendment does not \nincrease the spending in the bill by any amount--not one single penny.\n  Third, we believe this amendment is very important to make sure that \nthere are adequate funds for the essential levee hurricane protection \nwork which is at the heart of this bill.\n  We have many debates about what is at the periphery, but this type of \nwork is at the heart of this bill, and, of course, the President and \nhis leadership have made that clear.\n  Again, I went into the details of this amendment yesterday. I won't \ngo into them again. But I certainly hope in light of the fact that this \namendment does not increase the cost of the bill, the Senate can come \ntogether and support Senator Landrieu and myself in passing this very \nimportant amendment to ensure that the vital work going on right now \nbuilding up to the next hurricane season which starts in June can be \ndone, and that all necessary moneys are there for all those important \ncategories of work.\n  I believe my colleague from Louisiana would like to say a few words \nin support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n\n[[Page S3957]]\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Louisiana. It \nhas been a pleasure to work with him, and of course the leadership of \nthe committee.\n  As the Senator has pointed out, it does not add any money to the \nunderlying bill, but it makes clear that there are four additional \nprojects that are very crucial to the comprehensive repairs that are \ngoing on in the greater metropolitan area that simply need to be \nincluded. That is really the essence of this amendment.\n  It does not add any money to the bill. It does not authorize anything \noutside the scope. It has been ruled germane.\n  I again want to not only thank him for his good work but also \nacknowledge the leadership of the administration which has in the past \nfew weeks come forward in terms of stepping up their leadership on this \nlevee repair and how crucial it is to our area.\n  I commend the administration for their support of the underlying bill \nwhich is very substantial.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, in closing, I would also say that this \namendment has been cleared by the majority and minority managers of the \nbill.\n  With that, I ask for a rollcall vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The yeas and nays are \nrequested.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears not to be a sufficient second.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I rise to simply advise the Senator that \nI am told by staff that the authorizing committee has some concerns \nwith the amendment and would oppose proceeding to a vote on the \namendment at this time without the opportunity of discussing it with \nother Senators.\n  That is the reason I didn't raise my hand to authorize the yeas and \nnays. I have no objection to the yeas and nays being ordered, but I \ndidn't want us to proceed to a vote without the benefit of the advice \nand counsel of the legislative committee that sent word they have some \nconcerns about the amendment. I don't know what the concerns are.\n  As I reminded the Senate a moment ago, there is a meeting with the \nSecretary of Defense and Secretary of State. Some Senators are at that \nmeeting and I don't want to unnecessarily infringe on their interests \nby having a recorded vote as they are meeting on subjects of this \nlegislation. This is a bill that funds the Department of Defense and \nthe Department of State with supplemental appropriations to help pay \nfor ongoing activities in the Middle East. This is a very important \nsubject for Senators to understand at this particular time.\n  I am sympathetic to their situation and think they should be able to \nquestion the Secretaries about the use of funds in this bill and the \ngeneral situation in the area where we are fighting the war on terror \nand trying to protect the security interests of our country.\n  Having said all of that, I don't want to slow down the Senate's \nconsideration of legislation, but I hope we would not proceed to a vote \non either the McCain amendment at this time or the Vitter amendment. We \ncan wait until a little later. We will be on the bill for the balance \nof the afternoon. We hope to complete action on the bill at least by \ntomorrow morning. We appreciate the cooperation of all Senators and \nparticularly those who are helping identify things that need to be \naddressed in this bill because of the devastating disasters that \noccurred in the southeast and the gulf coast region. They need the \nmoney now. We are not trying to slow down the action on the bill. We \nwill not do that.\n  I thank the Senators from Louisiana for understanding and hope they \nwill not push for a vote right now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. If I could respond to the suggestions of the \ndistinguished chairman through the Chair, I have no objection to \nscheduling this vote later in the day. I have been in a lot of contact \nwith the authorizing committee, its leadership and its staff. I will \ncontinue to be in contact with them about issues contained in this \namendment. I have no objection to proceeding to a vote later in the \nday.\n  I do wish to restate my call for a rollcall vote. I would be \nperfectly amenable to any unanimous consent order to schedule the vote \nlater in the day as long as that vote is assured.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been requested.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears not to be a sufficient second.\n  The senior Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I suggest to my colleague--and the chairman has been so \nhelpful on all of the amendments--would it be possible through the \nChair to request a specific time, or would the recommendation be to set \nthis aside and come back to it at a later time? We have been working \nfor quite some time on this. Would the Chair wish to set a time or \nshould we think about setting it aside and coming back at a later date? \nWe do not want to disrupt the proceedings taking place, as the Senator \noutlined.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I understand the chairman and the ranking \nmember have already accepted my amendment. I will speak to it very \nbriefly.\n  The amendment they have accepted is straightforward, clear, and \nsimple. It affirms that the United States will not seek to establish \npermanent military bases in Iraq and has no intention of attempting to \ncontrol Iraqi oil.\n  I know that is self-evident. We all know that. We know that is not \nour intention. The fact is, it is urban legend in Iraq, and our enemies \nin Iraq are using it as a rationale for continued opposition to the \nUnited States of America.\n  The Senate Appropriations Committee, in its report on the bill we are \nconsidering, noted:\n\n       It's the current policy of the United States to establish \n     no permanent military bases in Iraq.\n\n  I commend the committee for this important finding. It is an \nimportant message, as I said, to say not only to the Iraqis but the \nwhole world. The administration policy has been less clear thus far, so \nhopefully it will be useful to the administration.\n  I am sure the American Ambassador to Iraq understands the importance \nof the issue. In March he told Iraqi television stations that the \nUnited States has ``no goal in establishing permanent bases in Iraq.'' \nBut, unfortunately, the Ambassador's statement has been clouded by \nmixed messages from senior administration officials in Washington.\n  To my knowledge, the President has never explicitly stated that we \nwill not establish permanent bases in Iraq.\n  On February 17, 2005, Secretary Rumsfeld told the Committee on Armed \nServices:\n\n       We have no intention, at the present time, of putting \n     permanent bases in Iraq.\n\n  ``At the present time'' caused a stir.\n  According to a recent survey, 88 percent of Sunni Arabs in Iraq \napprove of attacks on American forces in part because they are \nconvinced that the Secretary's statement means that we do \nhave eventually a desire to have a permanent base in Iraq.\n\n  On February 15, 2006, at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nhearing, my friend, the Senator from Massachusetts, asked Secretary \nRice:\n\n       Is it, in fact, the policy of the administration not to \n     have permanent bases in Iraq?\n\n  Rather than answering the simple one word, ``Yes,'' Secretary Rice \nsaid during a 400-word exchange on the question:\n\n       I don't want to in this forum try to prejudice everything \n     that might happen way into the future.\n\n  Not a very reassuring message to our friends in Iraq. These mixed \nmessages are confusing also to the American people.\n  But here is the most troubling thing. They make it more dangerous for \nour armed services, our men and women in Iraq on the ground. General \nGeorge Casey, the ground force commander in Iraq, told the Committee on \nArmed Services last September:\n  Increased coalition presence feeds the notion of occupation.\n  According to an opinion poll conducted by a the Program on \nInternational Policy Attitudes from the\n\n[[Page S3958]]\n\nUniversity of Maryland in January 2006, 80 percent of the Iraqis \nbelieve we do have plans to establish permanent military bases. And an \nastounding 92 percent of the Sunni Arabs believe this to be true.\n  These widespread suspicions contribute to the violence against \nAmerican military personnel in Iraq, in my view. Why do Iraqis believe \nwe want permanent bases? Why do they think we should subject ourselves \nto the enormous ongoing costs in Iraq? Do they think we want their \nsand? No, I think they think we want their oil.\n  According to a 2004 Pew Charitable Trust international survey on the \nAmerican invasion of Iraq, all four Muslim states surveyed, including \nTurkey, Pakistan, Jordan, and Morocco, expressed overwhelming suspicion \nabout the stated reasons for America's invasion of Iraq. Majorities in \neach of the countries believe that control of Mideast oil was an \nimportant factor in our invasion.\n  If you believe, as I do, that we need a regional strategy in Iraq to \ntackle growing sectarianism, allaying these suspicions is critical. It \nis critical to winning the battle for the hearts and minds of 1.2 \nbillion Muslims in the world.\n  Those who have been to Iraq, as I have--and I know the men and women \nin the Senate have--everyone here knows these rumors to be unfounded, \nto be untrue. It is not our intention to control their oil. It also is \nnot who we are.\n  However, that is not what the people of the Muslim world think. \nBefore we quickly dismiss these fears as ludicrous, remember what the \nIraqis have been through in three decades: Three wars and a tyrannical \nregime that turned paranoia into a way of life, turned neighbor against \nneighbor, friend against friend, brother against brother.\n  And remember the longer history of Iraq in the region which is \ningrained in the Iraqi psyche: 400 years of British and Ottoman \noccupation have, to put it mildly, led to certain suspicions about \nforeign presence.\n  As CENTCOM Commander GEN John Abizaid testified before the Committee \non Armed Services last September:\n\n       We must make clear to the people of the region we have no \n     designs on their territory or resources.\n\n  The amendment of mine that has been accepted will have no detrimental \neffect on the military operations of our Armed Forces in Iraq or their \nability to provide security for Iraqi oil infrastructure.\n  The U.N. Council Resolution 1546 recognizes that the American and \ncoalition forces are present in Iraq at the invitation of the Iraqi \nGovernment and that their operations are essential to Iraq's political, \neconomic, and social well-being.\n  We are anxious for the day when Iraqis can take control of their own \ndestiny, but the Iraqis are suspicious of our intentions and growing \nincreasingly impatient. I have no illusions that a single amendment \nwill somehow change the dynamics of events on the ground, but I believe \nwe have a duty to proclaim and demonstrate through our deeds that we \nhave no intention whatever of either maintaining permanent Iraqi \nmilitary bases or controlling Iraqi oil.\n  If I may, I suggest what I proposed this past weekend, a third way on \ndealing with Iraq. Right now, we have basically two alternatives. The \nadministration has a plan as to how not to lose but not one on how to \nwin. Some of my friends in both parties believe the answer is to figure \nout how quickly we can pull out our forces. I want our forces out, but \nI also want to leave behind a stable Iraq so we need not go back in \nagain.\n  Toward that end, I laid out a proposal. I want to make absolutely \nclear what it is not. It is not a proposal to partition Iraq. As a \nmatter of fact, I respectfully suggest that the proposal I have laid \nout, and signed on by Les Gelb and others, is, in fact, the only way to \navoid the partitioning of Iraq.\n  My fellow colleagues, we have gone from the major threat in Iraq \nbeing the insurgency to the major threat in Iraq being sectarian \nviolence and a civil war. If you read the major press on Sunday, both \nthe Washington Post and the New York Times have articles from well-\nrespected reporters on the ground in Iraq saying that the nation is \ndangerously careening toward partition.\n  My proposal is designed to avoid partitioning. I believe, in order to \nbe able to keep Iraq together and as a united government 5 years from \nnow, we must give them breathing room now--breathing room now. The fact \nof the matter is, there is no plan on the administration's radar or \nanyone else's, for that matter, to deal with disbanding the militia or \nintegrating the militia into the Iraqi military.\n  And, right now, a unity government--which is a necessary precondition \nfor what I am talking about--a unity government, without a plan as to \nhow to keep the Sunnis in the game, is one that is destined for \nfailure.\n  We have had two unity governments already, and they have gotten us, \nquite frankly, nowhere. What makes anyone think because you no longer \nhave Ibrahim al-Jaafari, who was disliked by the rest of non-Shiite \nIraq, as prime minister that somehow the Sunnis are going to embrace a \nhighly centralized Government, politically controlled by the Shia, and \nwithout any Sunni access to resources, and nothing being done about the \ndeath squads and the militia coming out of the Sadr camp and the Badr \nbrigade, which has been trained, in part, by the Iranians? They are not \nlikely to sign on.\n  So the proposal I have laid out, which I will not bore my colleagues \nwith in detail, but I will submit for the Record, the proposal I have \nlaid out has five parts. I came to those conclusions based upon the \nfollowing assessment: Nothing I propose is in any way contradictory to \nthe existing Iraqi Constitution. Let me remind all my colleagues that \nthe Iraqi Constitution, voted on last year by the Iraqi people, calls \nfor the establishment--after a general election, which took place on \nDecember 15--of an Iraqi Government.\n  Once the Iraqi Government is established--and it must be established, \nnow, by May 20--the Parliament will meet. The Iraqi Parliament will \nmeet, and they will appoint a committee to make recommendations on \namendments to the Constitution.\n  This process was made available because of the hard work of our \nAmbassador to Iraq. When they voted on the Constitution, you may \nremember, at the last minute, to save the deal, Zal was able to go out \nand get the following caveat put into their Constitution: that it was \nstill able to be amended, particularly as it related to regionalism.\n  For the Sunnis feared, above all, that you would have these two \nautonomous provinces with all the oil--north and south--and they would \nbe left without any resources in the middle and at the mercy of those \ntwo regions. That is why the present Constitution in Iraq calls for the \npossibility of amendment. And the amendments the administration has \nbeen calling for, I have been calling for, and everyone else, are \namendments designed to get further Sunni buy-in. For everyone knows, \nunless the Sunnis buy in, the insurgency will not stop. If the \ninsurgency is not quelled, continued sectarian violence will erupt. And \nalready the genie is out of the bottle.\n  What has happened now is sectarian violence and ethnic cleansing is \nbecoming a part of the political process in Iraq. In order to be able \nto stem that, there is a necessity, in my view, to get Sunni buy-in.\n  Everything has changed on the ground since my first trip to Iraq, \nright after Saddam's statue fell, with Dick Lugar and with our \ncolleague from Nebraska, Chuck Hagel.\n  At that time, the Sunni former Baathist insurgents believed, if they \nresisted, they could drive America out, and they could once again take \ncontrol of the central government. They believed that Sunni domination, \nas existed the previous decades, was again achievable.\n  The Shia thought there was no possibility of them being able to \ndominate militarily, and they would have to be able to do that \npolitically.\n  And the Kurds saw themselves as a semiautonomous region not caring \nmuch about anything else that happened as long as they maintained their \nautonomy.\n  What has happened in the last couple years? Well, what has happened \nin the last several months, when the mosque was blown up in the Shia \narea, it unleashed--it unleashed--sectarian violence. It unleashed it \nin a way that the\n\n[[Page S3959]]\n\nbrigades of the existing militia began to wreak vengeance and havoc.\n  Every day you pick up the paper, what do you read about in Baghdad? \nYou read about 2, 12, 14, 50 Sunnis found bound and gagged and shot in \nthe head. You read of death squads.\n  On this floor, a year and a half ago, I warned that the police \ndepartment in Iraq was not being organized and was essentially becoming \na group of death squad people, dominated by the sectarian groups.\n  What has our military told us now? They told us just that, just that. \nAnd what has happened now is our chief military guy on the ground, \nGeneral Casey, says we have to radically reform the police. And he \ncalls 2006: the year of the police. The year of the police--a tacit \nacknowledgment they have been a vehicle of dividing Iraq in sectarian \nways rather than one of uniting Iraq.\n  Read today's papers--the New York Times, the Washington Post, the LA \nTimes. What are you reading? You are reading now that members of the \nIraqi Army are refusing to be deployed outside the areas from which \nthey come.\n  The election on December 15--and I came to this floor afterward--it \nwas heralded as this great democratic movement. What was it? Ninety \npercent of the Iraqis who voted on December 15 for a new Iraq voted for \nsectarian or ethnic parties. If you look at the results, it was a call \nfor, effectively, the thing we do not want--division and partition. \nThat is what it was. Only 10 percent of the votes cast in Iraq on \nDecember 15 were for nonsectarian, nonethnic parties or candidates.\n  So much for this notion that there is this nonsectarian oasis that \nexists in Iraq that we can now drink from in order to unite Iraq.\n\n  So I say to my colleagues, the proposal I have come forward with is, \nI believe, the only reasonable way in which to guarantee there is not a \ndivision of Iraq, that there is not partitioning. My proposal calls for \na strong central government controlling all of the revenues, all the \nresources, all the oil revenues, controlling a united army, and in \ncharge of border security and foreign policy.\n  But what it does is what we did, in part, in Bosnia in the Dayton \nAccords. It gives the sectarian areas breathing room. It does not \ninsist that the central government and the Parliament dictate to the \npeople in the Sunni area, for example, what their laws on marriage \nshould be, what their laws on divorce and property settlement would be, \nany more than we allow the Federal Government to tell the people of \nMississippi or the State of Washington or the State of Delaware what \nthose laws would be. That is not division.\n  I remind everybody, what did we do? We won a Revolutionary War, but \nwe could not get a consensus among the 13 Colonies to have a strong, \nunited central Government, so we developed the Articles of \nConfederation. It took us 13 years to have our Philadelphia moment. It \ntook us 13 years.\n  Let me go back to Bosnia and continue that analogy. The Dayton \nAccords called for the establishment of a place called the Republika \nSrpska. Remember, Serbians within Bosnia-Herzegovina had their own \nrepublic, were allowed to keep their army, allowed to keep their \nmilitary, and three Presidents were elected under the Constitution--a \nSerbian President, a Bosniak President, and a Croat President. That was \nnecessary to keep this place from splitting and splintering. There was \nno possibility you would get them all on the same page, in the same \nbox, after the ethnic cleansing that had taken place.\n  What is happening now in Bosnia-Herzegovina? Now they are rewriting \ntheir Constitution. The Republika Srpska is ready to give up their \nstatus, give up their military, as well as move from three Presidents \nto one. Why? They want to become part of Europe. They want to become \npart of Europe and benefit economically. That is why we needed to give \nthem breathing room.\n  My proposal does not do a single thing that the existing Constitution \ndoes not contemplate in Iraq. And my proposal requires--requires--as a \nprecondition the establishment of the very government that is being \nestablished right now. But it goes beyond that. As our Ambassador said \nto us, down at the White House, in the teleconference with the \nPresident and about six Senators and the members of the war Cabinet of \nthe President--he said: Mr. President--I am paraphrasing--we first have \nto establish this government. Then we need a program. The government \nneeds a program.\n  Essentially, what my proposal calls for are the outlines of a \nprogram, a program whereby the Sunnis are guaranteed a piece of the \neconomic pie.\n  Now, people would say: Joe, why? And I have run this by at least a \nhalf a dozen Iraqi leaders in Iraq--Sunni, Shia, and Kurds--and it \nranges from ``not sure'' to ``supportive.''\n  Why? What has changed? Here is what has changed. This is how the \nground has shifted. No. 1, there is now sectarian violence, and ethnic \ncleansing is underway already now.\n  Secondly, the Sunnis no longer think there is any possibility of them \ncontrolling the central government and all of Iraq any longer. They \nhave given up that notion. They know it is not possible. Some diehard \nBaathists and terrorists still think that. But the vast majority of the \nSunni leadership knows that is not in the cards. That is not where they \nwere 8 months ago.\n  Now, what happened with regard to the Shia? The Shia now know they \ncan be the dominant political party in Iraq. But they have also figured \nout, in the last 3 months--they have had, as we Catholics say, their \nown epiphany. And what was their epiphany? It is that they know they \ncannot control the insurgents. They know there is nothing they are \ngoing to be able to do in the foreseeable future to keep their mosques, \nthe oil wells, and infrastructure from being blown up.\n  The Kurds. What has happened in the last 3 months with the Kurds? The \nKurds value, above all else, their autonomy. They really want \nindependence, but they value their autonomy. Why would they be part of \nthis deal to give up part of the revenues to guarantee the Sunnis have \nrevenues? A simple reason, folks: They have now decided there is no \npossibility of them occupying Kirkuk and being independent in a country \nthat blows apart. Why? The Turks will take them out. The Turks will \ntake them out. The Turkoman, the Syrians, and others who live in \nKirkuk--the Turks will not allow the Kurds in Iraq to essentially have \nan independent state if a civil war breaks out.\n  So they have all figured it out. But they do not know quite how to \nfix it. You may say: Biden, isn't it presumptuous for you to tell them \nhow to fix it?\n  Quite frankly, every move forward of late has been from an American \ninitiative.\n  Well, I heard the White House criticize my plan, saying we ought to \nlet the Iraqis do it. Well, how do they explain the fact that the \nPresident of the United States got on the phone and told the Iraqis: \n``Jaafari is out''? How do they explain the fact of noninterference \nwith the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense getting on a \nplane and going over to Iraq and saying: ``Jaafari is out''?\n  Do you call that meddling? I call it meddling, but a rational \nmeddling, a rational meddling for their own well-being and, long term, \nours.\n  And I might add, who was it that insisted that the Constitution, that \nwas clearly going to be voted on overwhelmingly, be amended at the last \nminute to allow further amendment? Our Ambassador? He did it. Why? It \nmade sense in order to get the Sunnis into the election.\n  Because they were not ready to buy in if they knew this Constitution \nwas cast in stone. That is nice meddling.\n  What I am proposing does not even approach that. What I am proposing \nis what everybody knows has to be dealt with in Iraq; and that is, you \nhave to figure a way that the Sunnis have some resources.\n  Now, if you are a Sunni, and you have been able to get a new \ngovernment here, where you get a few people who are in the government, \nwhat do you think happens in a parliament, where 60 percent of the \nparliament is dominated by the Shia when it comes to distributing \nresources in the central government? Do you think you are going to get \nmany hospitals built in the Sunni region? Do you think you are going to \nget many roads built? Do you think you are going to get many wells dug? \nThese folks are not stupid.\n\n[[Page S3960]]\n\n  But if you guarantee them a rational piece of the economic pie--sort \nof like revenue sharing--if you guarantee them something approaching 20 \npercent of the oil revenues, after the central government has paid for \nall it needs to make them function, then, in fact, they know they have \nthe ability to provide for their own needs, and they are not going to \nbe left totally out in the cold. It is money distributed by a strong \ncentral government.\n\n  I would add one other point. People ask: Why would the Sunnis and \nShia give up what they now control, all this oil? Why would they give \nany guaranteed peace to the Sunnis? I will tell you why. Some of my \ncolleagues remember when Dick Lugar and I came to the floor and said \nthere would not be oil to pay for this war.\n  Why did we say that? We are not all that brilliant. Because we went \nto the oil men, we went to Mr. Yergin from the Cambridge research \noutfit that advises all the major oil companies in the United States. \nHe came and testified and said: You can't get oil out of the ground in \nsufficient amount unless you invest $30 billion in the ground.\n  What does everybody agree to now? Everybody, including the \nadministration, says we have to invest $30 billion in the ground.\n  What is the next message coming from the oil industry worldwide? They \nwill not invest sufficiently in Iraqi oil unless there is a centralized \noil ministry with actual control and unless there is a reasonable \nprospect of an end of the insurgency and the prospect of no civil war. \nSo why would the Shia give up part of their oil that is in the south? \nThere is no oil in the middle. It is in the north and the south. Why \nwould they give it up? Because they know with the investment, the oil \npie will be so much bigger. Although they would be giving up a little \nbit with the Constitution, they will be getting considerably more \nrevenue. This is not rocket science. That is what this is about.\n  There are five pieces of the plan. If we are ready to go to something \nelse, I am happy to cease and desist.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, we understand \nthe meeting with Senators and the Secretary of State and Secretary of \nDefense is still going on. We are advised that a good time for the vote \non the McCain amendment would be about 3:30. You are getting wound up.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Well, I am. Although I may speak long, I speak seldom. But \nthis is very important to me and to our country. I want to make sure, \nwhether people agree or disagree with my proposal, they understand it. \nAnd if they disagree, they know why they disagree. A lot are agreeing.\n  Here is the deal. There are two alternatives we have now been \noffered. One side says we are going to keep things from getting worse, \nwhere we have no strategy to make them better. The other side of the \nequation says, things aren't going to get better so we better get our \ntroops out of there as quick as we can. Neither speaks to what I think \nis our national interest and objective and they are dual: One, get the \ntroops out as rapidly as we can and leave behind as stable and \nintegrated country as possible. Because if we don't leave behind a \nstable government, we are going to do exactly what I predict is going \nto happen in Afghanistan. We are going to be back in Afghanistan. Read \ntoday's paper. My argument is, we should be sending more forces rather \nthan less. Read the paper today. The paper today says our folks and the \nAfghanis and others say the Taliban is about to occupy again the \nPashtun area, that the rural areas of southeastern Afghanistan are now \ncontrolled by the Taliban and al-Qaida.\n  Hear me. If they are controlled by the Taliban and al-Qaida, mark my \nwords, that control will be consolidated because we left too soon, we \ndon't have enough resources there, and we didn't finish the job. I \ndon't want the same thing happening in Iraq. So just pulling troops \nout, which I would love to do, pulling them out and trading a dictator \nfor chaos is no answer. Leaving them in without a plan to be able to \nbring them out with a country left behind is also not a plan.\n  Here is the deal, five pieces to my proposal, all contemplated by the \npresent Constitution and all totally consistent with the establishment \nof an integrated government. The first part of that plan requires that \nthere be strong central government control over revenues, border, \nnatural resources, and distribution of them. As part of that, we would \nalso do what the World Bank has done before: Have a World Bank \ncommittee overseeing the distribution of resources, which we have done \nin many countries, to guarantee transparency.\n  The second piece of this is a requirement that the Constitution be \namended, or theoretically it could be done by the Parliament, where the \nSunnis are guaranteed a portion of the oil revenues after the central \ngovernment has paid all its bills, as the Kurds would be and as the \nShia would be.\n  The third piece of this is, instead of doing what the administration \nhas done, which is in this budget cut off more economic aid to Iraq--I \nfind that amazing. We are ending economic aid, reconstruction aid in \nIraq. What is the plan for this democracy? We should, in fact, continue \neconomic aid to Iraq, which I am sure is hugely unpopular because it \nhas been so badly spent so far, but require a fundamental change in the \ndistribution of that aid away from megaprojects to small-bore projects. \nWe should, at the same time in part 3, be calling upon our erstwhile \npartners who committed resources to Iraq to deliver them. And we should \nhave an altar call for our Arab friends in the gulf who are making \nExxonMobil look like a piker. They have plenty of money. And it is as \nmuch in their interest to see civil war not break out, as it is in \nours.\n  All of that aid should be conditioned on one important thing: A \nguarantee of human rights and women's rights. People say: Biden, we \nknow you wrote the Violence Against Women Act. What is the deal here? \nThe reason is not only is it morally the right thing to do, it is \nessential for there to be any prospect of a democratic Iraq emerging in \nthe future, essential that women have rights and are protected. And the \ncondition upon the aid should be the guarantee and ability to oversee \nnot abusing the rights of women in their laws, in their provinces, \nsimilar to our States, similar to the State of Delaware, the State of \nMississippi, as well as the fact that overall human rights be something \nthat is transparent.\n\n  The fourth piece of this plan calls for what I have been calling for, \nfor 2 years, I admit. Dr. Kissinger has been calling for it for a year \nand three-quarters, Secretary Shultz has been calling for it. Secretary \nPowell is calling for it. We need a regional conference. We need to get \nall of Iraq's neighbors, such as we did in Afghanistan, get all of \nIraq's neighbors to essentially enter into an agreement not to meddle \nin Iraq's affairs. People ask: Why would they do that? Why would Iran \ndo that, why would Turkey do that, why would the Arab neighbors do \nthat? A simple reason: The last thing any of them want is a civil war.\n  They say the Iranians might want a civil war. No. What the Iranians \nwant is what they have. What they have now is Americans being bled \nfinancially and physically, with 10 or 12 divisions tied down. That is \nwhat the Iranians want.\n  What they don't want is a civil war. You ask why? In Tehran, the \nGovernment of Tehran and the clerics know that 75 to 80 percent of \ntheir constituency hates them. They know they are incredibly unpopular. \nYou are sitting on top of an unpopular government, knowing that there \nis not enough energy for there to be another revolt, another revolution \namong the people. Do you want 17 million of your Shia Arab brothers--\nand don't forget the Iranians are not Arab, they are Indo-European, \nthey are Persian--do you want 17 million of your Shia Arab brothers \nlearning how to fight and learning how to muster their physical \ncapability perhaps for the next year on your border while they are \nengaging with 60 million of your Shia citizens who don't like you? I \nguarantee you, the answer is ``no.'' They don't want that.\n  The Turks don't want a civil war. Civil war means the Kurds are going \nto go their own way. The last thing the Turks want is the Kurds going \ntheir own way. And for Lord's sake, the Arab Gulf States don't want a \ncivil war because they then begin to count their days. So it is in \neveryone's interest.\n  How do you get this regional conference? I believe we can and I am \nconfident we will. Get the P5, the permanent 5 of the Security Council \nto lay\n\n[[Page S3961]]\n\ndown the parameters for a regional conference, get a U.N. Security \nCouncil resolution passed calling for a regional conference on Iraq and \nnonintervention. And then do what I have been calling for for 2 years, \nset up a contact group made up of the regional and world powers who \nwill essentially police the deal--not send troops into Iraq, police the \ndeal--so that all those who sign on in the region do not interfere and \nobserve they are not interfering.\n  The fifth piece of my plan calls for a date to be announced, that by \nthe end of 2008, the majority of American forces will be redeployed. \nThere are two reasons for that. To give the U.S. military certainty, to \ngive them certainty to plan, for there is no possibility of them \npulling American forces out in 6 months or 8 months. I am not going to \npresume to tell the military how long an orderly change in our presence \nin Iraq would take and when it should take place. If it occurs sooner, \nall the better.\n  But the second reason to state it is to let the Iraqis know, as \nDemocrats and Republicans and the President himself have acknowledged, \nthat as long as they think we are there forever, they are not about to \nstep up to the ball to make the hard decisions.\n  So I believe the only reasonable prospect of holding Iraq together, \nto avoid partitioning, which could be a disaster, is to give the region \nbreathing room and incentive to stay in the deal.\n  I hope over time this will get a closer look. As Dr. Kissinger said, \nand I spoke with him and Vice President Cheney in Philadelphia at the \nWorld Affairs Council, when they asked Dr. Kissinger, after my speech \nalong these lines, what he thought, he said he thought the plan \nwarranted very close scrutiny. When I laid it out to Ash Carter, he \nthought the plan was a good plan. When I laid it out to other people, \nincluding former Republican and Democratic members of the foreign \npolicy establishment, it went from: Joe, is this partitioning? and once \nexplained that it wasn't, to not a bad idea, to fully embracing the \nidea.\n  This is going to take a while. I remember when I came to this floor \nin the early 1990s and to the shock and dismay of my colleagues called \nfor us lifting the arms embargo against the Bosnians and calling for \nair strikes against the Serbs. My colleagues thought that was crazy.\n  I remember when I came back again, after meeting with Milosevic and \nhim having told people in a private meeting that when he asked me what \nI thought about him, I told him I thought he was a war criminal and I \nwould spend my career seeing that he was tried as one, my colleagues \nthought it didn't make sense. It took 3 years to convince the \nadministration we should move. It takes time. But they did move. We \ndidn't lose an American force. We stopped a genocide. We stopped the \ndismantling of an entire region of the world, and we saved the lives of \nat least a quarter of a million people.\n  We can do that again. Don't expect everyone to embrace this plan. I \nrealize it is strategically pretty broad. I realize it takes time to \ndigest. My fervent prayer is, I would love it if 6 months from now, \nwhat I proposed proves not to be necessary because the Iraqis have \nembraced and rallied around this new government, that the insurgency is \nstopped, that we have not had continued ethnic cleansing, and that \nthere is a unified central government as is. I would be delighted, \ndelighted to stand on the floor and have people say: Told you, Joe. You \ndidn't need the scheme you laid out.\n  I pray God that is true. But I respectfully suggest to you it is not \nlikely to be true. We better have a plan B for pulling out American \ntroops precipitously without a plan, for keeping them in without a plan \nis a disaster either way you look at it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the speech I delivered \nearlier this week at the World Affairs Council be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n    The Way Forward in Iraq: Avoiding Partition, Preserving Unity, \n                     Protecting America's Interests\n\n       It's an honor to be back at the Philadelphia World Affairs \n     Council.\n       First, let me apologize to those of you confused by the \n     schedule. It shows me speaking this afternoon. Instead, you \n     get me to start your day. Look at it this way: things can \n     only get better. And they will, because I understand that \n     Vice President Cheney and Secretary Kissinger will be here \n     for lunch.\n       I'd like to focus on an issue that weighs heavily on our \n     national consciousness--Iraq.\n       I start from this hard truth: President Bush does not have \n     a strategy for victory in Iraq. His strategy is to prevent \n     defeat and to hand the problem off to his successor. \n     Meanwhile, the frustration of Americans is mounting so fast \n     that Congress might end up mandating a rapid withdrawal, even \n     at the risk of trading a dictator for chaos, and a civil war \n     that could become a regional war.\n       Both are bad alternatives.\n       Today, I will argue for a third way that can bring our \n     troops home, protect our fundamental security interests, and \n     preserve Iraq as a unified country.\n       I developed this plan with Les Gelb, the president emeritus \n     of the Council on Foreign Relations. It recognizes this new, \n     central reality in Iraq: a rising tide of sectarian violence \n     is the biggest threat to Iraq's future and to America's \n     interests. It is premised on the proposition that the only \n     way to hold Iraq together, and to create the conditions for \n     our troops to responsibly withdraw, is to give Shiites, \n     Sunnis, and Kurds room to breath in their own regions.\n       Let me tell you what our plan is not: it is not partition. \n     Let me tell you what our plan is: It is consistent with \n     Iraq's constitution. It is consistent with the new unity \n     government. And it is consistent with--in fact, it is \n     necessary to--the goal of keeping Iraq unified within its \n     existing borders and not a threat to its own people, its \n     neighbors, or to us.\n       I'd like to share the details of our plan with you.\n\n\n                         The Current Situation\n\n       I was last in Baghdad on December 15th to observe the \n     elections. It was my sixth trip to Iraq. It was incredibly \n     moving to see Iraqis go to the polls.\n       I came back with a finger stained purple from the polling \n     ink. But I also returned with this warning: we must not, yet \n     again, prematurely declare, ``Mission Accomplished.'' Yes, \n     Iraqis voted by the millions, but who did they vote for? \n     Ninety percent cast their ballots for sectarian and ethnic \n     parties. Far from a democratic turning point, the elections \n     reflected Iraq's deepening fault-lines.\n       Here's where we are in Iraq: we can't lose on the \n     battlefield and the insurgents can't win as long as enough \n     U.S. troops remain. But, as both our Ambassador and our top \n     general in Iraq acknowledge, violence between the Shi'a and \n     Sunnis has surpassed the insurgency as the main security \n     threat. It is driving the country toward chaos and civil war.\n       Simply put, the sectarian genie is out of the bottle. \n     Ethnic militias increasingly are the law in large parts of \n     Iraq. They have infiltrated the official security forces. \n     Sectarian cleansing has begun in mixed areas, with tens of \n     thousands of Iraqis fleeing their homes in recent weeks. \n     Dozens of dead bodies turn up daily in Baghdad.\n       Meanwhile, Iraqis have less electricity, clean water, \n     sewage treatment and oil than before the war. Iraq's \n     government ministries are barely functional. Iraq looks more \n     like a failing state, not an emerging democracy.\n       There is no purely military answer to this slow but certain \n     downward spiral. With more troops and the right strategy, we \n     might have stopped the insurgency. But no number of U.S. \n     troops will stop a civil war. To prevent it, we need a \n     political solution. The national unity government in which \n     the President has put so much stock is necessary, but it is \n     not enough. We have had ``unity'' governments for three years \n     in Iraq. Yet sectarian violence has escalated.\n       What the Iraqis need now--and what this plan proposes--is a \n     genuine political way forward that, like our own Articles of \n     Confederation, gives Sunnis, Shiites, and Kurds the \n     confidence to pursue their interests peacefully in a unified \n     country. In fact, the central government this plan proposes \n     for Iraq would be even stronger than America's first \n     government. With time, we can hope they will come to their \n     own Philadelphia freedom.\n       At the same time, I believe we can't pull our forces out \n     precipitously, just as we can't keep them in Iraq \n     indefinitely. Withdrawing them too soon would open the door \n     to all out civil war that could turn into a regional war. It \n     also would leave parts of Iraq a haven for terrorists. That \n     would be disastrous for U.S. interests.\n       What our troops deserve--and what this plan proposes--is a \n     clear target date for redeployment that, coupled with a \n     political settlement, will allow us to leave Iraq with our \n     basic interests intact.\n\n\n                       A Five Point Plan for Iraq\n\n       Ten years ago, Bosnia was drowning in ethnic cleansing and \n     facing its demise as a unified state. After much hesitation, \n     the United States stepped in decisively with the Dayton \n     Accords to keep the country whole by dividing it into ethnic \n     federations. We even allowed Bosniaks, Croats, and Serbs to \n     retain separate armies. With the help of U.S. troops and \n     others, Bosnians have lived a decade in peace. Now, they are \n     strengthening their common central government, and disbanding \n     their separate armies.\n       The Bush Administration, despite its profound strategic \n     misjudgments, has a similar opportunity in Iraq.\n       The idea is to maintain a unified Iraq by decentralizing it \n     and giving Kurds, Shiites, and Sunnis the room to run their \n     own affairs. The central government would be left in charge \n     of common interests. We would encourage Iraqis to accept this \n     formula with major sweeteners for the Sunnis, a military\n\n[[Page S3962]]\n\n     plan for withdrawing and redeploying U.S. forces, and a \n     regional non-aggression pact. The plan has five elements:\n     1. One Iraq With Three Regions\n       The first element is to establish three largely autonomous \n     regions with a viable but limited central government in \n     Baghdad.\n       The central government would be responsible for border \n     defense, foreign policy, oil production and revenues. The \n     regional governments--Kurd, Sunni and Shiite--would be \n     responsible for administering their own regions.\n       The United States shouldn't impose this solution and we \n     don't have to because federalism is already written into \n     Iraq's constitution. In fact, the constitution creates a \n     limited central government and establishes a procedure for \n     provinces combining into regions.\n       Increasingly, each community will support federalism, if \n     only as a last resort. Until recently, the Sunnis sought a \n     strong central government because they believed they would \n     retake power. Now, they are beginning to recognize that they \n     won't. Their growing fear is Shi'a power in a highly \n     centralized state, enforced by sectarian militia and death \n     squads. The Shi'a know that they can dominate the government, \n     but they can't defeat a Sunni insurrection. The Kurds want to \n     consolidate their autonomy.\n       Some will ask whether this plan will lead to sectarian \n     cleansing. The answer is that it's already happening. \n     According to the Iraqi government, 90,000 people have fled \n     their homes since the February bombing of the Samarra mosque \n     for fear of sectarian reprisals. That's a rate of more than a \n     1,000 people a day. This does not include the tens of \n     thousands of educated Iraqis from the middle class who have \n     left the country.\n       We must build in protections to prevent more cleansing and \n     to improve security in the big cities, which the \n     Administration has failed to achieve. Baghdad would become a \n     federal zone, while densely-populated areas with mixed \n     populations would receive both multi-sectarian and \n     international police protection.\n       A global political settlement won't end the Sunni \n     insurgency, but it should help to undermine it. The Zarqawi \n     network would no longer have the sectarian card to play. \n     Sunni Nationalists and neo-Baathists would still be unhappy \n     but they would be easier to contain.\n       Similarly, while decentralization won't end the militia \n     problem overnight, it is the best way to begin rolling it \n     back. Right now, there is no plan to disband the militia. \n     Militias have so heavily infiltrated the security forces that \n     our training program is effectively making them better \n     killers. The regions can become magnets for the militia, \n     integrating them into local forces, and eventually into the \n     national force. Again, the constitution already provides for \n     security forces within the regions. There is nothing radical \n     in this proposal.\n       The Administration is focusing only on putting together a \n     unity government. But the ``unity'' government of the past \n     year wasn't able to govern or stop the violence. This one \n     offers little more promise. A much broader political \n     settlement that gives each community breathing space is the \n     best bet to prevent civil war and to keep Iraq intact.\n     2. A Viable Sunni Region With Shared Oil Revenues\n       The second element of the plan is to gain agreement for the \n     federal solution from the Sunni Arabs by giving them an offer \n     they can't reasonably refuse.\n       Basically, they get to run their own region. That's a far \n     better deal than the present alternatives: either being a \n     permanent minority in a centrally run government or being the \n     principal victims of a civil war.\n       As a major sweetener, we should press the Iraqis to write \n     into the constitution that the Sunnis would receive about 20 \n     percent of all present and future oil revenues. That's \n     roughly proportional to their size. And it's far more than \n     they'd get otherwise, since the oil is in the north and \n     south, not the Sunni center. These revenues represent the \n     only way to make the Sunni region viable economically. If \n     Sunnis reject the deal, there is no guarantee they will get \n     any oil revenues.\n       The central government would set national oil policy and \n     distribute the revenues, which would reinforce each \n     community's interest in keeping Iraq intact. There would be \n     international supervision to ensure transparency.\n       Why would the Shiites and Kurds sign on? Petroleum experts \n     agree that the Iraqi oil industry will attract much more \n     desperately needed foreign capital if it is run as a unified \n     whole. Shiites and Kurds will get a slightly smaller piece of \n     a much larger pie. That's a better deal than they would get \n     by going it alone. Guaranteeing Sunnis a piece of this pie \n     will reduce the incentive of insurgents to attack the oil \n     infrastructure. That, too, would be good for everyone.\n     3. More Aid, But Tied To The Protection Of Minority And \n         Women's Rights\n       Third, instead of ending U.S. reconstruction assistance, as \n     the Bush Administration is doing, we should provide more. But \n     we should clearly condition aid on the protection of minority \n     and women's rights. The incompetence of the Bush \n     Administration's reconstruction program makes more \n     reconstruction money a hard sell. A new aid effort would have \n     to be radically different than the old one. For example, \n     instead of international mega-firms pocketing valuable \n     contracts, spending a huge chunk of each one on security, and \n     then falling short, Iraqis should be in the lead of small-\n     scale projects that deliver quick results.\n       The President also should insist that other countries make \n     good on old commitments, and provide new ones. He should \n     focus on the Gulf States. They're enjoying windfall oil \n     profits. They have a lot at stake in Iraq. They should step \n     up and give back.\n       But all future U.S. aid would be tied to the protection of \n     minority and women's rights, clearly and unambiguously. We \n     should insist other donors set the same standard. Aid would \n     be cut off in the face of a pattern of violations.\n       President Bush is now silent on protecting minority and \n     women's rights. If they are not upheld, there can be no hope \n     for eventual democracy in Iraq.\n     4. Maintain Iraq's Territorial Integrity And Engage Its \n         Neighbors\n       Fourth, this plan proposes that the United Nations convene \n     a regional security conference where Iraq's neighbors, \n     including Iran, pledge to respect Iraq's borders and work \n     cooperatively to implement this plan.\n       The neighbors may see decentralization as a plot to carve \n     up Iraq. But they have an equally strong interest in not \n     seeing Iraq descend into a civil war that could draw them \n     into a wider war. Engaging them directly can overcome their \n     suspicions and focus their efforts on stabilizing Iraq, not \n     undermining it.\n       The U.N. Security Council should precede the conference \n     with a call for the necessary declarations. The permanent \n     members of the Security Council should then sponsor and \n     participate in the conference to show a united international \n     front.\n       After the conference, Iraq's neighbors will still be \n     tempted to interfere in its weakened affairs. We need an on-\n     going mechanism to keep them in line. For two years, I've \n     called for a standing Contact Group, to include the major \n     powers, that would engage the neighbors and lean on them to \n     comply with the deal. I'm not alone. Former Secretaries of \n     State Kissinger, Shultz, and Powell have all called for the \n     same thing.\n       President Bush's failure to move on this front is \n     inexplicable. There will be no lasting peace in Iraq without \n     the support of its neighbors.\n     5. A Responsible U.S. Drawdown And A Residual Force\n       Fifth, the President should direct U.S. military commanders \n     to develop a plan to withdraw and re-deploy almost all U.S. \n     forces from Iraq by 2008. If the military can do it sooner \n     without precipitating a meltdown, so much the better. \n     Regardless, the President should make it clear that the \n     direction we're heading in is out, and no later than 2008.\n       We would maintain in or near Iraq a small residual force--\n     perhaps 20,000 troops--to strike any concentration of \n     terrorists, help keep Iraq's neighbors honest, and train its \n     security forces. Some U.S. troops and police would also need \n     to participate in a multinational peacekeeping force deployed \n     to the major multi-sectarian cities, as in the Balkans. Such \n     a force is now a non-starter with other countries, despite \n     their own interest in avoiding chaos in Iraq and the region. \n     But a political settlement, and their role in helping to \n     bring it about through a regional conference and Contact \n     Group, could change their calculus and willingness to \n     participate.\n       Right now, our troops are still necessary to prevent total \n     chaos. But unless the Iraqis see and believe we are leaving, \n     they will have little incentive to shape up. Redeployment is \n     also necessary because we can't sustain this large a force in \n     Iraq without sending troops back on fourth and fifth tours, \n     extending deployments, and fully mobilizing the Guard. That \n     would do serious long-term damage to our military.\n       A clear plan also would end the fiction the President keeps \n     repeating of a ``conditions based draw down.'' What \n     conditions justify the draw down of 30,000 troops since the \n     December elections? The situation has gotten worse.\n       President Bush's refusal to give clear direction leaves our \n     military unable to plan an orderly draw down. It also leaves \n     our troops, the Iraqis and the American people in the dark. \n     It's time to end the guessing. It's time for clarity, but \n     clarity with responsibility. Redeploying our troops over 18 \n     months will allow the political settlement I've proposed to \n     take hold and prevent all-out civil war.\n\n\n                        Redeeming Our Sacrifice\n\n       This plan for Iraq has its own risks. But this \n     Administration has left us with nothing but hard choices.\n       The choice I'm proposing may be the only way left to keep \n     Iraq intact and allow our troops to come home with our \n     fundamental security interests intact.\n       The choice I'm proposing can give all of us--Republicans, \n     Independents, Democrats, Americans--realistic hope that our \n     sacrifices in Iraq were not in vain.\n       Thanks for listening.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to support Senator Biden's \namendment to provide that none of the funds being appropriated in this \nemergency supplemental appropriations bill may be used by the United \nStates to establish permanent military bases in Iraq. If we are serious \nabout finding ways to neutralize the insidious insurgency that has \nkilled over 2,400 American service men and women in Iraq, we must state \nclearly, unequivocally, and without further delay that we do not\n\n[[Page S3963]]\n\nintend to remain in Iraq indefinitely. Permanent U.S. military bases \nare a temptation for terrorists and would be a continuing symbol of \nU.S. occupation.\n  The U.S. Ambassador in Iraq, Zalmay Khalilzad, said on March 24, \n2006, that the United States ``has no goal of establishing permanent \nbases in Iraq.'' Senior-level officials regularly promise that the \nUnited States will not establish permanent bases in Iraq. But the facts \ntell a different story.\n  General John Abizaid, the commander of U.S. troops in the Middle \nEast, testified before Congress earlier this year that he couldn't rule \nout the possibility of permanent bases in Iraq. And according to the \nCongressional Research Service, the Bush administration has requested \nmore than $1.1 billion for new military construction in Iraq, nearly \ndouble what the United States has spent in Kuwait, Qatar, and the \nUnited Arab Emirates combined. This very bill we are considering \nincludes $348 million for more base construction. This begs the \nquestion, if the U.S. Government doesn't plan to occupy Iraq for any \nlonger than necessary, why are we spending billions of dollars to add \nonto and build more bases?\n  At the end of March, Brigadier General Mark Kimmitt said, and I \nagree, that ``we must . . . show that we will not become a permanent \nforce of occupation . . .''. Last month, Secretary of State Condoleezza \nRice conceded that the Bush administration had probably made \n``thousands'' of ``tactical errors'' in Iraq. Let's not compound the \nproblem by establishing permanent bases in Iraq.\n  I say it again: if we are serious about finding ways to neutralize \nthe insidious insurgency in Iraq, we must convince the rest of the \nworld--especially the Muslim world--that we do not intend to remain in \nIraq indefinitely. Approving the amendment offered by the senior \nSenator from Delaware will help us send that message. Therefore, I urge \nmy colleagues to support the Biden amendment to prohibit the United \nStates from building permanent military bases in Iraq.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, there are two amendments that have been \ncleared for consideration by the Senate.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3605\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order to call up \nand consider amendment No. 3605 on behalf of Mr. Lott regarding Armed \nForces retirement home.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran], for Mr. Lott, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3605.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To designate the Navy, acting through the Naval Facilities \n   Engineering Command, as the agent for all matters relating to the \n    construction of a new Armed Forces Retirement Home in Gulfport, \n                              Mississippi)\n\n       On page 193, line 25, insert after ``Provided,'' the \n     following: ``That the Navy, acting through the Naval \n     Facilities Engineering Command, shall be the agent for all \n     matters with regard to the planning, design, construction, \n     and contract administration related to the construction of \n     the new Armed Forces Retirement Home: Provided further,''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3605) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3657\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3657 on behalf of \nSenator Leahy and others regarding international disaster and famine \nassistance and hurricane relief.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran], for Mr. Leahy \n     and Mr. Durbin, proposes an amendment numbered 3657.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To address a shortfall in funding for international disaster \n                         and famine assistance)\n\n       On page 118, line 7, strike ``$136,290,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``$171,290,000''.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3657, As Modified\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I send a modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  Without objection, the amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 3657), as modified, is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To address a shortfall in funding for international disaster \n            and famine assistance and for hurricane relief)\n\n       On page 118, line 7, strike ``$136,290,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``$171,290,000''.\n       On page 117, line 25, strike ``$10,500,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``$22,500,000''.\n       On page 117, line 26, after ``That'' insert the following:\n       of the funds appropriated under this heading, $12,000,000 \n     shall be made available for assistance for Guatemala for \n     relief and reconstruction activities related to Hurricane \n     Stan: Provided further, That\n       On page 126, line 12, after the period insert the \n     following:\n\n                              (RESCISSION)\n\n       Sec. 1406. Of the funds appropriated under the heading \n     ``Economic Support Fund'' that are available for assistance \n     for Egypt in Public Law 109-102 and under such heading in \n     prior Acts making appropriations for foreign operations, \n     export financing, and related programs, $47,000,000 are \n     rescinded: Provided, That such amount shall be derived only \n     from funds available for cash transfer assistance.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this amendment offered by myself, Senator \nDurbin and Senator Wyden, provides an additional $35 million for famine \nand disaster assistance for people in West Africa and in the Horn of \nAfrica who are suffering from severe drought and hunger.\n  In last year's supplemental we provided additional funding for this \npurpose and according to USAID's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance \nit was extremely helpful.\n  The situation this year is no less dire. Additional funding for \nfamine and disaster assistance is required for the Horn of Africa where \n15 million people are at risk and an additional 8 million people in \nEthiopia, Kenya, and Somalia face severe food and water shortages. To \nput it another way, they are going to die if we and others don't do \nmore to help them.\n  In Ethiopia alone, more than 740,000 people urgently need water, and \nmore than 1.5 million children under five require immunizations against \ndisease.\n  The shortfall in this account also threatens to jeopardize USAID's \nresponse to other emergencies in Africa. Humanitarian programs in \nUganda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi, and Cote d'Ivoire \nface cuts in funding despite worsening circumstances.\n  In Cote d'Ivoire, 500,000 internally displaced persons face growing \nhardship and insecurity. USAID does not have the resources to respond \nto the increased needs of vulnerable people, especially women, and \nchildren.\n  The situation in these countries is worse than pitiful. This \namendment will not solve the problem, but it will save lives and help \nprevent the situation from getting even worse. It is what we need to do \nto give the relief workers who are trying to get food, water and \nshelter to these people the resources they need.\n  Mr. President, the devastation caused by Hurricane Stan did not \nreceive the attention that it should have by the Congress. That was \npartly because it was overshadowed by the terrible earthquake in \nPakistan and by Hurricane Katrina.\n  Whole villages in Guatemala were buried by some 900 mudslides, 670 \npeople died, 845 are missing, and 475,000 were directly affected. Many \nof them lost their homes, their property and their livelihoods as a \nresult of Hurricane Stan. Most of the destruction occurred in one of \nthe poorest parts of\n\n[[Page S3964]]\n\nthe country which is the source of the majority of Guatemalan \nimmigrants to the United States. Yet so far we have contributed only a \nfew million dollars.\n  My amendment provides an additional $12 million for assistance for \nGuatemala for relief and reconstruction activities related to Hurricane \nStan. It is not as much as I wish we could provide, but I know that it \nwill help address the most urgent needs of people who are trying to \nrebuild their lives.\n  I want to thank Senator McConnell for agreeing to accept this \namendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment being \noffered by my colleague from Vermont to provide much-needed emergency \nassistance to sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere through the Office of \nForeign Disaster Assistance.\n  Specifically, his amendment, which I am proud to cosponsor, would \nincrease humanitarian aid funds by $35 million.\n  The amendment has also now been modified to provide $12 million for \nhurricane relief assistance to Guatemala, which I also support.\n  This supplemental is intended to meet emergencies. Well, many \ncountries in Africa especially face dire emergencies, and the money \nprovided in the Leahy amendment is desperately needed.\n  The United Nations reports that more than 8 million people are facing \na food crisis in the Horn of Africa--2 million people in Ethiopia alone \nare facing critical food shortages.\n  The world has waited too long before, to respond to crises in \nEthiopia and elsewhere. Let's act now and not wait for the television \ncameras to jar us into action.\n  The Bush administration has not requested additional funds in the \nsupplemental bill to meet this mounting crisis, despite the fact that \nconditions in the region have worsened considerably in recent months.\n  Other regions are also facing emergency situations, most notably West \nAfrica, the Great Lakes region, and Chad.\n  And yet, in spite of these growing needs, the Office of Foreign \nDisaster Assistance faces the prospect of having to slash the budgets \nof lifesaving programs.\n  I want to focus on one example: the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n  I am told that in the Democratic Republic of Congo, critical U.S. \nassistance budgets for this year may be cut in half.\n  In December, I visited the DRC, and I have to tell you, it is hard to \nimagine a place in greater need.\n  However, budgetary pressures are forcing U.S. programs in the DRC to \ncollapse the depth and breadth of their efforts.\n  This means cutting food security programs, clean water, maternal and \nchild health care programs, and other efforts to address fundamental \nhuman needs.\n  The DRC has been wracked by war for years.\n  Now, it finally sees some hope, but there are 2 million displaced \npeople there.\n  The Democratic Republic of Congo has long been called one of the \nworld's most neglected emergencies. Let's change that.\n  The situation in the DRC is just one of the humanitarian crises that \ncurrently plague the continent of Africa.\n  But we can make a difference. We must not cut our disaster assistance \nto countries like the Congo in half.\n  That kind of cut undermines everything we have been trying to do. It \nwould be a strategic mistake and a moral failure.\n  I call on my colleagues to support this additional emergency aid \noffered by the Leahy amendment.\n  These supplemental funds are urgently needed and they will go a long \nway toward providing relief to the millions of Africans and others in \nthe world who find themselves facing absolutely dire circumstances.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this amendment is offset by a reduction \nin foreign economic assistance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? The question is----\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada reserves the right to \nobject.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, may I ask the chairman of the committee, \nis this an increase in funding in this bill?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. No, it is not. If the Senator will yield, as I \nunderstand it, it shifts funds from a foreign economic assistance \naccount to an account to provide disaster assistance in Guatemala for \ndamages and expenses sustained in a hurricane.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. So this is no net increase in spending in the bill?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. My reading is that it transfers money from a foreign \neconomic assistance account to one that provides disaster assistance \nfor damages sustained in Guatemala as a result of a hurricane--\nHurricane Stan I think was the name of it.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3657), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am advised that we are now prepared to \ngo to a vote on the McCain amendment. For that purpose, I ask for the \nregular order.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3616\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                            GASOLINE PRICES\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today, life in America is tough. \nPeople are working very hard to make ends meet. In so many cases, \nfamilies have to earn two incomes to meet their basic needs: mom \nworking one shift, dad working another shift.\n  It is a mystery to me, and I am sure it is to so many people in our \ncountry,\n\n[[Page S3965]]\n\nhow it is that the inflation index is so modest when everything costs \nmore, whether it is milk, whether it is electric, whether it is \nhousing, whether it is prescription drugs, whether it is school, \nwhether it is college and university tuition.\n  I am reluctant to talk about my age, but since the days the \ndistinguished chairman of the Committee on Appropriations and I were in \ncollege, the tuitions have become such an expensive proportion of a \nfamily's income that it is hard to imagine how working people can get \ntheir kids into college and not have them drowning in debt by the time \nthey finish.\n  That is life in America today. No matter where you turn, it costs \nmore. Look at ball game tickets. Look at theater tickets. Look at the \npleasant amenities, see how much they cost, and one can understand why \nfew people can afford to take advantage of these things. As a \nconsequence, most Americans agree that this Nation is headed in the \nwrong direction. Who can blame them?\n  We saw the Government's bungling and ineptitude in response to \nHurricane Katrina. The administration's missteps in Iraq are costing \nAmericans dearly in lives and dollars, and gasoline prices are out of \ncontrol.\n  Gas prices have gone through the roof. This chart shows in December \nof 2001, President Bush's first year in office, the national average \nprice of gas was $1.06 for regular gas, $1.25 for supreme gas. Now we \nare at a much different point, $1.06 for regular has gone to $2.92, \nalmost a $1.85 increase in the price. That is almost a 200-percent jump \nin price from 2001 when supreme was $1.25. Supreme now is $3.07.\n  It is unconscionable. The American people are upset. Members are \nreceiving e-mail messages, phone calls. Our constituents will tell \nMembers what they think of these prices.\n  Gas prices were low in 2001 when two oil men in the White House got \ntogether with their friends and the oil industry. They convened a \nsecret task force to develop an energy policy. Then our friends, the \nRepublicans in the Congress, passed the so-called Energy bill which was \nmostly a bunch of giant tax breaks for big oil and the wealthiest among \nus. They did not construct that, but that is what happened.\n  What is the result of all this work by the Bush-Cheney administration \nand the Republican majority in the Congress? The average price of \ngasoline this week, as I said, is $2.92 for the lowest octane.\n  What is the Republican answer to this problem? How about this: Give \neveryone a $100 tax rebate. Whoopee. What a celebration, 100 bucks. If \nyou have a 20-gallon tank in your car, you get 2.5 fills before using \nyour $100. In fact, the average family cost in gasoline today is up \n$1,800. Everyone knows this is a silly idea when they hear it. With \ngasoline prices at this rate, what is $100 going to do? Practically \nnothing; $100 is not going to do anything as long as the Republican \nParty is a subsidiary of big oil.\n  Here is an example. To pay for the $100 rebates, the Republican \nParty, the Republican majority said they will close tax loopholes that \noil companies enjoy. But the oil companies said: Wait a minute, don't \nget tough with us. So today we hear the Republicans have backed off \nthat plan, holding their heads in wonderment like scolded \nschoolchildren.\n  We all know about the obscene retirement package that former \nExxonMobil CEO Lee Raymond received. His retirement package--get this--\nwas almost $400 million. When they recalculated his earnings over the \nperiod of time he served, his average income was $145,000 each and \nevery day. How many people in this country earn over $145,000 a year, \nno less per day? It is incomprehensible. And the public has been \njustifiably outraged by this outlandish compensation package at the \nexpense of the American people.\n  Listen to what the now-ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson said on the \n``Today Show'' this morning. I heard it. He was asked if his company \nwould offer his fellow Americans some relief this summer and discount \ngasoline prices. His answer was: ``We are in the business to make \nmoney.'' He said that was his job.\n  I was CEO of a pretty big company, and I understand the business \nworld. But when you deal in a commodity you have to be cognizant of \nyour ethical and civic responsibilities to your country. Gasoline is \nnot some run-of-the-mill product. It is vital to our entire society. It \nis critical. ExxonMobil is part of the American community and its \nneighbors are suffering. Businesses and American families are having \nreal problems just affording gasoline. There are families who may \ndecide not to go to the doctor this week for a sick child. They may \npostpone it. Small businesses are losing lots of money with higher fuel \ncosts.\n\n  Big oil needs to recognize the impact their commodity has on everyday \nAmericans' lives. Mr. Tillerson, the CEO of ExxonMobil, needs to \nunderstand their special role in our functioning as a society.\n  And the Bush administration needs to stop acting helpless. President \nBush and Vice President Cheney often say: There is not much we can do \nabout high gasoline prices. I do not see it that way. There are things \nthey can do.\n  There is something we can do here. We can get tough with the Saudis \nand get rid of their OPEC cartel. The OPEC oil cartel has one purpose--\nto keep oil prices high by restricting exports or output. Their \nactivity is a blatant violation of the GATT agreement, the General \nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade.\n  Not only is the President not getting tough with the Saudis, the \nadministration is pandering to them. A year ago, when gasoline prices \nhad already spiked well past $2 a gallon, the Saudi ruler visited the \nPresident at his ranch in Texas. What we saw was not the President \ngetting tough but, instead, being very friendly, strolling through a \nflower garden with the Saudi leader. It looked like a friendly \ngathering, not a tough negotiation.\n  Then, last week, President Bush's Energy Secretary traveled to an \nOPEC nation in the Middle East and praised the oil cartel. And this \nweek, with the Saudi Oil Minister here in DC, the administration is \nputting down the red carpet and telling the Saudis and OPEC what a \ngreat job they do.\n  What the President should do is tell the Saudis, point blank: Disband \nyour OPEC cartel or we will file a complaint against you in the World \nTrade Organization.\n  Under international law, OPEC is an illegal cartel aimed at keeping \noil prices high. We need to force the Saudis and their friends to play \nby the rules. And that means no cartel. Forget about it.\n  Mr. President, I say this: The next time the Saudis or one of the \ncountries in the cartel has a problem with a belligerent neighbor, they \nshould not dial 911 because there will not be anybody to answer that \nphone, not if they continue the pattern of behavior they have started.\n  To the President: The American people have had enough. They want a \nchange in leadership in this country. We need leaders who will stand up \nto the Saudis and the big oil companies. It is one of the only ways we \ncan get oil and gasoline prices under control.\n  We have to hunt for other sources of energy, for other ways to use \nthe energy. We are seeing it now in hybrid cars. We are seeing now that \nin Brazil almost 75 percent of the people there are using an ethanol \nmixture, saving substantial--substantial--amounts of oil. And we have \nto be creative. We have the genius in this country. Why don't we turn \nit loose and make sure they have the incentives, the economic \nincentives, the market incentives to do those things that can save oil?\n  I do not hear anybody saying, I do not hear the President of the \nUnited States saying--and I have not heard it in a long time--join in \nthe sacrifice. We are at war. Join in conservation. We do not have \nenough. Help this country get through this crisis. And let the oil \ncompanies know the American people are in charge, not they. But that \nmessage is not sounded. The alarm is not rung. And that is the way life \nis here.\n  I make this plea to the President of the United States and colleagues \nhere: Step up to the plate. Really take an action to get that price \nreduced and not be satisfied with excuses like: Oh, that is the \nmarketplace. Baloney; that is what the American people will tell you. \nThey do not want to drain their limited resources out the window by \nthese outrageous prices for gasoline.\n\n[[Page S3966]]\n\n  We have to work together. But the only way we are going to work \ntogether is if there is some concerted leadership that says: Hey, we \nhave to get on to this problem, and not pretend this problem will kind \nof go away by itself.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3601\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3601 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Inouye] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3601.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide assistance relating to assessments and monitoring \n                   of waters in the State of Hawaii)\n\n       On page 253, between lines 19 and 20, insert the following:\n\n\n                    ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY\n\n       Sec. 7032. For an additional amount for ``Environmental \n     Programs and Management'', $1,000,000, to remain available \n     until expended, for assistance relating to assessments and \n     monitoring of waters in the State of Hawaii; Provided, That \n     the amount provided under this heading is designated as an \n     emergency requirement pursuant to section 402 of H. Con. Res. \n     95 (109th Congress), the concurrent resolution on the budget \n     for fiscal year 2006.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, this amendment has been cleared by the \nParliamentarian as being germane. It has been discussed with the \nleadership of the committee.\n  It provides $1 million to the Environmental Protection Agency for \nassistance relating to assessments and monitoring of waters in the \nState of Hawaii.\n  As some may be aware, the State of Hawaii sustained extraordinarily \nheavy rains and flooding for more than 40 days and 40 nights, beginning \nFebruary 20, 2006, devastating many families and destroying public and \nprivate property.\n  Unfortunately, on March 24, during this deluge, a Waikiki sewer line \nruptured, sending more than 48 million gallons of raw sewage into the \nAla Wai Canal, closing popular beaches in Waikiki.\n  The water quality of other beaches and streams on the Island of Oahu \nwas severely impacted by the sustained heavy rains that caused sewer \noverflows and runoff of tremendous amounts of sediment and pollutants. \nSewer systems are designed to handle wastewater and very small amounts \nof storm water that infiltrates into the pipe system.\n  During the continuous storm event, excessive amounts of water from \nthe surrounding area infiltrated into the pipe, and homeowners \ndischarged storm water into the sewer system. High bacterial levels \nexceeded the recreational water quality standards and the State \nDepartment of Health required beaches to be closed.\n  Mr. President, I hope the Senate will approve this amendment. I urge \nthe adoption of the proposed amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I have been advised that the Senator from \nArizona, Mr. McCain, wants to speak on the amendment and is on his way \nto the floor to do so. So awaiting his arrival, I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3673\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I call up for its immediate consideration \namendment No. 3673.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Inouye] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3673.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To increase funds made available for assessments of critical \n              reservoirs and dams in the State of Hawaii)\n\n       On page 246, line 1, strike ``$500,000'' and all that \n     follows through line 8 and insert ``$1,400,000, to remain \n     available until expended, for assistance with assessments of \n     critical reservoirs and dams in the State of Hawaii, \n     including the monitoring of dam structures: Provided, That \n     the amount provided under this heading is designated as an \n     emergency requirement pursuant to section 402 of H. Con. Res. \n     95 (109th Congress), the concurrent resolution on the budget \n     for fiscal year 2006.''.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, as I noted earlier, heavy rains, for more \nthan 40 days and 40 nights, devastated many families and destroyed \npublic and private property in the State of Hawaii.\n  On the Island of Kauai, besides the serious damage to agricultural \noperations in these areas, the intensity and sustained nature of these \nstorms caused a breach of two important reservoirs. A breach sent water \nand debris downstream at about 25 miles per hour and tore away homes \nand blocked off the north side of the island, hampering emergency \nservices and assistance. In addition, floodwaters from the reservoir \ncompromised the downstream reservoir, which public officials have now \ndeclared unstable and dangerous. These two reservoirs were built in the \n1890s.\n  As a result of this failure, the only access to the northern part of \nthe island sustained severe damage to the roadway, embankments, \nculverts, guardrails, and other structures. This damage was so great \nthat the highway was shut down for over a week.\n  The emergency supplemental already includes $500,000 for the U.S. \nGeological Survey's Hydrologic Networks and Analysis Program for \nassistance in conducting assessments of critical reservoirs and dams.\n  This amendment asks for an additional $900,000, which would make it \npossible for the evaluation of critical reservoirs and dams throughout \nthe State of Hawaii. I urge the adoption of this proposed amendment. It \nhas been cleared by the Parliamentarian as being germane.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the amendments \noffered by my colleague, the senior Senator from Hawaii, Dan Inouye, to \nthe fiscal year 2007 supplemental appropriations bill, H.R. 4939. I ask \nthat I be included as a cosponsor of both amendments.\n  I believe that we, as government leaders, should continue to provide \nwhatever forms of assistance are necessary to help the men, women, and \nchildren left devastated by natural disasters such as Hurricane Katrina \nand severe flooding that recently marred the islands of Kauai and Oahu \nin my home State of Hawaii. Although the immediate crises have passed, \nthe long process of recovery has just begun. Now, more than ever, we \nneed to support the efforts of those engaged in the process of \nrebuilding their communities.\n  I am pleased to see that the Senate Appropriations Committee has \nincluded $33.5 million in the emergency supplemental for disaster \nassistance in Kauai and Windward Oahu, and $6 million for sugarcane \ngrowers in Hawaii whose crops were destroyed by the floods earlier this \nspring. These funds will provide a great deal of assistance to the \ncitizens of my home State as they work to repair the damage to their \nhomes and businesses.\n  However, as my colleague eloquently explained, we need to go further. \nHis first amendment would provide $1.4 million to assess the security \nand safety of critical reservoirs and dams in Hawaii, including \nmonitoring dam structures. This funding is crucial because the failure \nof Kaloko Dam on Kauai led to the severe flooding and loss of life. The \nother Inouye amendment would provide $1 million for environmental \nmonitoring of waters in and around Hawaii.\n\n[[Page S3967]]\n\n  In March, I visited the hardest hit areas of our State and met with \nvictims, emergency responders, and State officials. The situation for \nmany of our residents is very grave. With hundreds of homes and \nbusinesses damaged or destroyed, critical infrastructure crippled, and \ndays of search and rescue activities, the resources of our State have \nbeen severely strained. Hawaii needs Federal assistance to recover from \nthe effects of the flooding, including restoring critical roadways, \nhelping farmers to salvage crops, and inspecting and repairing faulty \ndams and flood control systems. It is clear that Hawaii will not be \nable to mitigate the damages in the near future and that long-term \nrecovery efforts will require Federal assistance.\n  As my friend indicated, President Bush yesterday declared a major \ndisaster for Hawaii triggering the release of Federal funds to help the \npeople and communities recover. I stand in strong support of Senator \nInouye's amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am advised that the Senator from \nArizona also wants to speak to the amendment that has just been \noffered. So unless there is someone else who seeks recognition at this \ntime, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thought maybe we had done enough pork \nbarreling for one bill, but apparently there is never enough around \nhere, never enough. I would ask the Senator from Hawaii, when is it \nenough? Another $1.9 million, that is all, just $1.9 million. We are \nalready, for hurricane recovery, $7.7 billion above the President's \nrequest; emergency agricultural disaster assistance, $3.9 billion above \nthe President's request; drought emergency assistance, $12.5 million; \nport security enhancement, $650 million; general provisions, $36 \nmillion. It goes on and on and on.\n  We are going to do something else for the State of Hawaii so we can \nwin the war in Iraq and so we can respond to the hurricanes. One of \nthese amendments is to provide assistance relating to assessments and \nmonitoring of waters in the State of Hawaii--a million bucks for \nassistance relating to assessments and monitoring of the waters in the \nState of Hawaii, provided that the amount under this is designated an \nemergency requirement. What is it that is going on in the waters of \nHawaii that designates it as an emergency?\n  Then we have a $900,000 earmark, all for Hawaii, for assistance with \nassessment of critical reservoirs and dams in the State of Hawaii. I \nknow something about that. We have a few reservoirs and dams in my \nState. I have yet to see an emergency that had to do with the war in \nIraq and hurricanes that required that, but we are going to give them \nanother $900,000. The sad thing about this is, they will probably get \nit. I am going to force a recorded vote on both of these amendments, \nbut they will probably get it. Then in conference, there will be more \nmoney for Hawaii. And then in the next appropriations bill, there will \nbe more money for Hawaii.\n  My constituents live in Arizona. A lot of us are getting sick and \ntired of this--sick and tired, sick and tired.\n  I ask unanimous consent to ask for the yeas and nays on both \namendments and separate votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to a request for the yeas \nand nays on both amendments at this time?\n  Without objection, it is in order to so request.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  Is there further debate on amendment No. 3673? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to amendment No. 3673.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Reserving the right to object, why can't we go on with \nthe next vote, the regular order, I ask the distinguished Democratic \nleader?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader has the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have been in the Senate a couple of \ndecades, and I have grown very fond of many people. There is no one in \nthe Senate for whom I don't have high affection. But I have to say at \nthe top of the list is a person whom I revere, a man by the name of Dan \nInouye from Hawaii.\n  Here is a man who has devoted his life to our country, and for \nsomeone to come on the Senate floor--even though the person doing that \nis my friend--and say what I believe are abusive things about Dan \nInouye is offensive to me and I think should be to the rest of the \nSenate.\n  This is a bill which is extremely important to our country. It is an \nemergency appropriations bill. Most of the money in this bill goes to \nthe wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and rightfully so. But there are other \nemergencies that come up from time to time. The disaster of Katrina was \nan emergency, but there are acts of God that take place.\n  One such act of God took place in Hawaii on the island of Kauai. \nRains lasted for 40 days and 40 nights, devastating that little island, \nbut in particular it broke a reservoir, killing seven people. Seven \npeople are dead.\n  Senator Inouye came to this Chamber and offered an amendment to have \nan emergency appropriation part of this bill. That is what it is.\n  For my friend, the distinguished Senator from Arizona, about whom we \nall care, to come and say to Senator Inouye, ``Have you no shame?'' \n``Have you no shame?''--to Dan Inouye, a Congressional Medal of Honor \nrecipient, on whom our country has bestowed the highest medal that can \nbe given to a person in the U.S. military for heroism. ``Have you no \nshame?'' Dan\n\n[[Page S3968]]\n\nInouye? The President declared that 40 days and 40 nights in Hawaii a \nPresidential declaration of an emergency. Senator Dan Inouye was doing \nhis job, as any one of us would do if we had torrential rains hitting \nour States.\n  We know how strongly John McCain feels about issues dealing with \nappropriations, but this is beyond the pale. This is beyond the pale to \nsay to Dan Inouye: ``Have you no shame?''\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3601\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn).

Mr. President, I would like to say that Senator Inouye \nand I have been friends for many years. I believe the process we are \ndoing--obviously, when I see billions and billions of dollars added to \nan emergency supplemental--is inappropriate and, of course, I in no way \nwould want to--in no manner would I want to offend my friend, Mr. \nInouye. If my remarks did so, I apologize for doing so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. McCain). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized for 10 minutes.\n\n\n                       Offsetting Future Spending\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, we are wrapping up the debate. It is \nfinished on this bill, and we are going to have votes in the morning.\n  I think we need to ask some questions. We have a supplemental bill. \nRegardless of the amount of it, it is here. I think there is a real \nquestion in the country, and there should be a real question for us, on \nwhy we are doing a supplemental bill on the war which we know is \nhappening, and also on projects associated with Katrina and Rita that \nwe know are going to come through the authorization and the \nappropriations process. I think we need to look at that as a Congress \nand say why are we doing that, and be very honest about why we are \ndoing it.\n  The second point I would make is, in emergency legislation we have a \nlot of things that really aren't emergencies. I think we as a body \nought to look at that and use self-discipline.\n  But the third point is, and this is the one I think the American \npeople are asking, we have a bill out here that is going to spend \nsomewhere between $94 billion and $108 billion of taxpayers' money, and \nthere was no attempt whatsoever to offset this spending--nothing. There \nwere attempts on the floor to change it, but there was no attempt to do \na rescissions bill. There was no attempt to look at the things where we \nknow there is wasteful spending. There was no attempt to look at some \nof these things. This is a list of $54 billion in potential rescissions \nthat I bet we could agree on $10 billion or $11 billion of if everybody \nknew the facts or the details. But we didn't do that. We didn't ask the \nAppropriations Committee to do that. It was not asked of them to do \nthat. It is not their fault. They weren't asked to do it. That is the \nquestion the American people ought to be asking. Where is the oversight \nto see if everything is running well?\n  If you ask the American people: Do you think the Federal Government \nis efficient, there is not going to be 1 or 2 percent that will say \nyes. If you ask the American people: Do you think we could do it more \nefficiently for less money, the vast majority of the American people \nwould agree with that. And that is probably true. If you ask Federal \nemployees, they will tell you that, too.\n  The question is, Why are we not doing it when we are spending money \nwe don't have? We ought to think about this the next time an emergency \nsupplemental comes around. We ought to make an effort to find the \noffsets, and we ought to work together across party lines to say how do \nwe secure the things we want. Some of those are different. If you are \nliberal or conservative, you may want different things. But if you are \ngoing to secure the future for those programs that help individuals and \ngo a long way in securing what we need to do to make sure people have \nan honest, even start in this country, things that are valuable in that \nregard--whether it be the Food Stamp Program or Head Start or something \nlike that--we are going to run out of money for those.\n  In 9 short years, 81 percent of our budget is going to be consumed by \nMedicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and interest. We should have the \ndiscipline to start now to make the significant changes that we need to \nmake to be able to handle that emergency that is coming. The real \nemergency is not right now. The emergency is going to happen starting \nin 2009.\n  I just ask that we look at that and think about it. How do we answer \nto the American public that we didn't try to trim any other type of \nspending as we spend $104 billion?\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). Who seeks recognition?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up \namendment No. 3819.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n\n[[Page S3969]]\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I make a point of order en bloc against a \nlist of amendments on the grounds that they are not germane under rule \nXXII.

Without objection, the point of order may be \nmade en bloc at this time.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I raise a point of order against these \namendments, that they are not germane under rule XXII.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair sustains the point of order with \nrespect to all the amendments.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. All the amendments that I read?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. My understanding is that the Chair sustains the point of \norder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair sustains the point of order on all \namendments.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate resumes \nthe supplemental appropriations bill tomorrow morning, the Senate \nproceed to consider votes on or in relation to the following, with no \nintervening action or debate or second-degree amendments:\n  Thune amendment No. 3705, and Vitter amendment No. 3728, as modified.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the bill be read a third time \nand the Senate proceed to a vote on passage with no intervening action \nor debate; provided further that following passage, the Senate insist \non its amendments and request a conference with the House, and the \nChair then be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the \nSenate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KOHL. The supplemental appropriations bill now pending before the \nSenate includes nearly $4 billion in emergency agriculture assistance. \nThis assistance is necessary for farmers and ranchers to recover from \nnatural disasters that have occurred over the past year. This \nassistance is not only related to the horrible storms that ravaged the \nGulf of Mexico coast last summer, but it also will be available for \nproducers across the country who have similarly suffered from floods, \nstorms, wildfires, drought, and other severe weather events.\n  Also included in this assistance package is a provision to provide \nsupplemental economic loss payments to producers of certain crops. The \nprimary purpose of this assistance is to help compensate for the impact \nof high energy costs on agricultural producers. We must remember that \nwhile many businesses can pass on increased costs of production to \nconsumers or other purchasers, the nature of the agriculture economy is \nsuch that farmers and ranchers are very limited in their ability to \npass on such costs. Yet the costs of fuel, electricity, and other \nenergy inputs are a very large part of the overall costs of \nagricultural production and when energy costs rise, as they have done \nin recent months, they put farming and ranching operations all across \nthe country at risk. Unfortunately, the provision now in the bill does \nnot apply to dairy producers.\n  During consideration of this supplemental appropriations bill by the \nFull Appropriations Committee, I pointed out to my colleagues that \ndairy producers are suffering from high energy costs as are producers \nof crops. I ask the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator \nCochran, if he recalls the discussion we had on that topic at that \ntime.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Yes. I say to the Senator from Wisconsin that I do \nrecall that discussion.\n  Mr. KOHL. It might be of interest to the chairman, and other \nSenators, to share some information I have received from the USDA \nOffice of the Chief Economist on the question of how energy costs \naffect various types of farming operations. I asked the Chief Economist \nif he could provide the amounts that farmers pay for direct fuels \ncosts, electricity, and indirect energy costs such as those associated \nwith the production of fertilizer and chemicals. According to that \noffice, using the most recent year for which these amounts are \navailable, 2004, producers of so-called program crops, including wheat, \ncorn, feed grains, rice, cotton oilseeds, and peanuts, paid a total of \n$9.9 billion for these sort of energy inputs. Of that total, corn had \nthe highest energy costs with $4.9 billion. Cotton producers came in \nsecond at $1.7 billion. On the other hand, peanut producers paid $145 \nmillion for these same costs. The average energy cost for these seven \ndifferent commodities, by commodity, was $707 million.\n  However, I would like to point out to my colleagues that the energy \ncosts of dairy producers, as described by the USDA Office of the Chief \nEconomist, was $2.2 billion. While dairy production was not the highest \nsingle commodity for energy costs, it did come in second and was three \ntimes greater than the average. While these costs were high in 2004, we \nall know what has happened, and is continuing to happen, to energy \ncosts since then.\n  I know the budget constraints that we face with regard to the pending \nsupplemental appropriations bill, and I am aware of the statement of \nPresident Bush in regard to his views on spending. However, I would \nlike to ask the chairman of the Appropriations Committee for his views \non this subject. I hope he would be willing to work with me in \nconference to ensure that in the event funds are provided for \nsupplemental economic assistance in a manner similar to what is \nprovided in the pending bill, that dairy producers will be able to \nparticipate in a program to help compensate for the high energy and \nother costs facing the agriculture sector.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Senator from Wisconsin for expressing his \nconcerns and for providing the specific information regarding the \neffect of energy costs on agriculture. The Senator is correct, we will \nbe under tremendous pressure in conference to limit the amount of \nspending in this bill. We all know how important the farming economy is \nto this country and how badly farm income is being impaired by high \nenergy costs. I would tell my friend from Wisconsin that I will work \nwith him, and other Senators, to make sure that all farmers are treated \nfairly. The Senator's point about the costs affecting dairy producers, \nalong with the others he mentioned, is well taken, and I hope an \naccommodation can be made to make sure all these farmers are treated \nequitably.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank the chairman.\n\n\n                        Army Modularity Programs\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I would like to engage my colleague from \nAlaska, Senator Ted Stevens, on a topic of importance to our Nation's \nmilitary and our industrial base. The issue of importance concerns \nadditional funding included by the House of Representatives for Bradley \nfighting vehicles and Hercules improved recovery vehicles. The House \nadded $250 million for Bradley ODS vehicles and another $100 million \nfor Hercules vehicles.\n  Mr. STEVENS. As the Senator from Pennsylvania knows, I am keenly \naware that these are important modularity programs for our Nation's \nArmy.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I want to thank the Senator from Alaska for his efforts \nto address these and other Army programs in this supplemental \nappropriations bill. I recognize that there are financial limitations \non what the Committee on Appropriations is able to do\n\n[[Page S3970]]\n\nwith respect to addressing the Army's recapitalization needs.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for his \nobservations on the realities of the appropriations process. Candidly, \nthere were more programs of need for the Army than there were resources \navailable to the committee. I am committed to working with conferees to \nthis bill in conference to try to address these two particular \nprograms.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank my colleague for his remarks and I stand ready \nto provide whatever assistance might be necessary to secure \nsupplemental appropriations funds for Bradley fighting vehicles and \nHercules improved recovery vehicles.\n\n\n                      public housing energy costs\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy with \nthe distinguished chairman and ranking member of the Transportation, \nTreasury, Judiciary, and HUD Subcommittee of the Committee on \nAppropriations.\n  As my colleagues know, rising home energy costs and high prices at \nthe pump are draining dollars out of our communities and the \npocketbooks of American families. This is money that could be spent on \nschool supplies, food and medicine, and retirement savings. The burden \nof high energy prices is disproportionately felt by low-income and \nworking class consumers, who do not have the disposal income to meet \nthese expenses. The unanticipated increases in energy costs due to \nHurricanes Katrina and Rita at the beginning of the 2005/2006 heating \nseason have had a significant impact on the ability of local housing \nagencies to effectively manage their public and section 8 housing \ninventories.\n  Nationwide, approximately 3 million families receive public housing \nor section 8 housing voucher assistance, which helps families pay for \nhousing costs, including utilities. In Rhode Island, public housing \nprovides homes for 16,000 households, 7,000 of whom are elderly or \ndisabled and 9,000 family members. The section 8 voucher program serves \nan additional 16,000 residents, 3,300 who are elderly or disabled, and \n12,173 family members. Public housing and the section 8 voucher \nprograms are important assets to communities and residents in Rhode \nIsland, making affordable housing available to many elderly, disabled, \nand working families. In 2004, the average rent for a two-bedroom \napartment in the State was $1,121. The average income needed for this \nrent is $45,000 per year, or $16.25 per hour. Teachers and librarians \nearn only an average of $40,685 per year in Rhode Island. Half of all \nRhode Island residents cannot afford the rent on the average two-\nbedroom apartment. The average hourly wage needed to afford a one-\nbedroom apartment in the State is $14.05. A minimum-wage employee, \nworking full time, would be able to afford $351 in rent.\n  Public housing agencies pay utility bills, and vouchers include an \nallowance for tenant-paid utilities. The Department of Housing and \nUrban Development's (HUD) budget for fiscal year 2006 for both public \nhousing and section 8 vouchers did not contemplate the growth in energy \ncosts that we have seen since the gulf coast hurricanes of 2005. The \n1.5-percent increase budgeted for utility payments is woefully \ninadequate this year.\n  For approximately 80 percent of public housing units, the local \nhousing agency pays directly for utilities. The local agency cannot pay \nincreased utility bills by raising rents. In the remaining 20 percent \nof public housing units, local agencies assist families, elderly, and \ndisabled persons to pay utility bills where these bills would tip \nhousing costs over 30 percent of income. HUD's public housing operating \nfund budget, which pays for utilities, for fiscal year 2006 \nincorporated only a 1.5-percent increase for rising energy costs, a \nlevel not close to the utility rate hikes experienced by local \nagencies. In 2005, public housing agencies received just 89 percent of \nthe amount necessary to cover basic maintenance and operations, and in \nfiscal year 2006, these agencies are expected to receive about 91 \npercent of necessary funding. Public housing agencies cannot absorb \nthese increases within their budgets or reserves. Without supplemental \nfunding, many agencies will be forced to again cut back on basic \nmaintenance and vital services to the elderly, disabled, and working \nfamilies they serve.\n  The section 8 voucher program is experiencing similar problems. About \n20 percent of assisted families have utilities included within their \nrental charges. For the remaining 80 percent, housing agencies provide \nthe family with a standard utility allowance based on energy \nconsumption for the housing unit where they live. HUD calculates the \nannual increases in voucher funding and the amount that agencies are \npermitted to pay on behalf of families for tenant-paid utilities based \non area housing cost estimates. Again, these calculations were \ndeveloped before' the recent increase in utilities. Housing agencies \nare required to recalculate and increase utility allowances for \nfamilies whenever utility costs increase by 10 percent or more. \nHowever, under the current ``budget-based'' method of funding vouchers, \nno additional funding will be provided midyear to accommodate these \nincreased costs. The failure to provide additional funding to local \nagencies for utility increases will create either greater rent burdens \nfor low-income families or force agencies to reduce the number of \nfamilies they assist within their limited budgets.\n\n  An example from my home State of Rhode Island is illustrative of what \npublic housing agencies are facing across the country. The Woonsocket \nPublic Housing Authority serves 1,300 families in public housing, \nincluding 650 senior citizens. While the agency is authorized to serve \n669 families with vouchers, the funding provided to the agency under \nthe budget-based voucher formula limits them to serving only 639 \nfamilies. Woonsocket has previously undertaken many energy-saving \nactivities; however, utility costs for electricity increased 100 \npercent in November/December 2005 over the same months in 2004. Natural \ngas increased 37 percent for the last 3 months of 2005. Utilities \ncosts, which were 30 percent of the operating costs, now have begun to \napproach 40 percent and could go to 50 percent.\n  For this reason, I filed an amendment to H.R. 4939, the emergency \nsupplemental appropriations bill, to provide $493 million to public \nhousing agencies to address rising energy costs for the section 8 \nvoucher program and public housing units. Unfortunately, the amendment \nis not germane postcloture and will not receive consideration. Local \nhousing agencies are not able to absorb these costs and meet their \nmission to ensure safe, decent, and affordable housing. I am \nparticularly worried that the problem will only be exacerbated as HUD's \nfiscal year 2007 budget projects a 1.8-percent decrease in utility \ncosts. Rising energy costs will remain a pressing issue for American \nfamilies and our local communities, and they need our assistance. I \nrecognize the difficult budget constraints that the chairman and \nranking member face this year as they begin the fiscal year 2007 \nappropriations process. I hope the chairman and ranking member can work \nwith me to address the growing problem of rising energy costs on local \nhousing agencies as they begin work on the fiscal year 2007 \nTransportation, Treasury, Judiciary, and HUD appropriations bill.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, local housing agencies in my State are also \nfacing these rising energy costs. The Housing Authority of Springfield \nexperienced a 28-percent increase in utility costs this winter during \nthe city's second warmest January and the warmest February in recorded \nhistory. This utility increase represents an approximate 6-percent \nincrease in the public housing agency's operating budget. As the \nSenator mentioned, many core programs within the subcommittee's \njurisdiction are facing deep cuts in the fiscal year 2007 budget \nrequest, and at this point, I am not certain what our allocation will \nbe for the fiscal year. The Senator raises an important concern, and I \nwill take a serious look at how these unbudgeted costs may be addressed \nso that local agencies can continue to manage their operations \nresponsibly.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I would second what the chairman has just \nstated about the budget constraints facing our subcommittee. I am \ncommitted to working with the Senator from Rhode Island during the \nfiscal year 2007 budget process to address these rising energy costs.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \ndiscuss\n\n[[Page S3971]]\n\nmy fire grant amendment to the Iraq and Hurricane Katrina emergency \nsupplemental bill. Although there are procedural reasons why I cannot \noffer this amendment at this time, it would provide an additional $100 \nmillion for firefighter assistance grants to address the 9/11 \nCommission's finding that Congress should give high priority to \nproviding funding for communications connectivity in high-risk areas.\n  We should implement the recommendations of the independent, \nbipartisan 9/11 Commission and finally protect our ports and airports, \nour borders and mass-transit systems, our chemical and nuclear power \nplants, and our food and water supplies from terrorist attack. In July \n2004, the 9/11 Commission submitted to Congress and the Nation a report \ncontaining 41 recommendations on how to improve intelligence operations \nand homeland security. In December 2004, Congress enacted the \nIntelligence Reform Act, ``the 9/11 Act'', authorizing several of these \nrecommendations. However, we have failed to live up to the commitments \nmade in the 9/11 Act.\n  Almost every single one of the recommendations made in the 9/11 Act \non homeland security has been significantly underfunded. In addition, \nthere has been a severe lack of leadership and competency at the \nDepartment of Homeland Security--culminating in the failed response to \nHurricane Katrina. On December 5, 2005, when the 9/11 Commission issued \nits final report card, it gave the administration and Congress a series \nof C's, D's, and F's on many areas in homeland security. These areas \ninclude port security, border security, aviation security, chemical \nplant security, and first responders. We should have an aggressive, \nrobust plan to secure our homeland, and this amendment would implement \none of the 9/11 Commission's recommendations.\n  In the 9/11 Commission's December 2005 report card, the \nadministration received an ``F'' on communications for first \nresponders. Indeed, Hurricane Katrina exposed that, 4 years after 9/11, \nlittle progress has been made in creating a system where police, fire, \nand emergency medical service departments can communicate with each \nother. Homeland Security's fiscal year 2007 budget decreases first \nresponder and homeland security funding by $400 million, which affects \nfirst responders across Illinois and throughout the Nation. Additional \nFederal funds are needed to protect our investments in homeland \nsecurity preparation and response.\n  Last year, more than $25 million was awarded to Illinois fire \ndepartments for equipment. Unfortunately, the fiscal year 2007 budget \nreduces funding for the Fire Program from $545 million to $293 million. \nThis program provides equipment and training to fire departments in \nIllinois and across the country to help them prepare and respond to \nterrorist incidents. One way to assist firefighters is to make sure \nthat they have the necessary equipment that makes it possible for them \nto communicate across departments and agencies.\n  In Illinois, STARCOM21 is the official statewide public safety two-\nway radio system. It has been designed to serve State, local, and \nFederal law enforcement agencies statewide by facilitating multi-agency \ncommunication through radio interoperability. This important program is \npart of a push by the Federal Government to address communication \nproblems experienced by first responders during national emergencies. \nAs part of its STARCOM program, Illinois has purchased and distributed \nradios to 698 law enforcement agencies at a cost of $3,899,630, for an \naverage cost of approximately $6,000 each; 755 fire departments at a \ncost of $4,531,580; and 212 emergency management, public health, and \nother agencies at a cost of $1,272,882. This is a total of 1,665 radios \nfor $9.7 million. This is a little more than half of the universe of \npublic safety agencies in the State. Illinois would like to provide \nadditional radios to some of the larger cities--there are 10 cities in \nIllinois with populations over 100,000 people--but Federal assistance \nis required.\n  My amendment addresses the 9/11 Commission's recommendation that \nfirst responders have interoperable communications equipment. My \namendment would provide an additional $100 million for interoperable \ncommunications equipment so that first responders can respond to \nnatural disasters, terrorist attacks, and other public safety needs. \nFire grants are already used by some jurisdictions for the purpose of \nobtaining communications equipment, and my amendment sets aside a pool \nof funding to encourage more departments to do so. This is important to \nhelp emergency responders field effective and reliable interoperable \ncommunications equipment to respond to natural disasters, terrorist \nattacks, and the public safety needs of America's communities.\n  The lack of interoperable communications for America's first \nresponders puts them and our communities in danger. Too many of our \npolice, fire, emergency medical services, and transportation officials \ncannot communicate with each other, and our local departments are not \nable to link their communications with State and Federal emergency \nresponse agencies. A June 2004 U.S. Conference of Mayors survey found \nthat 94 percent of cities do not have interoperable capability between \npolice, fire, and emergency medical services, and 60 percent of cities \ndo not have interoperable capability with the State emergency \noperations center. Almost half of the cities that responded to the \nsurvey said that a lack of interoperable communications had made \nresponse to an incident within the last year difficult. In November \n2003, OMB testified before Congress that there is insufficient funding \nin place to solve the Nation's interoperability problem, and it would \ncost more than $15 billion to begin to fix the problem.\n  I appreciate Senator Stabenow's work on this issue and her \ncosponsorship of this important amendment. This is such an important \nissue for firefighters in Illinois and across the country that when \nthere is another opportunity, I intend to bring this amendment before \nthe Senate, and I hope that my colleagues will consider supporting it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am a cosponsor of amendment 3662 by my \nfriend from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold. His amendment, which would \nhave ensured continued support for the Office of the Special Inspector \nGeneral for Iraq Reconstruction, was ruled ``nongermane'' by the \nParliamentarian.\n  This is inexplicable and unfortunate. But the real travesty is that \nthe majority, which could simply agree to accept this amendment, would \nprefer to hide behind the Parliamentarian's ruling and let it die.\n  By all accounts, with the exception of the snipes of some anonymous \nPentagon officials and their friends in the majority party who do not \nwant the colossal blunders of the Iraq reconstruction program exposed \nto the light of day, the special inspector general has done an \nexcellent job under difficult and dangerous conditions.\n  He has uncovered numerous instances of waste and fraud--some, \nshocking in their audacity--and there are dozens of investigations and \nprosecutions under way.\n  There is another $1.6 billion for Iraq reconstruction in this \nsupplemental for precisely the same types of activities that have been \nfunded under the Iraq relief and reconstruction fund.\n  But in this bill they are funded under traditional foreign operations \naccounts, not under the Iraq relief and reconstruction fund.\n  What this means is that, by not adopting the Feingold amendment, the \nspecial inspector general will not have oversight of these funds.\n  Apparently the idea is for the State Department inspector general to \ntake over this responsibility. But that office has no people in Iraq, \nno plan or budget to put people there, and no ability to do the job any \ntime soon. They have said so themselves.\n  This is nothing more than a transparent attempt to shut down the only \neffective oversight of this massive reconstruction program which has \nbeen plagued by mismanagement and fraud.\n  Projects have been poorly designed, grossly over priced, and many \nwill never be finished, while U.S. contractors such as Halliburton have \nmade off with huge profits.\n  We are told by our friends in the majority, acting on behalf of some \nin the Pentagon and the White House who want to shut down the Office of \nthe Special Inspector General, that they just want to return to the \n``regular order.'' That is their explanation for\n\n[[Page S3972]]\n\nturning this responsibility over to the State Department.\n  That is laughable. There is nothing that resembles the regular order \nin this multibillion-dollar supplemental, none of which is paid for. In \none breath they argue that they cannot pay for the war through the \nregular appropriations process because it is an extraordinary expense. \nIn the next breath they make the opposite argument to justify shutting \ndown the Office of the Special Inspector General.\n  If this were really about the regular order, the White House would \nsupport the amendment by Senator Byrd to pay the cost of this war, \nrather than continue to ignore the regular budget process and fund the \nwar off budget, leaving it to future generations to pay.\n  This is just another example of the hypocrisy of the President's \nbankrupt fiscal policy, and of those who continue to defend it in \nCongress. Use a figleaf to make it appear as if you support the regular \nbudget process when in fact you are weakening it. This also is the \nlatest example of the majority party's distaste and even disdain for \noversight and for the checks and balances in our system that are \nsupposed to root out corruption, waste, fraud and abuse and to make \ngovernment work better as government spends the taxpayers' hard-earned \ndollars.\n  The special inspector general has a difficult job. His job is to find \nthe truth, and sometimes the truth is hard for government agencies to \naccept. Sometimes they would rather not have the spotlight shined on \ntheir mistakes.\n  But the special inspector general works for American taxpayers, not \nfor the Pentagon, and not for Halliburton.\n  The Feingold amendment would have ensured continued oversight of the \nvery programs the special inspector general was created to oversee. I \nwant to commend him for his attention to this issue and his effort to \nprotect American taxpayers. By using a technical sleight-of-hand \nmaneuver to prevent the Senate from voting on this amendment--a vote \nthey know they would lose--the majority has dealt a blow to oversight \nof the shoddy, wasteful, and criminal failures of the Iraq \nreconstruction program.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate approved my \nlanguage to provide up to $8.5 million to the U.S. Institute of Peace \nin the emergency supplemental appropriations bill. This funding would \nallow USIP to continue critical democracy-building programs in Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  This $8.5 million will continue funding vital programs that are \nalready in place on the ground in Iraq but that are in danger of \nrunning out of money before the end of the summer. And I would like to \nassure my colleagues that USIP has a plan on how to use every dollar of \nthis funding.\n  BG Donald Alston, our chief military spokesman in Iraq, has \nacknowledged, and I quote, ``[The insurgency in Iraq] is not going to \nbe settled, the terrorists and terrorism in Iraq is not going to be \nsettled, through military options or military operations. It is going \nto be settled in the political process.''\n  Right now, a critical player in advancing that political process in \nIraq is the U.S. Institute of Peace, a nonpartisan organization created \nby Congress in 1984 to, among other duties, facilitate the resolution \nof international disputes, train international affairs professionals in \nconflict prevention, management, and resolution techniques, and \nstrengthen the education of emerging generations of young people in the \nUnited States and in foreign zones of conflict.\n  USIP has embraced that mission in Iraq. U.S. Institute of Peace \npersonnel are doing a magnificent job of facilitating interethnic and \ninterreligious dialogue and conflict resolution. They are training \nIraqi leaders at the national and local levels in democratic processes \nand rule-of-law programs. They bring unique experience and expertise in \nbuilding a democratic government and a robust civil society. And, \nobviously, this is all the more critical today, as we acknowledge that \nIraq's future will be decided in the political arena, not on the field \nof battle.\n  But there is a problem. The U.S. Institute of Peace is on the verge \nof running out of funds for its operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and \nall of its ongoing programs in those countries will be halted in the \ncoming months if we do not provide a necessary infusion of funds in \nthis emergency supplemental.\n  Some other amendments to this bill have been criticized because they \ndo not pertain to Iraq or Afghanistan and because they are not \nemergencies. That is definitely not the case in this situation. The \nU.S. Institute of Peace is at the heart of our efforts to achieve a \npolitical success in Iraq. And we are truly at an emergency juncture \nwhere the institute will have to cease operations if it does not \nreceive supplemental funding.\n  For fiscal year 2004, USIP received $10 million in funding for its \noperations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Those funds will be exhausted in a \nmatter of months. The Office of Management and Budget has proposed a \nsmall increase for next fiscal year. But meanwhile, we face a crisis, \nhere and now, that will require a shutdown in USIP operations at \nexactly the time when they are most urgently needed. The $8.5 million \ninfusion provided in the bill will allow those operations to continue \nand, in some cases, to expand.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, we are now spending \nalmost $6.4 billion a month in Iraq, overwhelmingly on combat \noperations. It would be penny wise and pound foolish to refuse to allow \nthis modest $8.5 million infusion to allow USIP's all-important \ndemocracy-building programs to go forward in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  The U.S. Institute of Peace is active in Iraq and Afghanistan on \nmultiple fronts. It has created networks of organizations and \nindividuals committed to a peaceful, democratic outcome in Iraq. It has \nengaged in successful outreach to the Sunni community and supported \nparticipation of marginalized groups in the political process, \nincluding minorities, women and the disabled.\n\n  In addition, the institute has trained hundreds of Iraqi officials in \nconflict resolution and negotiation strategies, as well as provincial-\nlevel government and civil society officials in conducting interethnic \ndialogue. It has supported Iraqi civil society projects that promoted \nintercommunal and interreligious tolerance, including a project with \nthe Iraqi Handicapped Association that brought together Iraqis of all \nfaiths and ethnicities to promote participation of Iraq's disabled in \nthe constitution process.\n  In my limited time, let me cite just three examples of the good work \nthat the institute is doing in Iraq:\n  Increasing regional stability. Iraq's neighbors have done little to \nhelp stabilize the country. So the Institute of Peace facilitated a \nseries of groundbreaking informal dialogues among leading foreign \npolicy and national security figures from Iraq and each of its six \nneighbors: Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Syria, Turkey, Iran and Kuwait. At \nthis meeting, participants identified and began to work on how to \naddress a number of challenges, including developing a regional \nreconciliation process to overcome deepseated cultural and political \nmisconceptions and prejudices creating a broad-based effort to improve \nsecurity promoting effective government inside Iraq, and building \nstronger economic ties.\n  Promoting Sunni engagement. Obviously, reaching out to Sunnis is \nvital to dealing with the insurgency. In March 2006, the institute \nconvened a meeting of Sunni political leaders and legal scholars to \ndiscuss the current constitution. Participants included Sunnis who \nrejected the approved constitution but who nevertheless joined in \ndesigning a strategy forward.\n  Creating a new generation of leaders. Almost half of the Iraqi \npopulation is under the age of 21. Long-term peace and development \ndepends on this generation developing democratic values. To this end, \nthe institute supported the establishment of a student society at the \nUniversity of Babylon-Hilla. This society is designed to foster freedom \nof expression and promote a culture of tolerance and respect for \ncitizens' rights among Iraqi youth. In 12 months, it disseminated \nthousands of copies of student-produced newsletters--al-Iraqi--and held \na total of 21 debates on controversial and timely issues, such as the \nrole of Islam, federalism, unemployment and terrorism. The student \nsociety has grown into the largest student organization on campus--\nlarger even than the Sadrist Islamic Student Union. The project is \ngalvanizing moderates and helping\n\n[[Page S3973]]\n\nmarginalize militants, providing an essential counterbalance to \nradicalization on campus.\n  Let me emphasize that this funding would also be used for programs in \nAfghanistan. In that country, the institute has been hard at work \nbuilding programs that promote the rule of law. As I am sure that my \ncolleagues are aware, while much progress has been made in Afghanistan, \nthere is a very real danger that the drug lords and warlords have ruled \nfor decades will gain traction and undo U.S. success in installing a \ndemocratic government. One way to combat that is through the \ntraditional mechanisms--councils of male village elders--that handle \nover 90 percent of legal disputes. The Institute of Peace has partnered \nwith the Afghan Ministry of Justice in developing a strategy that will \nenable the formal and informal legal systems to work together and \nensure that Afghans, in particular women and minorities, enjoy \nprotection of their rights. One tribal leader at an Institute of Peace \nmeeting said that his people want effective central government, but \nthat they have never had a government they can trust. The institute \naims to create the kind of legal system all Afghans can look to for \njustice with confidence.\n  The bottom line is that all of this good work being carried out by \nthe U.S. Institute of Peace in Iraq and Afghanistan will come to a \ncrashing halt in the months immediately ahead if we do not provide this \ninfusion of $8.5 million on an emergency basis. The institute's \ndemocracy-building efforts would end at exactly the time when they are \nmost urgently needed. That would be unconscionable. Millions of Iraqis \nare putting their lives on the line because of their commitment to \nbuilding democracy. We need to keep faith with those courageous Iraqis \nand their dream of a democratic Iraq.\n  Further, I would like to inform my colleagues that our U.S. \nAmbassador, Zalamay Khalilzad, who is currently serving in Iraq, was a \nmember of the USIP board of directors from November 1999 to May 2001, \nat which time he joined the National Security Council and had to leave \nthe board. Ambassador Negroponte who served in Iraq prior to Ambassador \nKhalilzad called on USIP to assist him in calling together Iraqi \nreligious leaders, and they would all meet in USIP's Iraq office. I am \nsure they would both join me in commending the work of the U.S. \nInstitute of Peace.\n  But before I finish my remarks I would like to take a few moments to \nspeak about the history of the U.S. Institute of Peace.\n  The U.S. Institute of Peace is a unique organization. Throughout our \nlong history, America has been proud of its strong, well-led military. \nAnd this outstanding military leadership is no accident. It is possible \nbecause we maintain prestigious, world-class military academies which \ntrain some of the best and brightest minds in America in the art and \nscience of war.\n  But Americans also have a long history as a peace-loving people. Time \nand again, we have brokered peace between warring nations, and we have \nintervened to head off potential conflicts. The Institute of Peace \ndraws on this proud tradition and today makes a vital intellectual \ninvestment in the art and science of peacemaking.\n  Today's Institute of Peace is the fruit of a dream and vision that \ngoes back to our Nation's Founders. Benjamin Banneker, often called \n``the first black American man of science,'' and physician Benjamin \nRush, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, noted and lamented \nthe Constitution's failure to establish a Department of Peace to \nbalance the Department of War. In their correspondence with Thomas \nJefferson in 1792, Banneker and Rush envisioned a ``Peace Office'' \nwhich would be on an equal footing with the Department of War and would \nbe charged with promoting and preserving perpetual peace in the United \nStates.\n  George Washington also supported the establishment of a Peace Office. \nAnd his support was not just casual. He believed that such an office \nshould be an essential pillar of the new Nation. When he died in 1799, \nWashington's last will and testament bequeathed in perpetuity 50 acres \nin Potomac County to be used ``toward the endowment of a university--\nunder the auspices of the general Government.'' This bequest was \nintended to make possible the proper ``Peace Establishment'' that \nPresident Washington had written about as early as 1783.\n  In a 1980 report, the Matsunaga Commission strongly recommended the \nestablishment of the United States Academy of Peace. In the course of \nmore than 70 meetings and hearings all across the United States, \nSenator Matsunaga of Hawaii and other Senators surveyed the full range \nof threats to world peace and explored ways to counter those threats.\n  After much thoughtful debate, a compromise was reached, and the \nUnited States Institute of Peace Act was passed and signed into law by \nPresident Ronald Reagan in 1984. A board was installed, and the \ninstitute's first meeting was held in February 1986. Since that time, \nthe institute has done remarkable work in such disparate nations as \nAfghanistan and Korea, Bosnia and the Philippines.\n  Today, at the direction of Congress, the Institute actively pursues \nsix interrelated activities: expanding society's knowledge about the \nchanging nature and conduct of international relations and the \nmanagement of international conflict; supporting policymakers in the \nlegislative and executive branches; facilitating the resolution of \ninternational disputes; training international affairs professionals \nfrom the United States and abroad in conflict prevention, management, \nand resolution techniques; strengthening the education of emerging \ngenerations of young people in the United States and in foreign zones \nof conflict; and increasing public understanding about the nature of \ninternational conflicts, as well as approaches to their prevention, \nmanagement, and resolution.\n  Mr. President, the USIP deserves our support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/03/senate-section/article/S3973-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3973]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak on our Nation's \nfiscal situation. Today, the Senate is considering about a $100 billion \nsupplemental funding bill that our Federal Government requires to \nfulfill its domestic and foreign obligations. While I acknowledge this \nfunding is needed in many areas at home and abroad, most notably with \nour commitments to fight the war on terror, rebuild after the \ndevastations of Katrina and Rita and protecting our borders, the \noccasion of passing a $100 billion supplemental bill is an opportunity \nthat I cannot pass up to remind the Senate of where our Nation's \noverall fiscal health lies.\n  In a nutshell, our fiscal health is in dire straits. In the most \nsimple terms, the Federal Government continues to spend more than it \ntakes in. I hope my colleagues agree that the running the charge cards \nfor today's needs and leaving the bill for our children and \ngrandchildren should not be the policy that this body pursues.\n  When I came to the Senate in 1999, the national debt stood at $5.6 \ntrillion. Today, as the chart shows, the national debt stands at $8.4 \ntrillion. Since I came to the Senate in 1999, we have had an increase \nin the national debt of about 50 percent. The chart shows the last 4 \nyears how we have climbed the ladder, and the Treasury will be back \nasking us to raise the debt limit.\n  As a percentage of gross domestic product, our national debt has \ngrown from being 58 percent of gross domestic production at the end of \n2000 to an estimated 66.1 percent of gross domestic production by the \nend of 2006.\n  Undoubtedly, the United States has undergone unprecedented challenges \nthat have spurred these fiscal issues. The tragedy of September 11 to \nfighting the war on terror at home and abroad, to hurricanes Katrina \nand Rita, to the rollout of the new Medicare prescription drug plan, \nthe largest\n\n[[Page S3974]]\n\nexpansion of Medicare Programs since its creation, our Nation has had \nto respond to challenges of tremendous magnitude. In responding to \nthose challenges, the Federal Government has had the responsibility to \nprovide the resources so that the country could confront these \nchallenges head on.\n  The Federal Government rightly appropriated $20 billion to help New \nYork, hundreds of billions to provide our war fighters with the \nnecessary equipment to provide for our national security and now well \nover $100 billion to help rebuild the gulf coast. We are dealing with \nall of these expenses, but we are ignoring the 800-pound gorilla in the \nroom, the impending tidal wave of entitlements coming due.\n  I was pleased this President in the State of the Union Address \nacknowledged that:\n\n       The retirement of the baby boom generation will put \n     unprecedented strains on the federal government. By 2030, \n     spending for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid alone \n     will be almost 60 percent of the entire federal budget. And \n     that will present future Congresses with impossible choices \n     staggering tax increases, immense deficits, or deep cuts in \n     every category of spending.\n\n  I am pleased the President decided to focus on what some call the \ndemographic tsunami coming our way and the necessity to reform \nentitlement programs before it hits. The 77 million baby boomers coming \ninto the Social Security and Medicare Program will put the Federal \nbudget under unprecedented pressure. Chairman Gregg took the courageous \nsteps to take on entitlement spending through the Deficit Reduction Act \nof 2005. I supported his efforts.\n  However, this was just the tip of the iceberg. The truth is, we have \nnot been serious about entitlement reform. The President called for a \nbipartisan commission to examine the full impact of baby boom \nretirements on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid in his State of \nthe Union Address. It is imperative we move on this quickly. \nUnfortunately, we are still waiting for the commission to be appointed. \nTime is of the essence, and I hope that Secretary Snow and the \nadministration will move quickly on creating that commission.\n  Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, make up a significant portion of \nmandatory spending and mandatory spending is crowding out other parts \nof the budget. This chart shows in the year 1965 mandatory spending was \n27 percent of our budget. In 1985, now we see mandatory spending makes \nup 42 percent, 44 percent is discretionary, and 14 percent is the \ninterest on our debt. Now, in the year 2005, from 1985 to 2005, \nmandatory spending has jumped from 42 percent to 53 percent, and \ndefense is 20 percent, nondefense is 19 percent, interest is 7 percent, \nand we have been lucky in terms of the interest costs because of the \nfact that our interest rates are very low today.\n  If we ever see an uptake in interest costs, we can go back to what \npercentage went toward interest. When I came to the Senate in 1999, our \ninterest costs were about 13 percent, so they have gone down, but the \nfact of the matter is we need to be realistic about the fact that they \nare not always going to be as low as they are today, and if they go up, \nthey will just gobble up more of the Federal budget.\n  According to the reports from Medicare and Social Security trustees, \nthe trust funds for these programs will be exhausted even earlier than \npreviously thought. According to the trustees report that came back \nlast week, the cost of Social Security and Medicare will grow from \nnearly 7.4 percent of the economy today to 12.7 percent by 2030, \nconsuming approximately not just 60 percent as predicted by the \nadministration but 70 percent of all Federal revenues, crowding out all \nother discretionary spending. No matter which way you look at it, if we \nleave reform of entitlement programs for future Congresses to solve, as \nwell as a mountain of national debt to pay off, it will have \ndevastating consequences on the economy and on our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  Some Members believe that the solution is to grow the economy out of \nthe problem, that by cutting taxes permanently the economy will \neventually raise enough revenue to offset any current losses to the \nU.S. Treasury. I respectfully disagree with that assertion. I do not \nbelieve that in the current situation our country faces, we can \ncontinue to spend more than we take in.\n  By the General Accounting Office's own estimates, about 35 years from \nnow, that is when my grandchildren have their own children to care for, \nbalancing the budget would require actions as large as cutting total \nFederal spending by 60 percent or raising taxes 2.5 times what they are \nat today's level.\n  Our friends overseas and Europe are experiencing what we will \nexperience if we do not get a hold of our finances.\n  In November 2005, former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan \ntestified before the Joint Economic Committee and told Congress:\n\n       We should not be cutting taxes by borrowing. We do not have \n     the capability of having both productive tax cuts and large \n     expenditure increases, and presume that the deficit doesn't \n     matter.\n\n  That is exactly what we have been doing the last several years.\n  I have said many times on this floor that our major problem is we are \nunwilling to pay for or go without what we want to get done. We have \nbeen willing, time and time again, to put the cost of our current \nspending on the credit cards of our children and grandchildren. To be \ncandid and fair, we had no choice in much of the spending since 9/11. \nThe Federal Government had to rebuild after 9/11. We have made the \ndecision to increase security for the homeland. We have to fund the war \nin Iraq and Afghanistan. And we have to rebuild after the devastation \nof dealing with Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. In other words, our costs \nare something we have not been able to control because of the war \nabroad, securing our homeland, and these hurricanes which were \nunprecedented in our country's history.\n  While we have had to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on these \nevents, the Senate has made the decision to squeeze the nondefense \ndiscretionary budget. In fact, the pendulum has swung from the Senate \nspending money like drunken sailors during the first years I was here \nto now cutting these nondefense discretionary accounts to the bone in \nthe name of fiscal responsibility.\n  Unfortunately, fiscal responsibility cannot be defined solely by \nrestraining and cutting nondefense discretionary spending. These \naccounts are only one-fifth of the budget and, frankly, with some of \nthe cuts to these accounts, I believe we are eating our seed corn in \nthe name of fiscal responsibility.\n  I would be the first to cut the excess out of the budgets. I only \nhave to think back to my mayoral days and my Governor days. As mayor of \nCleveland, we inherited the first major city in the United States to \ndefault on its loans since the Great Depression. By making tough \nchoices, we turned the city around.\n  As Governor, we faced a no less daunting challenge. We came into \noffice in a $1.5 billion hole. We scoured through line by line and went \nthrough four rounds of cuts in the State budget. After the fourth cut, \nthe math still did not add up. We had to raise revenues to meet the \nresponsibilities of the State--a solution that was not easy. But at the \nend of the day, it was necessary because--do you know what--we had to \nbalance our State budget.\n  I had to balance my budgets when I was the mayor of the city of \nCleveland. Unfortunately, we do not have to balance our budgets here in \nWashington. After getting back on even keel, we were able to reduce \ntaxes in each of the last 3 years of my administration. But we had to \nget back on even keel.\n  I view the situation our Nation faces today in a very similar light. \nWe are in a heck of a spot. Our Nation has faced extraordinary costs \nthat could not be foreseen. And at the same time, we are talking about \nreducing revenues. We have cut nondefense discretionary spending, and I \nam sure there are those who believe we can cut more. I think we have \ncome to the point where we need to face reality. These numbers just do \nnot add up.\n  Now, I want to say that I am not against tax cuts. In other words, I \nhave been for it. I supported tax cuts in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004. In \n2001, we were facing a starkly different fiscal picture than we have \ntoday. I think it is really important to understand that. The fiscal \npicture today is entirely different than when we started the tax cuts \nin 2001. The surplus over 10 years was estimated to be $5.6 trillion--a \nlot of money. Congress, as I mentioned, spent\n\n[[Page S3975]]\n\nmore money in 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2001 than they should have. This \nled most of us to want to get that money off the table so it could not \nbe spent. I supported this because of what I referred to as the three-\nlegged stool: pay down the debt, fiscal responsibility, and tax cuts--\nthe three of them.\n  On June 7, 2001, the President signed the Economic Growth and Tax \nRelief Reconciliation Act. I voted for this bill which reduced the \nindividual income tax rates that apply to taxable income, increased the \nchild tax credit to $1,000, and extended it to smaller families, \naddressed the marriage penalty, phased out the Federal estate tax over \nthe period 2002 to 2010, provided a temporary reduction in the \nalternative minimum tax, and provided some savings incentives and \nchildcare credits.\n  After 9/11, I joined the Centrist Coalition to accelerate these cuts \nto provide a short-term stimulus to our economy. The House passed this \nbill, but it stalled in the Senate because of partisan politics.\n  In 2003, our country was still reeling from September 11, the war \nagainst terror, and corporate accounting scandals. We were in \nrecession. We needed additional stimulative medicine. But I fought to \nensure that the tax cuts were the right amount. I joined with Senators \nOlympia Snowe, John Breaux, and Max Baucus to get the $350 billion that \nwe passed in 2003.\n  On May 28, 2003, the President signed the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief \nReconciliation Act into law. We accelerated the cuts from the 2001 tax \nbill, such as the individual income tax cuts, the marginal rates, the \nchild tax credit, the marriage penalty relief, extended the AMT again, \nand reduced the rate on both dividends and capital gains to 15 percent \nfor higher tax brackets and 5 percent for those in the lower tax \nbrackets for 2003 to 2008.\n  One of the reasons we said only $350 billion was that we were \nconcerned about the cost of the war and homeland security. And we were \nright. Our national defense and homeland security costs have added up \nto $2.3 trillion since then.\n  Since 2003, when we decided to provide accelerated tax cuts, our \nnational defense and homeland security costs have added up to $2.3 \ntrillion.\n  Can you imagine where we would have been if the $1.57 trillion the \nadministration initially proposed or even the $725 billion tax cut that \nwas being considered at the time by the House of Representatives was \nactually passed? Just think what our deficit and national debt would be \ntoday. The negative consequences of such cuts adding to our national \ndebt would have outweighed any positive stimulus effect.\n  I said that $350 billion in tax cuts would be enough to get the \neconomy and the stock market moving then and now, and it worked. In \nother words, what we did is we front-end loaded that $350 billion tax \ncut to really give us some oomph so we would kick this economy into \ngear. And it worked. The economy and the stock market have moved.\n\n  I can still remember people saying: The market is never going to \nrecover. I heard, several years ago: It is never going to get back to \nwhere it was. And the fact is, it has. The Nation's GDP grew by over 4 \npercent in both 2003 and 2004, and 3.5 percent in 2005, and \nunemployment has dropped since we enacted tax cuts from 6.6 percent to \nthe current 4.7 percent. And we just announced that in the first \nquarter of this year, our GDP growth is over 4 percent and more \nAmericans are working. Unfortunately, we are not seeing this in the \nState of Ohio. We are still under a great deal of duress because of the \nloss of our manufacturing jobs.\n  However, the world does not stand still, and we now face different \nchallenges. While this tax cut stimulation worked, making these tax \ncuts permanent should be subject to pay-go, as Alan Greenspan said, or \n``serious economic disruptions'' will result. We need to cut expenses \nor pay for them with other tax increases.\n  Now, let's look at the costs of some of the tax cuts we passed. These \nare all going to be under consideration, and we will have people \nsaying: We have to extend all of them.\n  The credit for research and experimentation, that is $81.2 billion; \ndeduction of State and local sales taxes is $41.5 billion; increased \nAMT exemption amount, $437.5 billion; hurricane relief--I will leave \nthat one alone; subpart F for active financing income, $45.2 billion; \nreduced tax rate on repatriated dividends, $57 billion; section 179 \nexpensing, $15.9 billion; reduced tax rates on capital gains, $63.4 \nbillion; empowerment and renewal zones, $11.7 billion; child tax \ncredit, $184.8 billion. Let's see. I won't hit them all. Estate and \ngift tax changes--estate and gift tax changes. Do you hear that? We are \ntalking about killing the death tax? We are talking about $357 \nbillion--$357 billion. And the income tax rates of 25, 28, 33, and 35 \npercent, if we keep those, will cost us $384.8 billion.\n  All I am saying is, if you add up all of the things that are going to \ncome to us during the next couple of years, we are talking about--what \nis that--$2.353 trillion. Do you hear that? It is $2.353 trillion. It \njust does not make sense.\n  As we see on the chart, according to CBO, the dividend and capital \ngains tax cuts will result in roughly about $193.1 billion in revenue \nloss to the Treasury. If we were to permanently repeal the estate tax--\nI have already mentioned that. Consider that the alternative minimum \ntax will cost us $511 billion. I support recent statements from the \nWhite House that AMT should be considered as part of tax reform, but \nuntil that happens, we are forced to confront this issue every year.\n  Everybody is complaining about the AMT. They want the AMT. They want \nthe dividend tax reduction to continue, the capital gains. You name it. \nThey want it all. And just these tax items on this chart--to repeat--\n$2.35 trillion over 10 years. Are we willing to add to our deficit and \ndebt to continue these cuts?\n  Let's list the numbers again, look at them again: unbalanced budgets \nsince 2001 last year's deficit was $318 billion; a rising national debt \nof $8.4 trillion--and that has increased, as I have said, by 50 percent \nsince 1999--the war on terror has cost us $450 billion, plus $160 \nbillion on homeland security since 9/11.\n  One of the things people do not understand is that Homeland Security \nhas 22 agencies, 180,000 employees. They have doubled the budget of \nthose 22 agencies since 9/11. As a matter of fact, if you look at other \nmoney we spent on homeland security, they have actually tripled the \nbudget since that time.\n  Katrina has cost us over $100 billion and continues to rise, and the \nMedicare Part D plan is now projected to cost over $1 trillion from \n2006 to 2015.\n  With significant unmet domestic needs and the looming cost to the \nTreasury of the baby boomers' retirement programs--which by \nconservative estimates from the administration will consume 70 percent \nof the entire Federal budget by 2030--what kind of economy is lurking \naround the corner in 2011?\n  Instead of making the tax cuts permanent, we should be leveling with \nthe American people about the fiscally shaky ground we are on. What we \nshould be doing is spending our time on tax reform. We all know that \nfundamental tax reform is critical, and as we consider the tax \nprovisions, such as the AMT, as I just mentioned, it becomes clearer \nand clearer we need to overhaul our Tax Code. So I simply cannot \nunderstand why some of my colleagues want to make so many provisions of \nthe current Tax Code permanent or add new tax cuts when we very well \nmay be eliminating precisely the same provisions as part of fundamental \ntax reform. No homeowner would remodel their kitchen and bathroom right \nbefore tearing down the house to build a newer and better one.\n  As the one who amended and pushed for the creation of the task force \non tax reform in 2003 and 2004, I was delighted when the President, in \nhis convention acceptance speech, said he would move forward with tax \nreform. In fact, 2 days after the convention--Ohio was sitting right in \nfront of the President when he was giving his acceptance speech. He \nsaid: When I mentioned tax reform, I watched you, Voinovich. He said: \nYou jumped out of your seat, and I thought you were going to run up and \nhug me because you were so happy we were going to do the tax reform.\n  I have to say that I am disappointed. I feel bad that the \nadministration has backed away from tax reform as a priority, since \nsimplifying the Code to make it more fair and honest could, by some \nestimates, save taxpayers over\n\n[[Page S3976]]\n\n$265 billion in costs associated with preparing their taxes. That would \nbe a real tax reduction. And do you know what. It would not cost the \nTreasury one darn dime. It would be a tax cut that would guarantee that \npeople are paying their fair share and would bring more money into the \nFederal Treasury.\n  According to the Tax Foundation, we lose about 22 cents of every \ndollar of income tax collected in compliance costs. It adds up to the \ncombined budgets of the Departments of Education, Homeland Security, \nJustice, Treasury, Labor, Transportation, Veterans Affairs, Health and \nHuman Services, and NASA.\n  In a recent conversation with Rob Portman, a longtime friend of mine, \nwho is our new OMB Director, I communicated my call for Tax Code \nreformation. I said if the President wanted to leave a real lasting \nlegacy, a real lasting legacy to the American people, something he \ncould point back to and be very proud of, he would keep his promise to \nthe American people to undertake tax reform.\n  If we keep going the way we are, his legacy may be a big tax increase \nin 2009 or 2010 or 2011, one like his father was forced to make in \n1991. I believe--and I have the greatest respect for the President and \nhis father--his father was a profile in courage. He bit the bullet and \ndid what was right for the country and, in the process, probably lost \nan election.\n  If we are going to provide the American people a clear picture of the \nshape of our fiscal house, we should be honest about the long-term \nproblems underneath the facade of our fiscal house. Currently, we are \ndistorting our Federal financial statements by borrowing from hundreds \nof Federal trust funds. In addition to the $1.6 trillion we have \nborrowed from the Social Security trust fund, we have borrowed over \n$660 billion from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, \n$177 billion from the military retirement fund, and smaller amounts \nfrom almost 130 Federal trust funds. In all, we have borrowed almost \n$3.3 trillion of funds intended for other purposes. All of this has \nadded to our $8.4 trillion national debt.\n  I believe we should keep the shrinking Social Security surplus \nseparate. It is important to set these funds so that the Federal \nGovernment will have real assets that can be used to redeem existing \nspecial issue Treasury bills when Social Security stops generating \nsurpluses in 2017. When we were looking at Social Security reform, it \noccurred to some of us that it would be useless to reform the program \nif the surplus money still went to general revenues. If we shore up the \nsystem without keeping the funding for it separate, the benefit of \nSocial Security reform could simply be spent on other related programs. \nIn other words, if we bite the bullet, reform Social Security, take in \nmore money and don't put it aside so we can't touch it, we will just \nuse it. We will be back where we were before. So we have to figure out, \nif we are going to do this, how we put the money aside.\n  One of the things I have worked on--and I have introduced a bill with \nSenator Conrad--is that we would stop the raid on Government trust \nfunds. It not only holds revenues designated for Social Security \nprograms separate from general revenues, it also would make Federal \nfinancing more transparent. People would know what the public debt is. \nIn other words, we would fundamentally borrow from the public the money \nthat we have been taking from the trust funds, and we would know that \nthe money in the trust funds would be there because it would not be in \nFederal investments.\n  At this time we need reliable financial and performance information \nto make sound policy decisions. If we were in business, we would be in \nsubchapter 11, absolutely. We need to bring transparency to our budget \nso that all the American people have a better understanding of the hard \nchoices we have to make.\n  Typically the American people have not tolerated a tax level of any \nmore than 20 percent of GDP. We reached that level of almost 21 percent \nwhen the tax cuts we enacted made revenues decrease quickly. The real \ndanger is the divide between our revenue and spending once the baby \nboomers start to retire. This dotted line is going to rise to levels \nnot given on this chart. In other words, this dotted line is going to \ngo way up in terms of dealing with our outlays. The revenues, as you \ncan see, they were up pretty high. This is 1980. They went up. Then we \ngot over here when we were flush, and they went up to here. Now the \nrevenues are down here and then coming here. This line of spending is \ngoing to go right off the chart, as I mentioned before, because of \nMedicare, Medicaid, and Social Security.\n  The American people should understand what this is about. We are \nreally in trouble. The question is, if we don't have enough revenue to \npay our current bills, how in the world are we going to prepare to \ncover much larger future promises? How are we going to take care of \nthis? In the big picture of where the United States stands, it is clear \nto me that the economic framework of our Nation needs to be \nrefurbished. There are certain investments and responsibilities that \nthis Senator believes we can no longer ignore and must address.\n  We should be rebuilding an infrastructure of competitiveness so that \nfuture generations at least have the same opportunity that we had for \nthe standard of living and quality of life we have. We need to build \nwhat I referred to earlier. We are in a competitive global marketplace. \nWhat we have to understand is, if we don't build the infrastructure of \ncompetitiveness to compete in that marketplace, our children's standard \nof living is going to be less than what ours is today.\n  One of the things I also think we need to understand is the fact that \nour infrastructure has been ignored for too long. It is a critical \npiece to making America more competitive. I have introduced the \nNational Infrastructure Improvement Act with Senators Clinton and \nCochran. The bill establishes the National Commission on the \nInfrastructure of the United States which would study infrastructure \nthroughout the Nation, including surface transportation facilities such \nas roads, bridges, mass transit facilities, freight and passenger rail, \nairports, wastewater collection, and treatment facilities, waterways \nand levees. I was a cosponsor of the highway bill, but I thought the \nlegislation was modest given the need.\n  Frankly, it falls far short of the level that would improve or even \nmaintain our Nation's highway system. According to the Federal Highway \nAdministration, $107 billion is needed annually to maintain and improve \nour highways and bridges. The enacted highway bill provides $70.4 \nbillion below what is needed to improve and $38.8 billion below what is \nneeded to maintain our highway system. We also desperately need to \nprovide increased funding for the Army Corps of Engineers, including \nfunding for levees and funding for additional civil engineers. This \nNation has an aging national water resources infrastructure. We saw it \nwith Katrina. If we continue to ignore the upkeep, the deterioration of \nour locks and dams, flood control projects and navigation channels, we \nrisk destruction of waterborne commerce, decreased protection against \nfloods, as we saw in Katrina, and other environmental damage.\n  I have been concerned about the backlog of unfunded Corps projects \nsince I was chairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation and \nInfrastructure in 1999. When I arrived in the Senate in 1999, I was \nchairman of that committee. The backlog of unfunded corps projects for \noperation and maintenance was $250 million. Today the backlog is $1.2 \nbillion. In 2001, there was $38 billion in active water resource \nprojects waiting for Federal funding. Today it is $41 billion in active \nconstruction and general projects that need Federal funding. This \nbudget is only going to increase this backlog. Our budget proposes a \n33-percent cut in the Corps construction budget. Can you imagine? After \nKatrina and what we saw in New Orleans in terms of not spending the \nmoney to maintain the levees and build them the right way, we are \ncutting the construction budget 33 percent, and a 42-percent cut in the \nCorps investigations budget.\n\n  Currently, the Corps is able to function only at 50 percent capacity \nat the rate of funding proposed by the budget. Can you believe this? It \nis incredible. We also cannot remain competitive without a workforce \nfull of educated and motivated young Americans.\n  As a Nation, we have to invest in our children and enable them to \nfully develop their God-given talents in order\n\n[[Page S3977]]\n\nto compete in a knowledge-based global economy. We have to have \nknowledge-based jobs if our people are going to work. This means we \nhave to place more emphasis on careers in science, engineering, and \nmath. Right now we are not getting the job done.\n  Globally, the United States ranks 17th in the proportion of the \ncollege-age population earning science and engineering degrees, down \nfrom third place several decades ago. In fact, the percentage of 24-\nyear-olds with science or engineering degrees is now higher in many \nindustrialized nations. Countries such as England, South Korea, \nGermany, Australia, Singapore, Japan, and Canada all produce a higher \npercentage of science and engineering graduates than we.\n  The National Academy of Sciences released a report this fall, \nentitled ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm,'' that recommends action \nthe Federal Government should take to enhance our ability to compete in \na global marketplace. The recommendations range from those that will \nimprove our Nation's math and science course work and establish a \nworkforce of qualified teachers who will prepare our students for \nfutures in highly innovative careers to the critical need for energy \nindependence and investment in research. It is hard for me to believe \nthe statistics that came out of the report. Half the teachers who teach \nmath and science today are not qualified to teach the subjects.\n  I did a survey of our State universities to find out how many people \ngraduated to teach physics. Thirteen was the number. How in the world \ncan we keep going with that kind of record?\n  I am encouraged that the President recognized that America needs to \nwake up and build a new infrastructure for competitiveness, and I \napplaud his American competitiveness agenda. Also, I joined a number of \nmy colleagues as an original cosponsor of the Protecting America's \nCompetitive Edge Act, or PACE. This legislation is aimed at improving \nour Nation's competitiveness through advancement and emphasis on math \nand science education. Like the President's initiative, this \nlegislation is comprehensive and it is aimed to increase our Nation's \nresearch capacities and emphasize strong science and math education. \nHowever, it will require a larger national commitment to reengage our \nNation's youth in science and math, similar to our response in the late \n1950s to Russia's launch of Sputnik and the ensuing space race.\n  Here the President's budget falls far short of what is necessary to \nfulfill the recommendations of the report. In other words, if we are \ngoing to really do something about this crisis that we have in terms of \nmath and science, we are going to have to fund the recommendations from \nthe National Academy of Sciences. The only thing that is being funded \nright now in the President's competitiveness agenda is retraining of \nteachers in high school, making the research and development credit \npermanent, and doing some work in research that will help us deal with \nour energy crisis. The portion of the report that talks about \nscholarships from the Department of Energy is not funded. The report \ncalls for 25,000 scholarships out of the Department of Energy at \n$20,000 a year to encourage people to study engineering.\n  It also provides out of the Department of Education $20,000 a year \nfor students to take math, science, information technology, and \neducation courses. And they commit that after 5 years they will teach \nfor 5 years. In other words, they will get their undergraduate degree \nand teach for 5 years. During those 5 years, the National Science \nFoundation will pay them $10,000 more than what the local school \ndistrict pays them. So it is a real comprehensive effort to deal with \nthe crisis that we have today in terms of providing the scientists we \nneed to get the job done.\n  The bottom line is, we don't need less revenue; we need more revenue. \nAs a Wall Street Journal article states:\n\n       Federal taxes amounted to 17.5 percent of gross domestic \n     product, up from a modern low of 16.3 percent in 2004.\n\n  That is one of the reasons the debt has gone up so much, like a \nrocket. It is because in 2004, we were only taking in 16.3 percent of \nour GDP in revenue. But it was well below the high of 21 percent that \nwe had in 2000. That was too much.\n  Continuing from the Wall Street Journal:\n\n       Keeping the tax burden low is going to be difficult. Last \n     year, the federal government's spending exceeded its tax take \n     by about $318 billion. And the retirement of the baby-boom \n     generation starting in 2011 could cause spending on big-\n     ticket federal retirement programs to jump.\n\n  That is the quote from the Wall Street Journal. The only thing that \nbothers me about the quote is that they reported the debt last year of \n$318 billion. That is what they reported. The fact is, from an accrual \nbasis--it comes out of the Department of the Treasury--we increased the \ndebt by $740 billion. But we only report to the American people $318 \nbillion. Several weeks ago, we were talking about the fact that the \nTreasury announced that on an accrual basis we increased our debt by \nthat amount of money. Someone said, why don't we keep our books on the \naccrual basis? Somebody said, for goodness sakes, we cannot do that \nbecause they will find out how much in debt we are and how much our \nbudgets are not balanced.\n\n  So I think that with the baby boom generation starting to retire in \n2011, we will have some real problems. The simple fact is we cannot \nhave it all. We need to set priorities and make hard choices; \notherwise, our children will end up paying for it. Our forefathers \nrecognized the inequity of passing on debt to future generations. \nGeorge Washington in his Farewell Address stated:\n\n       [Avoid] the accumulation of debt, not only by shutting \n     occasions of expense, but by vigorous exertion in time of \n     peace to discharge the debts which unavoidable wars may have \n     occasioned, not ungenerously throwing upon posterity the \n     burden which we ourselves ought to bear.\n\n  Again, he said ``not ungenerously throwing upon posterity the burden \nwhich we ourselves ought to bear.''\n  I have to say this, and I know it is controversial, but if you look \nat the extraordinary costs that we had with the war and homeland \nsecurity and Katrina, the logical thing that one would think about is \nto ask for a temporary tax increase to pay for them. Did you hear that? \nAsk for a temporary tax to pay for it, instead of saying we will let \nour kids take care of it; we will let our grandchildren take care of \nit. No, we are not doing it. The people who are sacrificing today in \nthis country are the ones who have lost men and women in our wars. The \npeople who have sacrificed today are the ones who have come back \nwithout their arms and legs--thousands of them. They are making the \nsacrifice.\n  The question I ask is, what sacrifice are we making?\n  Anyone in the know who is watching us has to wonder about our \ncharacter, our intellectual honesty, our concern about our national \nsecurity, our Nation's competitiveness in the global marketplace now \nand in the future and, last but not least, our don't-give-a-darn \nattitude about the standard of living and quality of life of our \nchildren and grandchildren.\n  The question is, are we willing to be honest with ourselves and the \nAmerican people and make these tough decisions? My two models when I \nwas mayor and Governor were ``together we can do it,'' and our State \nmotto, ``With God All Things Are Possible.''\n  I am prayerful that the Holy Spirit will inspire us to make those \ntough decisions and do what is right for our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/03/senate-section/article/S3977-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3977-S3978]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     GUN TRAFFICKING: A NATIONAL ISSUE REQUIRING NATIONAL ATTENTION\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, last Tuesday, 15 mayors from a diverse \ngroup of cities around the country gathered in New York City for a \nmayors' summit on illegal guns. This summit provided an excellent \nopportunity to share gun violence prevention strategies, engage \nexperts, and coordinate future national outreach and lobbying efforts \nfor the safety of their cities. I commend those who participated for \ntheir willingness to work together to address the gun violence issues \nthat plague communities across our country.\n  One of the major issues discussed by the mayors last week was the \nbuying and selling of guns by ``straw purchasers.'' Straw purchasers \nplay a critical role in the illegal trafficking of\n\n[[Page S3978]]\n\nguns by purchasing with the intention of reselling them to prohibited \nbuyers. These straw purchases are often made in States with lax gun \nsafety laws and trafficked to cities where they may later be used in \nviolent crimes. New York City Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly refers \nto this as the ``iron pipeline'' of illegal firearms. According to \npublished reports citing New York Police Department statistics, 8 of \nevery 10 guns used in crimes in New York City come from other States. \nIn fact, only 18 percent of the illegal guns recovered in New York City \nin 2005 were originally sold in New York State, while 61 percent were \ntraced to just five other States.\n  According to several of the mayors in attendance, the lack of \nleadership by the President and Congress on the issue of illegal gun \ntrafficking was the impetus for the summit. As New York Mayor Michael \nBloomberg pointed out, ``There's very little that an individual city \ncan do to halt the sale of guns to criminals. This is a national issue \nthat requires national attention.'' In the absence of adequate Federal \nattention, the 15 attending mayors signed a statement of principles \nresolving, among other things, to work together in the prosecution of \ngun traffickers, irresponsible gun dealers, and violent criminals.\n  In their statement of principles, the mayors vow to oppose all \nFederal efforts to restrict the ability of cities to access, use, and \nshare firearms trace data that can be critical to law enforcement \npersonnel working to stop the flow of guns from reckless gun dealers \ninto the hands of criminals. This statement refers to amendments that \nhave been inserted in the Commerce-Justice-Science Appropriations Act \neach of the last 4 years that prohibit the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, \nFirearms and Explosives, ATF, from disclosing important information \nfrom the national Firearms Trace System Database to local law \nenforcement and government officials. Unfortunately, legislation has \nrecently been introduced in the House of Representatives which would \nmake these restrictions on ATF firearms trace data permanent.\n  It is time that Congress work with, instead of against, our Nation's \nmayors to solve the gun violence issues which our communities face. The \nmayors are right. The gun violence epidemic across the country requires \nnational attention, and I urge my colleagues to join me in working to \nenact commonsense gun safety laws that will help keep guns out of the \nhands of criminals.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this statement of principles \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     Mayors' Summit on Illegal Guns\n\n       Whereas: 30,000 Americans across the country are killed \n     every year as a result of gun violence, destroying families \n     and communities in big cities and small towns; and\n       Whereas: As Mayors, we are duty-bound to do everything in \n     our power to protect our residents, especially our children, \n     from harm and there is no greater threat to public safety \n     than the threat of illegal guns;\n       Now, therefore, we resolve to work together to find \n     innovative new ways to advance the following principles:\n       Punish to the maximum extent of the law--criminals who \n     possess, use, and traffic in illegal guns.\n       Target and hold accountable irresponsible gun dealers who \n     break the law by knowingly selling guns to straw purchasers.\n       Oppose all federal efforts to restrict cities' right to \n     access, use, and share trace data that is so essential to \n     effective enforcement, or to interfere with the ability of \n     the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms to combat \n     illegal gun trafficking.\n       Work to develop and use technologies that aid in the \n     detection and tracing of illegal guns.\n       Support all local, state, and federal legislation that \n     targets illegal guns; coordinate legislative, enforcement, \n     and litigation strategies; and share information and best \n     practices.\n       Invite other cities to join us in this new national effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/03/senate-section/article/S3978-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3978-S3979]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        IN CELEBRATION OF ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to recognize Asian \nPacific American Heritage Month.\n  Please join me as we celebrate the outstanding contributions of Asian \nPacific Americans to our Nation during Asian Pacific American Heritage \nMonth. Since 1977, when Congressman Norman Mineta of San Jose, along \nwith Senators Daniel Inouye and Spark Matsunaga of Hawaii, introduced a \njoint congressional resolution, we have celebrated Asian Pacific \nAmerican--APA--cultures and traditions each May. They chose May for the \nobservance because the first Japanese settlers had come to mainland \nAmerica in May 1843, and the Nation's first transcontinental railroad \nwas completed, with the help of Chinese American labor, in May 1869. \nThis year, the theme is ``Celebrating Decades of Pride, Partnerships \nand Progress.''\n  More than 14 million APAs live in the United States. Nearly 5 million \nAPAs live in California, making it home to the largest population of \nAsian Pacific Americans in the Nation. It is no wonder, then, that the \nAPA community in California has made tremendous strides by working \ntogether to bring about positive change and growth. I am so proud of my \nState of California for being a leader on Asian Pacific American \nissues.\n  Earlier this year, the California State Legislature's Asian Pacific \nIslander Legislative Caucus held its 6th Annual APA Legislative \nBriefing, ``Partnering for Community Empowerment.'' The conference \nbrought together statewide APA community leaders--from organizations \nsuch as the Asian Pacific Islanders California Action Network, Asian & \nPacific Islander American Health Forum, and Asian Americans for Civil \nRights and Equality--to create unique partnerships to advance civil \nrights, education, health care and community development. I commend the \nAsian Pacific Islander Caucus and California's APA community leaders \nfor their tireless and innovative efforts to empower Asian Pacific \nAmericans in California.\n  In addition to reflecting on the many accomplishments of the APA \ncommunity, Asian Pacific American Heritage Month also allows us to \nhonor the memory and contributions of notable Asian Pacific Americans. \nThis year, sadly, we have lost many APA leaders: Dave Tatsuno, a \ncourageous man who secretly documented life in a Japanese American \ninternment camp during World War II; Sam Chu Lin, one of the first \nAsian American journalists in the United States; Judge Delbert Wong, \nthe first Chinese American judge in the continental United States; and \nJade Snow Wong, a world-renowned author and ceramicist.\n  All four of these APA leaders were undeterred in their efforts to \nmake America a better place to live, and they will be missed by all who \nknew them. In remembering the accomplishments of Dave Tatsuno, Sam Chu \nLin, Judge Delbert Wong, and Jade Snow Wong, I hope that future APAs \nwill be inspired to become leaders who will fight for this great Nation \nand for the rights of all Asian Pacific Americans.\n  As we celebrate Asian Pacific American Heritage Month this May, let \nus remember that Asian Pacific Americans are constantly contributing to \nevery aspect of American life, from business and government to sports, \nscience, and the arts. As we note their many contributions, let us \ncelebrate diversity and recommit ourselves to working together toward a \nbetter future for us all.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, this month marks the anniversary of two \nmilestones in Asian Pacific American history.\n  The first-ever Japanese Americans made their home in this country \nstarting on May 7, 1843. And in this same month in 1869, the \nTranscontinental Railroad, which had a tremendous impact on settling \nthe West, was completed largely due to the hard labor of hundreds of \nChinese Americans.\n  These landmarks in Asian Pacific American history inspired Congress \nin 1977 to pass legislation establishing a week in May as Asian/Pacific \nHeritage Week. In 1990, it was expanded into a month-long observation.\n  So this May, in recognition of Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, \nI honor the diverse cultures and heritages that make up the Asian and \nPacific Islander American communities in my own home State of Maryland \nand across the Nation. I recognize the adversity and discrimination so \nmany have faced and continue to face in America, and I vow to continue \nto fight\n\n[[Page S3979]]\n\nto make sure all Asian Pacific Americans receive the equality they \ndeserve in all aspects of their lives.\n  Asian and Pacific Islander American communities come from all \ndifferent countries of origin from China, Japan, Laos and the \nPhilippines to Pakistan, Vietnam, Korea, and many others. They have \nbrought with them unique cultural traditions, religions and languages. \nAnd they make major contributions to all facets of our society from \nsmall businesses to giant corporations, from the government to the \nfront lines of battlefields, schools, athletics, law firms, hospitals, \nand countless other arenas. For centuries, they have helped make \nAmerica what it is today, and they continue to be an integral part of \nthe diverse American tapestry.\n  That is why I support comprehensive immigration reform and \naccessible, efficient immigration services to keep our borders open to \nthe immigrants that continue to make their homes in America and \ncontribute to our culture and economy.\n  Asian Pacific American Heritage Month is a reminder of the \ncontributions this community makes to our society all year round. I \nwill continue to fight in the Senate for the needs of the millions of \nAsian Pacific Americans that have made their home in this country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/03/senate-section/article/S3979-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3979-S3980]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE HAMILTON PROJECT\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, America has never lacked challenges, nor \nhas it lacked the determination and ingenuity to resolve them.\n  In our Nation's very first hours, we faced stark realities. \nRevolutionary War debts put the Treasury $79 million in the red. States \ncould not retire their debt. Our young Nation had no public credit. We \nalso had no source of revenue--much less a means to collect it. And \nmany Americans were as indebted as their Government. The future held \npromise, but the present was bleak.\n  America's first Treasury Secretary, Alexander Hamilton, embraced \nthese challenges. The day after his appointment--a Saturday--he put in \nmotion a plan to get our economy on its feet. In his first weeks, he \ncreated a customs service to generate income, established a rudimentary \ncoast guard for enforcement, and laid the foundation for fruitful trade \nrelations with Britain.\n  These first weeks in office proved Hamilton a man of action. The \nyears that followed showed him a man of vision. The Treasury Secretary \nauthored the legendary Report on Public Credit, the blueprint for \nAmerica's fiscal system. Not without controversy, his plan consolidated \ndebt and issued new bonds. He raised taxes and set up a national \ncentral bank. The legacy of Hamilton's plan endures today.\n  Hamilton's action and vision launched our Nation's early prosperity. \nBut today, we again face mounting challenges.\n  Using accrual accounting, the 2005 Financial Report of the United \nStates Government reported that the Government is running a net \noperating deficit of $760 billion--more than 6 percent of our economy. \nOur foreign debt to GDP ratio has not been this high since Grover \nCleveland was President in the late 19th century.\n  We face the largest current account deficit in history--more than \n$800 billion. A rising China and India are testing our innovative \ncapacity and the robustness of our manufacturing sector.\n  We are also neglecting education and the young minds that will define \nour future successes. We have forgotten our research institutions that \ngenerate ideas and spur innovation. We are abandoning the basic \ninfrastructure that buttresses our economic growth. We have let health \ncare become a burden rather than an asset. We have emptied our saving \naccounts and neglected investment.\n  Like newly independent America, the United States today demands \nvision and action.\n  I have put forward a comprehensive competitiveness initiative to \naddress these challenges. I have introduced trade competitiveness \nlegislation to make sure our trading partners play by the rules and \ngive our companies and workers a fair shot a success. I have introduced \nenergy competitiveness legislation to promote innovation and research \nand reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.\n  I have also proposed savings competitiveness legislation to close the \nfiscal gap and encourage Americans to save. Savings boosts investment \nand innovation. This week I will introduce legislation to boost \ninnovation by revamping and making permanent the R tax credit. In the \ncoming weeks, I will introduce ambitious legislation on education, \nhealth care, and international tax competitiveness.\n  But I do not pretend to have all of the answers. That is why today I \nwould like to recognize another initiative that embraces these \ncompetitiveness challenges. It is an initiative that invokes the vision \nand action of Alexander Hamilton. This namesake initiative--the \nHamilton Project--led by some of America's brightest minds, is clear in \nits vision and bold in the action it promises.\n  Based on principles--not politics--the Hamilton Project recognizes \nthat broad-based economic growth in America is stronger and more \nsustainable than growth that accrues to a small segment of the \npopulation. The Hamilton Project recognizes that our Nation can pursue \neconomic security for American workers and economic growth \nsimultaneously--and that both can be mutually reinforcing. The Hamilton \nProject recognizes that effective government plays a critical role in \nfacilitating our Nation's prosperity and enhancing economic growth.\n  These principles inform four pillars of action: education and work, \ninnovation and infrastructure, savings and insurance, and effective \ngovernment. Under each pillar, the project promises innovative ideas \nand a clear blueprint to realize them. Already, the project has \nproposed reducing the skills gap of underprivileged school children and \nimproving the effectiveness of our teachers. They have put forward \nclear proposals to boost savings in America and simplify taxes for the \nmajority of Americans.\n  In the coming months, the Hamilton Project will continue to roll out \nspecific policy proposals in each pillar. The project's work so far \npromises clear-eyed, detailed plans for our most pressing challenges. I \nlook forward to evaluating each proposal. I recommend that my \ncolleagues take the time to do the same.\n  Once again, I applaud those at the Hamilton Project for their \ninitiative. Our challenges may be daunting, but we must all welcome the \nchallenge.\n  Upon accepting his nomination as Treasury Secretary centuries ago, \nHamilton understood the hugeness of his task, saying: ``I conceived \nmyself to be under an obligation to lend my aid towards putting the \nmachine in some regular motion.'' Let us follow his lead. And let us \nlend our aid, and keep this great machine in motion.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe Executive Summary of the Hamilton Project's strategy paper.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Executive Summary\n\n       We believe in America's promise: that education and hard \n     work can provide each individual with the opportunity to \n     advance and allow each generation to do better than the one \n     before. Today, however, that promise is in jeopardy because \n     our nation is neither paying its way nor investing adequately \n     in its future. Our nation has failed to make the tough \n     decisions required to advance opportunity, prosperity, and \n     growth over the years and decades ahead.\n       The Hamilton Project's economic strategy reflects a \n     judgment that long-term prosperity is best achieved by making \n     economic growth broad-based, by enhancing individual economic \n     security, and by embracing a role for effective government in \n     making needed public investments. The Project's strategy--\n     strikingly different from the theories driving current \n     economic policy--calls for fiscal discipline and for \n     increased public investment in key growth-enhancing areas. \n     The Project will put forward innovative policy ideas from \n     leading economic thinkers throughout the United States--ideas \n     based on experience and evidence, not ideology and doctrine--\n     to introduce new, sometimes controversial, policy options \n     into the national debate with the goal of improving our \n     country's economic policy.\n       Many options for addressing the fiscal problem have been \n     identified; the most pressing need now is not new ideas, but \n     greater political will and a bipartisan political process. \n     The president and the leaders of both parties in both houses \n     need to come together in a special process that recognizes \n     the critical importance of these issues, acknowledges \n     differences in views, and works to reach common ground with \n     joint political accountability.\n\n[[Page S3980]]\n\n       The failure to invest wisely in sound policies to promote \n     economic growth is particularly problematic in light of the \n     growing competition U.S. workers and firms face as the people \n     of China, India, and other nations rapidly enter the global \n     economy. Significant new intellectual work is needed to \n     identify evidence- and experience-based policies to promote \n     individual opportunity and strengthen America's economy.\n       The Project will therefore reach across the country to \n     encourage many of the nation's leading thinkers to put \n     forward new proposals and will help bring those ideas to bear \n     on policy debates in a relevant and effective way.\n       Economic evidence and experience suggest three principles \n     on which the Project's economic strategy is premised:\n       Broad-based economic growth is stronger and more \n     sustainable: Broad-based growth will be stronger and more \n     sustainable than growth accruing disproportionately to a \n     small segment of the population. When public policy \n     excessively favors relatively few, the economy misses out on \n     opportunities for innovation and productivity by the many.\n       Economic security and economic growth can be mutually \n     reinforcing: Not only does economic growth increase economic \n     security, but economic security in turn can increase economic \n     growth--by enabling people to take the risks that promote \n     growth (such as starting a new business or investing in their \n     own education), by getting families back on their feet \n     quickly after unexpected shocks, and by lessening calls for \n     growth-diminishing policies like closing our markets to \n     competition.\n       Effective government can enhance economic growth: Markets \n     are the cornerstone of economic growth, but government must \n     invest in critical needs that market forces will not \n     adequately meet--such as education, infrastructure, and basic \n     research. Government must rigorously seek efficiency, \n     increased productivity, and internal reform so that it can \n     most effectively target its policies to provide necessary \n     services.\n       To achieve the goal of strong, sustainable, and broad-based \n     economic growth, the Project will identify and advance sound \n     policy ideas that rest upon four pillars:\n       Education and work: The productive power of the U.S. \n     economy lies heavily with its people. The Project will \n     explore ways to improve education--from prekindergarten \n     through graduate school--to equip America's youth to succeed \n     in the knowledge-based economy; reform the nation's job \n     training and vocational education system; and increase work \n     incentives for low-skilled workers.\n       Innovation and infrastructure: Innovation fuels growth, \n     creates jobs, and expands economic opportunity. With global \n     economic activity becoming increasingly dependent on \n     technology, the Project will propose ways of making more \n     workers literate in science and engineering; adopting smarter \n     incentives for private firms to undertake R and removing \n     barriers to private-sector innovation; increasing the federal \n     commitment to fundamental scientific research; achieving \n     energy independence; and improving our nation's physical \n     infrastructure.\n       Savings and insurance: The more security that people can \n     achieve in their personal finances--through both savings and \n     social insurance--the more confidence they can place in the \n     future, making them more likely to seize opportunities and \n     bounce back from adverse events. The Project will be \n     examining topics such as shoring up health-care coverage and \n     reducing health-care costs; cushioning the economic shocks of \n     job dislocation; and increasing retirement security--all in \n     an effort to provide people with the economic security they \n     need to be entrepreneurial and invest in their own skills.\n       Effective government: Government has a limited but \n     essential role in creating the conditions for growth in which \n     all Americans can share. The Project will propose ways to \n     increase government productivity and efficiency; realign \n     government's activities in response to changing \n     circumstances; reform government regulation so that it \n     efficiently guides private firms when necessary without \n     unduly hampering them; and take measures to make the \n     Project's proposals budget-neutral.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/03/senate-section/article/S3980-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3980]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FREE INTERNET FILING ACT\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I continue to advocate for the ability of \ntaxpayers to file their taxes directly through the Internal Revenue \nService Web site without depending on commercial tax preparers. If a \ntaxpayer has taken the time to fill out their taxes on their own, they \nshould be provided with the opportunity to file electronically through \nthe IRS Web site without exposing their personal financial information \nto a tax preparer or be subjected to solicitations for other services \nor tax products. A bill that I introduced with my friend from New \nMexico, Senator Bingaman, S. 2550, the Free Internet Filing Act, \nrequires that taxpayers be provided with the option to directly e-file \nvia the IRS Web site without using commercial tax preparers. I will \ncontinue to work with my colleagues to enact this needed legislation. \nElectronic returns help taxpayers receive their refunds faster than \nmailing them in. This would also save the IRS resources and reduce \npossible errors that can occur when the mailed-in returns are \ntranscribed.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an additional letter of \nsupport for S. 2550 from the National Consumer Law Center, Consumer \nFederation of America, Consumers Union, U.S. Public Interest Research \nGroup, and Consumer Action be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   April 21, 2006.\n     Hon. Daniel K. Akaka,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: The National Consumer Law Center (on \n     behalf of its low-income clients), Consumer Federation of \n     America, Consumers Union, the U.S. Public Interest Research \n     Group and Consumer Action write to support S. 2550, the \n     ``Free Internet Filing Act.'' Consumer groups have long \n     advocated for what S. 2550 would provide--the ability of \n     taxpayers to electronically file their returns without the \n     need for a third party intermediary.\n       Enabling taxpayers to file electronically directly with the \n     Internal Revenue Service will benefit taxpayers tremendously. \n     It will save taxpayers the fees charged by some commercial \n     preparers for electronic filing. Unlike the current Free File \n     program established by the IRS, S. 2550 will provide \n     taxpayers with free electronic filing without being subject \n     to cross-marketing pitches for refund anticipation loans, \n     mortgages and other financial products which may not be in \n     their best interests.\n       S. 2550 will also help taxpayers to keep their information \n     private. By allowing free direct electronic filing with the \n     IRS, taxpayers will have the ability to bypass commercial \n     preparers that might exploit or share their personal, \n     confidential tax information for non-tax purposes.\n       We believe the IRS should have been required a long time \n     ago to establish free direct electronic filing. For many \n     years, Americans have been able to apply for federal student \n     financial aid on www.fafsa.ed.gov and Social Security \n     retirement benefits at www.ssa.gov. A free direct electronic \n     filing program at www.irs.gov is long overdue.\n       If you have any questions about this letter, please contact \n     Chi Chi Wu.

TIBERTI\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I pay tribute to a great Nevadan whose \npassing has saddened me and countless others in my State. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in offering their thoughts and prayers to the \nfamily of J.A. Tiberti.\n  Mr. Tiberti died yesterday. He had called Nevada home since 1941.\n  I'm very proud to say J.A. Tiberti was my friend. But he was more \nthan that. J.A. Tiberti was nothing less than a deep personal \ninspiration. He embodied a bold, energetic, upbeat entrepreneurial \nspirit. The type of spirit that built Nevada, the West, and this \ncountry. The type of spirit that inspires and energizes brave thinkers \nand dreamers throughout America, and has done so since our Nation was \nformed.\n  Mr. Tiberti leaves behind not only one of the most proud and \nprominent families in Nevada but also a legacy of vision and dreams for \nhis community that will last, literally, for generations.\n  If you drive anywhere in southern Nevada today, you will see homes, \nbusinesses, office buildings, and resorts rising out of the desert and \nforming the fastest growing communities in America. These are all \ntestaments to the allure of Nevada and the spirit of the people who \ncall it home. And on many of those rising structures you will see the \nTiberti name. It is a testament to a man who dedicated his life to \nhelping build his community.\n\n[[Page S3981]]\n\n  Tiberti Construction is one of the most successful and thriving \nbusinesses in the country. At this moment, hundreds of students are \npursuing higher education at the University of Nevada Las Vegas within \nwalls and under roofs built by Tiberti Construction. The men and women \nof our military are training to defend our country at Nellis Air Force \nBase inside buildings erected by J.A. Tiberti's company.\n  J.A. Tiberti's generosity and philanthropic efforts are well known \nand talked about by all who knew him, but never by Mr. Tiberti himself. \nHis willingness to donate to causes close to his heart was matched by \nhis reluctance to speak of them or try to gain publicity for himself. \nIt is remarkable that a man of such success and generosity was also \nblessed with a humility that prevented him from boasting of his \naccomplishments and contributions. I will tell you, as a small example, \nthat the alumni center and engineering complex at UNLV exist today \nbecause of J.A. Tiberti.\n  His humble nature was inherited from his parents, hardworking \nimmigrants from Italy who lived and worked in a coal mining camp. His \nfather went off to work in the mines at 2 a.m., checking for dangerous \ngasses that could put the other workers' lives in danger.\n  When J.A. Tiberti began having success in the construction business \nhis values never left him. An interviewer once asked him how he had \nachieved success early on and, instead of citing business plans or wise \ninvestments, J.A. Tiberti said it was honesty and sincerity that laid \nthe groundwork for his business.\n  Two years ago, J.A. Tiberti was inducted into the Nevada Business \nHall of Fame. He has served on too many planning commissions, advisory \nboards, finance committees, and professional societies to name here, \nand his commitment to community service was recognized in 1987 when he \nwas named Most Distinguished Nevadan.\n  Today the Tiberti family is also grounded in those values, and their \nsuccess reflects the hard work and generosity of their patriarch. J.A. \nTiberti leaves behind six children, 21 grandchildren, and six great-\ngrandchildren.\n  I know they are proud to carry on the Tiberti name and, through our \nsadness over his passing, we Nevadans are proud that he chose our state \nto raise his family and to call home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/03/senate-section/article/S3981-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3981]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO PAUL SCAPICCHIO\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am proud to join Massachusetts \nState Senate President Travaglini, Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives DiMasi, Mayor Thomas Menino, the members and staff of \nthe Boston City Council in celebrating the exemplary public service \nperformed by City Councilman Paul Scapicchio over the last 8 years.\n  Paul's time in office has been defined by a sustained love for the \npeople of East Boston, Charlestown, and the historic North End. His \nconstituents and colleagues regard him as a friend, as does everyone \nwho gathered together last night in Boston to mark this important \nmilestone in Paul's career. A native of Boston's North End, Paul has \nalways been involved in his community. He spent much of his youth \nplaying and coaching in various sports, including Babe Ruth baseball, \nyouth hockey, and basketball. After college, it was natural that this \nconnection to his neighbors and their lives would lead him to seek \npublic office. As Councilman, Paul focused on issues such as affordable \nhousing, improved public education, and increased economic \nopportunities for all of Boston's residents. He proposed incentives for \nBoston drivers to purchase hybrid vehicles, reached out to the seniors \nof his district by participating in Seniors Count, and helped countless \nconstituents address the day-to-day problems that surface throughout \nBoston's neighborhoods.\n  Mr. President, while a chapter of Paul's public service will come to \na close with his departure from the Boston City Council, I am thrilled \nthat he will continue to be part of Boston's future through his work at \nML Strategies. I extend to him my gratitude for his service and my best \nwishes as he, Kate, and their children move on to these new \nchallenges.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/03/senate-section/article/S3981-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3981]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       LOS ANGELES COUNTY SHERIFF MARIA CECILIA ROSA: IN MEMORIAM\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

Her \nattitude and performance were always top rate, and she was always fair \nand courteous to everyone with whom she came in contact. Many describe \nher ``wonderful sense of humor with an electric smile.'' Colleagues \nnote that she was affable, yet tough, and approached even the most \nmundane tasks with energy and enthusiasm.\n  Deputy Rosa is survived by her sister Luz Maria Yanez and brothers \nEduardo and Maricelo Yanez. When she was not on duty, Deputy Rosa loved \nto dance, especially Salsa. She was extremely caring and always \navailable to a friend. Deputy Maria Rosa served the State of California \nwith honor and distinction and honorably fulfilled her oath as an \nofficer of the law.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize \nCalifornia State University, San Bernardino, CSUSB. This academic year, \nthe campus celebrates its 40th anniversary.\n  San Bernardino-Riverside State College was founded in 1960 and was \nnamed California State College at San Bernardino when it opened on \nSeptember 28, 1965. At that time, only 293 students were enrolled. In \n1984, the campus gained university status and became California State \nUniversity, San Bernardino.\n  Today, CSUSB can look back on 40 years of growth as a successful \nuniversity that has graduated more than 55,000 students, with an \nenrollment of over 16,400, with about 3,500 annual graduates. \nAdditionally, Cal State San Bernardino boasts of 5 academic colleges, \noffering more than 70 degree and certificate programs.\n\n[[Page S3982]]\n\n  Cal State San Bernardino is an asset to the local economy as well. \nThe university provides direct and indirect employment to approximately \n10,000 people in the local region, supporting healthy economic growth \nin the Inland Empire.\n  CSUSB is a leader in student diversity, with one of the most diverse \nstudent bodies in the California State University system. The Robert V. \nFullerton Art Museum, which is located on campus, is a significant \ncultural institution throughout all of southern California, bringing an \nimportant cultural contribution with its impressive ancient and \ncontemporary collections.\n  CSUSB faculty and staff also provide important research in the Inland \nEmpire. The university has many research and service facilities that \ninclude the Water Resources Institute, Developmental Disabilities \nCenter, Institute of Applied Research, Diversity Institute, Inland \nEmpire Center for Entrepreneurship, International Institute, Arrowhead \nLaboratory for Securities Analysis, Center for the Study of Hate and \nExtremism, Institute for Child Development and Family Relations, Office \nfor the Commercialization of Advanced Technology, Office of National \nExcellence in Distance Learning, and the Community-University \nPartnership.\n  While located in San Bernardino, the university is working to provide \nhigher education in the Coachella Valley, a traditionally underserved \narea. The university has built a branch campus in Palm Desert, which \nprovides much needed access to higher education in this rapidly growing \nregion.\n  I applaud the service and dedication of the staff and students of \nCalifornia State University, San Bernardino as they celebrate 40 years \nof improving the education and lives of the people of the Inland Empire \nand desert region of southern California.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/03/senate-section/article/S3982-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3982]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/03/senate-section/article/S3982-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3982]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/03/senate-section/article/S3982-3", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3982]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:05 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2720.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na refundable credit for high deductible health plans for uninsured \nindividuals; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this week, the first week of May, is \nNational Cover the Uninsured Week. Now in its fourth year, it is the \nlargest nonpartisan effort in our Nation's history to raise awareness \non the staggering numbers of Americans who do not have health \ninsurance.\n  Forty-six million Americans have no health insurance--including more \nthan 8 million children. In Alaska, 110,000 people do not have health \ninsurance--that is nearly 17 percent of our population. One-half of \nAlaska's uninsured live in a household with a least one child.\n  Being uninsured too often means going without needed care--and minor \nillnesses can become major ones simply because health care is delayed. \nOver a third of Alaska's uninsured reported that they didn't seek \nmedical care for themselves or their family when it was needed. Why? \nBecause they couldn't afford it. An estimated 18,000 uninsured \nAmericans die each year because they received too little care, too \nlate.\n  Most of these individuals and families are hard-working Americans--\njust making it from paycheck to paycheck. In fact, 8 out of 10 of \nuninsured Americans either work or are in working families.\n  To help those working families, I join Senator Santorum and Senator \nDole in introducing the Helping Working Americans Afford Health \nCoverage Act of 2006. The goal of this bill is to make health coverage \nmore affordable and accessible to the working populations with the \ngreatest needs.\n  This bill creates a progressive, refundable health care tax credit \ntargeted toward low- and moderate-income individuals and families which \ncan be used for health savings account-eligible health insurance. \nRecent studies show that low- and moderate-income Americans and those \npreviously uninsured are enrolling in health savings accounts or HSAs. \nMore than one-third of HSA purchasers last year had incomes under \n$50,000 per year, and one-third of individual HSA purchasers last year \nwere previously uninsured.\n  Specifically, the refundable tax credit would provide a subsidy of up \nto 90 percent of the cost of health care coverage, up to a maximum \ncredit of $1,000 per adult and up to $3,000 for a family. Additionally, \nthe credit will be advanceable so that an individual or family would \nnot have to wait to be reimbursed to purchase coverage.\n  This bill also contains an important provision to address the higher \nhealth care costs and higher poverty levels in the noncontiguous States \nof Alaska and Hawaii. In Alaska, the qualifying income thresholds for \nboth individual Alaskans and Alaskan families are increased by 25 \npercent.\n  Though the Helping Working Americans Afford Health Coverage Act is \nnot as comprehensive as S. 160, the SAVE Act, Securing Access, Value \nand Equality Act--legislation that I introduced\n\n[[Page S3987]]\n\nearlier in the Congress--it is still an important first step in \naddressing the needs of the uninsured.\n  The National Association of Health Underwriters states that this bill \n``will provide much needed relief by providing a refundable tax credit \nthat can be used for both their health insurance policy premiums and as \na deposit into their HSA account This (bill) will provide individuals \nwith ready access to health care while encouraging them to become more \nengaged in the process of obtaining health care.''\n  Mr. President, helping Americans afford insurance saves money in the \nlong run. Between $65 billion and $130 billion of public health dollars \nare spent on treating acute patients. Much of this could be saved if \nonly those individuals received preventative care.\n  Making health insurance more affordable will make a real difference \nto the Nation's physical and economic health. I am proud of Alaskans \nand all Americans who have united during National Cover the Uninsured \nWeek and are bringing attention to this national health care crisis. I \nask my colleagues to take an important step in helping the uninsured by \nsupporting the Helping Working Americans Afford Health Insurance Act of \n2006.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Frist, Mr. Reid, Mr. \n        Grassley, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. DeWine, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. \n        Brownback, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Warner, Mr. Inouye, Mr. \n        Hagel, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Allen, Ms. \n        Landrieu, Mr. Obama, Mr. Salazar, and Mr. Menendez):\n  S. 2703. A bill to amend the Voting Rights Act of 1965; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the chairmen of both \nthe Senate and House Judiciary Committees, the ranking member of the \nHouse Judiciary Committee, the Democratic and Republican leaders of \nboth the Senate and the House of Representatives, and members of \nCongress from both parties to introduce a bill to reauthorize and \nreinvigorate the temporary provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. \nThe bicameral, bipartisan introduction of this bill reflects not only \nits historic importance as a guarantor of the right to vote for all \nAmericans, but also the broad consensus that the expiring provisions \nmust be extended this year without delay.\n  There are few things as critical to our Nation, and to American \ncitizenship, as voting. Like the rights guaranteed by the First \nAmendment, the right to vote is foundational because it secures the \neffective exercise of all other rights. As people are able to register, \nvote, and elect candidates of their choice, their interests and rights \nget attention. The very legitimacy of our government is dependent on \nthe access all Americans have to the political process.\n  The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was the result of an historic struggle \nfor civil rights led by such American heroes as Dr. Martin Luther King, \nJr., Coretta Scott King and Rosa Parks, who refused to be treated as \nsecond-class citizens. That struggle reached a crucial turning point on \nMarch 7, 1965, on the Edmund Pettis Bridge in Selma, AL, when State \ntroopers brutally attacked John Lewis and his fellow civil rights \nmarchers who were fighting for their right to vote.\n  The events of that day, now known as ``Bloody Sunday,'' were captured \nin newspapers and on televisions across the country, and those powerful \nimages marked a crucial turning point in securing the right to vote for \nall Americans. A few days after the violence of Bloody Sunday, \nPresident Lyndon Johnson outlined the proposed Voting Rights Act of \n1965, before a joint session of Congress. Within months, Congress \npassed it so that the Constitution's guarantees of equal access to the \nelectoral process, regardless of race, would not be undermined by \ndiscriminatory practices.\n  The enactment of the Voting Rights Act in 1965 transformed the \nlandscape of political inclusion. Prior to the Act, minorities of all \nraces faced major barriers to participation in the political process, \nthrough the use of such devices as poll taxes, exclusionary primaries, \nintimidation by voting officials, language barriers, and systematic \nvote dilution. We have made great gains since that time, but our work \nis not finished. The record established in 10 hearings in the House of \nRepresentatives indicates that the tools provided by the expiring \nprovisions of the Voting Rights Act remain necessary for protecting the \nvoting rights of minority Americans in this country.\n\n  Among the Act's most critical protections are the pre-clearance \nprovisions of Section 5, which prevent discriminatory laws from going \ninto practice. The Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act \nof 2006 would extend these protections for 25 years, retaining the most \neffective measures to fight certain kinds of pervasive and recurring \ndiscrimination.\n  The insidious discriminatory tactics that led to the original Voting \nRights Act were deeply rooted. In the annals of our Nation, this fight \ndates back almost 100 years, to the ratification of the 15th Amendment \nin 1870, the last of the post-Civil War Reconstruction amendments. It \ntook implementation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 for people of all \nraces in many parts of our country to gain the effective exercise of \nrights guaranteed 95 years earlier by the 15th Amendment. The pre-\nclearance provisions were one of the primary reasons this Act succeeded \nwhere earlier attempts had failed. Section 5 requires certain covered \njurisdictions with a history of discrimination to pre-clear all voting \nchanges with either the Department of Justice or the U.S. District \nCourt for the District of Columbia. In doing so, Section 5 combats the \npractices in these jurisdictions of shifting from one invalidated \ndiscriminatory tactic to another, which had undermined earlier efforts \nto enforce 15th Amendment guarantees.\n  We have made significant progress toward a more inclusive democracy \nover the past four decades since the enactment of the Voting Rights Act \nin 1965. However, I fear that if we fail to reauthorize the expiring \nprovisions of the Voting Rights Act, our country is likely to \nbackslide. We must make sure those gains do not suffer the same fate as \nthe gains in voting rights made during Reconstruction.\n  After the Civil War, the Reconstruction Act promised that the \nguarantees of the 15th Amendment would be realized. Between 1870 and \n1900, 22 African Americans served in the United States Congress. In \n1868, Louisiana elected an African-American Lieutenant Governor, Oscar \nDunn, and 87 African Americans held seats in the South Carolina \nlegislature. However, these Reconstruction-era gains in African-\nAmerican voting and representation proved to be short-lived. Following \nthe end of Reconstruction, the rights of African Americans to vote and \nto hold office were virtually eliminated in many areas through \ndiscriminatory legal barriers, intimidation, and violence. The changes \nwere swift, systematic and severe. By 1896, Representative George White \nof North Carolina was the only African American remaining in the U.S. \nCongress, and it would take 72 years after Representative White left \nCongress for African-American voters in the South to elect another \ncandidate of their choice to Congress.\n  In Mississippi, the percentage of African-American voting-age men \nregistered to vote fell from more than 90 percent during Reconstruction \nto less than 6 percent in 1892. Between 1896 and 1900, the number of \nAfrican-American voters in Louisiana was reduced from 130,000 to a mere \n5,000. Unlike their short-lived gains made during Reconstruction, \nAfrican-American voters' exclusion from the ballot box was persistent. \nOnly 3 percent of voting-age African-American men and women in the \nSouth were registered to vote in 1940, only 1 percent in Mississippi--\njust 1 percent. These numbers are staggering, and they provide a \nhistory lesson we should not ignore.\n\n  As part of the Voting Rights Act reauthorization in 1975, Congress \nadded Section 203, which requires bilingual voting assistance for \ncertain language minority groups. This provision was enacted pursuant \nto congressional power to enforce the 14th and 15th Amendments. Section \n203 has been a key factor to expanding the inclusiveness of democracy \nto all citizens and has led to extraordinary gains in representation \nand participation made by Asian-American and Hispanic-American \ncitizens. Like Section 5, Section 203 is expiring in 2007. The Voting \nRights Act Reauthorization and\n\n[[Page S3988]]\n\nAmendments Act of 2006 would extend these critical protections for 25 \nyears.\n  Hispanic-American populations have been one of the primary minority \nlanguage groups to benefit from the protections of the bilingual \nprovisions of the Voting Rights Act. For example effective \nimplementation of the bilingual provisions in San Diego County, CA, \nhelped increase voter registration by more than 20 percent. And voter \nturnout among Hispanic Americans in New Mexico rose 26 percent between \n2000 and 2004 after television and radio spots in Spanish educated \nlisteners about voter registration and absentee ballots.\n  Voting rights belong to people who are American citizens. They are \ntrying to vote but many of them are struggling with the English \nlanguage due to disparities in education and the incremental process of \nlearning. It is imperative that all citizens be able to fully exercise \ntheir rights as citizens, particularly a right as fundamental as the \nright to vote. Renewing the expiring language provisions of the Voting \nRights Act will continue to help make that a reality.\n  Rather than merely extending the Voting Rights Act, Congress now has \nan opportunity to reinvigorate the Act, strengthening and improving its \nremedies. The Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of \n2006 does so by clarifying certain parts of Section 5 to give clear \nguidance to the Courts and to restore the original understanding of the \nAct. Two recent Supreme Court decisions have significantly narrowed \nSection 5's effectiveness and undermined the purposes of the Act.\n  The Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006 \nremedies the Supreme Court's holding in Reno v. Bossier Parish, by \nmaking clear that a voting rule change motivated by any discriminatory \npurpose violates Section 5. Under the holding in Reno v. Bossier \nParish, certain voting rule changes passed with the intent to \ndiscriminate against minorities could pass Section 5 muster. Because \nsuch an interpretation is inconsistent with purposes of the Voting \nRights Act to eliminate discriminatory tactics that undermine the \nguarantees of the 15th Amendment, the Voting Rights Act Reauthorization \nand Amendments Act fixes this inconsistency by clarifying that a voting \nrule change motivated by any discriminatory purpose also cannot be pre-\ncleared.\n\n  The Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006 also \nremedies the Supreme Court's holding in Georgia v. Ashcroft. Under the \ntest established in Georgia for assessing a jurisdiction's challenge to \ndenial of Section 5 pre-clearance, the court can give greater weight to \nnumerous undefined considerations than to the ability of a minority \ncommunity to elect a candidate of its choice. This test is as difficult \nto administer as it is contrary to the purposes of the Act. This act \nfixes both of these problems by restoring the original understanding \nthat the purpose of the Voting Rights Act is to protect the minority \ncommunity's ability to elect their preferred candidates of choice and \nby setting forth defined factors.\n  In addition to restoring the Act's original meaning, this Act makes \nchanges to the expiring Federal examiners and observers provisions to \nbetter allocate resources for combating discrimination in voting. The \nVoting Rights Act provides for Federal examiners to ensure that legally \nqualified persons are free to register for Federal, State, and local \nelections and that observers to observe whether citizens who are \neligible to vote are able to exercise the right to vote. Federal \nobservers are the most frequently used federal oversight tool in voting \nand the only Federal officials authorized to enter polls and places \nwhere votes are tabulated. This Act eliminates Federal examiners \nbecause they have not been appointed to jurisdictions certified for \ncoverage in more than 20 years, and other laws such as the Help America \nVote Act now address the concern of voting rolls. At the same time, the \nbill strengthens the observers provisions to allow the assignment of \nfederal observers upon finding that there is a reasonable belief that a \nviolation of the 14th or 15th Amendments will occur, without having to \nfirst certify federal examiners.\n  The Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendment Act also removes \nan impediment to effective protection of voting rights by authorizing \nthe prevailing party in a lawsuit brought under Section 2 to recover \nexpert costs as part of the attorney fees already authorized. This will \nhave a significant impact on the ability of litigants to successfully \ncombat discrimination in court.\n  The process of reauthorization began in the House of Representatives, \nwhere Representatives Nadler, Chabot and Watt presided over 10 hearings \non the effectiveness and continuing need for the expiring provisions of \nthe Voting Rights Act. Last week, the distinguished House Judiciary \nchairman and ranking member appeared before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee and introduced the extensive record from those hearings. I am \ngrateful for the hard work that has been done in the House, and I want \nto thank Chairman Specter for agreeing to move forward promptly with \nSenate Judiciary Committee hearings on the expiring provisions.\n  Congress has reauthorized and revitalized the Act four times, each \ntime with overwhelmingly bipartisan support. As I noted last week in \nwelcoming the House Judiciary chairman and ranking member, we are \nrepeating the bicameral and bipartisan process of the 1982 \nreauthorization. In 1982, Chairman Specter and I were both Members of \nthe Judiciary Committee, along with Senators Kennedy, Biden, Hatch and \nGrassley. Under the chairmanship of Senator Strom Thurmond, \nreauthorization was reported by the Judiciary Committee and passed both \nhouses of Congress. I am hopeful that our Committee can accomplish the \nwork that needs to be done and report this bill to the full Senate \nbefore the Memorial Day recess.\n  The Voting Rights Act of 1965 is one of the most important laws \nCongress has ever passed, helping to usher the country out of a history \nof discrimination and into the greater inclusion of all Americans in \nthe decisions about our Nation's future. Our democracy and our Nation \nhave been better and richer for it. While I hope some day these \nextraordinary remedies are not needed, I urge the Senate to build on \nthe work done in the House of Representatives to extend the expiring \nprovisions so that we can eliminate recurring discrimination and make \nsure that the gains we have made are not lost. I am heartened that this \nis not a partisan issue benefiting one party or another. Rather, as \ndemonstrated by the bicameral and bipartisan process we continue for \nreauthorizing and revitalizing the Act's expiring provisions, this is \nabout making our democracy reflect the will of all of the American \npeople.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Specter, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. \n        Biden, Mr. Kerry, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Nelson of \n        Florida, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Lautenberg, \n        Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 2704. A bill to revise and extend the National Police Athletic \nLeague Youth Enrichment Act of 2000; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I join Senators Specter, Feinstein, \nBiden, Kerry, Boxer, Schumer, Nelson of Florida, Menendez, Dodd, \nKennedy, Lautenberg, Durbin, and Lieberman to introduce a bill to \nreauthorize the Police Athletic/Activities League, better known as PAL. \nThese local youth crime prevention programs, run by police officers \nnationwide, provide after-school educational, athletic, and \nrecreational opportunities for the communities they serve.\n  The first PAL chapter was founded in the 1910s in New York. The \ngrowth since then has been tremendous, and there are now over 330 PAL \nchapters in 38 States, DC, the Virgin Islands, Canada, and Nigeria, \nserving approximately 2 million children between the ages of 5 and 18. \nIn my own home State of Ohio, we are fortunate enough to have 28 of \nthese outstanding organizations.\n  Studies conducted in Eastlake, OH, and Portland, OR, have shown a \nsubstantial drop in the juvenile crime rate in those two cities upon \nthe creation of a PAL chapter. These chapters make a point to serve \nthose most in need. For example, 50 percent of the kids involved in the \n28 Ohio chapters come from families with a median income of less than \n$20,000.\n\n[[Page S3989]]\n\n  PAL chapters provide kids with a wide range of activities. One \nchapter in Ohio, for instance--the Chillicothe-Ross County Police \nAthletic League--has offered dances, films, rap contests, and programs \nin archery, art, basketball, bowling, boxing, computers, cooking, CPR, \nfishing, fitness, lacrosse, nutrition, paint ball, running, tumbling, \nvolleyball, and weightlifting. Other chapters around the country have \noffered programs like chess, flag football, junior golf, homework clubs \nand hydroponic gardening. In addition--through their Youth Leadership \nCouncil--PALs provide a setting for kids to learn important skills to \nassist them in becoming the leaders of tomorrow.\n  But, the Police Athletic/Activities League does more than merely \nprovide after-school activities to kids who may not otherwise have \naccess to tutoring or athletic facilities. PAL provides them with \nmentors and positive role models. In addition, PAL programs help teach \nkids that their relationship with law enforcement need not be one that \nis ``us vs. them;'' instead, to quote National PAL, itself, the \nrelationship can be one of ``cops and kids together--providing \nsolutions through sports and education.''\n  The money provided by this reauthorization bill would enable PAL \nprograms to continue their current programs and also expand--at a rate \nof 50 chapters per year--into areas where kids can truly benefit from \nthe good work of the PAL.\n  The PAL has been a success for over 90 years, and the Senate \nconsistently has supported this outstanding organization. We passed the \nNational Police Athletic League Youth Enrichment Act of 2000 by \nunanimous consent, and I urge my colleagues to continue to support the \nPAL with this reauthorization.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2704\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide an \nenrollment priority for veterans, who are recipients of certain medals \nof valor, in health care services provided by the Department of \nVeterans Affairs; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of our Nation's \nveterans and military heroes to introduce the ``Heroes Healthcare \nEligibility Act of 2006.'' This legislation would recognize the \nsacrifices and contributions of our Nation's military heroes by \nensuring that our military heroes have full access to VA health care.\n  Since January 2003, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs has used his \nauthority under current law to prohibit Priority 8 veterans from \nenrolling in the VA health care system. Priority 8 veterans are those \nwith no service-connected disability and have an income of over \n$26,902. To date, more than 260,000 of these supposed ``middle-income'' \nveterans have been turned away from the VA health care system.\n  I was dismayed to learn that the group of Priority 8 veterans may \ninclude thousands of war heroes, who were awarded medals for valor in \ncombat but are ineligible for health care because of income \nlimitations. Lou Green, a Korean war veteran and veterans advocate, \nbrought a case to my attention where a multiple Silver Star award \nwinner was denied access to care. This particular veteran had income \njust slightly above the means test limit but was told that his award \n``meant nothing'' for getting VA health care.\n  This bill would recognize those veterans who have been awarded the \nSilver Star Medal or higher for valor and give them access to VA health \ncare on par with former POWs; service connected veterans rated 10 \npercent or 20 percent disabled and all those who have received a Purple \nHeart. From World War II to present, more than 134,000 servicemembers \nhave been awarded either the Silver Star, Air Force Cross, Navy Cross, \nDistinguished Service Cross or the Medal of Honor.\n  I would tell my colleagues that there is precedent for establishing \npriority eligibility for a veteran's benefit as a result of being \nawarded a military decoration. As I mentioned before, today combat \nveterans in receipt of a Purple Heart are eligible for VA health care, \nas they fall into the third priority group. Also, current policy at \nArlington National Cemetery gives eligibility for full-body burial to \nthose who have been awarded the Silver Star or higher for valor or are \nin receipt of the Purple Heart.\n  As much as I would like to reopen the doors to VA health care for all \nPriority 8 veterans, this legislation to recognize our Nation's \nmilitary heroes is a step in the right direction. It is time our \ndecorated military heroes receive the recognition they so richly \ndeserve. I urge my colleagues to join me in making this needed change \nto VA's health eligibility for our military heroes a reality.\n\n[[Page S3990]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/03/senate-section/article/S3986-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3986-S3990]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. SANTORUM (for himself, Mrs. Dole, and Ms. Murkowski):\n  S. 2701. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na refundable credit for high deductible health plans for uninsured \nindividuals; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this week, the first week of May, is \nNational Cover the Uninsured Week. Now in its fourth year, it is the \nlargest nonpartisan effort in our Nation's history to raise awareness \non the staggering numbers of Americans who do not have health \ninsurance.\n  Forty-six million Americans have no health insurance--including more \nthan 8 million children. In Alaska, 110,000 people do not have health \ninsurance--that is nearly 17 percent of our population. One-half of \nAlaska's uninsured live in a household with a least one child.\n  Being uninsured too often means going without needed care--and minor \nillnesses can become major ones simply because health care is delayed. \nOver a third of Alaska's uninsured reported that they didn't seek \nmedical care for themselves or their family when it was needed. Why? \nBecause they couldn't afford it. An estimated 18,000 uninsured \nAmericans die each year because they received too little care, too \nlate.\n  Most of these individuals and families are hard-working Americans--\njust making it from paycheck to paycheck. In fact, 8 out of 10 of \nuninsured Americans either work or are in working families.\n  To help those working families, I join Senator Santorum and Senator \nDole in introducing the Helping Working Americans Afford Health \nCoverage Act of 2006. The goal of this bill is to make health coverage \nmore affordable and accessible to the working populations with the \ngreatest needs.\n  This bill creates a progressive, refundable health care tax credit \ntargeted toward low- and moderate-income individuals and families which \ncan be used for health savings account-eligible health insurance. \nRecent studies show that low- and moderate-income Americans and those \npreviously uninsured are enrolling in health savings accounts or HSAs. \nMore than one-third of HSA purchasers last year had incomes under \n$50,000 per year, and one-third of individual HSA purchasers last year \nwere previously uninsured.\n  Specifically, the refundable tax credit would provide a subsidy of up \nto 90 percent of the cost of health care coverage, up to a maximum \ncredit of $1,000 per adult and up to $3,000 for a family. Additionally, \nthe credit will be advanceable so that an individual or family would \nnot have to wait to be reimbursed to purchase coverage.\n  This bill also contains an important provision to address the higher \nhealth care costs and higher poverty levels in the noncontiguous States \nof Alaska and Hawaii. In Alaska, the qualifying income thresholds for \nboth individual Alaskans and Alaskan families are increased by 25 \npercent.\n  Though the Helping Working Americans Afford Health Coverage Act is \nnot as comprehensive as S. 160, the SAVE Act, Securing Access, Value \nand Equality Act--legislation that I introduced\n\n[[Page S3987]]\n\nearlier in the Congress--it is still an important first step in \naddressing the needs of the uninsured.\n  The National Association of Health Underwriters states that this bill \n``will provide much needed relief by providing a refundable tax credit \nthat can be used for both their health insurance policy premiums and as \na deposit into their HSA account This (bill) will provide individuals \nwith ready access to health care while encouraging them to become more \nengaged in the process of obtaining health care.''\n  Mr. President, helping Americans afford insurance saves money in the \nlong run. Between $65 billion and $130 billion of public health dollars \nare spent on treating acute patients. Much of this could be saved if \nonly those individuals received preventative care.\n  Making health insurance more affordable will make a real difference \nto the Nation's physical and economic health. I am proud of Alaskans \nand all Americans who have united during National Cover the Uninsured \nWeek and are bringing attention to this national health care crisis. I \nask my colleagues to take an important step in helping the uninsured by \nsupporting the Helping Working Americans Afford Health Insurance Act of \n2006.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Frist, Mr. Reid, Mr. \n        Grassley, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. DeWine, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. \n        Brownback, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Warner, Mr. Inouye, Mr. \n        Hagel, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Allen, Ms. \n        Landrieu, Mr. Obama, Mr. Salazar, and Mr. Menendez):\n  S. 2703. A bill to amend the Voting Rights Act of 1965; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the chairmen of both \nthe Senate and House Judiciary Committees, the ranking member of the \nHouse Judiciary Committee, the Democratic and Republican leaders of \nboth the Senate and the House of Representatives, and members of \nCongress from both parties to introduce a bill to reauthorize and \nreinvigorate the temporary provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. \nThe bicameral, bipartisan introduction of this bill reflects not only \nits historic importance as a guarantor of the right to vote for all \nAmericans, but also the broad consensus that the expiring provisions \nmust be extended this year without delay.\n  There are few things as critical to our Nation, and to American \ncitizenship, as voting. Like the rights guaranteed by the First \nAmendment, the right to vote is foundational because it secures the \neffective exercise of all other rights. As people are able to register, \nvote, and elect candidates of their choice, their interests and rights \nget attention. The very legitimacy of our government is dependent on \nthe access all Americans have to the political process.\n  The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was the result of an historic struggle \nfor civil rights led by such American heroes as Dr. Martin Luther King, \nJr., Coretta Scott King and Rosa Parks, who refused to be treated as \nsecond-class citizens. That struggle reached a crucial turning point on \nMarch 7, 1965, on the Edmund Pettis Bridge in Selma, AL, when State \ntroopers brutally attacked John Lewis and his fellow civil rights \nmarchers who were fighting for their right to vote.\n  The events of that day, now known as ``Bloody Sunday,'' were captured \nin newspapers and on televisions across the country, and those powerful \nimages marked a crucial turning point in securing the right to vote for \nall Americans. A few days after the violence of Bloody Sunday, \nPresident Lyndon Johnson outlined the proposed Voting Rights Act of \n1965, before a joint session of Congress. Within months, Congress \npassed it so that the Constitution's guarantees of equal access to the \nelectoral process, regardless of race, would not be undermined by \ndiscriminatory practices.\n  The enactment of the Voting Rights Act in 1965 transformed the \nlandscape of political inclusion. Prior to the Act, minorities of all \nraces faced major barriers to participation in the political process, \nthrough the use of such devices as poll taxes, exclusionary primaries, \nintimidation by voting officials, language barriers, and systematic \nvote dilution. We have made great gains since that time, but our work \nis not finished. The record established in 10 hearings in the House of \nRepresentatives indicates that the tools provided by the expiring \nprovisions of the Voting Rights Act remain necessary for protecting the \nvoting rights of minority Americans in this country.\n\n  Among the Act's most critical protections are the pre-clearance \nprovisions of Section 5, which prevent discriminatory laws from going \ninto practice. The Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act \nof 2006 would extend these protections for 25 years, retaining the most \neffective measures to fight certain kinds of pervasive and recurring \ndiscrimination.\n  The insidious discriminatory tactics that led to the original Voting \nRights Act were deeply rooted. In the annals of our Nation, this fight \ndates back almost 100 years, to the ratification of the 15th Amendment \nin 1870, the last of the post-Civil War Reconstruction amendments. It \ntook implementation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 for people of all \nraces in many parts of our country to gain the effective exercise of \nrights guaranteed 95 years earlier by the 15th Amendment. The pre-\nclearance provisions were one of the primary reasons this Act succeeded \nwhere earlier attempts had failed. Section 5 requires certain covered \njurisdictions with a history of discrimination to pre-clear all voting \nchanges with either the Department of Justice or the U.S. District \nCourt for the District of Columbia. In doing so, Section 5 combats the \npractices in these jurisdictions of shifting from one invalidated \ndiscriminatory tactic to another, which had undermined earlier efforts \nto enforce 15th Amendment guarantees.\n  We have made significant progress toward a more inclusive democracy \nover the past four decades since the enactment of the Voting Rights Act \nin 1965. However, I fear that if we fail to reauthorize the expiring \nprovisions of the Voting Rights Act, our country is likely to \nbackslide. We must make sure those gains do not suffer the same fate as \nthe gains in voting rights made during Reconstruction.\n  After the Civil War, the Reconstruction Act promised that the \nguarantees of the 15th Amendment would be realized. Between 1870 and \n1900, 22 African Americans served in the United States Congress. In \n1868, Louisiana elected an African-American Lieutenant Governor, Oscar \nDunn, and 87 African Americans held seats in the South Carolina \nlegislature. However, these Reconstruction-era gains in African-\nAmerican voting and representation proved to be short-lived. Following \nthe end of Reconstruction, the rights of African Americans to vote and \nto hold office were virtually eliminated in many areas through \ndiscriminatory legal barriers, intimidation, and violence. The changes \nwere swift, systematic and severe. By 1896, Representative George White \nof North Carolina was the only African American remaining in the U.S. \nCongress, and it would take 72 years after Representative White left \nCongress for African-American voters in the South to elect another \ncandidate of their choice to Congress.\n  In Mississippi, the percentage of African-American voting-age men \nregistered to vote fell from more than 90 percent during Reconstruction \nto less than 6 percent in 1892. Between 1896 and 1900, the number of \nAfrican-American voters in Louisiana was reduced from 130,000 to a mere \n5,000. Unlike their short-lived gains made during Reconstruction, \nAfrican-American voters' exclusion from the ballot box was persistent. \nOnly 3 percent of voting-age African-American men and women in the \nSouth were registered to vote in 1940, only 1 percent in Mississippi--\njust 1 percent. These numbers are staggering, and they provide a \nhistory lesson we should not ignore.\n\n  As part of the Voting Rights Act reauthorization in 1975, Congress \nadded Section 203, which requires bilingual voting assistance for \ncertain language minority groups. This provision was enacted pursuant \nto congressional power to enforce the 14th and 15th Amendments. Section \n203 has been a key factor to expanding the inclusiveness of democracy \nto all citizens and has led to extraordinary gains in representation \nand participation made by Asian-American and Hispanic-American \ncitizens. Like Section 5, Section 203 is expiring in 2007. The Voting \nRights Act Reauthorization and\n\n[[Page S3988]]\n\nAmendments Act of 2006 would extend these critical protections for 25 \nyears.\n  Hispanic-American populations have been one of the primary minority \nlanguage groups to benefit from the protections of the bilingual \nprovisions of the Voting Rights Act. For example effective \nimplementation of the bilingual provisions in San Diego County, CA, \nhelped increase voter registration by more than 20 percent. And voter \nturnout among Hispanic Americans in New Mexico rose 26 percent between \n2000 and 2004 after television and radio spots in Spanish educated \nlisteners about voter registration and absentee ballots.\n  Voting rights belong to people who are American citizens. They are \ntrying to vote but many of them are struggling with the English \nlanguage due to disparities in education and the incremental process of \nlearning. It is imperative that all citizens be able to fully exercise \ntheir rights as citizens, particularly a right as fundamental as the \nright to vote. Renewing the expiring language provisions of the Voting \nRights Act will continue to help make that a reality.\n  Rather than merely extending the Voting Rights Act, Congress now has \nan opportunity to reinvigorate the Act, strengthening and improving its \nremedies. The Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of \n2006 does so by clarifying certain parts of Section 5 to give clear \nguidance to the Courts and to restore the original understanding of the \nAct. Two recent Supreme Court decisions have significantly narrowed \nSection 5's effectiveness and undermined the purposes of the Act.\n  The Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006 \nremedies the Supreme Court's holding in Reno v. Bossier Parish, by \nmaking clear that a voting rule change motivated by any discriminatory \npurpose violates Section 5. Under the holding in Reno v. Bossier \nParish, certain voting rule changes passed with the intent to \ndiscriminate against minorities could pass Section 5 muster. Because \nsuch an interpretation is inconsistent with purposes of the Voting \nRights Act to eliminate discriminatory tactics that undermine the \nguarantees of the 15th Amendment, the Voting Rights Act Reauthorization \nand Amendments Act fixes this inconsistency by clarifying that a voting \nrule change motivated by any discriminatory purpose also cannot be pre-\ncleared.\n\n  The Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006 also \nremedies the Supreme Court's holding in Georgia v. Ashcroft. Under the \ntest established in Georgia for assessing a jurisdiction's challenge to \ndenial of Section 5 pre-clearance, the court can give greater weight to \nnumerous undefined considerations than to the ability of a minority \ncommunity to elect a candidate of its choice. This test is as difficult \nto administer as it is contrary to the purposes of the Act. This act \nfixes both of these problems by restoring the original understanding \nthat the purpose of the Voting Rights Act is to protect the minority \ncommunity's ability to elect their preferred candidates of choice and \nby setting forth defined factors.\n  In addition to restoring the Act's original meaning, this Act makes \nchanges to the expiring Federal examiners and observers provisions to \nbetter allocate resources for combating discrimination in voting. The \nVoting Rights Act provides for Federal examiners to ensure that legally \nqualified persons are free to register for Federal, State, and local \nelections and that observers to observe whether citizens who are \neligible to vote are able to exercise the right to vote. Federal \nobservers are the most frequently used federal oversight tool in voting \nand the only Federal officials authorized to enter polls and places \nwhere votes are tabulated. This Act eliminates Federal examiners \nbecause they have not been appointed to jurisdictions certified for \ncoverage in more than 20 years, and other laws such as the Help America \nVote Act now address the concern of voting rolls. At the same time, the \nbill strengthens the observers provisions to allow the assignment of \nfederal observers upon finding that there is a reasonable belief that a \nviolation of the 14th or 15th Amendments will occur, without having to \nfirst certify federal examiners.\n  The Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendment Act also removes \nan impediment to effective protection of voting rights by authorizing \nthe prevailing party in a lawsuit brought under Section 2 to recover \nexpert costs as part of the attorney fees already authorized. This will \nhave a significant impact on the ability of litigants to successfully \ncombat discrimination in court.\n  The process of reauthorization began in the House of Representatives, \nwhere Representatives Nadler, Chabot and Watt presided over 10 hearings \non the effectiveness and continuing need for the expiring provisions of \nthe Voting Rights Act. Last week, the distinguished House Judiciary \nchairman and ranking member appeared before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee and introduced the extensive record from those hearings. I am \ngrateful for the hard work that has been done in the House, and I want \nto thank Chairman Specter for agreeing to move forward promptly with \nSenate Judiciary Committee hearings on the expiring provisions.\n  Congress has reauthorized and revitalized the Act four times, each \ntime with overwhelmingly bipartisan support. As I noted last week in \nwelcoming the House Judiciary chairman and ranking member, we are \nrepeating the bicameral and bipartisan process of the 1982 \nreauthorization. In 1982, Chairman Specter and I were both Members of \nthe Judiciary Committee, along with Senators Kennedy, Biden, Hatch and \nGrassley. Under the chairmanship of Senator Strom Thurmond, \nreauthorization was reported by the Judiciary Committee and passed both \nhouses of Congress. I am hopeful that our Committee can accomplish the \nwork that needs to be done and report this bill to the full Senate \nbefore the Memorial Day recess.\n  The Voting Rights Act of 1965 is one of the most important laws \nCongress has ever passed, helping to usher the country out of a history \nof discrimination and into the greater inclusion of all Americans in \nthe decisions about our Nation's future. Our democracy and our Nation \nhave been better and richer for it. While I hope some day these \nextraordinary remedies are not needed, I urge the Senate to build on \nthe work done in the House of Representatives to extend the expiring \nprovisions so that we can eliminate recurring discrimination and make \nsure that the gains we have made are not lost. I am heartened that this \nis not a partisan issue benefiting one party or another. Rather, as \ndemonstrated by the bicameral and bipartisan process we continue for \nreauthorizing and revitalizing the Act's expiring provisions, this is \nabout making our democracy reflect the will of all of the American \npeople.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Specter, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. \n        Biden, Mr. Kerry, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Nelson of \n        Florida, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Lautenberg, \n        Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 2704. A bill to revise and extend the National Police Athletic \nLeague Youth Enrichment Act of 2000; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I join Senators Specter, Feinstein, \nBiden, Kerry, Boxer, Schumer, Nelson of Florida, Menendez, Dodd, \nKennedy, Lautenberg, Durbin, and Lieberman to introduce a bill to \nreauthorize the Police Athletic/Activities League, better known as PAL. \nThese local youth crime prevention programs, run by police officers \nnationwide, provide after-school educational, athletic, and \nrecreational opportunities for the communities they serve.\n  The first PAL chapter was founded in the 1910s in New York. The \ngrowth since then has been tremendous, and there are now over 330 PAL \nchapters in 38 States, DC, the Virgin Islands, Canada, and Nigeria, \nserving approximately 2 million children between the ages of 5 and 18. \nIn my own home State of Ohio, we are fortunate enough to have 28 of \nthese outstanding organizations.\n  Studies conducted in Eastlake, OH, and Portland, OR, have shown a \nsubstantial drop in the juvenile crime rate in those two cities upon \nthe creation of a PAL chapter. These chapters make a point to serve \nthose most in need. For example, 50 percent of the kids involved in the \n28 Ohio chapters come from families with a median income of less than \n$20,000.\n\n[[Page S3989]]\n\n  PAL chapters provide kids with a wide range of activities. One \nchapter in Ohio, for instance--the Chillicothe-Ross County Police \nAthletic League--has offered dances, films, rap contests, and programs \nin archery, art, basketball, bowling, boxing, computers, cooking, CPR, \nfishing, fitness, lacrosse, nutrition, paint ball, running, tumbling, \nvolleyball, and weightlifting. Other chapters around the country have \noffered programs like chess, flag football, junior golf, homework clubs \nand hydroponic gardening. In addition--through their Youth Leadership \nCouncil--PALs provide a setting for kids to learn important skills to \nassist them in becoming the leaders of tomorrow.\n  But, the Police Athletic/Activities League does more than merely \nprovide after-school activities to kids who may not otherwise have \naccess to tutoring or athletic facilities. PAL provides them with \nmentors and positive role models. In addition, PAL programs help teach \nkids that their relationship with law enforcement need not be one that \nis ``us vs. them;'' instead, to quote National PAL, itself, the \nrelationship can be one of ``cops and kids together--providing \nsolutions through sports and education.''\n  The money provided by this reauthorization bill would enable PAL \nprograms to continue their current programs and also expand--at a rate \nof 50 chapters per year--into areas where kids can truly benefit from \nthe good work of the PAL.\n  The PAL has been a success for over 90 years, and the Senate \nconsistently has supported this outstanding organization. We passed the \nNational Police Athletic League Youth Enrichment Act of 2000 by \nunanimous consent, and I urge my colleagues to continue to support the \nPAL with this reauthorization.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2704\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide an \nenrollment priority for veterans, who are recipients of certain medals \nof valor, in health care services provided by the Department of \nVeterans Affairs; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of our Nation's \nveterans and military heroes to introduce the ``Heroes Healthcare \nEligibility Act of 2006.'' This legislation would recognize the \nsacrifices and contributions of our Nation's military heroes by \nensuring that our military heroes have full access to VA health care.\n  Since January 2003, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs has used his \nauthority under current law to prohibit Priority 8 veterans from \nenrolling in the VA health care system. Priority 8 veterans are those \nwith no service-connected disability and have an income of over \n$26,902. To date, more than 260,000 of these supposed ``middle-income'' \nveterans have been turned away from the VA health care system.\n  I was dismayed to learn that the group of Priority 8 veterans may \ninclude thousands of war heroes, who were awarded medals for valor in \ncombat but are ineligible for health care because of income \nlimitations. Lou Green, a Korean war veteran and veterans advocate, \nbrought a case to my attention where a multiple Silver Star award \nwinner was denied access to care. This particular veteran had income \njust slightly above the means test limit but was told that his award \n``meant nothing'' for getting VA health care.\n  This bill would recognize those veterans who have been awarded the \nSilver Star Medal or higher for valor and give them access to VA health \ncare on par with former POWs; service connected veterans rated 10 \npercent or 20 percent disabled and all those who have received a Purple \nHeart. From World War II to present, more than 134,000 servicemembers \nhave been awarded either the Silver Star, Air Force Cross, Navy Cross, \nDistinguished Service Cross or the Medal of Honor.\n  I would tell my colleagues that there is precedent for establishing \npriority eligibility for a veteran's benefit as a result of being \nawarded a military decoration. As I mentioned before, today combat \nveterans in receipt of a Purple Heart are eligible for VA health care, \nas they fall into the third priority group. Also, current policy at \nArlington National Cemetery gives eligibility for full-body burial to \nthose who have been awarded the Silver Star or higher for valor or are \nin receipt of the Purple Heart.\n  As much as I would like to reopen the doors to VA health care for all \nPriority 8 veterans, this legislation to recognize our Nation's \nmilitary heroes is a step in the right direction. It is time our \ndecorated military heroes receive the recognition they so richly \ndeserve. I urge my colleagues to join me in making this needed change \nto VA's health eligibility for our military heroes a reality.\n\n[[Page S3990]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/03/senate-section/article/S3990-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3990]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 462--DESIGNATING JUNE 8, 2006, AS THE DAY OF A \n                    NATIONAL VIGIL FOR LOST PROMISE\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Biden, and Mr. Talent) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 462\n\n       Whereas over 26,000 citizens die from the effects of drug \n     abuse each year;\n       Whereas the damage from drugs is not limited to drug \n     abusers, the collateral damage from drugs is enormous, and \n     drug abuse costs society over $60,000,000,000 in social costs \n     and lost productivity;\n       Whereas drugs rob users, their families, and all the people \n     of the United States of dreams, promises, ambitions, talents, \n     and lives;\n       Whereas drug abuse affects millions of families in the \n     United States;\n       Whereas the stigma of drug abuse and the cloak of denial \n     keep many individuals and families from dealing with the \n     impact of drugs;\n       Whereas many friends and families are ashamed to \n     acknowledge the death of their loved ones caused by drug \n     abuse;\n       Whereas all the people of the United States can benefit \n     from illuminating the problem of drug abuse and its impact on \n     families, communities, and society;\n       Whereas the futures of thousands of youth of the United \n     States have been cut short because of drug abuse, including \n     the life of--\n       (1) Irma Perez, who suffered and died of an Ecstasy \n     overdose at age 14;\n       (2) David Manlove, who wanted to be a doctor, but died from \n     inhalant abuse at age 16;\n       (3) David Pease, an articulate debater, who died of a \n     heroin overdose at age 23;\n       (4) Ian Eaccarino, a college student who died of a heroin \n     overdose at age 20;\n       (5) Jason Surks, who was studying to be a pharmacist, but \n     died of prescription drug abuse at age 19;\n       (6) Kelley McEnery Baker, who died of an overdose of \n     Ecstasy at age 23;\n       (7) Ryan Haight, who died of an overdose of prescription \n     drugs he had purchased over the Internet at age 18; and\n       (8) Taylor Hooton, a high school baseball star whose life \n     was cut short by steroids at age 16;\n       Whereas these deaths represent only a small sample of the \n     lost promise that drug abuse has cost the future of the \n     United States;\n       Whereas law enforcement, public health and research \n     organizations, community coalitions, drug prevention outreach \n     organizations, individual parents, siblings, friends, and \n     concerned citizens are joining together on June 8, 2006, in a \n     Vigil for Lost Promise, to call public attention to the \n     tremendous promise which has been lost with the deaths of \n     those affected by drugs: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals of the Vigil for Lost Promise;\n       (2) encourages any families who have been affected by a \n     death due to drugs to visit www.nationalparentvigil.com;\n       (3) encourages all young people to choose to live a drug-\n     free life;\n       (4) encourages all people of the United States to work to \n     stop drug abuse before it starts and remain vigilant against \n     the far reaching loss of promise caused by deaths from drug \n     abuse;\n       (5) designates June 8, 2006, as the day of a National Vigil \n     for Lost Promise; and\n       (6) encourages all citizens of the United States to \n     remember the lost promise of youth caused by drug abuse on \n     this day.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, sadly, every year over 26,000 people die \nin this country from the effects of drug abuse. This is a staggering \nand sobering statistic. Still, millions more have been devastated by \nthis tragic loss of life and promise. Ordinary people like you and I, \nare left to cope with the loss of a loved one senselessly taken at the \nhands of drugs.\n  Over the years, families and friends have individually found ways to \nremember and honor their memory. But to date, there has been no \nnational event to bring people together to call attention to the nature \nand extent of the drug problem in this country.\n  Now, eight families who have personally suffered the loss of a loved \none because of drugs have joined together to plan a remembrance. On \nJune 8, 2006, the first annual Vigil for Lost Promise: Remembering \nThose Who Have Died From Drugs will be held in Washington, DC.\n  This national event finally gives these and other families the \nopportunity to remember and honor the memory of those who have died \nfrom drugs. This event will illuminate for everyone just how pervasive \nand dangerous this problem is in our society.\n  Others sharing similar stories of loss will be joined by leaders in \nthe drug prevention, treatment and education fields, community leaders, \nclergy from all faith, educators, legislators and concerned citizens as \nwell as the Drug Enforcement Administration, the National Institute on \nDrug Abuse and the Partnership for a Drug Free America to raise public \nawareness about the terrible toll that drugs take on families, friends \nand society .\n  Today, I am pleased to submit along with my colleagues, Senator Biden \nand Senator Talent, a resolution to support the goals of the Vigil for \nLost Promise and to designate June 8, 2006, as the day of a National \nVigil for Lost Promise.

Con. Res. 93\n\n       Whereas the members of the United States Armed Forces have \n     served honorably and courageously in Iraq;\n       Whereas Congress and the people of the United States owe a \n     debt of gratitude to those members of the Armed Forces who \n     have died fighting for their country; and\n       Whereas Iraq will have established a free and democratic \n     government once it completes its constitution-making process: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the United States should not maintain a permanent \n     military presence or military bases in Iraq;\n       (2) the United States should not attempt to control the \n     flow of Iraqi oil; and\n       (3) United States Armed Forces should be redeployed from \n     Iraq as soon as practicable after the completion of Iraq's \n     constitution-making process or December 31, 2006, whichever \n     occurs first.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, Monday, May 1, marked the 3rd anniversary \nof President Bush's speech on the flight deck of the USS Abraham \nLincoln. On that occasion, with a giant banner behind him proclaiming \n``Mission Accomplished,'' the President said triumphantly that ``major \ncombat operations in Iraq have ended.'' But, 3 years later, 133,000 \ntroops remain on the ground, and' the President has signaled that the \nU.S. military occupation in Iraq is open-ended and of indefinite \nduration.\n  This has given rise to suspicions that the United States has long-\nterm designs on Iraq and its oil. And it has deprived the Iraqi \ngovernment of incentive to resolve its internal divisions and stand on \nits own feet. With the war in Iraq now in its 4th year, it is clear \nthat the President's course is not a strategy for success; it is a \nstrategy for continued stalemate and stagnation.\n  It is time to chart new course. To that end, today, I am offering a \nconcurrent resolution that does three things: 1. It states that ``the \nUnited States should not maintain a permanent military presence or \nmilitary bases in Iraq. 2. It states that ``the United States should \nnot attempt to control the flow of Iraqi oil. And 3. It states that the \n``United States Armed Forces should be redeployed from Iraq as soon as \npracticable after the completion of Iraq's constitution-making process \nor December 31, 2006, whichever comes first.'' A companion to this \nconcurrent resolution has been offered in the other body by \nRepresentative Mike Thompson of California.\n  The capable and courageous men and women of our Armed Forces have \ncompleted the tasks they were sent to Iraq to accomplish: Saddam \nHussein's dictatorship has been deposed; we are certain that Iraq does \nnot possess weapons of mass destruction; and the Iraqi people have a \nconstitution and a democratically elected government. To our troops' \ngreat credit, they have achieved these things despite a series of \ndisastrous decisions by their civilian leaders in Washington.\n  Today, the question is: Why are U.S. forces still in Iraq? Our \ncommanders have acknowledged that Iraq's remaining challenges cannot be \nresolved by the U.S. military, as they are mostly political. As GEN \nJohn Abizaid, head of U.S. Central Command, said recently, the \nsituation in Iraq is ``changing in its nature from insurgency toward \nsectarian violence''--I would. add, with U.S. troops caught in the \ncrossfire.\n  Given these realities, President Bush's call to ``stay the course'' \nis a slogan, not a strategy. for success. Indeed, I fear that ``stay \nthe course'' really means ``stay forever,'' and this sends exactly the \nwrong message. It stokes the insurgents, who believe that the U.S. \nwants a permanent military presence in Iraq. And it takes away any \nincentive for the Iraqi government to resolve its internal divisions \nand stand on its own feet.\n  As GEN George Casey, our commander in Iraq, told the Senate last \nSeptember, ``Increased coalition presence feeds the notion of \noccupation, contributes to the dependency of Iraqi security forces on \nthe coalition, [and] extends the amount of time that it will take for \nIraqi security forces to become self-reliant.''\n  BG Donald Alston, the chief U.S. military spokesman in Iraq, put it \nthis way: ``I think the more accurate way to approach this right now is \nto concede that . . . this insurgency is not going to be settled . . . \nthrough military options or military operations. It's going to be \nsettled in the political process.''\n  I would add that the Iraqi people also believe that a redeployment of \nU.S.\n\n[[Page S3992]]\n\nforces would give a boost to political progress. According to a recent \npoll conducted by the University of Maryland, more than 80 percent of \nIraqis want U.S. forces to leave Iraq. When asked what the impact of a \nwithdrawal of U.S. troops would be, large majorities of Iraqis believe \nthat insurgent attacks will decrease, sectarian violence will decline, \nand the sectarian factions in parliament will be more willing to \ncooperate.\n\n  We all hope that the Sunni, Shiite, and Kurdish leaders are sincere \nin their stated desire to avoid an all-out civil war. Last week, they \nagreed on a new prime minister, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki. And Mr. al-Maliki \nhas pledged to announce a national-unity cabinet as quickly as \npossible. As President Bush said on Monday, the creation of a new Iraqi \ngovernment is ``a turning point.'' We hope that is the case. But \nwhether or not Mr. al-Maliki makes good on his pledges, it is certainly \ntime for a turning point in U.S. policy in Iraq.\n  The remainder of the year 2006 must be a period of transition to full \nIraqi sovereignty, with the goal of deploying U.S. forces out of Iraq \nby the end of this calendar year. It is time to hand off security \nresponsibilities to the Iraqi army and police, and to redeploy our U.S. \narmed forces from Iraq by Dec. 31.\n  This strategic redeployment must involve converting our vast military \npresence on the ground in Iraq to a quick-reaction force staged in \ncountries bordering Iraq--countries that share our interest in a stable \nIraq and view our military presence in the region as a stabilizing \nforce. This force could be used to respond to threats to our national \nsecurity in Iraq or elsewhere. I believe the vast number of National \nGuard units should be redeployed to their states to shore up gaps and \nvulnerabilities in our own homeland security.\n  I would expect that, as our troops withdraw from Iraq, this would \nfree up U.S. forces to combat the resurgence of the Taliban in \nAfghanistan. Other troops would be available to help respond to \nemerging terrorist threats in countries such as Somalia, Sudan, and \nYemen, which threaten to become major breeding grounds for terrorists.\n  At the same time that we are redeploying our Armed Forces, we need to \nfoster sustained diplomatic engagement--working with Middle Eastern \nnations--to facilitate rival Iraqi factions in reaching a political \nsettlement. Iraq's neighbors have a profound stake in its stability, \nbut they currently have no incentive to get involved. Once it is clear \nthat the U.S. is leaving, those nations will be highly motivated to \nbroker a deal within Iraq.\n  Some say that the U.S. forces in Iraq are the only thing that stands \nbetween the Sunnis and Shiites, and all-out civil war. I disagree. It \nis the ongoing presence of U.S. forces--and the prospect that we will \nbe in Iraq as a babysitter for years to come--that has delayed progress \non the political front. It allowed Iraqi leaders to quarrel and dither \nfor more than four months before finally choosing an acceptable prime \nminister.\n  In addition, our continuing presence--in fact, our apparently growing \npresence in Iraq--is a propaganda victory and recruiting tool for the \ninsurgency in Iraq, and for Islamic extremists around the world. The \ninsurgents and jihadists are strengthened by the overwhelming \nperception among Iraqis that the United States military is an occupying \nforce, that we are building what appear to be permanent bases, and that \nour continuing presence in Iraq is all about oil.\n  Meanwhile, the Congressional Research Service reports that we are now \nspending $6.4 billion a month in Iraq--up sharply from last year. \nIncluding funds committed by the emergency supplemental bill currently \nbeing debated in the Senate, we have spent a grand total of $320 \nbillion in Iraq. More than 2,400 American troops have been killed, and \nnearly 18,000 have been wounded. We are in the process of building a \ngigantic new U.S. embassy in Baghdad that will span 104 acres, the size \nof nearly 80 football fields. This does not look like a U.S. mission \nthat plans on winding down or relinquishing its grip on Iraq. To the \ncontrary, it is easy to see how ordinary Iraqis view this as the \nbehavior of a conquering power that has no intention of leaving. And \nthis perception continues to give powerful fuel to the insurgency.\n\n  There is another important reason for redeploying our forces from \nIraq. Iraq did not attack us on 9/11, nor did Saddam Hussein's \ngovernment have any operational links to al Qaeda. By preemptively \nattacking Iraq, we committed a major strategic error in the larger war \non terror. Simply put: We took our eyes off the ball. We diverted our \nmilitary and intelligence resources away from Afghanistan, away from \nthe hunt for Osama Bin Laden. And the consequences are plain to see. It \nis no coincidence that, today, the Taliban is resurgent in Afghanistan. \nNor is it a coincidence that Bin Laden is still at large, still \ndirecting al Qaeda operations, still threatening us.\n  Indeed, by invading Iraq and getting bogged down in a guerilla war, \nthere, the United States has given a huge gift to Bin Laden and al \nQaeda. Not only has it taken the heat off of the terrorists who \nattacked us on 9/11, it has given them a propaganda victory and, as I \nsaid, a major recruiting tool. The sooner we acknowledge this strategic \nblunder and take steps to reverse it, the sooner we redeploy our \nmilitary and strategic assets to confront our real enemies, the better \noff we will be.\n  This resolution is not only about the future of Iraq as a sovereign, \nindependent nation; it is also about the unity and security of the \nAmerican people. This misbegotten, misguided, mismanaged war is \ndividing our nation and distracting our government from urgent \npriorities, including health care, education, law enforcement, and, \nyes, a smarter approach to the very real terrorist threats of today and \ntomorrow.\n  The men and women of our Armed Forces have sacrificed greatly. It is \ntime to allow the political process to go forward, and to demand that \nIraq's new leaders take responsibility for their country's future. And \nit is time to bring home as many troops as possible, consistent with \nforce-protection requirements, and to redeploy as many as necessary to \nsuccessfully pursue Bin Laden and al Qaeda, and to protect our vital \ninterests around the world.\n  President Bush tells us to be patient. He says we will succeed in \nIraq. He says Iraq will become a flourishing democracy that will spread \nthe flame of freedom across the entire Middle East. But, with due \nrespect to President Bush, Vice President Cheney, and Defense Secretary \nRumsfeld, they have been consistently wrong--disastrously wrong--in \ntheir predictions with regard to Iraq. Before the invasion, Vice \nPresident Cheney said that Iraq had ``reconstituted nuclear weapons.'' \nSecretary Rumsfeld said he knew exactly where Saddam was storing his \nweapons of mass destruction. As I noted, 3 long years ago, President \nBush said that major combat operations were over, mission accomplished. \nThey assured us that the war would be self-financed thanks to Iraq's \noil (in fact, Iraqi oil production has declined by 700,000 barrels a \nday since the invasion). They said, a year ago, that the insurgency was \n``in its last throes.'' I could go on and on with this litany of false \nassertions--some would call them lies--and predictions that turned out \nto be 100 percent wrong.\n  So, at this point, President Bush has not only spent his political \ncapital, he has squandered the last shred of his credibility when it \ncomes to Iraq. Specifically with regard to America's departure from \nIraq, President Bush has it backwards. He says that our army will stand \ndown only as the Iraqi army stands up. The truth is that the Iraqi \narmy--and government--will stand up only when it is clear that the \nAmerican military is committed to standing down by the end of this \nyear. We can send that message loudly and clearly by passing this-\nconcurrent resolution. I urge my colleagues to support this measure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/03/senate-section/article/S3992-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3992-S3993]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOTICES OF HEARINGS/MEETINGS\n\n\n                Subcommittee on Public Lands and Forests\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 463, which was submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 463) recognizing the 58th anniversary \n     of the independence of the State of Israel.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I acknowledge three significant days \nof commemoration that fall around this time each year. Today is the \n58th anniversary of David Ben Gurion's declaration of Israel's \nIndependence and the end of the British Mandate in Israel. As a Jewish \nAmerican, I am proud to be one of the cosponsors of the concurrent \nresolution the Senate will pass celebrating Yom Haatzmaut, Israel's \nIndependence Day.\n  Yom Haatzmaut is usually observed on the 5th of the Jewish month \nIyyar; this year it falls on May 3rd. In Israel, Yom Haatzmaut is \nalways preceded by Yom Hazikaron, Israel's Memorial Day for fallen \nsoldiers. The proximity of the dates is a reminder that Israelis owe \ntheir independence to the soldiers who sacrificed their lives for it. \nThe official switch from Yom Hazikaron to Yom Haatzmaut is signaled \nwhen the flag is raised from half staff to the top of the pole in a \nceremony on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem after sundown.\n  Last week, the Senate commemorated Yom Hashoa, Holocaust Remembrance \nDay, with S. Res. 445, which I also cosponsored. Yom Hashoa is when the \nJewish community solemnly remembers the suffering caused by the Nazi \nHolocaust led by Adolph Hitler during World War II. During the \nHolocaust, over six million Jews perished, along with Gypsies, \nhomosexuals, and other victims of Nazi genocide.\n  Yom Hashoa is observed every year on the 27th of Nisan in the Jewish \ncalendar, a week after the seventh day of Passover, and a week before \nYom Hazikaron and Yom Haatzmaut. Yom Hashoa became a national holiday \nin the State of Israel in 1959. Each year, throughout the streets of \nIsrael, the sound of sirens on Yom Hashoa stops traffic and pedestrians \nfor 2 minutes of silent devotion.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that the U.S. Senate is adopting these \nimportant measures.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 463) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 463\n\n       Whereas, on May 14, 1948, the State of Israel was \n     established as a sovereign and independent country;\n       Whereas the United States was 1 of the first countries to \n     recognize Israel, only 11 minutes after its creation;\n       Whereas Israel has provided Jews from all over the world \n     with an opportunity to reestablish their ancient homeland;\n       Whereas Israel is home to many religious sites that are \n     sacred to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam;\n       Whereas Israel provided a refuge to Jews who survived the \n     horrors of the Holocaust, which were unprecedented in human \n     history;\n       Whereas the people of Israel have established a unique, \n     pluralistic democracy that incorporates the freedoms \n     cherished by the people of the United States, including--\n       (1) the freedom of speech;\n       (2) the freedom of religion;\n       (3) the freedom of association;\n       (4) the freedom of the press; and\n       (5) government by the consent of the governed;\n       Whereas Israel continues to serve as a shining model of \n     democratic values by--\n       (1) regularly holding free and fair elections;\n\n[[Page S3994]]\n\n       (2) promoting the free exchange of ideas; and\n       (3) vigorously exercising in its Parliament, the Knesset, a \n     democratic government that is fully representative of its \n     citizens;\n       Whereas Israel has bravely defended itself from terrorist \n     and military attacks repeatedly since it declared its \n     independence;\n       Whereas the Government of Israel has successfully worked \n     with the neighboring Governments of Egypt and Jordan to \n     establish peaceful and bilateral relations;\n       Whereas, despite the deaths of over 1,000 innocent Israelis \n     at the hands of murderous suicide bombers and other \n     terrorists during the last 5 years, the people of Israel \n     continue to seek peace with their Palestinian neighbors;\n       Whereas visionary Israeli leaders like Yitzhak Rabin and \n     Ariel Sharon were at the forefront of creating conditions for \n     peace in the Middle East;\n       Whereas the United States and Israel enjoy a strategic \n     partnership based on shared democratic values, friendship, \n     and respect;\n       Whereas the people of the United States share an affinity \n     with the people of Israel and view Israel as a strong and \n     trusted ally;\n       Whereas Israel has made significant global contributions in \n     the fields of science, medicine, and technology; and\n       Whereas the Independence Day of Israel on the Jewish \n     calendar coincides this year with May 3, 2006: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the independence of the State of Israel as a \n     significant event for providing refuge and a national \n     homeland for the Jewish people;\n       (2) commends the bipartisan commitment of all \n     administrations and Congresses of the United States since \n     1948 that stood by Israel and worked for its security and \n     well-being;\n       (3) congratulates the United States and Israel for \n     strengthening their bilateral relations during the last year \n     in the fields of defense, diplomacy, and homeland security, \n     and encourages both countries to continue their cooperation \n     in resolving future mutual challenges; and\n       (4) extends warm congratulations and best wishes to the \n     people of Israel as they celebrate the 58th anniversary of \n     the independence of Israel.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this resolution we addressed is a \nresolution recognizing the 58th anniversary of the independence of the \nState of Israel. I am proud to be the sponsor of this resolution and \nappreciate my colleagues for joining me on this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/03/senate-section/article/S3994-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIONAL HUNGER AWARENESS DAY\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Res. 464\n\n       Whereas food insecurity and hunger are a fact of life for \n     millions of low-income citizens of the United States and can \n     produce physical, mental, and social impairments;\n       Whereas recent data published by the Department of \n     Agriculture show that almost 38,200,000 people in the United \n     States live in households experiencing hunger or food \n     insecurity;\n       Whereas the problem of hunger and food insecurity can be \n     found in rural, suburban, and urban portions of the United \n     States, touching nearly every community of the Nation;\n       Whereas, although substantial progress has been made in \n     reducing the incidence of hunger and food insecurity in the \n     United States, certain groups remain vulnerable to hunger and \n     the negative effects of food deprivation, including the \n     working poor, the elderly, homeless people, children, migrant \n     workers, and Native Americans;\n       Whereas the people of the United States have a long \n     tradition of providing food assistance to hungry people \n     through acts of private generosity and public support \n     programs;\n       Whereas the Federal Government provides essential \n     nutritional support to millions of low-income people through \n     numerous Federal food assistance programs, including--\n       (1) the federal food stamp program, as established by the \n     Food Stamp Act of 1977 (7 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.);\n       (2) child nutrition programs; and\n       (3) food donation programs;\n       Whereas there is a growing awareness of the important \n     public and private partnership role that community-based \n     organizations, institutions of faith, and charities provide \n     in assisting hungry and food-insecure people;\n       Whereas more than 50,000 local community-based \n     organizations rely on the support and efforts of more than \n     1,000,000 volunteers to provide food assistance and services \n     to millions of vulnerable people;\n       Whereas a diverse group of organizations have documented \n     substantial increases in requests for emergency food \n     assistance during the last year; and\n       Whereas all citizens of the United States can help \n     participate in hunger relief efforts in their communities \n     by--\n       (1) donating food and money;\n       (2) volunteering; and\n       (3) supporting public policies aimed at reducing hunger: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates June 7, 2006, as ``National Hunger Awareness \n     Day'';\n       (2) calls on the people of the United States to observe \n     National Hunger Awareness Day with--\n       (A) appropriate ceremonies, volunteer activities, and other \n     support for local anti-hunger advocacy efforts and hunger \n     relief charities, including food banks, food rescue \n     organizations, food pantries, soup kitchens, and emergency \n     shelters; and\n       (B) the continued support of programs and public policies \n     that reduce hunger and food insecurity in the United States; \n     and\n       (3) authorizes the offices of Senators Gordon H.

Mr. President, I understand there are two bills at the \ndesk, and I ask for their first reading en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask for a second reading, and in order to \nplace the bills on the calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I \nobject to my own request, all en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The bills will receive their second reading on the next legislative \nday.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will continue with our business, but I \nhave to stop a moment and note that both of these bills, S. 22 and S. \n23, address an issue that is very close to my heart because they focus \non reform of a medical liability system, or a medical malpractice \nsystem that is just flat out broken. The sad thing about it is that the \npatients suffer. Future mothers--women who are pregnant--have to worry \nabout whether an obstetrician will be available if they begin to have \nproblems during their pregnancy. Over half the counties in America \ndon't have an obstetrician. If you are so unfortunate as to have an \naccident driving home tonight or in to work tomorrow, you want to make \nsure there is a neurosurgeon on call to be at that hospital to treat \nyou in the event of a traumatic accident.\n  The truth is neurosurgeons today are fleeing from taking trauma \nemergency\n\n[[Page S3995]]\n\ncalls because of the likelihood--no matter how good they are, no matter \nwhat their past record is, or no matter what they do--of being sued by \npredatory personal injury trial lawyers who are after them because they \ncan make a buck. That is the reality we are talking about. People \nshould be able to depend on access to good quality of care, whether it \nis delivering a baby that future moms have to worry about--and in \nAmerica it shouldn't happen--or having to worry about whether there is \nsomebody appropriate to treat you in the event there is trauma.\n  That is where the vote is going to be when we debate these two bills, \nand hopefully we will be debating these bills sometimes in the next 3 \nor 4 days.\n  I do have to add the other component to it because the other issue, \naside from the access issue, is the cost issue. Everyone knows that \nhealth care costs are skyrocketing, and they are out of reach for many, \nif not most, Americans today. As a physician, I can tell you that if \nyou know you are going to be sued, no matter who you are, and almost \nall physicians are sued today--almost all physicians are sued--if you \nknow you are going to be sued, you practice what we call defensive \nmedicine. And since you know you can be sued sometime in the future, \nfor every patient who comes in, to protect yourself when you are sued, \nno matter if you have done anything wrong, you end up ordering lots of \nextra tests to have a paper trail documented to show that you made the \nright decisions throughout.\n  It is estimated that so-called defensive medicine cost is anywhere \nfrom $100 billion to $125 billion a year. In my own State it is \nestimated to be about $2 billion a year. That is wasted money, \ninefficient use, money that is thrown away. Who pays for it? The \nAmerican people do. The premiums go up. The cost issue is a separate \nissue from the access of care. But the access of care issue and the \ncost issue, the higher you drive up the costs and the lower the access, \nquality falls. That is what is going to be debated when we address \nthese two bills on medical liability by Senator Ensign and the second \nbill by Senator Santorum.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/03/senate-section/article/S3995-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3995]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   CONVEYING SYMPATHY OF CONGRESS TO THE WOMEN OF CIUDAD JUAREZ AND \n                               CHIHUAHUA\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
