Mr. President, the night before last, I went home and my \nwife told me: You have to be home tomorrow--that is, Wednesday night--\nbecause at 9 o'clock all nine Democratic women Senators will be on \n``Larry King.'' I did get home in time to watch the nine Democratic \nwomen Senators on ``Larry King.''\n  When I came to the House of Representatives, there were 22 women in \nthat huge 435-Member body. Now I think there are 62 or something like \nthat. I don't know the exact number.\n  I was elected to the Senate in 1986 with Barbara Mikulski. As \nindicated last night, she is the dean of the Senate women. She is \ncertainly the dean of those nine Democratic Senators there.\n  Having experienced the Senate, a body of 100, with hardly any women, \nI know how much better the Senate is because of having women in the \nSenate. It has improved the Senate. It has improved our country.\n  I was so proud of those nine women last night, proud of what our \ncountry has done and what it has come to. These women have not made the \nSenate better simply because they work on issues relating to women. \nThat has only been part of their talent. They have worked on wide-\nranging issues. Senator Mikulski, for example, spent tremendous time on \nhealth. The National Institutes of Health are located in her State. \nSenator Feinstein, for example, was the ranking member and chair of the \nMilitary Construction Subcommittee responsible for billions of dollars. \nShe has done an outstanding job.\n  I am not going to run through the talents of all nine, but they have \nmade the Senate a much better place. Even though I, as the Democratic \nleader, was so very proud of those nine women last night, it didn't \nmatter what their party affiliation was. This was good for the country \nto see these women there on national television, talking about\n\n[[Page S6324]]\n\nissues they believe are important. The Senate will get better with more \nwomen. It is a unique body, and we are all very fortunate to be able to \nserve in the Senate. But just speaking from personal experience, the \nSenate, I repeat, is a much better place because of the women who serve \nin the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/22/senate-section/article/S6324-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, there \nwill be 60 minutes for debate, divided as follows: Senator Warner, 30 \nminutes; Senator Levin, 15 minutes; and Senator Kerry, 15 minutes.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Warner, would the Chair \nplease advise me when I have consumed 10 minutes?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, since last Tuesday, scores of my constituents \nhave called my office and otherwise communicated with us, asking a very \npoignant question. Since last Tuesday, this country has mourned the \ndeaths of two brave soldiers who were kidnapped and mutilated and \nkilled, both Army PFC Kristian Menchaca, from Texas, and Thomas Tucker, \nof Oregon. The question my constituents are asking me is, How on Earth \ncould the Senate be debating resolutions of withdrawal from Iraq in the \nsame week that we discovered the mutilated bodies of these two American \nsoldiers? Shouldn't our debate, rather, recall the famous words of \nAbraham Lincoln in his Gettysburg address, ``That they shall not have \ndied in vain,'' and motivate us to redouble our efforts to support our \ntroops in carrying out the unfinished business that remains in Iraq?\n  There is unfinished business there, to bring to justice the people \nwho committed these heinous acts and to rid that country and the region \nonce and for all of the evildoers who support that kind of violence \nagainst both Americans and Iraqis and who promise in the future to \ncommit that same kind of violence against us until they have become \nvictorious. These are the terrorists.\n  I found it interesting that one of our colleagues was arguing, \nwrongly, that there were no terrorists in Iraq before we invaded the \ncountry and eliminated Saddam Hussein. The evidence is overwhelming \nthat is not true. But in any event, of what importance is it, given the \nfact that they are there now, mutilating and killing American soldiers \nand Iraqi citizens? What do the terrorists have in mind if we pull out?\n  The President recently and succinctly described the plans of the \nterrorists, directly quoting from a letter that Ayman al-Zawahiri, who \nis the second in command of al-Qaida behind Osama bin Laden, wrote to \nAbu Mus'ab al-Zarqawi, who recently, of course, was brought to justice \nby American troops and was bin Laden's designated leader of al-Qaida in \nIraq:\n\n       Their objective is to drive the United States and coalition \n     forces out of Iraq, and use the vacuum that would be created \n     by an American retreat to gain control of that country. They \n     would then use Iraq as a base from which to launch attacks \n     against America, and overthrow moderate governments in the \n     Middle East, and try to establish a totalitarian Islamic \n     empire.\n\n  In that same letter, Zawahiri stated that the battle in Iraq ``is now \nthe place for the greatest battle of Islam in this era.''\n  It doesn't matter if we are fighting them. They are going to fight \nus. The point is, they are going to fight us wherever the point of the \nbattle is, based upon their choosing. Today they chose that battle to \nbe in Iraq. In some respects, given the quality of American forces, \nthat is a better place for us to be confronting this enemy, these \nevildoers, than waiting for them to come back and attack us in the \nUnited States. That is why we owe so much to the soldiers and to the \nsailors and to the airmen and to the Marines whom we have sent into \nharm's way to confront the enemy there. We owe them not just the best \ntraining and the best equipment and the best planning in the world to \nenable them to carry out their missions but support here at home.\n  The question my constituents are asking me is, What message does it \nsend to our troops, to our allies, and to our enemies, when we begin \ntalk of withdrawal? You can sugarcoat it all you want. You can call it \nphased withdrawal, you can call it timelines, but whatever you call it, \nit pretty much amounts to the same thing.\n  The distinguished minority leader, as a matter of fact, said just a \ncouple of days ago, and I am quoting:\n\n       I think that even though we have at least two positions, I \n     think if you look at them closely, they're both basically the \n     same, that there should be redeployment of troops. It's a \n     question of when.\n\n  Indeed. One resolution says: Right away; it has to be done this year. \nThat is a time certain, this year. And another one talks about \nsubmission of a plan with estimated dates. Dates, of course, are times \ncertain. Whenever they are established, you have a specific time within \nwhich the withdrawal is to occur, whether it is in a phased way or all \nat once, right next door or 1,000 miles away. The bottom line, whatever \nyou want to call it, is withdrawal of American troops within certain \ntimeframes to no longer be able to perform their mission there.\n  Why would you take that kind of position when there is work yet to be \ndone? It has to be based upon the guess that by the time that time \ncomes the work will be finished, that we will have done sufficient work \nin Iraq and training up the Iraqi soldiers and performing, ourselves, \nthat we will no longer be needed. But nobody supporting these \nresolutions knows that. The military commanders on the ground will tell \nyou that they do not know it. No one can know what the circumstances on \nthe ground will be by the end of 2006 or by the middle of 2007.\n  All wars are based upon the circumstances at a given time on the \nground. It would have been folly, for example, simply because we were \nlosing significant numbers of American soldiers in World War II, for \nthe U.S. Congress to pass a resolution, sending it to President \nRoosevelt, saying you have to be out of Germany by a date certain and \nyou have to begin a phased withdrawal of our Pacific troops by a date \ncertain.\n  At that time, America was committed to performing the mission, to \ngetting the job done, to winning the war. What should the condition for \nwithdrawal be? Victory; the ability to say we have accomplished our \nmission, we have pacified the country to a sufficient extent that we \ncan leave without creating a power vacuum into which the Iranians and \nthe Syrians and perhaps the Turks or others might come into Iraq \nbecause of their interests in the area, not sending a message to our \nallies in the region that, instead of being on the winning side, it \nturned out that they chose the wrong side, the side that wanted to \nleave the battlefield before the battle was won.\n  Think about the Iraqis who are supplying intelligence to us right \nnow. They have calculated that we are the winning side and that they \ncan give us information to help get these evildoers without fear of \nretribution--that when we leave they are going to be vulnerable to \nattacks by the insurgents and the terrorists who remain. They calculate \nthat we will stay long enough to do the job. The same thing for the 12 \nmillion Iraqi people who elected their Government and the same thing \nfor the\n\n[[Page S6325]]\n\nGovernment that has now stood up in that country that does not want us \nto leave precipitously. Yes, of course they get the message that they \nhave to eventually be responsible for their own security. Yes, of \ncourse they are participating in the training of their army so that \nthey can eventually do this job themselves. They don't need to receive \na message from the United States that this is ultimately going to be \ntheir responsibility.\n  They understand that. What we cannot do is send to the Iraqi people, \nwho are now very increasingly cooperating with us, send a message to \nour allies in the region that they chose the wrong side, and send a \nmessage to our American troops that we are not willing to back them all \nthe way to victory.\n  That would be the way to lose this war. It has been said many times \nthat the insurgents and terrorists cannot defeat our troops. The only \nway they can win the conflict is if they defeat us here at home by \nundermining our confidence, by undermining our credibility, and by \nundermining our support for our troops.\n  Mr. President, this is the most serious business that the Senate \ncould be debating. It has to do not just with the freedom of Iraqis in \nthe future, or the lives of American soldiers, important as they are; \nit has to do with the security of the people of the United States of \nAmerica from terrorists who are seeking places in the world from which \nto operate. We need to deny them that territory and that support and, \nin the process, persuade the neighbors of Iraq in the region that they \nneed to stay with us, to continue to get the terrorists out of their \ncountry, continue to stop funding the terrorists, and to continue to \nsupport our efforts, so that the words of Osama bin Laden will be \ndemonstrated as absolutely false. Remember what he said--that we are \nthe weak horse, he's the strong horse. Where did he get that idea? \nBecause of previous times in which we have withdrawn.\n  We cannot make that same mistake again. I urge my colleagues to \ndefeat both of these amendments when they are presented this morning.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield to myself such time as I may \nrequire. I thank the Senator from Arizona. He has been a very strong \nvoice, not only in this debate but all debates.\n  Once again, to me, the debate today hinges around getting this new \nGovernment, in which we have invested an awful lot over these 18 months \nin life and limb, dollars, and in every other way, up and running. It \nis now running, Mr. President. I have just left a meeting with the \nSecretary of Defense, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, and General \nCasey, the field commander in Iraq, who were briefing a few of us this \nmorning. Clearly, that Government is setting down its roots, getting \nstabilized, operating as a sovereign entity. We must give them that \nsupport and not send a signal that we are going to pull, possibly, the \nrug out from under them because it is our security environment, \ntogether with the coalition partners, that is enabling that Government \nto function.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes from the time \nallotted.\n  Mr. President, we should take heed of what the Government of Iraq is \ndoing and saying. We should take heed of the fact that it has made \nprogress in establishing itself and making significant steps forward. \nIn this context, let me again remind my colleagues of what the National \nSecurity Adviser for Iraq has said. He suggested we should begin \nwithdrawing troops by the end of this year. That is what the Reed-Levin \namendment would require. He also suggests and predicts that by the end \nof 2007 most American combat forces would be out of the country. He \nsays, in his words:\n\n       The eventual removal of coalition troops from Iraqi streets \n     will help the Iraqis, who now see foreign troops as occupiers \n     rather than the liberators they were meant to be. Moreover, \n     the removal of foreign troops will legitimize Iraq's \n     government in the eyes of the people.\n\n  I concur with Senator Warner that we should support the Iraqi \nGovernment, pay attention to what they are saying. I think we should \npay particular attention to what Iraq's security advisor has said. This \nwas not a casual off-the-cuff remark. He said it first on CNN, where he \nknew he was speaking to a world audience, particularly an American one. \nThen he crafted a very careful op ed opinion for the Washington Post. \nIf that is what one of the key leaders of the Iraqi Government is \nsaying, then I think that supports our efforts for the Reed-Levin \namendment.\n  Also, this amendment has been mischaracterized grotesquely. This is \nnot some arbitrary fixed timetable. This is not something where dates \nmean dates specific. We say precisely that the President shall submit \nto the Congress a plan by the end of 2006, with estimated dates for the \ncontinued, phased redeployment of U.S. forces, with the understanding \nthat unexpected contingencies may arise. I think my colleagues \ndemonstrate a lack of confidence in the ability of the President, \nlistening to his commanders in the field to prepare an estimate of our \nposture in Iraq over the next several years. There is no end point in \nour amendment because we recognize, as so many others, that this \nprocess could take an indefinite time but a time that at least could be \nestimated by the President.\n  Let me also suggest that the Levin-Reed amendment recognizes there \nwill be a residual force in Iraq of American trainers, American \nlogisticians, and of special operations troops to seek out these \nterrorists, rather than having young Americans at checkpoints who are \nsubject, because of a lack, apparently, of coordinated support, to \nbeing attacked successfully by Iraqis. That mission should be done by \nthe Iraqis. But we cannot give up the right and capability of striking \nat terrorists in Iraq. This amendment clearly states that. It is \nsomething else, too, because we have a lot of people coming to the \nfloor talking about we are going to stay the course and we are going to \nsupport them.\n  We have done nothing virtually with respect to nonmilitary support, \neffectively, for Iraq. Where are the State Department teams? Months \nago, with great fanfare, the President announced we are going to \ndevelop eventual reconstruction teams and put them in the provinces of \nIraq. There are only four. They lack resources, they lack personnel, \nand they lack real support and emphasis. Unless we can fix some \nnonmilitary aspects of the reconstruction, redevelopment, political \nmentoring, our military efforts will buy us time that we will squander, \nas we have squandered to date.\n  Now, the real test of the other side is not the rhetoric on the floor \nand the slogans that you cannot ``cut and run'' and appropriately \nrecognizing the great sacrifices of our forces. It is coming down here \nwith a plan--over many years, according to them--and the resources to \nsupport that plan--the billions and billions of dollars that we will \nneed over the next several years, the personnel we need in the country, \nnot just from our military forces but from our State Department, our \nAgency for International Development, and our Justice Department. If we \nare truly committed to this concept of complete victory, we need a \nplan. The President has to deliver such a plan. This amendment will \nrequire him, we hope, to sketch out that plan.\n  At the heart of this, it is not about satisfying the Congress, it is \nabout confiding in, with candor, the American people, telling them what \nthe risks are, what the costs are and how we are going to pay for it. \nIt is easy to come down here and say we are going to support our troops \nand do all these things. But then 2 weeks from today, or a week from \ntoday, we will have a bill to cut the estate tax. How do we pay for \nthese troops and give them equipment and reset our equipment? How do we \ngive resources for troops in the field and support this new Iraqi \nGovernment? With what?\n  The real test of the other side will be when they come up with a plan \nand with money and with resources. I believe this approach is the most \nsound tactically, strategically, and politically, not to surrender but \nto succeed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am disappointed that we are considering \nlegislation that would force the United\n\n[[Page S6326]]\n\nStates to withdraw our troops before we have finished the job in Iraq.\n  It is ironic. Some of my friends on the other side of the aisle fight \nover judicial nominations, they fight the President while he is trying \nto protect our country, and they fight each other. Just about the only \nthing they are unwilling to fight is an actual war.\n  Let me be clear: We got into the war committed to success, and I am \nnever going to allow us to cut and run.\n  Let me remind everyone that bin Laden inspired his followers with his \nview that America was easy to defeat. Let's not do anything to confirm \nhis skewed vision. When we leave Iraq, let's make sure it is stable and \nsecure enough to defend itself.\n  Last Thursday, we had our first vote on pulling out the troops. We \nvoted on a proposal by the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts who \nseeks to require the President to set a date for withdrawal by December \n31, 2006. Wisely, my colleagues voted down the proposal by a 93 to 6 \nvote. Now that is a pretty telling vote in today's partisan atmosphere.\n  The minority is now seeking a scheduled phaseout withdrawal, which \nwould set an artificial deadline that would only encourage and embolden \nour Nation's enemies. I am sure this will get more votes than the \nprevious proposal, but it clearly doesn't have the votes to pass, and \nit shouldn't. The enemy will use this estimate and tell the Iraqi \npopulation that the United States is leaving. This could have \ntremendously harmful repercussions.\n  The United States clearly has a strategy for meeting this difficult \nchallenge in Iraq. Some of those on the other side insist on focusing \non the difficulties, while asserting that we have no strategy.\n  Our goal is to stay in Iraq as long as necessary, but not one day \nlonger.\n  Our strategy is to ensure that the Iraqi people have developed a \nsecure constitutional government that embodies a national compact \nbetween all Iraqi groups.\n  And it is training their forces to provide for their own security.\n  We have made significant progress. The Iraqis have formed a national \ngovernment, and they are taking more and more responsibility for their \nsecurity.\n  In fact, Iraq has nearly 265,000 trained security forces now--\nincluding 115,000 for defense--and that is building daily. Our troops \nare serving with Iraqi units and running joint combat operations.\n  We also have--in conjunction with Iraqis--put Al-Qaida, the \nSaddamites and the Sunni insurgents on the defensive. They spend more \ntime running from us than they do attacking us, although we all agree \nthey are still lethal.\n  I think it is shameful that we are even considering proposals to \nwithdraw our troops before the job is done in Iraq.\n  We have seen the cost of U.S. withdrawal before, and we should learn \nfrom our past history.\n  If our Nation sets an artificial deadline for the removal of our \nforces, all our adversaries need to do is husband their resources until \nwe leave and then emerge, possibly destroying all of the \naccomplishments to date.\n  That is not a plan for success--that is a plan for failure.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, the Senate's debate on U.S. \npolicy with respect to the war in Iraq has been healthy. There is no \nquestion but that every Member of this Chamber is deeply proud of \nAmerica's men and women in uniform and the magnificent job they have \ndone and continue to do to bring peace and stability to that troubled \nland. Like all my colleagues, I want them all to come home to their \nloved ones and this grateful Nation as soon as possible. But our \ndeparture from Iraq must not leave a greater risk of terror taking hold \nthere. We cannot afford to leave Iraq in a condition that terrorists \ncould take over the country, as they did in Afghanistan before \nSeptember 11.\n  I have given the views of my colleagues on all sides of today's votes \ncareful consideration. I have concluded that I cannot support any \npolicy that would set an arbitrary timeline for the start, rate, or \nconclusion of the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq.\n  The decision to drawdown American forces must be based on the \napplication of our military commanders' professional judgment assessing \nactual security conditions on the ground. Withdrawal of U.S. forces \nmust be based on the objective criteria of local stability and the \ncapability of Iraqi forces.\n  Setting a timeline for withdrawal limits our Commander in Chief's \nstrategic options and denies our local commanders the operational \nflexibility necessary to sustain progress to stability and reduce the \nrisks of the insurgency taking any tactical advantage.\n  We all pray for the safe return of every one of our men and women in \nuniform, as soon as the mission of leaving Iraq in the hands of a \nstable government can be accomplished.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, all of Vermont is breathing a sigh of \nrelief with the return from Iraq of 350 members of the Vermont National \nGuard, many of whom have spent most of the past year in Al Ramadi, one \nof the hot spots of the war. We are terribly proud of the outstanding \njob they have done, working in a dangerous area, attempting to root out \ninsurgents, bring stability to the region, and provide a climate that \nwill permit reconstruction and development. These brave men and women \nhave set their private lives on hold for a year and a half, risking \ninjury or death, in order to give Iraqi citizens a chance at a better \nlife. I thank them and all Vermonters who have served and continue to \nserve in Iraq, Afghanistan and Kuwait.\n  Vermont has lost 23 sons in the Iraq war, one of the highest per \ncapita casualty rates of any State. As Task Force Saber returns, we \nhold particularly close the families of those members who are not \nreturning: MSG Chris Chapin of Proctor, 1LT Mark Dooley of Wilmington, \nSPC Scott McLaughlin of Hardwick; 2LT Mark Procopio of Burlington; SGT \nJoshua Allen Johnson of Richford and SPC Christopher Merchant of \nHardwick. My thoughts and prayers are with them.\n  Vermont soldiers have performed admirably the job that was asked of \nthem. Now it is incumbent upon us to determine what our role in Iraq \nshould be and how that role should be carried out in the coming year.\n  I opposed this war from the very beginning. I did not believe the \nadministration's claims that Saddam Hussein was an immediate threat to \nthe United States, and I believed that working through the United \nNations would more effectively curtail Saddam Hussein's regime. At the \nstart, in 2003, our presence was welcome, and we had an important \nobligation to the Iraqi people. But now we find that our presence is in \npart feeding the cycle of violence that is tearing Iraq apart. Foreign \nterrorists continue to be recruited to Iraq because that is where they \ncan attack Americans. Iraqi groups are polarized over the American \npresence and how and when American forces should leave. American \nmilitary actions continue to be controversial and continue to \nradicalize certain elements of the population. The newly established \npermanent Government of Iraq struggles to assert its sovereignty in the \nface of the heavy American military presence.\n  It is time that we step back and hand more of the security functions \nover to the Iraqi security forces. We have been training Iraqi military \nand police for 3 years. Finally, significant numbers of Iraqi units are \nable to take over for American units and are doing so in many places \nacross the country. We owe it to them to train, equip, and support \nIraqi security forces. But the Iraqi security forces deserve the chance \nto independently establish the security required for reconstruction and \ndevelopment.\n  Sectarian violence across Iraq seems to be exacerbated by the U.S. \nmilitary presence. The presence of American forces makes it more \ndifficult for moderates on all sides to keep out foreign jihadists who \nare anxious to alter the traditional secular orientation of Iraqi \nsociety. The presence of American forces makes it more difficult to \nshift the Iraqi national debate from conflict to the formation of a \nunified and effective government. The ongoing presence of American \nforces makes it harder for the new Iraqi government to take on primary \nresponsibility for countering insurgents in the future.\n  Ultimately, it must be the Iraqi people, working through their new \ninstitutions of government, who find solutions to the religious, \nethnic, and cultural divisions that threaten to tear Iraq apart. The \nShiite majority must realize that unless it incorporates strong Sunni \nrepresentation into the\n\n[[Page S6327]]\n\nnew Government, Sunni minorities will not feel that they can count on \nthe protection of the Government. Kurdish groups want guarantees that \ntheir autonomy will be respected. Smaller ethnic and religious groups \nare worried that democracy means tyranny by the majority over minority \npopulations. The Iraqi people must devise the solutions to these \ncomplex problems. They are not likely to look like American solutions. \nSome of these solutions may not even feel right to us. But our troops \nhave fought for the right of the Iraqi people to decide these things \nfor themselves. We must step back and let them do that.\n  Getting American troops off the streets of Iraq will remove the sense \nof occupation that currently pervades parts of Iraq and makes Iraqis \nfeel that their fate is not in their own hands. We may also increase \nour own security by reducing our visibility in Iraq. Images of American \ntroops patrolling Iraqi streets continue to inflame conservative Arab \nelements all over the world. The struggle against American occupation \nis one of the biggest recruiting slogans for radical Muslim groups. If \nwe are serious about fighting terrorism, then we must be mindful of \nwhere our own actions foster radicalism and strengthen the enemy.\n  I will vote for the amendment by the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. \nKerry. The Kerry amendment calls for the withdrawal of the majority of \nAmerican troops by this time next year, leaving in place those troops \nnecessary to train Iraqi security forces, to conduct specialized \ncounterterrorism operations, or to protect American facilities and \npersonnel. This language would allow U.S. troops to stay in Iraq where \nabsolutely necessary but would bring the bulk of our troops home.\n  I will also support the Levin amendment, which requires that \nwithdrawal of U.S. forces begin before the end of this year. It calls \nupon the administration to set up a timetable for the phased \nredeployment of U.S. troops. It makes clear to the Iraqi Government, \nthe Bush administration, and the American people that we must start \ngetting out of Iraq. While this amendment is not as firm as the Kerry \namendment, I believe it is an improvement over the current policy of \njust staying the course with no clear guidance on withdrawal.\n  Mr. President, we owe it to the men and women who are serving so \nnobly in Iraq to not leave them in harm's way 1 day longer than is \nnecessary. We can and we must start drawing down the number of troops \nin Iraq and bringing our people home. This is the right move for our \ntroops, and it is the right move for the Iraqi people. It takes \npolitical courage to change course. It is time the Congress showed a \nlittle courage in the face of the daily acts of valor displayed by our \ntroops under fire. I call upon my colleagues to rise to the occasion \nand do what needs to be done. It is time to end a bad policy and focus \nour efforts on the reconstruction and development of Iraq.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, the Department of Defense authorization \nbill for fiscal year 2007 has now been under consideration on the \nSenate floor for more than a week. Much of that time has been devoted \nto discussion of Iraq, which casts a long shadow over every decision we \nare called to make. I regret that there has been such great \nunwillingness, until now, to have this issue freely debated on the \nfloor of the Senate, and I commend the floor managers for allowing us \nto fulfill our constitutional responsibility. If ever there was a time \nfor a resolute and reasoned assessment of our policy in Iraq, this is \nit.\n  In undertaking unilateral military action to remove Saddam, the \nadministration chose to pursue a costly policy that has seriously \nundermined our ability to focus on and deal effectively with the urgent \nnational-security challenges we face. Turning its back on 50 years of \nbipartisan consensus on the need to work collectively and cooperatively \nthrough multilateral institutions--a consensus that carried us through \nthe darkest years of the Cold War--this administration insisted on a \ngo-it-alone strategy that made only minimal gestures toward diplomacy. \nPushing aside the many diplomatic, economic and political resources at \nhis disposal, the President squandered the vast outpouring of support \nthat resulted from the tragic events of 9/11. His policies have divided \nus not only from the vast population of the Muslim and developing \nworld, whose support is more important now than ever in the fight \nagainst terrorism, but also from many of our traditional friends and \nallies in Europe and Asia.\n  More than 3 years ago I took the Senate floor and posed this \nquestion: ``Are we going to seek to exercise our power in cooperation, \nin coordination with others, which in the current context means working \nthrough the United Nations; or are we going to move down the path of \nasserting a unilateral preemptive prerogative, in effect, asserting our \nright to do what we want anywhere, anytime, to anyone?'' I say now that \nthe administration made a grievous mistake in pursuing the second path, \nand thus today we find ourselves forced to deal with the consequences. \nMr. President, I call to the attention of my colleagues my remarks of \nOctober 9, 2002.\n  Had the United States taken that more prudent course, we would find \nourselves in a different, and, I would argue, immeasurably stronger \nposition than we are in today. Before the invasion began, we had \ninvestigators from the International Atomic Energy Agency on the ground \nin Iraq, where they were tracking down and following up all reports of \nweapons of mass destruction. U.S. and British aircraft were enforcing \ntwo U.N.-backed no-fly zones, one to protect the Kurds in the north, \nand another to protect Shiites in the south. In effect, we had Saddam \nHussein in a corner, and we were keeping him there with the blessing of \nthe international community.\n  The President chose instead to take a reckless and irresponsible \ngamble. We can count up the number of deaths, we can count up the \nnumber of dollars, we can count up the number of injuries from which \npeople will never recover, but none of this begins to account for the \ntrue costs to our Nation. We have lost more than 2,500 courageous and \ndedicated men and women--a tragedy for them and their families, and \nalso for the nation, because they represented the promise and hope of \nour future. This is not to mention the tens of thousands of innocent \nIraqi civilians, women and children alike, who were caught in the \ncrossfire. We have diminished our standing in the eyes of the world, \nand having declined to use the tools of diplomacy at our disposal, we \nnow find their effectiveness diminished. This military action has \nclouded our vision and distorted our priorities to the point that the \nentire question of national security must now be debated through the \nprism of Iraq.\n  With our diplomatic resources focused overwhelmingly on Iraq, we have \nundermined our ability to achieve national security objectives we know \nto be critical. Today the challenge in Afghanistan is growing, not \nreceding. More than in the past, al Qaida is an international \nphenomenon that adapts to local conditions, making its detection and \ndestruction ever more difficult. The nuclear challenge posed by Iran is \ngaining momentum at the same time that our presence in Iraq \nimmeasurably complicates the problems of dealing effectively with Iran, \nand North Korea has raised its own nuclear challenge to a new level.\n  Our country's standing in the world community has been diminished on \nnumerous fronts by the profoundly misguided invasion of Iraq and our \ncontinuing failure to meet the goals we set for ourselves. We have \nseriously undermined working relations with our traditional partners \nand allies, which the President's trip to Vienna has yet again put on \nvivid display. Sixteen of the original 37 members of the coalition \nwhich the administration touted have withdrawn their troops, Japan \nbeing only the most recent to announce its departure. Of those who \nremain, only the United Kingdom has more than 5,000 soldiers on the \nground.\n  This is to say nothing of the toll Iraq has taken at home. There are \nthousands who have been disabled by serious war-related injuries and \ntrauma. Hundreds of thousands of families have been torn apart by \nlengthy and unplanned Guard and reserve duty, often creating \nsubstantial financial hardship. Our National Guard, thus stretched, is \nless able to render assistance in the situations it was designed to \naddress. We have had to divert hard-pressed resources from urgent \ndomestic priorities, the recovery from Hurricane Katrina among them.\n\n[[Page S6328]]\n\n  Yet the administration refuses to face these realities. When at a \nhearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last fall I asked \nSecretary of State Condoleezza Rice, referring to Iraq, ``Do you think \nfive years from now, some American forces will have come out?'' She \nsaid, ``Senator, I don't want to speculate.'' Even when asked, ``What \nabout 10 years from now?'' she refused to rule out the prospect that \nour troops would still be on the ground in Iraq. Her response revealed \nthe administration's adamant refusal to think through to the \nconsequences of the action, which has characterized our policy in Iraq \nfrom the beginning.\n  It is long past time to face the situation squarely and undertake a \nfundamental redirection of the policy before more damage is done. The \nwar not only has taken a terrible toll in terms of lives and hopes for \nthe future; it has diverted our attention from the real and urgent \nthreats to our national security and compromised our ability to deal \nwith them. We should not be pursuing an open-ended commitment in Iraq. \nIt was a war that need never have begun. By failing to offer to a \nviable strategy to bring it to an end, the administration does a grave \ndisservice to our Nation.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in fairness, we should give the sponsors \nof the Kerry-Feingold amendment the opportunity to speak to the Senate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask to be informed when I have \nconsumed up to 7 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator \nKerry, for working together with me so well on this very important \namendment. We understand that we are not going to get a majority. We \nknow we are not going to get anywhere near a majority. The Senator and \nI know we represent the view of a majority of the American people, \nwhich has clearly been demonstrated in every indication, whether it be \nconversation, polling, or town meetings that I hold in Wisconsin. The \npeople of this country know that we have to finish this Iraq mission, \nthat it cannot be open-ended.\n  To me, the most touching moment of the debate came when the senior \nSenator from Massachusetts quoted his own brother, Robert Kennedy, who \nfor many of us was a central figure who inspired us to go into \npolitics. I hope he doesn't mind my repeating Robert Kennedy's words in \n1968:\n\n       Past error is no excuse for its own perpetuation.\n\n  That is what the Iraq situation represents. Let's be clear. Every one \nof us, as the Senator from Massachusetts pointed out last night, voted \nfor the Afghanistan invasion. We did not think that was a mistake. I \nask my colleagues on the other side, if they believe we believe in cut-\nand-run, why aren't we trying to cut-and-run from Afghanistan? Why is \nno Senator saying: Let's get the troops out of Afghanistan, as \ndifficult as it is? Because that was not a mistake, because that was \nessential, because we had to go after the Taliban and al-Qaida. It was \nnot a mistake.\n  What is a mistake, though, is to continue indefinitely the Iraq \ninvasion and Iraq situation with some 138,000 troops, without any \nrealization or recognition that it is sapping our strength, it is \nsapping our credibility around the world, and it is sapping the \nresources of our military. It is sapping the recruitment ability of our \nmilitary. In other words, it is weakening America.\n  At the same time, as I mentioned on the floor yesterday, the \nsituation appears to be slipping in places where we know al-Qaida was \noperating--such as Somalia or Mogadishu, now taken over by a radical \nIslamic government. We are trying to work with Indonesia's Government, \nbut the fact is, in the area between the Philippines and Malaysia and \nIndonesia, there is an ungoverned area where groups sympathetic to al-\nQaida are operating. This is a threat of the exact kind that 9/11 \nrepresents, and we know they have successfully pulled off attacks in \nIndonesia.\n  Perhaps most compelling to me is the fact that we are losing ground \nin Afghanistan because we have stopped paying attention to the No. 1 \npriority in the fight against terrorism.\n  Let me quote from the Washington Post article from June 20, entitled \n``In Tribal Pakistan a Tide of Militancy.'' It says:\n\n       In north Waziristan, barbers are ordered not to shave off \n     beards, and thieves have been swiftly beheaded. In Swat, \n     television sets and VCRs have been burned in public. In Dir, \n     religious groups openly recruit teenagers to fight U.S. \n     forces in Afghanistan. In the Khyber area, armed squads have \n     burst into rooming houses, forcing people to pledge to obey \n     Islamic law.\n       . . . A tide of Islamic militancy is spreading across and \n     beyond the semiautonomous tribal areas of northwest Pakistan, \n     that hug the Afghan border.\n       . . . Observers say the army's aggressive efforts since \n     2004 have backfired, alienating the populace with heavy-\n     handed tactics and undermining the traditional authority of \n     tribal elders and officials.\n\n  How did we lose focus on those who attacked us on 9/11? Does it make \nsense to continue to pour virtually all our resources into an Iraq war \nthat is not working? It is time to tell the Iraqis that we have done \nwhat we can do militarily, that we will continue to help them in many \nways, and we will continue to have special operations forces capacity \nin that region to take on situations, such as the al-Zarqawi situation. \nBut the notion of continuing to put all of these resources just into \nIraq on the absurd notion that that is the key to the fight against al-\nQaida is one of the worst mistakes in American foreign policy history. \nThis is an enormous disservice to the American people, and it is \nespecially a disservice to the families of those who have died, those \nwho have been injured, and those who continue to serve. We owe it to \nthose families to not be standing here when No. 3,000 soldier has died. \nIt doesn't have to happen. It doesn't have to be. What is happening now \nis a horrible situation, not the imagined problems that the other side \ncontinually suggests will occur if we have a reasonable program to \nbring this to a conclusion within the coming year.\n  Mr. President, how much time have I consumed?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has consumed 5 minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I have been a legislator for almost 25 \nyears now. I must say, this is one of the toughest moments of my \ncareer, to see the Senate not recognize that we were falsely led into a \nwar, that we falsely led the American people into believing this had \nsomething to do with 9/11, and that many of the things that have \nhappened simply didn't have to happen. That is water over the dam.\n  What has happened after the mistake was made is that mistake after \nmistake has been compounded. Every day this myth that somehow Iraq is \nthe central focus of the war on terrorism is being used as an excuse to \nsend more and more Americans into harm's way, which is not necessary.\n  Iraq is not the be all and end all of our national security. Iraq is \nnot the situation that led to 9/11. The American people know it. It is \ntime for this body to catch up and have a reasonable plan to finish the \nIraq mission so we can focus on those who attacked us on 9/11.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 8 minutes 15 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. How about Senator Warner's time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Warner has 18\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Senator Kerry will go next.\n  Mr. WARNER. My understanding, Madam President, is that Senator Kerry \nhas approximately 7\\1/2\\ minutes; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 7 minutes \n15 seconds.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, this is obviously the most important \nissue facing the country today. I listened to my colleagues on the \nother side try to make this a debate about something that it is not \nabout.\n  All of us support the troops. The only question here is how do we \nmost effectively support them. The best way to support the troops is to \nget this policy right. That is how we support the troops.\n  There is nothing more disappointing than being a troop in the field \nand see you are doing missions that don't\n\n[[Page S6329]]\n\nmake sense or that the overall strategy doesn't make sense. And the \nrecord here--as the Senator from Wisconsin has said in quoting Robert \nKennedy about past error justifying a perpetuation of the same--the \nrecord here is not good.\n  Prediction after prediction after prediction has been wrong. Policy \nchoice after policy choice after policy choice has been wrong. Young \nmen and women in the U.S. Armed Forces have been wounded and killed \nbecause of bad policy decisions, and it is not enough to come to the \nfloor of the Senate and insist: Oh, we have to stay the course because \notherwise what our troops are doing would be lost or be in vain.\n  What would be lost and be in vain is not to look at and think about \nwhat is happening over there and to adjust appropriately. Our troops \nwant us and deserve for us to get this policy right.\n  What Senator Feingold and I are offering, along with Senator Leahy \nand Senator Boxer, is a plan that gets it right, that helps us get on a \npath where we demand accountability and where we still support Iraq.\n  Sure, we can muddle along on this course. None of us have come to the \nfloor and said the cause is lost. None of us have suggested that we \njust have to walk away and leave chaos. That is not what this plan \ndoes. This plan honors the investment of our troops, and, in fact, what \nit does is provide a better way of not only empowering the Iraqis but \nof empowering the United States of America to fight a more effective \nwar on terror.\n  Let me say it plainly. Redeploying U.S. troops is necessary for \nsuccess in Iraq, and it is necessary to be able to fight a more \neffective war on terror. That is why we put this program forward.\n  Our amendment requires redeployment of American combat forces with \nimportant exceptions. At the end of the year, if, in fact, it is \nnecessary to continue to train in order to stand up the Iraqis, we \nallow for that. If we need to continue to fight al-Qaida because we \nhaven't destroyed it completely in the next year, we allow for that. \nAnd we allow, obviously, for the protection of American facilities and \nforces. There is no other reason to be in Iraq a year from now, other \nthan standing up the Iraqi forces or chasing al-Qaida or protecting our \nfacilities.\n  So, in fact, what we are providing for is exactly what our policy \nought to be, but it begins the redeployment because the fact is--and \nour generals have said it and every expert has said it--the large \npresence of American forces in Iraq is contributing to the insurgency.\n  Why on Earth would Senators want to come to the floor and argue, \nLet's just stay the course and do the same old thing, when our own \ngenerals have told us the same old thing is part of the problem, the \nsame old thing is attracting terrorists, the same old thing is losing \nus allies, the same old thing is costing us unbelievable sums of money \nand costing us lives unnecessarily?\n  Our plan believes there is a better way to fight the war on terror \nand a better way to be successful in Iraq. It is different from what \nSenator Levin and others are offering, but it is not different in that \nit has every component of the plan they offer.\n  I have heard some Senators say we don't have a plan. We have exactly \nthe same plan that is in the Levin amendment except we go further. We \nmaintain an over-the-horizon force to protect our security interests in \nthe region.\n  In addition to that, we have a date, and it is binding. I don't \nbelieve at this point in time that our troops are well served by only \nhaving a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. We ought to make policy. We \nhelped make policy that put them there, and we ought to help make the \npolicy to help get them out of there.\n  Let me also be clear about this, Madam President: This plan continues \nsupport for Iraq. There is no drop dead, no depart, no ultimatum. It \ngives them a deadline to stand up, but it provides the President the \nability to continue to train if that hasn't completely happened. The \nfact is, this amendment permits us to accomplish the job.\n  General Casey has said--how many times does the commanding general \nhave to say it?--this war cannot be won militarily. The only way to do \nthis is to bring parties together and resolve the political differences \nthat are feeding the insurgency.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, the National Security Adviser of Iraq \nsaid it this week. How many of our colleagues came over to the Senate \nthe other day and argued about the sovereignty of Iraq? I am for the \nsovereignty of Iraq. The sovereignty of Iraq is respected by respecting \nwhat they are saying about themselves.\n  Prime Minister Maliki says they will be able to take the security of \n16 out of 18 provinces by the end of this year. Let's honor that. Prime \nMinister Maliki said getting our troops out will, in fact, legitimize \nthe Government, it will help them. Other Iraqis and Sunnis have said \nthat. Madam President, 94 percent of the Sunnis say the United States \nshould set a timetable; 90 percent of the Shia say the United States \nshould set a timetable. Are the Iraqis cutting and running on \nthemselves by saying that? Of course not.\n  All these comparisons with World War II are absolutely ridiculous. Of \ncourse we wouldn't set a date when we are fighting a uniformed force \nthat has invaded other countries and we can understand how to do it. \nBut this is not a uniformed force. These are terrorists and these are \ninsurgents and these are criminals. These are people whom we need to \nfight differently. And when our own presence is adding to their ability \nto recruit, if we are going to be smart, we ought to think about how we \nare going to turn around and fight differently.\n  I remember what it was like when we fought in a war where we were \nbound by a policy without thinking about how we could change it and be \nmore effective. An awful lot of lives were lost as a result of that \nwhen policy leaders failed to change the policy and do what was \nnecessary to win.\n  If the Iraqis themselves keep talking about a timetable and only \ndeadlines have worked up until this point--the deadline for the \ntransfer of authority for the provisional government, a deadline for \nthe Constitution. The Iraqis wanted to let it slip. We said no. We held \ntheir feet to the fire. They did the Constitution. It was the same \nthing with the elections. We set a deadline. We said the date will be \nnow. They wanted to let it slide. We said no. They held the elections.\n  I believe it is a more effective way to put America in a position of \nstrength, in a position to fight the war on terror in Somalia, in \nAfghanistan, and in the other places of the world where al-Qaida is \ngrowing. Iraq has been a diversion from the real war on terror, and \nIraq has weakened the United States in the world. We deserve to take a \nposition that supports our troops by getting this policy right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, before we start on the next speaker, as \nI understand it, the standing order recites that the Levin amendment \nwould be the first vote. If I understand the request of the \ndistinguished colleague from Michigan, there is a preference to have it \nswitched so that the Kerry vote will be first. Is that a request being \npropounded?\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator is correct. I asked both Senators Kerry and \nFeingold as to what their preference is. They do prefer to go first. \nThat is fine with me, if it is OK with the manager of the bill.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, there will be no objection on this side \nto that request. So for the advice of all Senators, the first vote that \nwill occur will be on the Kerry-Feingold amendment to be followed by \nthe Levin-Reed amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield such time as the distinguished Senator requires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I rise once again to oppose the \namendment offered by the Senators from Michigan and Rhode Island and \nthe amendment offered by the Senators from Massachusetts and Wisconsin.\n  Before I speak about the problems I believe to be inherent in these \namendments, I would like for a moment to discuss the nature of the \ndebate upon which this body is engaged.\n\n[[Page S6330]]\n\n  The discussion over this war is perhaps the most consequential debate \nthe Senate will engage in this year or perhaps in several years. The \noutcome of the war will impact the stability of the Middle East and the \nnature of U.S. foreign policy for a generation. It is that important.\n  So our debate in this Chamber should be a serious weighing of the \narguments. Sometimes, unfortunately, the debate seems to have \ndeteriorated into sloganeering, but overall, I think this debate has \nbeen very helpful.\n  I reiterate the fact that we should respect the views of those who \ndisagree with us. I respect and have known my colleagues who are \nsponsors of these amendments, and I believe that a good, healthy, \nstrong debate is what this Nation needs. In that spirit, I would like \nto discuss again my strong opposition to the two amendments.\n  By calling for a withdrawal of American troops tied to arbitrary \ntimetables rather than conditions in country, these amendments \nliterally risk disaster for our intervention in Iraq.\n  Madam President, the Iraqi security forces, I say to my friends, are \nclearly unable to maintain security on their own. All one has to do is \nlook at every news story every morning or every evening. Even with the \npresence of coalition forces in Iraq today, the violence and \ninstability remain at unacceptably high levels. To abandon the \nfledgling Iraqi Army and police to the insurgents, the militias and the \nterrorists would risk chaos in Iraq, and chaos in Iraq would mean \ndisaster.\n  Madam President, there is an old line about those of us who ignore \nthe lessons and mistakes of history are doomed to repeat them. \nAfghanistan is the classic example of what could happen in Iraq. After \nyears and years of incredible assistance to those who were seeking \nfreedom from the then-Soviet Union occupation of Afghanistan, the \nRussians were driven out. Then, incredibly, the United States of \nAmerica totally disengaged--totally disengaged--from Afghanistan. I \ncommend to my colleagues a book called ``Ghost Wars'' by Steve Coll \nwhich won a Pulitzer prize. And in that vacuum, of course, came the \nTaliban, and the Taliban then obviously was not only a terribly \noppressive, brutal, and cruel regime but became a hotbed of training \nfor terrorists, al-Qaida and others.\n  It is clear to me that if we abandon Iraq to that same chaos, there \nis no doubt who would come to power, at least in some parts of Iraq, \nand the consequences we would pay for that.\n  We watched Afghanistan descend into chaos. There continues to be much \ndebate about Saddam Hussein's connections to terrorists before our \ninvasion, but there can be no doubt about the centrality of this \nconflict on the war on terror today. A failed state in Iraq would pose \na clear, present, and enduring danger to the security of our country.\n  Now, the sponsors of these amendments seem to base them on a premise \nthat if we begin withdrawing, the Iraqi Government will somehow get \nserious and fight the insurgency on its own without our help. That \nmakes the assumption, incredibly, that the present Government in Iraq \nand the military who are out there fighting all the time and their \npolice are somehow not serious. Of course they are serious. They are \njust not capable. It is going to take more time and more effort and, I \nam sorry to say, more American sacrifice before they are capable of \nassuming those responsibilities. Rather than inducing the Government to \ncrack down on the insurgency, beginning a U.S. withdrawal is more \nlikely to induce average Iraqis to join a militia for protection rather \nthan cast their lots with the Government.\n  I would also ask the sponsors of the amendments what they advocate if \nwe withdraw and the violence actually worsens and full-scale civil war \nensues or terrorists then enjoy a safe haven to plan attacks against \nAmericans and our friends. Do we then face the options only of \ntolerating this situation in perpetuity or reinvading the country?\n  We have just one choice in Iraq, and that is to see our mission there \nthrough to victory. What does victory mean? It is the classic reduction \nand eventual elimination of any insurgency, an economy that works, a \ngovernment that functions, and a military and police that are able to \ncome back and eventually eliminate and destroy an insurgency. That is \nthe way every insurgency in history was put down. There is no peace \nsigning on board the USS Missouri. There are no Paris peace talks. It \nis an insurgency that has to be surrounded, contained, and eliminated.\n  That is not to say this victory will be quick and easy. It is long \nand it is hard and it is tough, and many mistakes have been made and \nall of us have been frustrated by those mistakes. Many of us have been \nterribly frustrated by the inflated estimates and over-optimistic \nstatements that so frustrated us and the American people when the \nconditions don't warrant it. It is still tough today. We can't fall \nprey to wishful thinking, that we can put the costs and the \ndifficulties and the frustrations aside by ignoring our challenges and \nresponsibilities. That is something we cannot do.\n  Madam President, I congratulate my colleagues for their participation \nin this debate. The American people expect nothing less of us. I hope \nwe are a better informed nation and a better informed body when we \nvote. It will probably not be the last time we address this issue, but \nI think it has been done in a comprehensive fashion.\n  I would close by reminding my colleagues that it was the United \nStates that led the invasion of Iraq, the United States led the \noccupation, and the United States, with our Iraqi partners, has the \nresponsibility to see this through. It will take more time, more \ncommitment, more support, and more brave Americans who will lose their \nlives in the service of this great cause. Despite our cajoling, \nnagging, and pleading, few other countries around the world will share \nmuch of our burden. Iraq is for us to do, for us to win or lose, for us \nto suffer the consequences or share in the benefits. But in the end, \nthere is only one United States of America, and it is to us that \nhistory will look for courage and commitment.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I commend my longtime friend from \nArizona. He in a very succinct way looked at this debate in the context \nof what is going on today and tomorrow and the weeks and months to come \nin Iraq, but he is also looking at it in the context of the future, how \ngenerations that follow us will look back on this chapter and moment in \nhistory and how the Congress of the United States, hopefully, has given \nsupport to the Commander in Chief under the Constitution--our \nPresident--to direct the operations of the current conflicts.\n  The Senator also touched on how we have conducted this debate. I wish \nto just repeat a few remarks of my opening remarks yesterday with \nrespect to my colleague from Michigan in addressing his amendment. I \nsaid that I have studied it carefully. I did not denounce the \namendment; I said it was a serious amendment, and it is a serious \namendment. It deserves serious thought, and I, and I think others, have \ngiven that serious thought to our colleague on his amendment. But I \nstrongly oppose it.\n  Unlike last year where I sat down and was able to work out with him a \nconciliatory, bipartisan amendment which got three-quarters of the \nvotes of the Senate, it just, in the form he presented it, was not an \noption this time. Therefore, regrettably, we approach these critically \nimportant votes with far greater partisanship than I had hoped. I had \nhoped we would have greater bipartisanship.\n  But my basic message to America and to my colleagues is that we have \nput an enormous investment into these conflicts, both in Iraq and in \nAfghanistan. We are focusing today on Iraq, but we have to look at the \nothers.\n  Madam President, 2,500-plus Americans have lost their lives and left \nfamilies and loved ones grieving, and 18,000 have survived their wounds \nand are working to reestablish themselves, many going back into uniform \nor having never left uniform, but remaining in, which is to their \neverlasting credit, but others receiving the love and the care of their \nfamilies and their communities in which they live. There has been \nenormous sacrifice. We have dollars incalculable in amounts.\n  Also, what we have on the line is the credibility of the United \nStates of\n\n[[Page S6331]]\n\nAmerica. The voice of this Senate will be recorded momentarily. I am \noptimistic it will be recorded in a way to support the President and \nhis statements that we are there to work with the Iraqi people, to \nestablish their democracy, which they have worked on these 18 months, \nnow with a permanent, unified government, and to try to let this \nGovernment of only weeks establish itself, send its roots into the \nground, derive its strength, and begin to govern and govern fully a \nsovereign nation and take on all of the responsibilities.\n  Both of these amendments, the amendment of the Senator from Michigan \nand the amendment of the Senator from Massachusetts, would send a \nmessage which would indicate there is some wavering, some equivocation \nhere at home in supporting our President, the Commander in Chief, and \nthat goes to the basic credibility of the United States of America, \nwhich is on the line in these votes.\n  There is not one of us here who doesn't desire to have our forces \nbrought home at the earliest possible date, but the formulation by \nwhich they can come home rests on the ability of this Government to \nseize those reins, to establish that security, to rebuild that \ninfrastructure, and gain the confidence and the respect of the Iraqi \npeople. That is a tough job, given the strong dissent between the \nvarious religious factions, but this Government appears to be up to it. \nIt must be given a chance. It cannot be crippled at this earliest stage \nby messages coming from this Chamber and elsewhere that we have less \nthan full confidence in their ability to achieve the goals of a full \ndemocracy in Iraq, and they are taking the reins to direct their \npeople. Our credibility is on the line, Madam President.\n  So I say to my colleagues as you approach this vote, it will be one \nof the most important that you have ever cast. Future generations of \nAmericans will look back upon this very moment to determine if two \nbranches of our Government, the executive and the legislative, stood \nside by side in honoring those who have given their lives, their \nwounds, and the 1 million other men and women of the Armed Forces, plus \nuntold American citizens who, in the years of the Iraqi conflict, have \ngone over and accepted the risks of serving there, be that in the \nmilitary or civilian capacities. This is a very heavy investment which \nhas been made by many thousands of courageous Americans to see that we \nhave gotten to where we are today; namely, a new government, a unity \ngovernment, and to give that government a chance to function without in \nany way jeopardizing that by sending a signal that we have less than \nfull confidence in their ability to achieve their goals.\n  Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 3\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. WARNER. I reserve the remainder of the time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I yield 3\\1/2\\ minutes to the Senator \nfrom North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I do not believe it is a wise policy to \nset a specific date for withdrawal from Iraq. I do believe it makes \nsense to begin to redeploy our forces sometime this year. Therefore, I \nwill support the Levin amendment. I believe that is the right policy \nfor the following reasons:\n  No. 1, our military commanders have made clear that is their \nintention. In fact, the news this morning says in a headline: ``U.S. \nMilitary to Send Equipment Home.'' The story goes on to say that the \nU.S. military has begun sending thousands of Humvees and other war \nequipment home as more Iraqi units join the fight. The move also \nanticipates that the number of American troops in Iraq will decline.\n  Is anybody suggesting our military is engaged in a cut-and-run \nstrategy? I don't think so. It is not a cut-and-run strategy. It has \nbeen the long-term plan to begin to redeploy this year.\n  No. 2, the President has repeatedly said: We will stand down as the \nIraqis stand up. Well, according to the administration, tens of \nthousands, even hundreds of thousands of Iraqis have now stood up. It \nis time for us to begin to redeploy. That does not constitute a cut-\nand-run approach but simply common sense.\n  No. 3, Iraq is ultimately the responsibility of the Iraqis. We cannot \nforever do the job for them. They must defend their own freedom.\n  No. 4, there are other priority threats that require our attention, \nincluding the worldwide al-Qaida conspiracy, North Korea nuclear \nweapons and missile development, and Iranian nuclear development.\n  For those reasons, I support a policy of beginning to redeploy our \nforces in Iraq this year but without a specific timetable or an \narbitrary pace for reducing those troop commitments. That is the right \npolicy. That is the policy outlined in the Levin amendment.\n  Madam President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I had intended to reserve a brief period \nof time for the President pro tempore, Mr. Stevens, but in his absence, \nI will just once again conclude.\n  The message today is whether we are here to uphold the credibility of \nthe United States of America, as stated most eloquently by our \nPresident, as we have come to establish a new government in Iraq. That \nhas been achieved. It has now been 18 months since the beginning of \ntheir elections, brave elections, followed by the establishment of a \nunity government. That Government is functioning, and we must give it \nan opportunity to govern.\n\n  Our President said it most succinctly upon his return from Iraq:\n\n       My message to the Iraqi people is this: Seize the moment. \n     Seize this opportunity to develop a government of and by and \n     for the people. And I also have a message to the Iraqi \n     people, that when America gives a commitment, America keeps \n     its commitment.\n\n  I yield the floor and yield back any time remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, the credibility of the United States has \nbeen proven with the loss of lives and the number of wounded we have \nsuffered in Iraq. We have proven our credibility over 2,500 times \nbecause we have lost more than 2,500 of our troops. We have proven our \ncredibility over 17,000 times in terms of the number of people who have \nbeen wounded in Iraq. We have proven our credibility with hundreds of \nbillions of dollars to give the Iraqis an opportunity to have a nation. \nIt is up to them to seize that opportunity. It is up to them to decide \nto make a choice. Do they want a civil war? Do they want to engage in \nmore sectarian battles? Or do they want to reach the kind of political \ncompromises which are essential if they are going to have a nation and \nend the insurgency and avoid an all-out civil war?\n  Our credibility has been proven thousands of times and with billions \nof dollars. We have given a people an opportunity that is \nextraordinary. We cannot make the decision for them, whether they will \nseize that opportunity. Only they can make that decision.\n  Last year we adopted, by an overwhelming vote, an amendment which \nsaid that 2006 would be a year of significant transition, with Iraqi \nsecurity forces taking the lead for the security of a free and \nsovereign Iraq, thereby creating the conditions for a phased \nredeployment of U.S. forces in Iraq. Similar to last year's sense of \nthe Congress, this year's sense of the Congress that we are offering is \nan attempt to change our policy from one of an open-ended commitment--a \npolicy that, as the Secretary of State put it, we are there as long as \nthey need us; as the President of Iraq, Mr. Talabani, put it, the \nAmericans will stay with all the forces that we want for as long as we \nwant them. That is a recipe, a formula for dependency. It is not the \nway in which Iraq can learn that it must, on its own, in a reasonable \nperiod of time, with reasonable notice and consultation, begin to ween \nitself, as General Casey put it, from overdependence on the American \nmilitary.\n  That is the issue. That is what our amendment would urge the \nPresident to do. Our amendment does not order the President, as some on \nthat side have actually put it. This is a sense of the Senate. This is \nsomething where we, the authors of this amendment, believe that we have \na responsibility to use our best efforts to give our best advice as to \nwhat our policy should be. It is not a policy of immediately \nredeploying forces. There is not a precipitous nature to this \namendment. It says\n\n[[Page S6332]]\n\nby the end of this year, in the next 6 months, to begin the phased \nredeployment of American forces from Iraq.\n  That is what the Iraqis say their policy is. That is what their \nsecurity adviser says their policy is. Their own security adviser, Mr. \nRubaie, in the Washington Post 2 days ago said: We envisage the U.S. \ntroop presence by year's end to be under 100,000. That is a \nredeployment of 30,000 troops. Our amendment tells the Iraqis: Stay \nwith that. Stick to that policy. It is the right policy. You must take \nover your own nation and make it work and make it happen.\n  Then Mr. Rubaie, the National Security Adviser of Iraq, in a written \ndocument presented to the American people through our newspaper, says \nthat ``the removal of coalition troops from Iraqi streets will help the \nIraqis who now see foreign troops as occupiers rather than \nliberators.'' He says, ``The removal of foreign troops will legitimize \nIraq's government in the eyes of its people.''\n  Our amendment urging the President to end an open-ended commitment of \nour troops to Iraq and to begin the redeployment by year's end is a way \nof implementing what the Iraqis themselves have said they plan on \ndoing.\n  All Senators want Iraq to end as a success story, every one of us. \nThere is not one Senator who wants anything other than to maximize the \nchances of success in Iraq. No matter how we voted on the original \nresolution authorizing force, every one of the 25 or so Senators who \nvoted against that resolution--and I am one of them--wants to maximize \nthe chances of success in Iraq. But to do that, we must prod the Iraqis \nto take the responsibility for their own nation.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and my dear friend from Virginia for \nthe way in which this debate has proceeded. I hope we have made a \ncontribution to the Senate and to the Nation.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, the order requires that the votes be \ntaken. I ask for the yeas and nays on both amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is in order to seek the \nyeas and nays on both amendments.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second with respect to both amendments.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. At this time, the parliamentary situation is leader time, \nand I yield the floor to the distinguished Democratic leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I would be certainly amiss if I didn't \nextend my appreciation for the civil nature of this debate to two of \nthe Senate's finest, the distinguished Senator from Virginia and the \ndistinguished Senator from Michigan, two of the finest the Senate has \never had. I thank them both very much for the civil nature of this very \ncontentious debate.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank our colleague.\n  Mr. REID. ``That we are to stand by the President, right or wrong, is \nnot only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonable to the \nAmerican people.'' Let me repeat that. ``That we are to stand by the \nPresident, right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is \nmorally treasonable to the American people.''\n  That was Republican President Theodore Roosevelt who said that. It is \nan appropriate quote for the Senate to hear before we vote.\n  Today we will decide on a way to move forward in Iraq. I speak in \nsupport of the Levin-Reed amendment. I believe it is long past time to \nchange course in Iraq and start to end the President's open-ended \ncommitment. It is time for sound policy, not more tired slogans \ndesigned to distort the facts and divide the American people. It is \ntime for a strategy that honors the brave service of our troops. A \nmajority of Americans recognize that we need a new strategy in Iraq. I \nam hopeful a bipartisan majority of this body will agree.\n  Almost 4 years ago, we stood in this Chamber debating whether to give \nthe President the authority to go to war in Iraq. Much has happened in \nIraq since that fateful day, at a great price to our troops, our \ntaxpayers, our country, and our security. The Iraq war will soon become \nthe longest conflict in this Nation's history, longer than World War \nII, a war in which we fought across Europe, North Africa, and the \nPacific. My own State of Nevada, a small, sparsely populated State, has \npaid an enormous price in this war. We have lost 39 soldiers in Iraq \nand Afghanistan, most of them in Iraq. That is 39 fathers, brothers, \nuncles, sons, daughters, and aunts who will never come home. Thousands \nof other Nevadans have sacrificed as well. Last year 70 percent of the \nNational Guard of Nevada was deployed. These Nevadans deserve to know \ntheir sacrifices will be honored. They deserve to know their Government \nhas a plan for success in Iraq that honors our troops and completes the \nmission. Just as important, they deserve an honest debate, not \npolitical slogans and not a President and a Republican Congress content \nwith no plan and no end in sight.\n  Today the real choice facing this body is a choice between doing \nnothing, the so-called ``stay the course'' option the President and his \nsupporters advocate, or changing the course and providing our troops \nand the Iraqi people a way forward. After 4 long years, more than 2,500 \nAmericans have died, thousands have been grievously wounded. Hundreds \nof billions of dollars have been spent and threats ignored around the \nglobe. Congress needs to offer a new direction. I believe we need to \nsignal to the Iraqi Government that our patience and our presence in \nIraq are not unlimited. We need to say to President Bush: You need a \nplan for the Iraqis to take responsibility for their own country, their \nown security, so that the phased redeployment of U.S. troops from Iraq \ncan begin by year's end.\n  Robert Taft, a great Republican Senator, said:\n\n       Criticism in time of war is essential to the maintenance of \n     any kind of democratic government.\n\n  Senator Taft was talking about World War II. But his words still ring \ntrue. There is nothing careless about pointing to the President's \nmistakes and missteps in Iraq. In fact, we must. His misjudgments have \nmade America less safe. From the outset, administration blunders \nincreased the costs and risks of confronting Saddam Hussein and \nsecuring Iraq: The administration built its case for war on faulty and \ncherry-picked intelligence. Smoking guns would become mushroom clouds. \nAl-Qaida and Saddam had a dangerous alliance. Nuclear weapons materials \nwere flowing into Iraq from Africa. We could invade Iraq without \ndiverting resources from the ongoing war on terror. The Iraq war would \nbe over quickly, and the costs would be covered by the proceeds from \nIraqi oil sales.\n  All these assertions, every one of them, turned out to be false. By \nthe start of 2003, U.S. troops and intelligence assets had already been \ndiverted from the hunt for Osama bin Laden in order to prepare for an \nattack on Iraq. The President's war plan turned out to be as deficient \nas the prewar intelligence. He rejected the Powell Doctrine's key \ntenets: No. 1, that military force should be used as a last resort; No. \n2, that force, when used, should be overwhelming; and No. 3, that there \nmust be a clear exit strategy from the conflict. And he rejected the \nadvice of his senior military commanders who called for 4 to 500,000 \ntroops, a recommendation that was based on years of hard-learned and \ncostly lessons.\n  As a result, after the Iraqi Government fell, there were not enough \nforces to pacify the country, to control looting, to guard the ammo \ndumps, to secure the borders, and to restore civility. The seeds for \nthe insurgency and the sectarian warfare that would soon plague Iraq \nhad been sown. But this didn't stop the President from donning a flight \nsuit and landing on an aircraft carrier to declare ``mission \naccomplished'' in May of 2003, more than 2 years ago.\n  Since that date, 95 percent of our casualties have occurred in Iraq--\nsince the ``mission accomplished'' performance on that aircraft \ncarrier.\n  Meanwhile, his viceroy in Baghdad continued to execute a series of \ndisastrous decisions, including disbanding the Iraqi Army, purging the \nGovernment of all Baath Party officials, and delaying the training of \nIraqi security forces. These early missteps had far-reaching \nconsequences that our troops must live with.\n  Three and a half years after the start of the war, there is still not \na single Iraq Army battalion that can operate\n\n[[Page S6333]]\n\nindependently--not one. On the reconstruction front, things aren't any \nbetter. The President who campaigned on the pledge not to do nation \nbuilding unfortunately stuck to that pledge. From the start, the \nrebuilding effort was plagued in Iraq by massive corruption and \ncontracting abuses. The American taxpayer and the Iraqi people have \npaid the price.\n  Power, water, and oil production all soon slipped below prewar \nlevels. Today, oil production is still 400,000 barrels per day below \nprewar levels. And the availability of electricity in Baghdad dropped \nfrom 16 hours a day prior to the war to its current average of 4 hours \na day.\n  These Bush administration missteps have reduced Iraqi support for our \npresence and fueled anti-American sentiments and insurgent activity. As \na result, the mission of our troops has become more difficult and \ncertainly more dangerous.\n  At the same time the President was sending too few troops for the \nmission in Iraq, he even failed to provide those he did send--those \nvaliant troops--with armor and equipment which they need to do the job. \nMilitary families already stretched and burdened from multiple \ndeployments were forced to buy armor and ship it to their loved ones \nserving in Iraq.\n  They went out and bought equipment and sent it to their loved ones \nbecause the military wasn't providing it. Combat units had to jury-rig \nvehicles with scrap metal in order to get some extra degree of \nprotection from the improvised explosive devices--and understandably \nso.\n  A study by the Marine Corps last year found that 80 percent of upper-\nbody fatalities could have been prevented with proper armor. The \ngreatest military in the world should not have to depend on scrap metal \nfrom Iraqi junk yards to protect its troops.\n  Meanwhile, security problems in Iraq grow more dangerous every day. \nIn April and May of this year alone, more than 160 U.S. troops have \nbeen killed in Iraq. Weekly insurgent attacks are higher than they have \never been. At least five troops were killed in Iraq yesterday. We don't \nknow the exact number, but at least five were killed yesterday.\n  The country has become what is was not before the war--a training \nground and a launching pad for acts of international terror.\n  The killing of terrorist Zarqawi was a step forward. But as we have \nseen, the killings have not ended. Sectarian violence has not ceased \nbecause the Iraqi Government has failed to make the political \ncompromises necessary to create a stable government that can provide \nfor the security of its people--people taken from buses, kidnapped, and \nlikely will be killed.\n  That is only part of what happened last night in Iraq. I recall \nvividly when the Senate paused for a moment of silence when we reached \nthe grim milestone of 2,000 U.S. military killed in Iraq. But just last \nweek on a date that arrived far too quickly, we paused again to honor \nthe now 2,500 who have given their lives. And, of course, that figure \nhas since passed and there is more.\n  The Senate has an obligation to our troops and their families to do \neverything we can to delay indefinitely the next milestone. Are we \ngoing to have a moment of silence for 3,000 of our best?\n  Twenty-five hundred dead Americans is not ``just a number,'' as Tony \nSnowe, the President's spokesman, said. These 2,500 are sons, \ndaughters, mothers, fathers, husbands, and wives. They are PFC Thomas \nTucker and PFC Kristian Menchaca, whose mutilated bodies were found in \nIraq yesterday. These aren't just numbers.\n  We owe it to these troops and all of our forces serving in Iraq to \ndevelop a sound policy. We hear a lot of rhetoric about ``supporting \nthe troops.'' But the best way we can support them is with a smart \nstrategy--not with more rhetoric or slogans. That is why the Levin-Reed \namendment is so important.\n  The Levin-Reed amendment recognizes that it is time to transform the \nU.S. mission in Iraq and to begin the responsible redeployment of U.S. \nforces this year. It builds upon the bipartisan Senate amendment which \nwe passed overwhelmingly last year calling for ``2006 to be a year of \nsignificant transition in Iraq.'' With the midpoint of 2006 upon us, \nthat transition must begin.\n  The open-ended commitment advocated by the President and the \nmajority--that is the Republicans in this body--is not the way to get \nthe Iraqis to assume responsibility for governing and securing their \ncountry. They have trained 287,000 troops.\n\n  The Levin-Reed amendment recognizes that there are only political \nsolutions remaining in Iraq, not military solutions. This amendment \nrightfully focuses on the need to reconcile the sectarian differences, \nto regionalize the U.S. strategy, and to revitalize reconstruction \nefforts.\n  Passage of this amendment would chart a new course, one that is well \nbalanced between the military, the political, the regional, and the \ninternational solutions. An open-ended commitment is not sustainable, \nand the American people know that.\n  The war is now costing the American people every month upwards of $2 \nbillion--$500 million each week. The military has been stretched so \nthin, with every available combat unit of the Army and Marine Corps \nserving multiple tours in Iraq.\n  This war is not a matter for ``future Presidents'' as President Bush \nsaid. It is his war. It is the war of President George Bush. And the \ntime to act is now, for as we are bogged down in Iraq, the threats to \nour freedom around the world only grow.\n  An open-ended commitment in Iraq hurts our ability to address other \nnational security challenges around the world. While beginning the \nphased redeployment this year will allow many of our troops to come \nhome, it will also permit the President to redeploy forces so they can \ndeal with other crises such as we now have in Afghanistan--where four \nor five were killed yesterday--where the resurgent Taliban threat must \nbe eliminated and Osama bin Laden must be finally captured or killed.\n  I watched the floor debate yesterday. The majority, instead of \noffering their vision for the future in Iraq, or even speaking to the \nmerits of the Levin-Reed amendment, chose to resort to a familiar \nplaybook straight from Karl Rove's book of partisan political tricks. \nThey have engaged in these cheap political attacks saying Democrats \nwant to ``surrender'' and ``cut and run.'' Not only are these attacks \nbaseless, but they won't help Iraqis--and they certainly won't help our \ntroops who are right now lugging 70-pound packs in 100-degree heat \nwhile trying to avoid roadside bombs and snipers.\n  The Republicans in the Senate stand alone, insisting on ``no plan and \nno end.'' It isn't a position shared by the American people, and it \nisn't even a position shared by our military leaders.\n  On today's morning news, it is reported that General Casey, commander \nof U.S. forces in Iraq, has stated that thousands of troops will likely \nbe redeployed by year's end. That is General Casey.\n  To my Republican colleagues, is General Casey surrendering? To my \nRepublican colleagues, is General Casey cutting and running? To my \nRepublican colleagues, is General Casey admitting defeat? I think not.\n  Over at the White House, we see similar partisan games. The \nadministration continues to mislead the American people. The Vice \nPresident continues to insist the insurgency is in its ``last throes,'' \ndespite the headlines we read every day. The President continues to \ninsist that we will ``stand down when Iraqis stand up.'' That has yet \nto occur.\n  It is time to change from the slogans, the attacks, and the continual \nmisleading nature of this administration as it relates to the war in \nIraq. Demanding a change of course is not irresponsible, it is not \nunpatriotic, it is the right thing to do.\n  Edward R. Murrow said:\n\n       We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. When the loyal \n     opposition dies, I think the soul of America dies with it.\n\n  For all of those troops who are serving on their third and fourth \ntours of duty, for those who have served on their first and second \ntours of duty, for all those Iraqis who want to see an end to the civil \nwar plaguing their nation, for all those people who want Iraq to \nsucceed in delivering a free and democratic way of life, for those who \nbelieve we need to refocus on the larger global war on terror, we must \nvote for a change in policy and a change in direction. We must reject \nthe ``stay the\n\n[[Page S6334]]\n\ncourse'' doctrine of the Bush administration. We must vote for the \nLevin-Reed amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I thank both managers for a superb debate \nand discussion over the course of the last several days--and really the \nlast several weeks--as we have focused on an issue that is no more \nimportant to the American people than the safety and security of the \nAmerican people.\n  We can take great pride in what our Nation and our military men and \nwomen have accomplished in Iraq. We thank them. We thank their families \nfor their commitment and for their dedication. But we did not go into \nIraq in pursuit of oil or riches or some other national advantage. We \nwent as a volunteer--as a nation willing to enforce the mandates of the \nyou U.N. Security Council when others were content to allow Saddam \nHussein to defy those mandates.\n  Some critics accused us at the time of ``unilateralism,'' but in fact \nwe acted to vindicate multilateralism--most importantly, the authority \nof the Security Council and the credibility of many resolutions it \nadopted with respect to Iraq between 1991 and 2003.\n  We went into Iraq to end a cruel dictatorship and free a people that \nwas no less deserving of freedom than any other. As a result of our \nefforts, the dictatorship has ended, and the people of Iraq are now \nembarked on a grand democratic project, seeking to build a pluralistic, \nmultiethnic, multireligious democracy in the heart of the Arab world.\n  This is a project without precedent in the Arab world. And because it \nis so novel, it has come under assault from religious fundamentalists, \nSunni and Shiite extremists, and others whose narrow agendas are \nthreatened by the prospect of democracy in that part of the world.\n  We have made an enormous investment in the success of this project. \nIt would be foolish to squander that investment just as we are seeing \nsuccess.\n  Last year, millions of Iraqis--half of them women--defied the threats \nof the terrorists and streamed to the polls in three national \nelections. Iraq's Sunni population participated in greater numbers each \ntime.\n  On June 8--just a couple of weeks ago--the new democratically elected \nPrime Minister Jawad al-Maliki named the last three Cabinet members, \nthe Ministers of Defense, Interior, and Security, thereby completing \nformation of his unity government.\n  That same day, the death of the foremost terrorist in Iraq, Abu Musab \nal-Zarqawi, was announced in Baghdad. That was huge progress.\n  We made a commitment to the new government of Prime Minister Maliki, \nand it would be impossible to imagine a worse time than now, just 2 \nweeks after that government was fully formed and its most ferocious \nenemy eliminated, to turn our backs on it.\n  None of us know for sure exactly how the democratic reform in Iraq \nwill turn out, as we stay committed, but we do know it will fail if it \nis abandoned prematurely by the United States.\n  Withdrawal is not an option. Surrender is not a solution. Every \nSenator must make his own decision and live with his own conscience, \nbut this Senator will not be responsible for condemning the 26 million \npeople of Iraq to decades more of violence and repression--not when \nthere is a democratic alternative before us that is so manifestly \ncommitted to creating the kind of pluralistic society that until now \nhas been absent from the Arab world.\n  Another reason we went into Iraq was because we were convinced that \nSaddam Hussein was continuing his pursuit of weapons of mass \ndestruction--chemical weapons that he had developed and used before.\n  And the events of 9/11 had taught us that there is no greater threat \nto us today than that posed by state sponsors of terrorism--such as \nIraq under Saddam Hussein--working to acquire such weapons.\n  After the war, of course, there emerged a big debate over whether \nSaddam Hussein really was working on weapons of mass destruction in \n2003.\n  But there is no debate that there was a strong international \nconsensus prior to 2003 that Saddam Hussein must be pursuing weapons of \nmass destruction.\n  This was the view not only of the Bush administration, but also of \nthe Clinton administration, as well as the opinion of most other \ngovernments around the world.\n  It made sense for two reasons.\n  First, Saddam Hussein had a long track record of not only seeking, \nbut also of using, chemical weapons. He had used chemical weapons \nagainst his own people in the 1980s. And at the end of the first \nPersian Gulf war in 1991 he was found to have an advanced nuclear \nweapons program--a program that may have only been 1 to 2 years away \nfrom producing a nuclear weapon.\n  Second, Saddam Hussein was acting like a man who had something to \nhide; he was obstructing the U.N.'s weapons inspectors and repeatedly \ndefying U.S. disarmament mandates. No one can explain why Saddam acted \nthis way if he in fact had no weapons of mass destruction programs to \nhide.\n  And it is certainly true that if Saddam Hussein were still in power \ntoday, Iraq would remain on the list with Iran and North Korea of \ncountries that we fear will develop weapons of mass destruction and \npass them to terrorists.\n  Because Saddam Hussein has been removed from power, Iraq is no longer \non that list.\n  But we must remember that many of Saddam's weapons scientist--those \nwho produced the chemical weapons he used against the Kurds in the \n1980s and who came close to producing nuclear weapons in the early \n1990s--are still in Iraq.\n  However, in a democratic Iraq these scientists pose no threat because \na democratic Iraq would never seek to revive Saddam Hussein's weapons \nprograms.\n  If we were to cut and run from Iraq, and risk letting the terrorists \ntake power, we would again have to fear that these scientists, and what \nremains of Saddam's weapons infrastructure, would once again be put to \nwork producing weapons that in the hands of international terrorists \ncould destroy our cities and decimate our population.\n  Again, every Senator must live with his own conscience, but this \nSenator does not want to be complicit in a decision that could reverse \nthe success we've achieved since 9/11 in keeping terrorism from our \nshores and weapons of mass destruction out of the hands of terrorists.\n  The amendments before us are intentionally misleading. They are \nwritten in soft language and wrapped in reassuring concepts.\n  They don't sue such terms as ``retreat'' or ``withdrawal,'' but \ninstead call for ``redeployment'' of our Armed Forces from Iraq.\n  They don't say that the withdrawal should take place on an artificial \ntimetable and be concluded by an arbitrary date. Instead, they say that \nthe ``redeployment'' should take place under a ``schedule,'' that the \n``schedule'' should be ``planned,'' that the ``plan'' should be \n``coordinated'' with the Government of Iraq, and that the Congress \nshould be ``consulted'' at every stage.\n  None of this artful language, however, can conceal what is really \nproposed and what really at stake.\n  The proponents of these amendments want us to tell the new Government \nof Iraq that we're leaving--no matter what the implications for the \nfuture of their country; no matter how much they plead with us to stay; \nno matter how great the risk that the investment that we and they have \nmade to date in building a new Iraq will be squandered and turned to \nnaught.\n  The amendments may differ in some of the details--how long we'll wait \nuntil we actually leave, how emphatically we tell the Iraqi people we \nreally care about them as we walk out the door, but the bottom line is \nthe same.\n  The amendments tell us to set a deadline and leave by the deadline.\n  This would be a dangerous policy, a reckless policy, and a shameful \npolicy.\n  The time to leave Iraq is when we have achieved our objectives. If we \nknew our objectives were unachievable then these amendments might make \nsense. But our objectives are achievable and we are achieving them.\n  The brave men and women of our Armed Forces are fighting daily to win \nvictory in Iraq, and it would dishonor them, to say nothing of their \nfallen comrades, to cut and run at a time as promising as now.\n  The spirit of these amendments is the spirit of defeatism and \nsurrender.\n  This is not the spirit that made America the great Nation it is \ntoday, and I trust that when we vote we will\n\n[[Page S6335]]\n\nsend the message that there is no room for defeatism in the United \nStates.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign).

We should be \ndoing all that we can to help members of our armed services who are \nserving so courageously. And, with the Nation's deficits and the tab \nfor the Iraq war at alarming levels, we should not be accepting another \nbackdoor payraise. At a minimum, the Senate should consider and vote on \nthose worthy amendments before completing work on the Defense \nauthorization bill.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote, the yeas are 98, the nays are 1. \nThree-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in the \naffirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, first, on behalf of Senator Levin and \nmyself, I thank all the Members for the strong cooperation to \nprocedurally move this series of amendments and to proceed with the \nbill. Speaking just for myself--my ranking member is absent for a \nmoment--I believe very strongly that this bill can be completed today \nbefore sunset. Of course, this is one of the longest days of the year, \nso that might be a little longer than some might wish, but I do think \nit is achievable. I say that most respectfully.\n  What we recommend to be done now--and I will ask unanimous consent--\nis the Senate now turn to an\n\n[[Page S6336]]\n\namendment by the distinguished Senator from Texas, and I am told by the \nSenator that she will seek a voice vote. That has been cleared on both \nsides. The next amendment will be offered by our distinguished \ncolleague from Georgia, a member of the committee, Mr. Chambliss. That \nwill take perhaps an hour or more and will require a record vote. \nThereafter, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate then recognize the \nSenator from Minnesota, Mr. Dayton, to address the Senate with regard \nto amendments and the bill as a whole.\n  I would also say to colleagues, subject to confirmation by the \nleadership, that I am recommending there be no votes from now until \n3:30. There are two very serious functions taking place, both of a \nreligious nature, in our city, and Members are attending either the \nlast rites of Philip Merrill, a personal friend of mine, a wonderful \nman who recently lost his life on the Chesapeake Bay, and then I \nunderstand a distinguished archbishop of the Catholic Church is being \ninstalled with a ceremony today.\n  Therefore, the bill will continue its momentum in this period of \ntime, and following those votes, I am certain the leadership will give \nthe managers such guidance as to when we can conclude this bill, which \nagain I hope will be today.\n  So at this time, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, if the chairman will yield just for a \nsecond, we don't need an hour on this amendment, I say to my friend \nfrom Virginia. I think 40 minutes equally divided would be sufficient \nfor my purposes. I don't know about the author of the amendment; he \nmight want more time.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, the only thing I would say is I have \nseveral folks who want to speak on it. If we could get an hour equally \ndivided, my guess is we won't use it.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be an \nhour equally divided between the distinguished Senators from Georgia \nand Arizona on the Chambliss amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. We have covered as much ground as we can procedurally at \nthis point, and I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4377\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I call up amendment No. 4377 and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4377.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To include a delineation of the homeland defense and civil \nsupport missions of the National Guard and Reserves in the Quadrennial \n                            Defense Review)\n\n       At the end of subtitle C of title IX, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 924. INCLUSION OF HOMELAND DEFENSE AND CIVIL SUPPORT \n                   MISSIONS OF THE NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVES IN \n                   THE QUADRENNIAL DEFENSE REVIEW.\n\n       Section 118(d) of title 10, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) by redesignating paragraph (15) as paragraph (16); and\n       (2) by inserting after paragraph (14) the following new \n     paragraph (15):\n       ``(15) The homeland defense mission and civil support \n     missions of the active and reserve components of the armed \n     forces, including the organization and capabilities required \n     for the active and reserve components to discharge each such \n     mission.''.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, this amendment would require the \nDepartment of Defense to clarify in the Quadrennial Defense Review the \nhomeland defense and civil support missions of the National Guard and \nReserves.\n  The QDR is a comprehensive examination of national defense strategy, \nforce structure, force mobilization, and modernization plans, \ninfrastructure, budget plans--all elements of the defense program. It \nis the planning that goes on every 4 years. The QDR is in process now \nfor the next 4 years. The goal of the QDR is to determine the defense \nstrategy of the United States and its established defense programs for \nthe next 20 years, and it is updated every 4 years.\n  For decades, homeland defense has been a mission of the Department of \nDefense. However, only after the 9/11 attacks in 2001 did this very \nimportant mission really come to the forefront in defense planning. \nUnfortunately, the present QDR lacks sufficient guidance for the Guard \nand Reserve components in this very important mission they have.\n  The amendment I am proposing would require the Department of Defense \nto include in the QDR a definition of the homeland defense and civil \nsupport missions of the National Guard and Reserves. The Department has \nnot really formalized the requirements for the role of the National \nGuard and Reserve in homeland security. We know the President has \nordered the deployment of Guard and Reserve to our borders to try to \nsecure our borders, so we need a really comprehensive look and guidance \nfor the Reserve component, particularly the Guard, concerning their \nroles and how they will be able to train and equip for homeland \nsecurity missions.\n  Today, the National Guard and Reserve must debate the merits of their \ninitiatives and their equipment procurement. That is not the way it \nshould be. Our Guard and Reserve do a fabulous job. They are on active \nduty in Iraq and Afghanistan today. They have gone through several \ncycles of deployment to Iraq and Afghanistan. There is a Texas Guard \nunit in Bosnia in command and control today, continuing the \npeacekeeping mission there. They are doing their jobs, they are being \ncalled up at a level that is very high, but ambiguities remain in their \nhomeland security mission.\n  Competition for resources continues, and there is a lack of clarity \nabout what role the Department actually expects them to have. This \nomission was painfully obvious after 9/11. After Hurricanes Rita and \nKatrina and now with the deployment to the border, which I totally \nsupport, their mission is once again expanding. This amendment will \nprovide the DOD with the information it needs to determine the role the \nNational Guard and Reserves should have, must have, and will continue \nto have, but with more clarification, in the defense of our country.\n  This is a very important amendment. I believe it will add to their \nresponsibilities, and they will be able to get the equipment and the \ntraining they need to do the jobs we are asking them to do in homeland \ndefense and for the other civil emergencies we have.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the support of my colleagues for this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There being no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4377) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we will turn to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Georgia for his amendment, with 1 hour equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4261\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I rise today to call up amendment No. 4261 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside and the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Chambliss], for himself, Mr. \n     Hatch, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Cornyn, \n     Mr. Thune, Mr. Bennett and Mr. Stevens, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4261.\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To authorize multiyear procurement of F-22A fighter aircraft \n                           and F-119 engines)\n\n       On page 29, strike lines 6 through 15 and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 146. FUNDING FOR PROCUREMENT OF F-22A FIGHTER AIRCRAFT.\n\n       (a) Prohibition on Use of Incremental Funding.--The \n     Secretary of the Air Force shall not use incremental funding \n     for the procurement of F-22A fighter aircraft.\n\n[[Page S6337]]\n\n       (b) Multiyear Procurement.--The Secretary of the Air Force \n     may, in accordance with section 2306b of title 10, United \n     States Code, enter into a multiyear contract beginning with \n     the fiscal year 2007 program year for procurement of not more \n     than 60 F-22A fighter aircraft.\n\n     SEC. 147. MULTIYEAR PROCUREMENT OF F-119 ENGINES FOR F-22A \n                   FIGHTER AIRCRAFT.\n\n       The Secretary of the Air Force may, in accordance with \n     section 2306b of title 10, United States Code, enter into a \n     multiyear contract beginning with the fiscal year 2007 \n     program year for procurement of the following:\n       (1) Not more than 120 F-119 engines for F-22A fighter \n     aircraft.\n       (2) Not more than 13 spare F-119 engines for F-22A fighter \n     aircraft.\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Let me say, it is very difficult, any time you have to \noppose your subcommittee chairman--and in this case the full committee \nchairman--on an issue, particularly two Senators whom I hold in such \nhigh esteem. But we do have a disagreement in a very professional way \non this issue. At the end of the day, all of us intend to do what is in \nthe best interests of the men and women who fight for America.\n  The F-22A Raptor is the U.S. Air Force's top priority for providing a \njoint force with air dominance, operational access, homeland and cruise \nmissile defense for the next 20-plus years. The F-22A is a first-of-a-\nkind multimission fighter aircraft that combines Stealth, supercruise, \nadvanced maneuverability, and integrated avionics to make it the \nworld's most capable combat aircraft.\n  This amendment authorizes a 3-year multiyear procurement contract for \nthe F-22. This is not about spending money, it is about saving money, \nand it is about good acquisition practices and policy.\n  This amendment will save approximately $235 million as a minimum \namount, allowing DOD to use this money for other priorities or allow \nus, the Congress, to return these dollars to the taxpayers.\n  An independent study, commissioned by the Office of the Secretary of \nDefense, is the only independent study yet to be done for the F-22 \nmultiyear contract. In that study, the Institute for Defense Analysis, \nor IDA, concluded that the proposed F-22A multiyear contract, first of \nall, meets all the criteria provided in the law and does, in fact, save \nthe taxpayer a minimum of $235 million over the next 3 years.\n  The study was not completed in time for the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee markup back in early May, which is why it was not included in \nthe Senate bill at that time, or at least we didn't have an amendment \nat that time. However, the study was submitted to the Armed Services \nCommittee on the 16th of May.\n  Since I have been on this committee, we have been talking about the \nneed to conduct acquisitions better, cheaper, and more efficiently. \nThis amendment does exactly that. We know we are going to buy 60 F-22s \nover the next 3 years. That is the current plan. The DOD budget \nprovides for the funding, and I have heard no one in Congress question \nthe need for the airplane. As a matter of fact, this airplane today is \nflying in rotation around the country and soon will be flying around \nthe world as it is scheduled to go into rotation to Iraq shortly. As we \nare sitting here today, I suspect there is an F-22 flying over \nWashington, DC, protecting the skies over our Nation's Capital.\n  The only question is how are we going to buy these airplanes? Are we \ngoing to buy them with 3 1-year contracts and pay more money, or are we \ngoing to buy them with a 3-year multiyear contract and save a quarter \nof a billion dollars?\n  We need to have a high standard for what qualifies for a multiyear \ncontract. As a matter of comparison, the F-414 engine for the F-18 \nsaved 2.8 percent and $51 million. The multiyear contract for two \nprevious F-16 multiyears saved $246 million and $262 million \nrespectively.\n  By comparison, the proposed F-22A multiyear contract saves 2.6 \npercent and a minimum of $235 million.\n  The point is that the F-22 multiyear is in the same category in terms \nof percent savings and total savings of multiyear contracts that this \nbody has previously approved.\n  Also, the per-plane savings on the F-22 multiyear will be identical \nto the per-plane savings on the F/A-18 multiyear, that being $3.8 \nmillion per plane. That is why the authors of the independent business \ncase analysis at IDA judge this multiyear to have significant savings, \nand I agree with them.\n  Much has been made over the old criteria for multiyear savings, which \nwas a minimum of 10 percent. But, frankly, that was changed early on in \nlaw and now, instead of 10 percent the statute does say, ``substantial \nsavings.''\n  The 2005 QDR, which was provided to Congress in concert with the \nfiscal year 2007 budget request, restructures the F-22A program to \nextend production through the fiscal year 2010 with a multiyear \nacquisition contract to ensure the Department does not have a gap in \nfifth-generation Stealth capabilities. To obtain a more favorable cost, \nDOD's strategy requested authority for a 3-year multiyear procurement \ncontract to buy 60 F-22s, 20 in each of the years 2007 through 2009. \nThis strategy was outlined in a letter from Undersecretary of Defense \nKen Krieg in a letter to the Senate Armed Services Committee on \nFebruary 13, 2006.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print that letter in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, \n           Technology and Logistics,\n                                Washington, DC, February 13, 2006.\n     Hon. John W. Warner,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Consistent with the Conference Report on \n     the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2006, Public \n     Law, 109-148, the Department has studied alternatives for the \n     continued acquisition of the F-22A aircraft beyond Fiscal \n     Year (FY) 2008. This has culminated in the procurement \n     strategy identified in the President's Budget for FY 2007 \n     (PB07).\n       The Quadrennial Defense Review Joint Air Dominance study \n     and budget deliberations addressed alternative procurement \n     quantities, rates, and force structure mixes. The \n     Department's PB07 plan provides for procurement of F-22A \n     aircraft through FY 2010. To obtain a favorable cost, the \n     strategy employs multiyear procurement of 20 aircraft each, \n     in Lots 7, 8, and 9, beginning in FY 2008, providing a total \n     force structure of 183 aircraft. FY 2007 funds will be used \n     to contract for delivery of economic-order-quantity items, \n     sub-assemblies and material required for Lot 7, advance \n     procurement for Lot 8 aircraft, and for other allowable costs \n     including, sustainment support, production engineering, \n     laboratories and combined test force infrastructure. This \n     strategy also procures titanium one-year earlier than normal \n     advanced procurement to accommodate the long-lead now \n     required to buy titanium. This plan substantially reduces the \n     F-22A procurement funds required by the Department in FY \n     2007, allowing the Department to meet other high-priority \n     requirements.\n       Continuing the F-22A procurement through FY 2010 retains \n     fifth-generation tactical aircraft procurement options in the \n     event of delays in the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program. \n     These actions also benefit the JSF program by helping to \n     reduce overhead rates and by retaining technical expertise \n     across the tactical aircraft industrial base, including the \n     prime contractor, subcontractors, and suppliers.\n       The Department is preparing the business case cost \n     comparison of multiyear and successive annual procurements \n     required by subsection 2306b(a)(1) of title 10, United States \n     Code. We intend to make the business case available to the \n     congressional defense committees by May 15, 2006, to support \n     FY 2007 Congressional budget deliberations.\n       I appreciate the foresight of the Congress in directing the \n     Department to study alternatives for the continued \n     acquisition of the F-22A. I believe that we have developed a \n     fiscally responsible strategy that will allow us to sustain \n     this viable tactical aircraft production line.\n       Similar letters have been sent to the chairmen and ranking \n     members of the other Congressional defense committees.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Kenneth J. Krieg.\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. The business case for the F-22 is clear and was \nvalidated during the QDR by the Joint Army Dominance Study. This study \nincluded any number of options of tactical air mixes, including various \ncombinations of F-22s, FA-18s, and joint strike fighter and other \nairborne weapons systems, so we are not proceeding with a random plan \nbut one that has been validated by careful analysis.\n  The business plan was also validated by the IDA study, again the only \nindependent organization that has looked at this multiyear plan.\n\n[[Page S6338]]\n\n  There are six criteria for meeting a multiyear contract. The \nindependent IDA business case analysis judges the F-22 program \naccording to each of these six criteria. I mention this because there \nis a GAO study that came out, coincidentally, this week relative to the \nmultiyear procurement of the F-22. It is critical of the multiyear \ncontract.\n  The GAO study, though, contains, frankly, false factual information. \nFor example, in the GAO study they talk about the cost of the airplane \nactually increasing under the multiyear contract. But what they fail to \ntake into consideration is that originally, before the reprogramming to \ndo 20 airplanes this year and 20 in the next budget and 20 in the next \nbudget, the Air Force was going to ask for 29 planes in the next budget \nand 27 in the following budget.\n  If you build 29 versus 20, it is going to be cheaper. But that is the \nfactual information that the GAO plugged into their numbers--29 instead \nof 20. That is why there is a higher price cost that the GAO came up \nwith.\n  Second, the GAO report talks about the fact that under the Air Force \nproposal, there is not enough funding in the budget to pay for these \nairplanes. We are going to have to use what is called incremental \nfunding.\n  That was talked about early on in the process but abandoned. Here we \nare in the end of June of this year. The reprogramming took place the \nend of last year and the early part of this year. The facts were known \nat that time. GAO ignored those facts.\n  Second, the incremental funding issue that was talked about early on \nwas abandoned early in the year. GAO ignored that and included those \nfalse facts in its report. So the GAO study, frankly, is not correct \nbecause it is not based on the actual, as we say in the law--the facts \nin evidence.\n  There is one other issue relative to the GAO that I am going to \nconclude with and that is this. It gives a list of the factors that it \ntook into consideration in doing its report. There is one glaring \nfactual statement, one factual provision that is left out of \nconsideration by the GAO. That is talking to pilots that fly this \nairplane.\n  I have talked to several of those guys. We had a red flag operation \nthat was done several weeks ago by the Air Force. In talking to a \ncouple of those pilots afterward, it was unbelievable what they had to \nsay about flying the F-22.\n  One of them said this:\n\n       In the United States Air Force, we don't look to win 51-49. \n     We look to win 100-nothing, and that is what the Raptor gives \n     us.\n\n  The Raptor is the follow-on for the F-15 and F-16. It is the fifth-\ngeneration fighter. It is going to allow us to continue air superiority \nand air dominance against any potential threat that might be \nforthcoming. I urge my colleagues to support the multiyear proposal \nthat is included in the President's budget, that is included in the \nauthorization bill that comes to the Senate from the House, that will \ngo into conference. We will save the taxpayer a minimum of $225 million \nover the next 3 years. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nNew Mexico?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I will be happy to yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nNew Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to Senator McCain, I understand he \nwants to speak in opposition to the amendment. I will not be long.\n  Mr. McCAIN. No problem.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Understand, we will each speak our piece here. It is \nnot a pleasure to come and oppose my colleague. Nonetheless, I must say \nthat it seems to me we are always talking in the Senate about trying to \ndo things that are more efficient; trying to do good business, do \nthings in a way they ought to be done. Here we have an opportunity to \ndo that.\n  We have a situation where the new fighter, the world-class F-22--but \nI am not going to take the Senate's time praising its qualities. We \nhave heard some of that from the distinguished Senator from Georgia. We \ncould spend all afternoon talking about what a fantastic airplane it \nis. That is not the issue before us.\n  The issue before us is that the Defense Department needs a multiyear \nprocurement authority to acquire these airplanes. The administration \nrequested a multiyear procurement authority for the F-22s. The House \nDefense Authorization bill granted the request. It makes plain, good \nbusiness sense that the Senate do the same--that we give the Department \nwhat it needs.\n  I also support this because, as indicated by the principal sponsor of \nthe amendment, the distinguished senior Senator from Georgia, this \nauthority will save money.\n  We are going to hear something to the contrary, but the contrary \nevidence is from reports that do not apply to the 20-per-year \nacquisition of the F-22. That is what we are trying to do. That is what \nthe Defense Department's final studies were based upon--acquisition of \n20 per year, for multiple years. A multiyear procurement of this nature \nwould net a savings of between $225 million and $325 million.\n  It seems to this Senator that this is precisely what we ought to be \ndoing. We ought to be doing more of this, not less. Is anybody doubting \nwe are going to buy this many of these Raptors? I don't hear that talk. \nI thought I was going to hear it 6 or 8 months ago when we were talking \nabout a number of systems, some of which are on hold, but this one is \nnot.\n  Therefore, we ought to proceed and save millions of dollars that can \nbe used for other needs. $300 million, for example, would pay for 4,200 \nNational Guard troops in active duty for 1 year. That is a lot of \nmoney. This is a monster bill, and one might say what is the difference \nhere? $225 million to $325 million in savings doesn't amount to much. I \nsubmit it is a pretty big amount.\n  There has been some talk this week about a new GAO report that is \ncritical of this multiyear procurement. But this report rehashes old \narguments and uses old data that is not relevant to the Department's \ndata regarding the multiyear acquisition, which has been stated in \ndetail by the senior Senator from Georgia.\n  Therefore, I submit that the airplane we are going to rely on--which \nwithout question the Quadrennial Defense Review says we must have--we \nought to go ahead and procure on a multiyear basis today when we vote \non this amendment.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding time. I believe he has a compelling \nargument, and I hope the Senate will follow his lead.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nUtah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Georgia and my \ncolleague from Arizona.\n  What is the bottom line here? Simply put, Senator Chambliss has \noffered an amendment that is supported by the ministration that will \nenable the Air Force to buy 20 F-22s Raptors a year for the next 3 \nyears. By entering into this multiple year contract, the independent \nInstitute for Defense Analysis believes that the American taxpayer will \nsave at least $225 million.\n  Why are we buying the F-22? Because it is a war-winner. This fighter, \nwhich is also a very capable bomber, is now operational with the 1st \nFighter Wing. The Raptor is stealthier than the famous F-117 Nighthawk, \nwhich dropped the first bombs during the first gulf war. But unlike the \nNighthawk, that must fly at night in order to survive in a combat \nenvironment, the F-22 brings stealth capability out of the night, \nenabling operations in high threat areas 24 hours a day 7 days a week.\n  I have been to the Air Force base where I have talked with the pilots \nand have seen this plane and have seen it fly. It is a marvel.\n  The Raptor is the world's most lethal and maneuverable fighter \naircraft. This is accomplished in no small part by its supercruise \nengines. Supercruise engines do not need to go to after-burner in order \nto achieve supersonic flight. This provides the F-22 with a strategic \nadvantage by enabling supersonic speeds to be maintained for a far \ngreater length of time. By comparison, all other fighters require their \nengines to go to after-burner to achieve supersonic speeds. This \nconsumes a tremendous amount of fuel and greatly limits an aircraft's \nrange.\n\n[[Page S6339]]\n\n  Another legitimate question is why not just rely on the aircraft we \nhave today? Over the past 30 years, the United States has been able to \nmaintain air superiority in every conflict largely due to the F-15C. \nHowever, with the great advancements in technology over the past \nseveral years, the F-15 has struggled to keep pace. For example, the F-\n15 is not a stealth aircraft and its computer systems are based on \nobsolete technology. My colleagues should remember that the F-15 first \nflew in the early 1970s. During the ensuing years, nations have been \nconsistently developing new aircraft and missile systems to defeat this \nfighter.\n  Obviously, we need the F-22 and we have identified a means to save \nmoney while we are buying it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I don't oppose the F-22 program. In fact, \nthe Armed Services subcommittee provided and the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee marked down an additional $1.4 billion for 20 F-22s.\n  The issue is not, frankly, whether we support the F-22. Rightly or \nwrongly, we all do--and every member of the committee does. The \nquestion is, Are we going to act responsibly? The question is, Are we \ngoing to authorize a multiyear procurement of an aircraft that has--and \nit is not unusual--experienced time after time dramatic delays and cost \noverruns? Are we ready to do that? Not according to the GAO, not \naccording to the OMB, not according to the Congressional Research \nService, and not according to every outside observer of this program.\n  Let me give a small example. The F-22 experienced an initial \noperational capability delay of 9 years 9 months; initial operational \ntest and evaluation delayed 5 years 3 months; full rate production \ndelay of 5 years 3 months; low rate initial production, 4 years 9 \nmonths; first delivery of operational aircraft delayed 4 years 7 \nmonths; first flight delayed 2 years; and completion of critical design \nreview delayed 1 year 4 months. The record is not good. In fact, the \nrecord is terrible. In 1991, the estimated cost, according to the U.S. \nAir Force, for the aircraft was going to be $114 million--in then-year \ndollars; now, $354 million per copy.\n  This program--not atypically--has experienced significant delays and \ncost overruns, which, by the way, maybe we will get into at some point. \nThen they received incentive bonuses, even for violations of Nunn-\nMcCurdy. We are not talking about the purchase of F-22s. What we are \ntalking about is, are we going to violate the basic principles and the \nlaw which requires certain criteria to be met before multiyear \nacquisition of these aircraft? The report prepared by the Comptroller \nGeneral of the United States clearly states that four of the six \ncriteria set forth in the law have not been met by the Air Force. They \nhave not been met. Yet here we are debating a measure that would \neffectively permit the Air Force to be held unaccountable, to end run a \ngood Government provision in Federal law that is specifically designed \nto ensure accountability in our Government.\n  There have been two Nunn-McCurdy violations, according to the \nComptroller General. Since its inception, this program has been subject \nto 2 Nunn-McCurdy violations and has been rebaselined 14 times just to \navoid additional breaches. Fourteen times they have rebaselined the \ncost of this weapons system. We all know the game. They come and they \nsay: This weapons system is going to cost X. They get it authorized, \nthen we get it, and guess what happens. It ends up costing dramatically \nmore money--in the case of this aircraft, from $114 million each to \n$354 million each, and it is still in a relatively embryonic stage.\n  The Air Force, I am sorry to say, has misrepresented several things, \nincluding the termination cost of the C-130J.\n  The Air Force--a September 28, 2005, Defense Contract Audit Agency \nreport points out that Lockheed-Martin earned a profit of almost 27 \npercent--$643 million--on a $2.4 billion, 60-aircraft, multiprocurement \nfor C-130 aircraft. The estimate on the actual multiyear procurement \ncost savings for the F-22--the Air Force acquisition officers \nmisrepresented the F-22 program as a stably funded program. Last year, \nCongress authorized and appropriated enough money for 24 F-22 aircraft. \nThe Air Force bought 22. We have been asking them: What happened to the \nother two airplanes? We still haven't gotten a response. How we buy the \nF-22 is not subject to unfettered discretion. If we choose to buy them \nunder a multiyear contract, we must do so in compliance with the law. \nThis amendment does not.\n  The Congressional Research Service points out the many ongoing \ntechnical problems with the F-22--avionics problems, airframe problems, \nengine problems. The F-119 engine fuel consumption has been \nunsatisfactory, and problems were experienced with the engine's core \ncombustor, which did not demonstrate desired temperature levels. The F-\n22's cockpit canopy experienced ongoing challenges, including cracking \nand reliability. It goes on and on. Many of these things are associated \nwith the development of a new weapons system.\n  By the way, I have never met a pilot who didn't like to fly a new \nweapons system, but the fact is that it is not ready for multiyear \nprocurement. That was the subject of extensive hearings in the \nsubcommittee and consideration in the full committee. I don't expect \nthis body to rubberstamp everything the committee does, but I can tell \nyou that extensive analysis and study was done on it.\n  I also point out that literally every outside group, including the \nIDA, had concerns about it, even though they alleged that there would \nbe significant cost savings. But the fact is that even the IDA, which \nmy friend from Georgia points out--this form of contracting bears \nsignificant risks. Multiyear procurement reduces Congressional \nbudgetary flexibility, both for the instant program and across other \nprograms within the Defense portfolio.\n\n  I urge my colleagues who consider supporting this amendment--and we \nknow very well that there will be reductions in defense spending. It \nhappens historically as wars wind down. Already on the House side, \nthere has been a proposal for significant reductions in defense \nspending, which I do not support but apparently may be the final \nproduct for next year from the House Appropriations Committee.\n  We are going to lock in multiyear procurement for a weapons system \nthat has experienced dramatic cost overruns. And I am not saying we \nshouldn't procure this aircraft. I am saying we should. I am not \ntotally convinced that it would actually meet the challenges of the war \non terrorism, but I strongly support it. But before we give them a \nblank check, I think we should regard what we are doing here--locking \nin, in a multiyear fashion, the procurement of a weapons system that \nhas gone from $100-and-some million per copy to over $300 million per \ncopy which still has very significant technical problems associated \nwith it. I would caution and urge my colleagues to understand this in \nthe larger context.\n  Finally, we have a responsibility of oversight in the committee and \nas a body. If we allow multiyear procurement, we basically give up \nthose oversight responsibilities. And when we talk about a couple \nhundred million dollars, which is big money, and cost savings, look at \nthe overruns, the billions in cost overruns they have already \nexperienced, and we still haven't got a fully tested, completed, and \noperational product.\n  I understand the desire of my friend from Georgia to make sure this \nprogram is basically locked in, which is what this amendment will do. I \ndon't think we are ready for it. Every outfit outside of the U.S. Air \nForce--and even the IDA, with a qualified endorsement--the \nCongressional Research Service, OMB, GAO, and all the others concur in \nthat conclusion.\n  I hope we will reject this amendment, but I certainly understand and \nrespect the position of my friend from Georgia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I find myself, as chairman, having to live \nup to my responsibilities. Not only do I have the highest regard for \nour colleague from Georgia, I have a high regard for this airplane. \nThese airplanes are stationed in Virginia. I am supporting the position \ntaken by Senator McCain against the constituent interests in my own \nState because I feel ever so importantly the statements made by Senator \nMcCain--namely, that the oversight which our committee tries to provide \nshould be respected in this Chamber. It is our collective judgment. The \nmajority of the\n\n[[Page S6340]]\n\nSenators, having voted on this in various ways in our committee, \nbelieve that we should not go to this multiyear procurement at this \ntime for reasons eloquently stated by the Senator from Arizona.\n  I regret deeply to be in opposition to one of our most valued \nMembers, the Senator from Georgia, but let me point this out: You have \nto sometimes stand apart from constituent interests, State interests, \nand do what you believe is in the best interests of this country.\n  I say this with a sense of humility. I walked into the Pentagon in \nFebruary of 1969 as then-Under Secretary of the Navy. The halls of the \nbuilding were filled with the wreckage of a plane called TFX in which \nthis country had invested billions of dollars to build and it was \nfinally concluded that, for a number of reasons, the contract shouldn't \ngo forward. Thereafter, in the positions as Under Secretary and \nSecretary of the Navy, I worked with the S-3, a new AFW airplane, \nbringing that along. I worked with the F-14. As a matter of fact, this \ndistinguished aide of the Armed Services Committee was an F-14 pilot \nand has reminisced with me many times--thank you for putting two \nengines on that plane--because many a time he landed on a carrier with \none engine.\n  The planes are complicated situations, and they are becoming more and \nmore complicated each year, and it is the collective judgment of the \nmembers of the Senate Armed Services Committee that we should not \nabdicate our oversight and jump into this multiyear procurement.\n  I support the airplane. I am hopefully getting additional aircraft at \nmy base in Virginia. I am proud of that. But I am going to support what \nI think is a proper management decision. To support the Chambliss \namendment would be, frankly, a violation of statute on the books, the \nlaw of the land. Subsection A(1) through subsection 6 of section \n2306(b) of title 10, United States Code, establishes the conditions for \nentering into a multiyear procurement contract. The statute requires \nthe use of such a contract resulting in a substantial savings. This \nmultiyear procurement proposal under this amendment would not provide \nsubstantial savings--some savings but not substantial. The statute also \nrequires that the estimates of both the cost of the contract and the \nanticipated cost avoidance through the use of a multiyear contract are \nrealistic.\n\n  Just listen to what Senator McCain said. The estimates are not \nrealistic. The Air Force had budgeted for 24 \nF-22A aircraft in fiscal year 2006 but will only be able to buy 22 or \n23 aircraft with the available funds.\n  Mr. President, the statute also requires that there is a reasonable \nexpectation that throughout the contemplated contract period the head \nof the agency will request funding for the contract at the level \nrequired to avoid contract cancellation. There is no reasonable \nexpectation that the level of funding required to avoid contract \ncancellation will be met. The multiyear justification package sent to \nCongress on May 16, 2006 presented a program that was underfunded by \n$674 million.\n  By statute, I say to colleagues, this amendment cannot be supported. \nBy statute, by the majority of the members of the Committee of the \nArmed Services having examined it carefully, through subcommittee and \nfull committee review, it cannot be supported. I say most respectfully \nto the Senator from Georgia, we are facing here a rather interesting \nchapter of a very significant and important defense contractor trying \nto get through this body a decision which is in violation of statute \nand overrides the judgment of the majority of the members of the Armed \nServices Committee. I urge Senators not to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). The Senator from Georgia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to my colleague from \nGeorgia, Senator Isakson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague, the \nsenior Senator from Georgia, Saxby Chambliss, for offering this \namendment. I have the greatest regard for the committee and \nsubcommittee chairmen. Senators Warner and McCain are outstanding \nMembers of this body. I beg to differ with them, and I want to focus my \ndebate on two critical areas.\n  One is Senator Chambliss presents as a selling point of this \namendment that $235 million in savings that a multiyear contract brings \nwould not happen if you were doing annual contracts. The distinguished \nSenator from Arizona acknowledged, did not argue that that number was \nnot correct. The distinguished Senator from Virginia also did not argue \nthat number wasn't correct but made the following statement, that that \nis not a substantial savings. That is at best a subjective judgment, \nbut I would call $235 million substantial any time.\n  Secondly, I would like to quote from a letter--and I ask unanimous \nconsent to have this letter printed in the Record--dated June 8 from \nJames Finley, Deputy Under Secretary of Defense, to the GAO.\n\n       Over the past several procurement lots, the Air Force has \n     been very successfully working with the prime contractor to \n     drive down cost. Unit flyaway costs have come down 35 percent \n     between Lot 1 and Lot 5. If stopped, production re-start \n     would be very costly and difficult to resume, breaking this \n     positive trend.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            Deputy Under Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 8, 2006.\n     Mr. David M. Walker,\n     Comptroller General of the United States, U.S. Government \n         Accountability Office, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Walker: This is the Department of Defense (DoD) \n     response to the GAO draft report, ``Tactical Aircraft: DOD \n     Should Present a New F-22 Business Case Before Making Further \n     Investments,'' dated May 8, 2006 (GAO Code 120474/GAO-06-\n     455R).\n       The Department does not agree with draft GAO report's \n     recommendation to delay further investment in the F-22. While \n     the Department agrees with the GAO's emphasis on the \n     importance of supporting our procurement decisions with \n     appropriate ``Business Case'' analysis, we have performed \n     such analysis to support F-22 and tactical aircraft force \n     structure decisions, and will continue to do so. Additional \n     information and rationale for the Department's position is \n     summarized below.\n       Implementing the GAO's recommendation to delay investment \n     in the F-22 would disrupt production and create program \n     instability. This instability would be detrimental to our \n     nation's defense capabilities and our tactical aircraft \n     industrial base. Over the past several procurement lots, the \n     Air Force has been very successfully working with the prime \n     contractor to drive down costs. Unit flyaway costs have come \n     down 35% between Lot 1 and Lot 5. If stopped, production re-\n     start would be very costly and difficult to resume, breaking \n     this positive trend. Likewise, there is considerable \n     modernization work ongoing. To stop this work would result in \n     large termination costs and would be very costly to resume. \n     Multiple GAO reports have noted the negative impact that \n     program instability has on program cost, schedule, and \n     performance.\n       The assumptions on which the GAO's recommendations are \n     based were not understood. The quantity and mix of tactical \n     aircraft to be procured by the Department has been and \n     remains an area of significant ``Business Case'' analysis. As \n     the geopolitical and fiscal environment changes, we \n     continually reassess national security requirements and \n     adjust our force structure as needed. Keeping the F-22 \n     production line active, preserves the Department's options \n     and sustains the industrial base for efficient transition to \n     Joint Strike fighter production.\n       To support the Quadrennial Defense Review and preparation \n     of the President's Fiscal Year 2007 Budget (PB07), the \n     Department performed a Joint Air Dominance (JAD) Study. The \n     JAD Study examined options for varying levels within the \n     strike fighter mix. The Department looked at the war \n     scenarios and cost implications of buying fewer variants of \n     Joint Strike Fighters, increasing and decreasing the number \n     of F-22s, and buying more legacy aircraft at the expense of \n     fewer fifth generation platforms. The results of these \n     analyses are reflected in PB07, which sets forth a balanced \n     portfolio of tactical aircraft assets, including Joint Strike \n     Fighter, F-22 and F/A-18E/F. The draft GAO report makes note \n     of, ``the large disparity between what the Air Force wants \n     for the F-22A program and what OSD has committed to fund, \n     there is a significant break in the business case to justify \n     buying more F-22As.'' The 381 aircraft the Air Force analysis \n     indicates are required is a fiscally unconstrained projection \n     of Service needs. The QDR analysis reflects fiscal realities \n     and the need to address competing defense priorities. The JAD \n     analysis showed that a balanced force structure mix of fifth \n     generation fighters, with legacy F/A-18E/Fs, F-15Es and \n     conventionally armed bombers, best met our requirements. \n     Buying fifth generation tactical\n\n[[Page S6341]]\n\n     aircraft assets (F-22 and JSF), for both the Air Force and \n     the Department of the Navy, optimized capability, \n     affordability, and mitigated risk better than other options.\n       A detailed response is attached.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to respond to this draft \n     report.\n                                                  James I. Finley.\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I was in business--didn't build airplanes \nbut built houses--and I know a little bit about R development costs, \nbut I know what the Raptor does.\n  Many of the things that were referred to as difficulties were \npredictable experiences in the development of a weapons system. The \nRaptor is the finest airplane ever built by any government anywhere any \ntime, and the pilots who fly it attest this meets and exceeds every \nspecification.\n  For me as a Senator, the other specification I want to meet is saving \nthe taxpayers of the United States of America money; $235 million is a \nsubstantial savings. The Senator from Georgia, Mr. Chambliss, is right. \nThis amendment establishes a 3-year multiyear contract for the F-22 is \nright, and I urge my colleagues to support it in the Chamber.\n  I yield back the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from South Dakota, \nMr. Thune.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, the Chambliss amendment will remove the \nprohibition on multiyear contract authority for the purchase of the F-\n22A aircraft and in so doing give the DOD the flexibility it needs to \npurchase 60 F-22A aircraft over a 3-year period in installments of 20.\n  The multiyear contract will save the Government, as has been noted by \nSenator Isakson, over $200 million over the 3-year period and allow for \na rational and steady flow of F-22s.\n  Mr. President, I also want to note one thing about the GAO study that \nhas been referenced here today and the funding for the F-22A. The \nstatement is made in the GAO study that the funding for the F-22 could \nbe better spent on fighting the war on terror. The problem with that is \nit assumes that America faces threats from only irregular forces or \nsubnational groups.\n  North Korea's threat to launch a multistage missile that can hit \nHawaii, Iranian nuclear ambitions, and the expansion and modernization \nof the Chinese military are patent examples of substantial threats from \nindependent nation states.\n  The air superiority gap America once enjoyed has dramatically closed. \nThe F-15, F-16, or F-18 are no longer without competition on the world \nstage. Since the late 1970s, for example, the Russian Air Force has \nbeen continually improving its air fleet. Planes like the MiG-29, Su-\n27, Su-35, and the addition of the Su-37 super-flanker have evened the \nplaying field. The Chinese are now making their own version of the Su-\n27 under the designation J-11. Both Russia and China are eyeing foreign \nbuyers for these formidable aircraft.\n  Further technology and modern air defenses have grown significantly, \nand Legacy aircraft are vulnerable to increased anti-aircraft threats \nand technology.\n  Congressional inaction on this matter is creating a situation where \nAmerican pilots will be flying aging Legacy aircraft against comparable \nenemy aircraft.\n  DOD states that the F-22As as fifth-generation fighters is needed to \nneutralize advanced air defenses, thus opening the door for follow-on \njoint forces to include nonstealthy Legacy aircraft and long-range \nstrike capabilities.\n  We need the F-22. The QDR supports this notion. The QDR focuses on \nthe ability to quickly and effectively penetrate enemy airspace and \nexploit stealth and electronic warfare capabilities. The F-22A excels \nat all these missions and helps America take a step ahead against \nemerging technologies and threats we face.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the Chambliss \namendment and allow the Air Force to move forward in a way that will \nenable us to save the taxpayers money and to meet the needs that we \nface for this country as we go forward.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 9 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I yield such time as he may consume to the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator from Georgia. I think this is a very \nserious thing we are getting into. I have five very important points I \nplan to make to respond to statements that have been made in the \nChamber here. One is I think the Chairman is right when he talks about \nthe information wasn't there, wasn't adequately discussed during the \nmarkup. One of the reasons for that is the IDA study didn't even come \nout until May 15, and because of that, that was not a part of the \nconversation.\n  Let me say one thing about the GAO study. I agree with the Senator \nfrom South Dakota. I am always leery of a new study that comes out the \nsame day that an amendment is discussed and brought up in the Chamber, \nand that happened to be 3 days ago. I think it is quite a coincidence \nit came out at the same time. Having looked at the IDA study, we are on \nsolid ground for pursuing this multiyear effort.\n  Let me respond to our good friend, the Senator from Arizona, on the \ncost overruns and the delays. I cannot remember--I have been on this \nArmed Services Committee for 12 years and in the House for 8 years--one \nsystem that did not go through this same thing. In the Navy alone, they \nhad many cost overruns. The joint strike fighter, now recognized as \nsomething we desperately need and are using, probably had more cost \noverruns. We had the Black Hawk upgrades, the same thing there.\n  But the thing I remember the most is the C-17s because I was in the \nHouse at that time. It was delay after delay after delay, and stop and \nthink, if we had at that point junked that, where would we be? Where \nwould we have gone in Bosnia, Kosovo? Things were anticipated where we \nwould desperately need it.\n  Right now we need to increase the number of planes. That I think we \nall know. And then we know what is happening to the C-130-R program. \nThis is something that has been happening for a long period of time.\n  The third thing I want to mention is the savings. I know one of the \nsix criteria is called substantial savings. I don't know if there is \nanyone who is going to be looking at this budget and accepting the fact \nthat a quarter of a billion dollars is not substantial. But there seems \nto be some doubt by Senators as to whether or not these savings would \nactually be achieved. And if you really ask questions about it, if we \nreally had to do this, I say to my friend from Georgia, we could write \nthat in and say at any point when it looks like we cannot anticipate \nthese savings, we would go back to the other type of procurement. That \ncould be done.\n  Quite frankly, I think the Air Force would be willing to do that. And \nthe figure of $225 million they and others believe and I believe is a \nconservative figure. So I think that would be one way to offset it.\n  When you look at title 10 criteria, substantial savings, we have \ntalked about that; stability, we have talked about that, stability of \nfunding, stability of design, we all know these things and where we are \nwith the program.\n  And so I have come to the conclusion after looking at this that it \ndoes qualify for all of these criteria, but there is one thing that has \nnot been said, quite frankly, in the right wing over here, and that is, \nduring the 1990s I can remember standing on this floor and saying we \nare going to have to do something about what is happening to the \nmodernization program because it is not just the aircraft and artillery \npieces, the most modern thing we have for the artillery is the \nPalladin, which is World War II technology, where you have to get out \nand swab the breach after each shot. There are five countries, \nincluding South Africa, making a better artillery piece than we are \nsending out with our kids.\n  Then we look at the F-15 and F-16, great vehicles. We understand \nthat. But one of the proudest moments I have had was in 1998 when we \nwere cutting a lot of the Defense budget at that\n\n[[Page S6342]]\n\ntime. We had two-star general John Jumper, who stood up and said \npublicly: Now we are sending our kids out with equipment that is not as \ngood as the Russians are making. At that time, they had the Su-27; the \nSu-30 was not actually deployed yet, now the Su-35. And we know in one \npurchase--I say to my friend from South Dakota because he mentioned \nother countries that are buying these things--in one purchase, the \nChinese purchased 230 of these vehicles. We think they are Su-30s, but \nwe don't know.\n  Consequently, if you assess the judgment as someone I think we will \nhave to accept, and that is General John Jumpers, their Su series in \nmany ways is better than our best strike vehicles, the F-15 and F-\n16. That has to concern Americans.\n\n  So I think if that were the only reason to keep this on schedule, and \ngo to a multiyear program where we enjoy the savings, that would be \nreason enough. As long as I am here, I am going to try to put America \nin a position where we have the very best of equipment with which we \nsend our kids to battle. That is not the case today. So I strongly \nsupport the amendment and believe we should get on with it.\n  Mr. President, I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may use.\n  I think we ought to try to go back to what this amendment is about. \nThis amendment is not to cure any delay. The fact is, we have in this \nauthorization 20 F-22s, with $1.4 billion over what was in the budget--\n20 of them. And then, next year, I would imagine we will authorize \nanother 20; and the year after that, another 20. This is not about any \ndelay. This is about congressional oversight. This is whether we should \ngo to multiyear funding and lock us into a weapons system which has not \nbeen proven yet.\n  I say to my friend from Georgia, no matter how this amendment comes \nout because of the differences of opinion we have within the committee, \nin July I would like to schedule a hearing, and we will get all the \nplayers over again. Whether this amendment goes up or down, in July we \nwill schedule a hearing in the subcommittee and have another look at \nthe pluses and minuses. The Senator from Oklahoma mentioned that \nseveral studies have come in. The IDAs came in on the 20th. The GAO one \ncame in yesterday or the day before.\n  So I will be glad--no matter how the vote ends up--to have another \nhearing on this issue because we are talking about, obviously, really \nlarge sums of money. So this Senator does not want to delay the \nprocurement of the F-22. But I certainly want to maintain our ability \nto oversight the program rather than locking us in. So it is not about \nwhether we delay or not.\n  Finally, on the issue of saving $225 million: from what? Because the \nAir Force, on May 16, 2006, stated that an additional $674 million is \nneeded to fully fund the multiyear program being proposed. So is that \nsavings of $225 million out of the $674 million of additional costs or \ndoes it mean there really isn't an additional $674 million, that they \nsent over, that they need? So that has to be sorted out as well.\n  So again, I restate to my colleagues that literally every outside \norganization--CRS, CBO, GAO--all of them believe not that this weapons \nsystem needs to be canceled, not that it needs to be delayed, but we do \nnot need to embark on a multiyear lock-in acquisition of this weapons \nsystem, which no doubt has very great value.\n  I hope my colleagues will agree with the distinguished chairman and \nme that this amendment should be rejected at this time.\n  Mr. President, does the Senator from Michigan wish to speak on this?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will be opposing the Chambliss amendment, \nalthough I am both a supporter of the F-22 and a supporter, generally, \nof multiyear contracts. Where they meet the criteria for multiyear \ncontracts, I am very supportive of them because of, mainly, the money \nthat can be saved.\n  I oppose this amendment with some reluctance. Again, I very much \nsupport, and have supported, the airplane. And I, in general, like the \nmultiyear approach, where it meets the criteria. But some of the \ncriteria have not been adequately met; for instance, whether the \nmultiyear contract would result in substantial savings compared to \nusing annual contracts. The studies are that the savings would be, I \nwould say, very modest and not substantial. There are some savings, but \nI could not say they are substantial savings.\n  Another criteria is whether the contract is for a number which is \nexpected to remain substantially unchanged during the contemplated \ncontract period in terms of both numbers, production rate, procurement \nrate, and, again, total quantities. The F-22 total program quantities \nare likely to increase before the end of production.\n  There is also a requirement that there be a stable design for the \nproperty to be acquired and that the technical risks associated with \nthe purchase are not excessive. There are some unresolved operational \ntest deficiencies, and there are what I think can fairly be called \nmajor modifications that are planned for providing more robust air-to-\nground capability.\n  There is also a question as to whether the estimates of both the cost \nof the contract and the anticipated cost avoidance through the use of a \nmultiyear contract are realistic. Cost estimates are still problematic. \nThe 2006 contract itself, we understand, has still not been signed. So \nit does not meet that criteria either.\n  I would hope that, perhaps next year, a multiyear would indeed meet \nthe criteria so we could utilize a multiyear approach next year. But I \ndo not believe this year it does meet the criteria for a multiyear \ncontract. I, therefore, will be opposing the Chambliss amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I respond to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Michigan that all of this which he raised has been addressed in \nthe IDA report and has been answered. The criteria set forth in the \nstatute has been validated and verified. I don't know of any technical \nproblems with the airplane today because, as I said earlier, we have 32 \nat Langley currently. We have other airplanes stationed at a couple of \nother bases around. They are flying over us as we speak, protecting our \nNation's Capitol. They are in rotation to go to Iraq. If there were any \ndeficiencies, obviously, we would not have those airplanes put in that \nrotation, engaging in what may be combat.\n  I will close by finally saying there has been a lot of conversation \nabout the way the cost of this airplane has increased. I think the \nmission of the airplane actually has changed over the 19 years since \nthis airplane was first authorized. It was initially an air-to-air \nairplane. Air-to-ground was added to it, which caused delays. What the \nSenator from Arizona alluded to, relative to issues of the airplane is \nexactly correct. But all of those have been addressed. And the cost, \nthe flyaway costs of this airplane for the last three lots have \ndecreased by 16 percent, 11 percent, and 14 percent respectively.\n  So it is an expensive airplane. There is no question about that. But \nthe capability of the airplane is also not questioned. It is a good \ndeal for the taxpayers. It is a good deal for the folks who are going \nto be called on to fly this airplane in defense of this country. I \nencourage my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I rise as an ardent supporter of the \nF-22A Raptor. I am very pleased that the Armed Services Committee has \nmodified the Department of Defense's budget request and authorized the \nprocurement of 20 F-22s during the next fiscal year.\n  That being said, I must express my disappointment that the committee \ndid not include in this legislation language authorizing the Secretary \nof the Air Force to enter into a multiyear procurement contract to \npurchase 20 Raptors a year for the next 3 years. Under such a contract, \nthe Institute for Defense Analyses estimates that we will save the \ntaxpayer at least $225 million. Therefore, I am proud to join Senator \nChambliss and cosponsor this important amendment along with Senators \nInhofe, Lieberman, Bingaman, Cornyn, Thune, Bennett, Isakson, Domenici, \nBaucus, Dodd, Hutchison, Collins, Ben Nelson, Feinstein and\n\n[[Page S6343]]\n\nStevens. Our amendment only strengthens the procurement plan for this \nvital aircraft.\n  I am also troubled that this bill does not increase above the 183 \ncurrently planned the number of F-22s that the Air Force is authorized \nto procure. My trepidation that our Nation will not build a sufficient \nnumber of aircraft is based on careful study of our Nation's needs and \non the advice and counsel of senior Air Force officers who have been \nunanimous in their expert opinion that if the Air Force is to meet its \nresponsibilities under the National Military Strategy, the Nation \nrequires 381 Raptors.\n  I have seen first-hand the capabilities of this extraordinary \naircraft, first at Tyndall Air Force Base, FL, where our pilots are \nlearning to fly the Raptor, and second at Langley Air Force, VA, where \nthe first operational F-22s are based. As a result of these meetings \nwith pilots and ground personnel and several other briefings on our \nfuture preparations, I have come to the conclusion that purchasing \nsufficient numbers of Raptors is absolutely vital to our national \nsecurity.\n  Over the past 30 years, the United States has been able to maintain \nair superiority in every conflict largely due to the F-15C. However, \nwith the great advancements in technology over the past several years, \nthe F-15 has struggled to keep pace. For example, the F-15 is not a \nstealth aircraft and its computer systems are based on obsolete \ntechnology. My colleagues should remember that the F-15 first flew in \nthe early 1970s. During the ensuing years, nations have been \nconsistently developing new aircraft and missile systems to defeat this \nfighter.\n  Realizing that the F-15 would need a replacement, the Air Force \ndeveloped the F-22. The F-22's combination of stealth, supersonic \ncruise, advanced maneuverability, and sensor-fused avionics makes this \naircraft a powerful deterrent to countries contemplating a challenge to \nU.S. interests, and defines the essence of a true fifth generation \nfighter.\n  So far during the current exercise Northern Edge in Alaska, the F-22A \nhas achieved a kill ratio of 144:0. Not one F-22 has been simulated \n``shot down'' while 14 legacy F-15s and F-18s in the exercise have been \nsimulated ``shot down.'' One-hundred-and-forty-four to zero, that is \nthe way American forces should go to war.\n  The F-22 has the greatest stealth capabilities of any aircraft \ncurrently flying or under design. This is a powerful attribute when one \nremembers that it was the F-117 Nighthawk's stealth characteristics \nthat enabled that aircraft to penetrate the integrated air defenses of \nBaghdad during the first night of the 1991 gulf war. The F-22 brings \nstealth capability out of the night, enabling operations in high threat \nareas at the place and time chosen by combatant commanders, 24 hours a \nday seven days a week.\n  The Raptor is also equipped with supercruise engines. These engines \ndo not need to go to after-burner in order to achieve supersonic \nflight. This provides the F-22 with a strategic advantage by enabling \nsupersonic speeds to be maintained for a far greater length of time. By \ncomparison, all other fighters require their engines to go to after-\nburner to achieve supersonic speeds. This consumes a tremendous amount \nof fuel and greatly limits an aircraft's range.\n  The F-22 is also the most maneuverable fighter flying today. This is \nof particular importance when encountering newer Russian-made aircraft \nand surface-to-air missile systems, both of which boast advanced, \nhighly impressive capabilities against our legacy F-15, F-18, and F-16 \naircraft.\n  Yet, a further advantage resides in the F-22's radar and avionics. \nWhen entering hostile airspace, the sensor-fused avionics of the F-22 \ncan detect and engage enemy aircraft and surface threats far before an \nenemy can hope to engage the F-22. At the same time its advanced \nsensors enable the F-22 to be a forward surveillance platform gathering \ncrucial intelligence on the enemy.\n  However, one of the most important capabilities of the Raptor is \noften the most misunderstood. Many critics of the program state that, \nsince much of the design work for this aircraft was performed during \nthe Cold War, it does not meet the requirements of the future.\n  I believe this criticism is misplaced. The F-22 is more than just a \nfighter--it is also a bomber. In its existing configuration it is able \nto carry two 1,000 pound GPS-guided JDAM bombs and will undergo an \nupgrade to carry eight small diameter bombs in the near future. In \n2008, the F-22's radar system will be enhanced with advanced air-to-\nground modes, enabling the Raptor to hunt independently and destroy \ntargets on the ground.\n  All of these capabilities are necessary to fight what is quickly \nemerging as the threat of the future--the anti-access integrated air \ndefense system. Integrated air defenses include both surface-to-air \nmissiles and fighters deployed in such a fashion as to leverage the \nstrengths of both systems. Such a system could pose a very real \npossibility of denying U.S. aircraft access to strategically important \nregions during future conflicts.\n  It should also be noted that--for a comparably cheap price--an \nadversary can purchase the Russian SA-20, surface-to-air missile. This \nsystem has an effective range of approximately 120 nautical miles and \ncan engage targets at greater then 100,000 feet, much higher than the \nservice ceiling of any existing American fighter or bomber. Surface-to-\nair missiles, with similar capabilities, have been sold to Iran. The \nRussians have also developed a family of highly maneuverable fighters, \nthe SU-30 and 35s, which have been sold to such nations as China. Of \nfurther import, 59 other nations have fourth generation fighters.\n  It has also been widely reported in the aviation media that the F-\n15C, our current air superiority fighter, is not as maneuverable as \nnewer Russian aircraft, especially the SU-35. However, the F-22 is \ndesigned to defeat an integrated air defense system. By utilizing its \nstealth capability, the F-22 can penetrate an enemy's airspace \nundetected and, when modified, independently hunt for mobile surface to \nair missile systems. Once detected, the F-22 would then be able to drop \nbombs on those targets. Some correctly state that the B-2 bomber and \nthe F-117 could handle these assignments during night only operations. \nHowever, the F-22 offers the additional capability of being able to \nengage an enemy's air superiority fighters, such as the widely \nproficient SU-35. Therefore, the Raptor will be able to defeat, almost \nsimultaneously, two very different threats, 24 hours a day, that until \nnow have been handled by two different types of aircraft.\n  I should like to point out that these potential threats are not just \nfuture concerns, but they are here today. For example, over the last 2 \nyears, the Air Force has conducted exercises with the Indian Air Force \nas part of our effort to strengthen relations with that nation. The \nIndian Air Force has a number of SU-30 MKKs, an aircraft which is very \nsimilar to a version of aircraft sold in large quantities to the \nPeople's Republic of China. During these exercises, it has been widely \nreported in the aviation and defense media that the Indian Air Force's \nSU-30s won a number of engagements when training against our Air \nForce's F-15s.\n  So let me be clear on this point: a developing nation's air force was \nable to defeat the F-15. This was a stunning event and one that \nrequires our immediate attention.\n  Now that this fact has been established, the question that we must \nask ourselves is: How do we remedy this national security concern? The \nF-22 provides the answer.\n  Though the F-22 may be the solution to these problems, if the Nation \ndoes not purchase a sufficient number of these aircraft our service \nmembers could face unnecessary dangers and risks. Many others and I \nhave come to this conclusion after closely listening to our service \nmembers when they have outlined their equipment requirements based upon \nthe national security goals our Government has outlined. What is their \nprofessional opinion? That if the Air Force is to succeed in the tasks \noutlined in our National Defense Strategy, our airmen and women require \n381 F-22s, far more then the 184 aircraft currently planned.\n  However, another important consideration is cost. In a period of \nrunaway procurement costs, we are not only concerned about the effort \nto procure the correct number of F-22s but to procure them at a \nreasonable price. That\n\n[[Page S6344]]\n\nis exactly what this amendment achieves. It authorizes a multiyear \nprocurement plan for the Raptor, in which 20 aircraft a year over 3 \nyears will be purchased. This will result in the taxpayer saving \napproximately $225 million under the existing plan to purchase 184 \naircraft.\n  Introducing innovative plans to save funds is nothing new to the F-22 \nprogram. In fact, since production first began on this aircraft, the \n``fly-away'' cost has been reduced by 35 percent. However, we must take \nadvantage of any opportunity that will result in additional savings \nwhile increasing our military capabilities. A multiyear F-22 \nprocurement plan achieves that goal.\n  If this amendment is adopted, the Air Force will be permitted to \nenter into a multiyear procurement contract. However, some of our \ncolleagues argue that the F-22 does not meet the six-point requirements \nfor multiyear procurement under existing law. I, on the other hand, \nbelieve these criteria have been met and the amendment before us should \nbe seen as reinforcing that fact.\n  Specifically, the first requirement to authorize a multiyear contract \nunder the existing statute is the determination that substantial \nsavings will result from the contract. The Institute for Defense \nAnalysis estimates that a multiyear contract will result in at least \n$225 million in savings.\n  The second criterion states there must be a ``minimum need'' for the \naircraft. I believe that my address today has shown the urgent need to \ndeploy the Raptor in order to counter the deployment of fourth \ngeneration fighters and new antiaccess systems.\n  As far as a minimum need is concerned, as a result of the Joint Air \nDominance Study the Secretary of Defense stated that a minimum \nrequirement for 183 Raptors existed. Under the administration's \nproposal, which this amendment is based upon, the production rate, \nprocurement rate and the total quantities of the Raptor purchased will \nbe substantially unchanged during the contract period. Remember, the \ncontract calls for the purchase of 20 Raptors a year over the next 3 \nyears.\n  The third requirement insists that the Raptor be a program with \nstable funding. The Armed Services Committee has added additional funds \nfor this year and the Department of Defense's future budgets will also \ncontain funding requests since the purchase of F-22s under a multiyear \nprocurement contract was called for in the Quadrennial Defense Review.\n  Fourth, the aircraft's design must be stable. This is probably the \nmost controversial requirement. Yes, the F-22 has had its problems \nduring the development and production process, but I challenge anyone \nto identify another strike aircraft that hasn't. Remember, the F-22 is \nnow operational. That means the Raptor will deploy in support of our \nservice members and it has satisfactorily completed the engineering and \nmanufacturing development phase as well as its follow-on operational \ntest and evaluation.\n  It is important to note that any upgrades to the Raptor will not \nresult in significant structural changes. Some might argue, correctly, \nthat a potential problem with the forward boom frame heat-treating has \nbeen identified on up to 91 aircraft. It is important to note that this \nwas not an aircraft design problem, but an issue of a manufacturer not \nfollowing the prescribed manufacturing process. In reality, testing has \nso far shown that 92 percent of the suspect frames tested did in fact \nundergo an adequate manufacturing process. I have been advised that \nneither a redesign nor a refit are planned or expected. Regardless, the \nmanufacturer has been replaced and all aircraft procured under a \nmultiyear agreement will not have this problem.\n  Fifth, a program must show that its cost estimates are realistic. The \nAir Force has gone above and beyond the call of duty in providing the \nCongress with independent cost analysis. The Institute for Defense \nAnalysis provided an Independent Cost Estimate in 2005 and with a \nmultiyear procurement business case analysis in May of this year.\n  Finally, the last requirement of a multiyear procurement plan is the \ndetermination that the program is important to the national security of \nthe United States. I believe that we have already established \nconclusively that the Raptor is the answer to the present and future \nthreats posed by antiaccess systems.\n  Therefore, I believe that the Raptor qualifies for a multiyear \nprocurement contract under the existing statute. However, to ensure \nthere is no doubt on this subject, I strongly recommend this amendment \nto my colleagues.\n  Our Nation stands at a crossroads.\n  In a wide variety of policy arenas, the Senate is being asked to make \ninvestments that will reap rewards for our children and our \ngrandchildren.\n  The F-22 is one of these investments. It will guarantee America's \ndominance of the skies for the next half century. All that is required \nis that we make a commitment now to ensure that future. By purchasing \nadequate numbers of F-22 Raptors we are meeting the threats of today \nand tomorrow and we are doing so in such a way as to maximize the \nsavings of the American taxpayer.\n  I thank Senator Chambliss for offering this important amendment, and \nI urge my colleagues to join my fellow cosponsors, Senators Inhofe, \nLieberman, Bingaman, Cornyn, Thune, Bennett, Isakson, Domenici, Baucus, \nDodd, Hutchison, Collins, Ben Nelson, Feinstein and Stevens in \nsupporting this amendment.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \namendment to authorize a multiyear procurement for the F-22 fighter--\namendment No. 4261 I am proud to cosponsor. I thank my friend and \ncolleague, the Senator from Georgia, Mr. Chambliss, for his leadership \nin offering this amendment. I believe he has very ably and \ncomprehensively argued the case for this multiyear and has persuasively \nrebutted the personal arguments against taking this action. But I want \nto add some thoughts about why I think this is a prudent act by this \nbody.\n  The F-22 has had developmental problems and it has had cost \nincreases. But all this is old news. There are few, if any, programs \nthat have had more oversight by the Senate Armed Services Committee \nthan this program. We have examined it in great detail in hearings each \nyear from concept to procurement. We have examined the technology, the \nacquisition plan, the development process, and the production issue. \nAnd we have examined the costs in substantial detail. In some years we \nhave put on cost caps to force spending discipline, and in other years \nwe have slowed down production to align the request with the reality of \nthe backlog. But despite the challenges of building the world's most \ncapable fighter, we have decided, and the full Senate has decided, that \nthis is a critical program that should and must continue. And the U.S. \nAir Force has argued it needs the F-22 to continue.\n  There is a very compelling reason for this decision. Air dominance is \nabsolutely essential to American military dominance and American \nsecurity in the 21st century. Our military has had that dominance since \nWorld War II. If we were ever to lose it, or even allow it to be \nseriously challenged, the global strategic environment would \nfundamentally change for the United States. The F-22 is the way we \nprevent that from happening for the next generation maybe more. Much \nhas been said about the cutting-edge technologies that are included in \nthis airplane that will ensure we maintain that air dominance. I need \nnot repeat that now. But it is the reason that we have voted to \ncontinue procuring the F-22 and it is reason that we will continue to \ndo so.\n  I believe the problems with the F-22 that some of my colleagues have \nreminded us about have been substantially solved. The F-22 business \ncase was validated by DOD during the QDR and the Air Dominance Study. \nThe long debate over the number we will procure is about over. I am \nconvinced that it will not be lower than the 183 validated by the QDR. \nIn fact if there are now to be changes in that number, it will be \nincreased, not decreased. So I believe that we will build the \nadditional 60 contemplated in this amendment. The decision to procure \nthese 60 over 3 years instead of 2 years is sound. We should not have a \nbreak in the production line before we begin building the F-35 the JSF. \nThose 60 aircraft can be built for about $250 million less with the \nmultiyear buy provided for by this amendment.\n  The Senate Armed Services Committee, and the Airland Subcommittee,\n\n[[Page S6345]]\n\nhas spent much time focusing on our acquisition system because we are \nconcerned that the weapons we are buying are taking too long to field \nand are costing too much. We believe the American people should not pay \nmore than they have to. But we also believe our Armed Forces should get \nthe weapons they need to defend our security. SACS have concluded we \nneed this fighter. We recommended full funding this year for 20. I \nbelieve we will do that next year and the year after that until we have \nprocured 183 F-22 fighters. Authorizing a multiyear will cost the \nAmerican people $250 million less than if we authorize these fighters \nyear by year. That is good acquisition policy. Our Armed Force needs \nthis fighter, and we should not pay $250 million more to get it than we \nhave to. That is why I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Mr. President, if the Senator from Arizona will yield 1 \nminute?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized for 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want to put in the Record a chart from \nthe Institute for Defense Analysis.

Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMinnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4241\n\n  Mr. President, I am a proud cosponsor of Senator McCain's proposal to \nname this legislation after the great chairman of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, Senator Warner.\n  I have had the privilege during my term in the Senate to serve on the \nArmed Services Committee under two tremendous chairmen, outstanding \nSenators, and terrific human beings--John Warner and Carl Levin.\n  Our Senate, our military, and our country have been fortunate to have \ntheir extraordinary leadership during these critical years.\n  Chairman Warner, for whom this legislation would be named, is more \nthan deserving of that honor. He is greatly respected by our committee \nmembers on both sides of the aisle and, indeed, by the entire Senate. \nHe has been unfailingly fair to all points of view, while leading us \nwith a firm hand and resolute gaze, that he learned during his own \nmilitary service and as Secretary of the Navy.\n  When he picks up his committee gavel, all of us--members, staff, \nmilitary officers, and other interested parties--all know we have a \nleader well prepared in all respects for that enormous responsibility.\n  Our Senate and our Nation are indebted to Senator Warner and to \nSenator Levin for their superb public service.\n  Mr. President, I have listened to many of my colleagues express their \nviews on Iraq during the past week and have waited for this opportunity \nto express my own.\n  My colleagues reflect sincere differences and I believe sincere \ndesires to uphold the best interests of our great country in a very \ndifficult and complicated situation. We are all patriotic Americans \nfirst and foremost and partisan politicians later.\n  I voted against the Iraq war resolution in October 2002, despite \nbeing presented with incorrect and misleading information by very high \nofficials in the Bush administration, which purported to prove that \nSaddam Hussein was developing nuclear weapons. I questioned the \nveracity of that information. And I had grave concerns that an \nunwarranted invasion of Iraq, if no weapons of mass destruction were \nfound, would ultimately weaken, not strengthen, the national security \nof the United States by seriously damaging our standing and our \nalliances throughout the world.\n  I also voted against the Iraq war resolution because I believed that \nsuch a decision by the Congress at that time was premature. President \nBush was not asking Congress for a declaration of war, as the U.S. \nConstitution requires. He was asking for a congressional resolution \nauthorizing him to declare war, if he determined it necessary at some \nlater date. I do not fault the President for asking for that blank \ncheck. I fault the Congress for giving it to him. In fact, it was over \n6 months later that the President made his final decision to commence \nmilitary action against Iraq.\n  In a similar vein, I believe that both the Levin-Reed amendment and \nthe Kerry-Feingold amendment were premature. One called for the \nredeployment of U.S. troops from Iraq to begin within 6 months. The \nother required the almost complete withdrawal of those troops within a \nyear.\n  I believe it is impossible to foresee at this time whether either of \nthose actions would be in the best national security and foreign policy \ninterests of the United States 6 months or 1 year from now. The \nsituation in Iraq is too uncertain and too unpredictable to do so. That \nuncertainty and unpredictability evidence the failures of the Bush \nadministration's conduct of this war effort.\n  It is now over 3 years since the U.S. military swept from the Iraqi \nborder to Baghdad in only 3 weeks, overthrew Saddam Hussein and his \nevil regime, and liberated the Iraqi people. Yet after that swift and \ndecisive military victory was won, the Bush administration has failed \nto secure it.\n  Administration officials ignored the advice of their own top military \ncommanders--and this is an important lesson for us--and failed to \ncommit\n\n[[Page S6346]]\n\nenough U.S. troops to secure the country. Other mistakes followed, \nleaving security and political vacuums that were filled by foreign \nterrorists and domestic insurgents.\n  During the past 3 years, violence in Iraq has steadily increased and \nstill threatens to rip the country apart. Like it or not, our \ncourageous troops remain the only effective protections of the Iraqi \npeople from civil war or anarchy and a lawless bloodbath.\n  Unfortunately, the bad conditions in Iraq today can become even \nworse--much worse--if our troops begin or complete their withdrawals \nbefore Iraqi forces are able to take their place. That training and \nequipping of Iraqi replacements should have been completed already, but \nit is not. I do not know what that timetable is. I am skeptical that \nanyone else in this body does. The Bush administration should tell us, \nbut they will not, which means they still do not know either.\n  So it seems to me necessary not to decide and certainly not to act \nuntil we have that information. It is imperative not to make future \nmistakes that will compound the previous mistakes. And we certainly \nshould not decide or act until we have listened to the current views of \nthe top U.S. military commanders, who are responsible for successfully \ncompleting our mission in Iraq and for protecting the lives and safety \nof the 133,000 heroic Americans who are stationed there now.\n  I serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee, and yet I have not \nheard those top military views recently expressed.\n  I respectfully ask the distinguished chairman of our committee to \narrange for us to hear them as soon as possible. I read a news report 2 \ndays ago that General Casey, the senior American commander in Iraq, \nwill brief the Secretary of Defense later this week on his newest \nthinking about U.S. force levels through the end of the year. I want to \nhear General Casey's recommendation myself and his reasons for it \nbefore I am prepared to vote on any proposal affecting U.S. troop \nlevels. I want to give our military commanders in Iraq and our American \ntroops in Iraq what they need to succeed now, 6 months from now, a year \nfrom now.\n  Like most Americans, I wish this war were over. I wish it hadn't \nbegun. But we are in it; we must win it. We cannot leave Iraq until the \nIraqi Government has established political control over its country and \nuntil the Iraqi security forces can protect their citizens. We cannot \nleave what we started to end in a lawless bloodbath.\n  We must rely on our senior military commanders to tell us what force \nstrength they need to successfully complete their mission. The \ntimetable we follow should be theirs, not ours. It should be based upon \nAmerican security and Iraqi survival. Again, I respectfully urge \nChairman Warner to summon our top military commanders to tell us what \nthey need and for how long. I don't want any more incidents where \nAmerican soldiers are captured, brutally tortured, and murdered because \nthere were not enough of their fellow American soldiers there to defend \nthem.\n  I agree with my colleagues about the urgent need for the new Iraqi \nGovernment to accelerate their assumption of complete responsibility \nfor their country's services, security, and success. They need to tell \nus their expected schedule for doing so. We need to assist them in that \nprocess, and we need to enlist other nations to help them as well. We \nmust complete our mission in Iraq as soon as possible, but we must \ncomplete it with a lasting victory, and we cannot leave until that \nvictory is secure.\n  We should be discussing what we can do to hasten that day. The Bush \nadministration should be telling us what we need to do to hasten that \nday, how to accelerate the transfer of responsibilities to Iraqis, how \nto accelerate the social and economic reconstruction of Iraq, how to \nenrich the lives of Iraqi citizens rather than the livelihoods of \nAmerican contractors. Instead, all we get are cheap spin-and-thin \nslogans rather than substantive proposals and sophisticated solutions. \nThe administration needs to set forth a plan of action in Iraq, a \nroadmap to final victory. That is what we should be demanding. That is \nwhat we should be debating.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Minnesota. He \nwill be departing our committee this fall, as he departs the Senate. I \nappreciate the work he has contributed to our committee throughout the \nyear.\n  It is time for my distinguished colleague from Michigan, ranking \nmember, and I to offer a package of amendments.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. While he was making reference to the Senator from \nMinnesota, I think the chairman was off the floor when the Senator from \nMinnesota, Mr. Dayton, made some very glowingly positive and \naffirmative remarks about our chairman and about how he was really \ndelighted to be able to cosponsor the amendment which had been \nintroduced to name this bill after our beloved chairman. I wanted to \nmake sure that he was aware of that and could look up those remarks \nlater.\n  Mr. WARNER. I was absent from the floor. I express my humble \nappreciation to my colleague from Minnesota. I recall that he \naccompanied Senator Levin and me to Iraq one time. That was when I \nfirst became aware of the knowledge that he had on world affairs and \nother subjects. He has contributed to the greater good of the Committee \non Armed Services. I thank him for his service. But there is more time; \nhe has a little bit left to go.\n\n\n  Amendments Nos. 4492; 4493; 4494; 4266, as Modified; 4495; 4307, as \nModified; 4326, as Modified; 4224; 4496; 4309, as Modified; 4345; 4368; \n    4497; 4222; 4498; 4499; 4202, as Modified; 4500; 4441; 4231, as \n Modified; 4409; 4501; 4502; 4503; 4504; 4505; 4506; 4331; 4507; 4508; \n4509; 4510; 4219; 4386; 4511; 4197; 4512; 4513; 4514; 4515; 4342; 4365; \n    4241; 4220, as Modified; 4371; 4244; 4516; 4466; 4517; 4363, as \n  Modified; 4450, as Modified; 4362, as Modified; 4275, as Modified; \n   4475, as Modified; 4276, as Modified; 4469, as Modified; 4477, as \n                Modified; 4518; 4214; and 4519, En Bloc\n\n  At this time I send a series of amendments to the desk.

This support is largely \n     responsible for the decline in cocaine shipments to the \n     United States through the Bahamas.\n       (5) The Bahamas is an island nation composed of \n     approximately 700 islands and keys, which makes aviation \n     assets the best and most efficient method of transporting law \n     enforcement agents and interdicting smugglers.\n       (6) It is in the interests of the United States to maintain \n     the results of the successful Operation Bahamas, Turks & \n     Caicos program and prevent drug smugglers from rebuilding \n     their operations through the Bahamas.\n       (b) Report on United States Government Support for OPBAT.--\n       (1) Report on decision to withdraw.--Not later than 30 days \n     before implementing a decision to withdraw Department of \n     Defense helicopters from Operation Bahamas, Turks & Caicos, \n     the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the Congress a \n     report outlining the plan for the coordination of the \n     Operation Bahamas, Turks & Caicos mission, at the same level \n     of effectiveness, using other United States Government \n     assets.\n       (2) Consultation.--The Secretary of Defense shall consult \n     with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security, and with other appropriate \n     officials of the United States Government, in preparing the \n     report under paragraph (1).\n       (3) Elements.--The report under paragraph (1) on the \n     withdrawal of equipment referred to in that paragraph shall \n     include the following:\n       (A) An explanation of the military justification for the \n     withdrawal of the equipment.\n       (B) An assessment of the availability of other options \n     (including other Government helicopters) to provide the \n     capability being provided by the equipment to be withdrawn.\n       (C) An explanation of how each option specified under \n     subparagraph (B) will provide the capability currently \n     provided by the equipment to be withdrawn.\n       (D) An assessment of the potential use of unmanned aerial \n     vehicles in Operation Bahamas, Turks & Caicos, including the \n     capabilities of such vehicles and any advantages or \n     disadvantages associated with the use of such vehicles in \n     that operation, and a recommendation on whether or not to \n     deploy such vehicles in that operation.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 4497\n\n (Purpose: To provide for an independent review and assessment of the \n organization and management of the Department of Defense for national \n                           security in space)\n\n       At the end of subtitle B of title IX, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 913.

SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``John \n     Warner National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n     2007''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Senator John Warner of Virginia was elected a member of \n     the United States Senate on November 7, 1978, for a full term \n     beginning on January 3, 1979. He was subsequently appointed \n     by the Governor of Virginia to fill a vacancy on January 2, \n     1979, and has served continuously since that date. He was \n     appointed a member of the Committee on Armed Services in \n     January 1979, and has served continuously on the Committee \n     since that date, a period of nearly 28 years. Senator \n     Warner's service on the Committee represents nearly half of \n     its existence since it was established after World War II.\n       (2) Senator Warner came to the Senate and the Committee on \n     Armed Services after a distinguished record of service to the \n     Nation, including combat service in the Armed Forces and high \n     civilian office.\n       (3) Senator Warner enlisted in the United States Navy upon \n     graduation from high school in 1945, and served until the \n     summer of 1946, when he was discharged as a Petty Officer 3rd \n     Class. He then attended Washington and Lee University on the \n     G.I. Bill. He graduated in 1949 and entered the University of \n     Virginia Law School.\n       (4) Upon the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950, Senator \n     Warner volunteered for active duty, interrupting his \n     education to accept a commission in the United States Marine \n     Corps. He served in combat in Korea as a ground officer in \n     the First Marine Air Wing. Following his active service, he \n     remained in the Marine Corps Reserve for several years, \n     attaining the rank of captain.\n       (5) Senator Warner resumed his legal education upon \n     returning from the Korean War and graduated from the \n     University of Virginia Law School in 1953. He was selected by \n     the late Chief Judge E. Barrett Prettyman of the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit \n     as his law clerk. After his service to Judge Prettyman, \n     Senator Warner became an Assistant United States Attorney in \n     the District of Columbia, and later entered private law \n     practice.\n       (6) In 1969, the Senate gave its advice and consent to the \n     appointment of Senator Warner as Under Secretary of the Navy. \n     He served in this position until 1972, when he was confirmed \n     and appointed as the 61st Secretary of the Navy since the \n     office was established in 1798. As Secretary, Senator Warner \n     was the principal United States negotiator and signatory of \n     the Incidents at Sea Executive Agreement with the Soviet \n     Union, which was signed in 1972 and remains in effect today. \n     It has served as the model for similar agreements between \n     states covering the operation of naval ships and aircraft in \n     international sea lanes throughout the world.\n       (7) Senator Warner left the Department of the Navy in 1974. \n     His next public service was as Director of the American \n     Revolution Bicentennial Commission. In this capacity, he \n     coordinated the celebration of the Nation's founding, \n     directing the Federal role in all 50 States and in over 20 \n     foreign nations.\n       (8) Senator Warner has served as chairman of the Committee \n     on Armed Services of the United States Senate from 1999 to \n     2001, and again since January 2003. He served as ranking \n     minority member of the committee from 1987 to 1993, and again \n     from 2001 to 2003. Senator Warner concludes his service as \n     chairman at the end of the 109th Congress, but will remain a \n     member of the committee.\n       (9) This Act is the twenty-eighth annual authorization act \n     for the Department of Defense for which Senator Warner has \n     taken a major responsibility as a member of the Committee on \n     Armed Services of the United States Senate, and the \n     fourteenth for which he has exercised a leadership role as \n     chairman or ranking minority member of the committee.\n       (10) Senator Warner, as seaman, Marine officer, Under \n     Secretary and Secretary of the Navy, and member, ranking \n     minority member, and chairman of the Committee on Armed \n     Services, has made unique and lasting contributions to the \n     national security of the United States.\n       (11) It is altogether fitting and proper that his Act, the \n     last annual authorization Act for the national defense that \n     Senator Warner manages in and for the United States Senate as \n     chairman of the Committee on Armed Services, be named in his \n     honor, as provided in subsection (a).\n\n\n                    AMENDMENT NO. 4220, as modified\n\n       At the end of subtitle D of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 352.

Mr. President, I rise today along with my colleague Mrs. \nLincoln to discuss an amendment accepted today by the distinguished \nchairman Mr. Warner, and ranking member, Mr. Levin.\n  I appreciate their willingness to advance this very important \nlegislation. Our policy must reflect our Nation's care and appreciation \nfor our veterans, and I will continue to work towards obtaining full \nconcurrent receipt. I have said it before, but I will say it again.\n  It is unacceptable that the men and women who dedicated their entire \ncareers to service in the military must surrender a portion of their \nretired pay if they want to receive the disability compensation.\n  It is acceptable, but today, because of the policy of concurrent \nreceipt, it is the law for veterans classified as unemployable.\n  Throughout my time in the Senate, I have championed legislation that \nwould end the unfair policy of denying America's disabled veteran's \nretirement benefits they have earned through years of service and \nsacrifice.\n  In 2004, I introduced legislation that was passed into helping those \nveterans who were 100 percent disabled to receive full concurrent \nreceipt immediately. By eliminating the 10-year phasein period, the \npassage of this legislation was a significant victory for those who \nhave fought for our freedom.\n  But, I never imagined that the administration would intentionally \nchange the intent, interpret the law, and shamelessly deny unemployable \nveterans, no matter what their disability rating, retirement pay and \ndisability compensation.\n  What kind of message does this send to our men and women in the \nmilitary today?\n  We have thousands of new American veterans from the Iraq and \nAfghanistan wars. These men and women serve in the most inhospitable \nreaches of the world, defending our freedoms and fighting for the cause \nof liberty.\n  Most of these young American Veterans don't realize that if they are \ninjured or wounded to the point were that can no longer work, will have \nto choose between their retired pay and their disability compensation. \nAs of today, they will not receive both until 2009.\n  This is unfair.\n  Military retired pay is earned compensation for the extraordinary \ndemands and sacrifices inherent in a military career. It is a reward \npromised for serving two decades or more under conditions that most \nAmericans find intolerable.\n  For several years I have introduced and championed legislation that \nwould end the unfair policy of denying America's disabled veterans' \nretirement benefits they have earned through years of service and \nsacrifice.\n  In November 2005, an amendment was passed to expand concurrent \nreceipt to cover America's disabled veterans rated as ``unemployable,'' \nand to implement the new policy immediately instead of phasing it in \nover a decade. However, I was disappointed that the conference \ncommittee chose not to enact this valuable legislation until 2009.\n  Therefore, I introduced this amendment to restore their full benefits \nas originally intended in the legislation I introduced in 2004.\n  Veterans' disability compensation is recompense for pain, suffering, \nand lost future earning power caused by a service-connected illness or \ninjury. Few retirees can afford to live on their retired pay alone, and \na severe disability only makes the problem worse by limiting or denying \nany post-service working life.\n  Mr. President, an ``unemployable'' retiree should not have to forfeit \npart or all of his or her earned retired pay as a result of having \nsuffered a service-connected disability.\n  At a time when our Nation is calling upon our Armed Forces to defend \ndemocracy and freedom, we must be careful not to send the wrong signal \nto those in uniform.\n  All who have selected to make their career in the U.S. military now \nface an additional unknown risk in our fight against terrorism. If they \nare injured, they would be forced to forego their earned retired pay in \norder to receive their VA disability compensation. In effect, they \nwould be paying for their own disability benefits from their retirement \nchecks unless my legislation is enacted.\n  This will send a signal to these brave men and women that the \nAmerican people and government take care of those who make sacrifices \nfor our nation. It is time for us to show our appreciation to the men \nand women who have demonstrated their allegiance to their country and \nthe principles it stands for.\n  I, again, thank Senator Warner and Senator Levin for their assistance \nin including this provision in the fiscal year 2007 Defense \nauthorization bill.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 4494\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss my concerns about \nthe amendment offered by my good colleague Senator Burns, regarding \nelectronic voting technology to S. 2766, the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007.\n  I understand that this amendment directs the Department of Defense, \nDOD, to continue the interim voting assistance system, IVAS, for \nuniformed service voters, overseas Defense Department employees, and \ndependents of such voters and employees, for all Federal elections \nthrough December 31, 2006. The amendment would not, as I understand it, \nextend the current program to nonmilitary overseas voters. Further, I \nunderstand that the amendment directs the DOD to submit two reports to \nCongress, one assessing the IVAS program during the 2006 Federal \nelections and the second detailing plans for an expansion of the IVAS \nprogram to all voters covered under the Uniform Overseas Citizens \nAbsentee Voting Act, UOCAVA, through November 2010.\n  I commend my colleague from Montana for his efforts to protect the \nfundamental right to vote and for extending a critical program that \nfacilitates electronic ballot access for our valiant overseas service \nmen and women, their colleagues and families. I strongly support the \ngoals of this legislation.\n  However, I am deeply concerned that the amendment as drafted \ncontinues to\n\n[[Page S6360]]\n\nwithhold the benefits of new technology from millions of other \nnonmilitary overseas voters in a manner that is inconsistent with the \npurposes of UOCAVA. According to the language of this amendment, only \nthose with an existing affiliation to DOD will continue to benefit from \nthe IVAS program in contrast to the broader group of citizens covered \nby UOCAVA, including overseas voters who are not members of the \nmilitary, employees of the Defense Department or a dependent of either \ngroup.\n  As my colleague know, UOCAVA treats all overseas voters--military, \ncivilian or otherwise--equally with respect to voting rights. Classes \nof voters under UOCAVA are not bifurcated. This approach ensures that \nthe all voters are treated in a nondiscriminatory manner under UOCAVA.\n  The number of overseas voters continues to make a difference in our \nFederal elections. The Federal Voting Assistance Program, FVAP, under \nthe Secretary of Defense estimates that over 3 percent of the total \nvote in the 1996, 2000, and 2004 elections came from abroad. In \naddition, an umbrella coalition focused on military and overseas voters \nestimates that the number of Americans residing overseas have ranged \nfrom 3 million to 6 million, but generally put the global population \nsomewhere around 4 million. The coalition's member organizations \ninclude the Federation of American Women's Clubs Overseas Inc, FAWCO, \nthe American Citizens Abroad, ACA, the Alliance of American \nOrganizations-Spain and Portugal, ALLAMO and the Association of \nAmericans Resident Overseas, AARO. Overseas voters are important \nAmericans who, under the goals of UOCAVA, must have the same \nopportunity to cast a vote and have that vote counted as their military \ncounterparts.\n  There is nothing more fundamental to the vitality and endurance of a \ndemocracy of the people, by the people and for the people, than the \npeople's right to vote. Thomas Paine wrote in 1795 that, ``the right of \nvoting for representatives is the primary right by which other rights \nare protected.'' This statement takes on an even more significant \nmeaning to Americans when America is at war.\n  As a former Peace Corps volunteer, I can offer testimony to the \nmeaningful contributions made by overseas citizens who are not included \nin the covered classes under the amendment of my colleague from \nMontana. At a time when the image of the United States is receiving \ninternational scrutiny, the work of individuals such as Peace Corps \nvolunteers is critical. The work of all our overseas citizens, whether \nthey serve in the military to protect us back at home or whether they \nconduct businesses and raise their families overseas, must be honored \nwith an absolute equal opportunity to vote in Federal elections.\n  We should not take any actions to discourage our civilian overseas \nvoters. We should not treat civilian overseas voters any differently \nthan overseas military or DOD contract voters, and certainly not by \nerecting an artificial bifurcation barrier between military and \ncivilian votes under UOCAVA.\n  I appreciate the fact that this amendment recognizes the need to \neliminate that bifurcation by requiring DOD to report specifically on \nexpanding the use of electronic voting technology for all voters under \nUOCAVA. I look forward to that report and will continue to work to \nensure that all American citizens living overseas have an equal \nopportunity to participate in our democracy through the ballot box.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 4241\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  This amendment would name the National Defense Authorization Act for \nFiscal Year 2007 after the chairman of the Committee on Armed Services, \nour distinguished friend and colleague from Virginia, John Warner. I am \npleased to be joined in this effort by Senators Frist, Levin, Inhofe, \nKennedy, Roberts, Byrd, Sessions, Lieberman, Collins, Jack Reed, \nEnsign, Akaka, Talent, Bill Nelson, Chambliss, Ben Nelson, Graham, \nDayton, Dole, Bayh, Cornyn, Clinton, Thune, Allard, and Allen.\n  I am certain that there is not a Senator in this Chamber who would \nnot agree that Senator Warner, with his grace, courtliness, bipartisan \nattitude: and kindness to all, represents the finest traditions of the \nSenate. All Senators know that the Defense Authorization bill occupies \na major place in the annual legislative calendar and takes substantial \ntime to complete. Those Senators who do not have the privilege of \nserving on the Committee on Armed Services may not realize the \ntremendous amount of work that goes into hearings, formulation of \nlegislative proposals, preparation for markup, and actual markup of \nthis bill--the largest annually recurring piece of legislation in \nCongress. When one adds to this the oversight of the largest department \nin the government, and the processing of thousands of military and \ncivilian nominations each year, the demands on the chairman of the \ncommittee and the need for leadership are obvious. For 6 years, John \nWarner has provided that leadership, and done it in a manner that has \ngained him universal respect.\n  John Warner is, first and foremost, a Virginian--a native of that Old \nDominion that has stood at the center of American history for over two \ncenturies and has given the Nation so many of its eminent men, from \nWashington forward. John Warner has continued that tradition of service \nto country from his youth. The son of a decorated Army physician in \nWorld War I, John Warner left high school to enlist in the Navy late in \nWorld War II. He served until 1946, when he was discharged as a petty \nofficer 3rd class. Like millions of other young Americans, he then \nattended college on the GI bill, graduating from Washington and Lee \nUniversity in 1949. He then entered the University of Virginia Law \nSchool. He interrupted his education to serve in the Korean war, \nvolunteering for active duty and accepting a commission in the Marine \nCorps. He served in combat as a ground officer in the First Marine Air \nWing, and remained in the Marine Corps Reserve for several years. Upon \nreturning from the Korean war, he resumed his legal education, \ngraduating from the University of Virginia Law School in 1953.\n  Upon graduation, John Warner's outstanding qualities were recognized \nwhen he was selected to serve as the law clerk to the late Judge E. \nBarrett Prettyman of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia Circuit, one of the most outstanding jurists of the period. \nMany years later, Senator Warner would be instrumental in naming the \nU.S. Court House in Washington, DC, for his old mentor. After his \nclerkship, John Warner became an assistant U.S. attorney in the \nDistrict of Columbia, and later was engaged in the private practice of \nlaw.\n\n  In 1969, President Nixon nominated John Warner to serve as Under \nSecretary of the Navy. The Senate confirmed the nomination, and he \nserved as Under Secretary until he was confirmed and appointed as the \n61st Secretary of the Navy in 1972. During his tenure as Secretary, the \nUnited States and the Soviet Union signed the Incidents at Sea \nExecutive Agreement, for which he was the principal United States \nnegotiator and signatory. This agreement remains in effect today and \nhas served as a model for similar agreements governing naval vessels \nand aircraft around the world.\n  After leaving the Department of the Navy in 1974, John Warner's next \npublic service was as chairman of the American Revolution Bicentennial \nCommission. He oversaw the celebration of the Nation's founding, \ndirecting the Federal Government's role in a commemoration that \nembraced all 50 States and over 20 foreign nations.\n  In 1978, the voters of Virginia elected John Warner to a full term in \nthe U.S. Senate. Upon beginning his service in 1979, he was elected a \nmember of the Committee on Armed Services. Upon leaving the \nchairmanship next year, he will have served on the committee for 28 \nyears, almost half of the committee's existence. Senator Warner served \nas chairman of the committee from 1999 to 2001, and again since 2003. \nHe also served as ranking member from 1987 to 1993, and again from 2001 \nto 2003. For 14 years of American history, years that saw the end of \nthe Cold War, the first gulf war, the attacks on September 11, 2001, \nand the global war on terror, John Warner has served in a leadership \nrole on the committee.\n  No Member of this body has done more for our national security than \nJohn Warner. As sailor, Marine officer, Under Secretary, and Secretary \nof\n\n[[Page S6361]]\n\nthe Navy, and U.S. Senator, he has always answered his country's call. \nThe dignified and evenhanded way in which he has presided over the \nbusiness of the committee has enabled it to continue its noble \ntradition of being an island of bipartisanship in an increasingly \nunpleasant political era. I submit, Mr. President, that it is \nexceedingly appropriate that this year's Defense Authorization Act, the \nlast which John Warner will manage as chairman of the Committee on \nArmed Services, be named in his honor.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 4244\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to thank my colleagues for accepting \nan amendment that I introduced on behalf of myself, Senator Bingaman, \nand Senator Carper to fully protect the health of our military \npersonnel. The majority of this amendment is the same language the \nSenate included in last year's Defense Authorization bill clearly \nestablishing the Vaccine Healthcare Centers, or VHCs, role in force \nprotection and treatment. That language was not retained in conference. \nInstead, a GAO report was mandated. While the GAO report will be \nhelpful in refining the organization and missions of the VHCs, it is \nimportant to clearly establish their role today.\n  The GAO report will not be completed until next year. In addition to \nthe language the Senate passed last year, this amendment includes one \nadditional area for GAO to investigate and a requirement that the \nDepartment of Defense examine and plan for its future vaccination \nneeds. Both necessary steps to determining the optimal structure for \nthe centers.\n  I should also point out to my colleagues that this amendment does not \nadd any funding to the bill. The centers are currently being funded at \n$6 million a year with global war on terror funds. This amendment does \nnot change that.\n  Let me explain more thoroughly what the vaccine health care centers \ndo. As our military operates around the globe, they are protected from \ncommon illnesses like the flu and from common travel concerns, like \nyellow fever for sub-Saharan Africa, by vaccinations. In addition, they \nare vaccinated to protect them from biological warfare agents like \nanthrax or smallpox.\n  These force protection measures are critically important, but they \nonly work if military personnel are confident that the vaccines \nthemselves are not dangerous or that the side-effects can be treated.\n  Vaccines, even those generally considered safe, are still drugs put \ninto the body. For that reason, there are always a small number of \npersonnel whose bodies will have an adverse reaction to a ``safe'' \nvaccine. In order to deal with this, the Vaccine Healthcare Centers \nNetwork was established in 2001.\n  The centers act as a specialized medical unit and center of \nexcellence that can provide the best possible clinical care to any \nmilitary member, Active-Duty, Guard, or Reserve, or their family that \nhas a severe reaction. They also advise the Department of Defense \nregarding vaccine administration policies and educate military health \ncare professionals regarding the safest and best practices for vaccine \nadministration. Their overall mission is to promote vaccine safety and \nprovide expert knowledge to patients and physicians.\n  Why is this so important? As many of you know, the number of adults \nwho get regular vaccines is fairly small. While we have civilian \nspecialists who deal with childhood vaccinations and problems that \nmight develop, the population of adults regularly vaccinated with \nanything more than the flu vaccine is small. No civilian expertise \nexists in this area because the cases are rare and infrequent.\n  In the military, the reverse is true. Military personnel are \nregularly vaccinated for travel, for threats relating to their theater \nof operation, and for things like the flu. Even in the military, \nthough, the cases are rare and spread throughout the force. It is \ndifficult for the average base physician to develop the expertise \nneeded to recognize the problem and to provide the best treatment. In \norder to effectively develop proper treatments, there must be a \ncentralized center to capture the information on those who experience \nsevere problems.\n  Here are some specifics:\n  Last year, 2005, the VHCs managed over 700 cases of adverse reactions \nto mandatory vaccines.\n  Each military service made use of the help and care offered by the \nVHCs--48 percent of their cases were in the Army, 29.6 percent of their \ncases were in the Air Force, 13 percent of their cases were in the Navy \nand Marine Corps, and 2.4 percent of their cases were in the Coast \nGuard.\n  Since being founded, as part of their ongoing educational effort, the \nVHCs have developed and distributed over 50,000 immunization took kits \nto improve vaccinations throughout DOD.\n  The VHCs are leading the effort to properly characterize and develop \ntreatments for serious reactions to the smallpox vaccine and the \nanthrax vaccine. In many cases, they collaborate with outside \nresearchers and analysts by providing the large sample population \nneeded to develop case definitions and clinical guidelines.\n  Since beginning their work in 2001, the VHCs have handled a total of \n2,049 cases. Their yearly case load has gone up 83 percent since 2001.\n  The over 2,000 cases treated demonstrates clearly the need for \npostvaccination treatment expertise. In all of these cases, base or \npost doctors did not have the expertise to adequately treat sick \npersonnel. Given that these are mandatory vaccinations, we have an \nabsolute moral obligation to make sure that those made sick by them get \nthe best possible treatment. Much as the military developed a unique \nexpertise in treating those exposed to nuclear radiation, in this new \nera of proliferating biological threats we must now develop an \nexpertise in postvaccination treatments.\n  This has all been done by an extremely small staff--only one full-\ntime doctor, three nurse practitioners, and five educators and support \nstaff at each of the four regional facilities. The value and medical \nservices they have provided to the entire military family--Army, Navy, \nAir Force, Marines, and Coast Guard--has been extraordinary.\n  Make no mistake, military personnel and their dependents are more \nconfident in the vaccination programs because of the VHCs. When \npersonnel do suffer adverse reactions, reports are extremely positive \nregarding the care they now get from the centers and we do not see \nindividual cases becoming national news and fear spreading throughout \nthe force.\n  Why do we need the language I am proposing? The reason is simple. \nDespite the May 9, 2006, testimony from the Deputy Assistant Secretary \nof Defense for Force Health Protection and Readiness to the House \nCommittee on Government Reform touting the centers as DOD's answer to \nadverse anthrax vaccine reactions, the centers are still not clearly \nestablished in law and face regular funding battles.\n  The VHCs were created in minimally worded report language from the \nfiscal year 2001 Labor-HHS Appropriations conference report. It is time \nto recognize their role and varied responsibilities with a proper \nauthorization.\n  In addition, it is time to make sure they have clear and regular \nfunding. For the past 5 years, the VHCs have been funded by the Army \nalone, primarily with global war on terror funds. I applaud the Army \nfor recognizing the need for the centers and providing those funds from \ntheir wartime allocation. But, I am concerned that this is not \nsustainable and it is not what Congress intended. The Army is only the \nexecutive agent for what is supposed to be a defense-wide service. Even \nthough almost half, 45 percent, of those treated by the VHC came from \nthe Air Force, Navy and Marines, and Coast Guard, none of those \nservices is willing to provide their fair share of the yearly $6 \nmillion bill. The Army cannot sustain this and the people that would \nlose are injured military personnel from the other services who will \nnot be able to access expert care.\n\n  In recent years, the decision by the other services not to provide a \nportion of the funding for the centers has led to proposals to \neliminate some of their operations. If all or part of the VHC network \nis dismantled, the technical expertise built up over the past 5 years \nwill be dispersed. It will be almost impossible to reconstitute that \nhighly specialized knowledge when we need it in the future. We cannot \njust hope that the 708 personnel who sought treatment last year will \njust get better on their own.\n\n[[Page S6362]]\n\n  This amendment seeks to clarify that the vaccine health care centers \nmust exist, while also mandating a thorough review of their \norganization and functions. Next year, when we have the GAO study and \nthe Pentagon's study, Congress can act on any worthwhile \nrecommendations. In the meantime, we cannot leave this vital force \nprotection and treatment center in limbo, nor can we leave the entire \nburden on the Army.\n  As biological threats grow from both naturally occurring diseases \nlike bird flu to weaponized agents like anthrax, force protection \nclearly demands a good vaccination program. Equally clearly, that \nprogram must include quality care for those who suffer adverse events \nin every service, not just the Army.\n  As we look to the future, the need for vaccinations is only likely to \ngrow. For that very reason, we established Project BioShield. At this \npoint, there is no civilian equivalent to the vaccine health care \ncenters network, but there is an initial collaborative effort between \nthe VHCs and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This \ncollaboration must be encouraged so that we can take advantage of the \nVHCs knowledge should a mass civilian inoculation become necessary. If \nthe VHCs are dismantled, that knowledge will be lost and may not be \neasily recovered or recreated.\n  At the end of the day, this is very simple. We simply cannot mandate \nthat military personnel take these vaccines and then abandon them when \na problem arises. There should be no ambiguity about the authority for \nthe vaccine health care centers to continue their excellent work.\n  If military personnel are injured because of their service to this \nNation, whether it be needing a prosthetic limb or long-term treatment \nfor an adverse vaccine reaction, we have an absolute obligation to give \nthem the best possible care.\n  Anything less is unconscionable.\n  For that reason, I am thankful that my colleagues have agreed and \nthat this vital amendment has passed the Senate.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 4466\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to \ndiscuss an amendment that I understand Mr. Warner and Mr. Levin have \nincluded in the managers' package.\n  I would like to begin by thanking Senators Warner and Levin and their \nstaffs for working so hard with us to get this done. I would also like \nto thank my colleague Senator Lieberman for working diligently with me \nto draft this legislation.\n  He really is a true champion for our men and women in uniform.\n  This amendment addresses an issue that is vitally important to many \nof my colleagues here in the Senate--improving mental health screening \nand services for our brave men and women serving in our armed services.\n  As we all know, our soldiers, marines, airmen, and sailors have been \nbogged down in an extremely dangerous and increasingly destructive war \nin Iraq for more than 3 years, and the pressure is taking its toll.\n  Multiple deployments, the insurgency, and the unprecedented urban \ncombat that many of our service members face is resulting in high \nlevels of mental illness, including PTSD--a disorder that, if left \nuntreated, can cripple a person for life.\n  Tragically, many of our service members are not being adequately \nscreened and treated for these conditions.\n  Let me give you an example from last month's Hartford Courant, which \nran an extended series of articles detailing the failures of our \nmilitary health care system.\n  Nine months ago, 27-year-old SSG Bryce Syverson was on suicide watch \nand taking antidepressants in the psychiatric unit at Walter Reed Army \nMedical Center. Doctors had diagnosed him with PTSD and depression, \nwhich they attributed to his 15-month tour in Iraq as a gunner on a \nBradley tank.\n  Today, Staff Sergeant Syverson is back in the combat zone as part of \na quick reaction force in Kuwait that could be summoned to Iraq at any \ntime.\n  He got his deployment orders after being told he wasn't fit for duty.\n  He got his gun back after being told he was too unstable to carry a \nweapon.\n  In a recent e-mai1 to his parents and brothers, Sergeant Syverson \nwrote: ``Nearly died on a PT test out here on a nice and really mild \nnight because of the medication that I am taking. Head about to explode \nfrom the blood swelling inside, the [lightening] storm that happened in \nmy head, the blurred vision, confusion, dizziness and a whole lot more. \nNot the best feeling in the entire world to have after being here for \ntwo days. . . . And I ask myself what . . . am I doing here?''\n  I ask my colleagues, do this make any sense?\n  In the Hartford Courant's May 17 piece entitled ``Still Suffering, \nBut Redeployed,'' COL Elspeth Ritchie, a psychiatry consultant to the \nArmy surgeon general, acknowledged that the decision to deploy soldiers \nwith PTSD is a matter that the Army is currently wresting with.\n  I would like to quote Colonel Ritchie, because I think that something \nshe said is particularly telling: ``historically, we have not wanted to \nsend soldiers or anybody with post-traumatic stress disorder back into \nwhat traumatized them. . . . The challenge for us . . . is that the \nArmy has a mission to fight.''\n  I appreciate that the military--particularly the Army--is facing \nsevere manpower needs, but the fact that we are knowingly sending U.S. \nservice members back into the very situation that caused their trauma \nis utterly tragic.\n  Tragic and unacceptable.\n  The Boxer-Lieberman amendment would do some very important things to \naddress this situation.\n  First, it would improve mental health screening procedures for those \nabout to be deployed. Currently, the military's pre-deployment mental \nhealth assessment is a single question on a form.\n  The Boxer-Lieberman amendment requires an enhanced mental health \nscreening process prior to deployment that would include: a mental \nhealth history of the servicemember; current mental health treatment or \nuse of medications for a mental health disorder; an assessment of any \nbehavior identified by the unit commander that might provided by the \nmember, (through a checklist or other means,) of symptoms that might \nindicate a mental health condition.\n  Second, the amendment mandates that soldiers determined to have \nsymptoms of a mental health condition--either before deployment or \nafter deployment--will be referred to a qualified health care \nprofessional with experience in the evaluation and diagnosis of mental \nhealth conditions.\n  This is an area where we are really falling short-the Hartford \nCourant reports that military screeners have arranged mental health \nevaluations for fewer than one in 300 deploying troops.\n  Third, the Boxer-Lieberman amendment mandates that any member of the \nArmed Forces who requests access to mental health care services, \nbefore, during, or after deployment to a combat zone, will be given \naccess within 72 hours after making the request or as soon as possible.\n  Fourth, the amendment directs the Department of Defense to develop \nclear and consistent guidelines and regulations on what mental health \nconditions and psychotropic drugs ought to prevent a servicemember from \nbeing deployed to a combat zone.\n  It also requires the Department to develop guidelines for the \ndeployability and treatment of service members diagnosed with severe \nmental illness or PTSD.\n  And lastly, it will require the Department to develop a plan to \nmonitor individuals deployed to a combat zone who are known to have a \nmental health condition or disorder or are known to be taking \npsychotropic medications.\n  I think that these are small steps that we can take to ensure that \nour service members receive a higher standard of mental health services \nand care.\n  I hope it will also prevent stories like the one I am about to tell \nyou, again in the Hartford Courant, from happening again.\n  Patricia Powers of Skiatook, OK wonders why her 20-year-old son \nJoshua was sent to Iraq barely six months after he enlisted in the \nArmy.\n  According to Ms. Powers, she ''just couldn't believe'' that the Army \ntook her son in, as her son had Asperger's syndrome--a form of autism.\n\n[[Page S6363]]\n\n  People with Asperger syndrome tend to be highly intelligent, but they \nhave trouble in social settings and are quite often loners who have \ndifficulty building relationships.\n  However, Asperger's was not the only neurological issue facing \nJoshua.\n  In reading through the medical records of her son's frequent visits \nto the base doctor, Ms. Powers found that in every instance, the doctor \nhad taken note of Joshua's severe depression.\n  Three weeks after arriving in Iraq, Pvt. Powers left his barracks \naround midnight and walked to the latrine, where he ended his life with \na gunshot to the head.\n  In a recent GAG report, the GAG noted that the military has been \nreluctantto create uniform guidelines for deployment.\n  In its recommendation, the GAG argued that guidelines are necessary \n``so that in future deployments [the Defense Department] would not \nexperience situations such as those that occurred with members being \ndeployed into Iraq who clearly had pre-existing conditions that should \nhave prevented their deployment.''\n  Situations like Joshua Power's Situations like Bryce Syverson's, \nwhere he was forced to ask his family: ``What am I doing here?''\n  Mr. President, the heroic men and women serving in Iraq and \nAfghanistan are doing a fantastic job.\n  In Iraq, they have succeeded in every mission that has been asked of \nthem, even the ones that have changed over time. In Afghanistan, they \nare relentlessly hunting for the man responsible for the deaths of over \n3,000 Americans. But as the death toll continues to rise, so does \nstrain.\n  Ided today just two examples of soldiers who clearly indicated that \ndeploying them to a combat zone would be a mistake. But we know that \nthere are many more.\n  What we are asking for in this amendment is simple: that the Pentagon \ndoes a better job of dealing with mental health matters for the men and \nwomen that it sends into harm's way. I don't think this is too much to \nask.\n  Again, I like to thank Senator Warner, Senator Levin, and Senator \nLieberman for their support.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about an \namendment offered during the debate on the 2007 Defense authorization \nbill by Senators Boxer, Kennedy, Clinton, and myself.\n  In May of this year, the Hartford Courant published a series of \narticles describing inadequacies in the military's mental health \nscreening procedures for servicemembers deploying to Iraq and \nAfghanistan. The Courant's investigation revealed that servicemembers \ndisplaying clear signs of distress and mental health problems are being \ndeployed into combat situations and in some cases have taken their \nlife. These cases compromise not only the lives of our servicemembers \nbut the strength and cohesion of our military units.\n  The Hartford Courant wrote about Jeffrey Henthorn, a young \nservicemember who took his life. Jeffrey was from Oklahoma and shipped \nout of Fort Riley, KS, the day after Christmas in 2004. While home, \nJeffrey was depressed, was having nightmares, and was plagued by \nmemories of a young boy who had died in Iraq. Less than 2 months after \nhis redeployment to Iraq, Jeffrey took his own life at the age of 25 \nyears. Since then, it has become known that Jeffrey had made suicidal \nstatements that were known to his Army superiors. Despite the clear \npsychological problems Jeffrey was having before his deployment, he was \nstill sent back to a combat zone where he took his own life. To prevent \nacts such as this that ruin individual lives and have deleterious \neffects on a unit, Congress passed the National Defense Authorization \nAct for Fiscal Year 1998. At that time, the statute required the \nmilitary to conduct an ``assessment of mental health'' for all \ndeploying troops to prevent young men like Jeffrey Henthorn from being \nplaced in further harm. However, the military's current screening \nprocess for deployment consists of a single mental health question on a \npredeployment questionnaire. The law is not being followed as it was \nintended.\n  Alarmingly, the Hartford Courant's investigation found that only 6.5 \npercent of those indicating mental health problems were referred for \nmental health evaluations from March 2003 to October 2005. This is \nunacceptable.\n  Senator Boxer and I are also concerned about the increase in the \nnumbers of servicemembers being prescribed medication for depression, \nanxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorderly, PTSD. These individuals \nare being sent into combat with psychotropic medications but are not \nsystematically receiving any followup or monitoring. We cannot send our \nservicemembers into combat zones without the medical and mental health \nsupport they deserve and need. There is nothing controversial about \nthat.\n  Another case reported by the Hartford Courant illustrates the dangers \nof providing medications without followup or monitoring in the field. \nMichael Deem, father of two, saw a psychiatrist before deploying to \nhelp him cope with serious symptoms of depression. He was given a \nyear's supply of Prozac, among other medications. Less than a month \nafter deploying to Iraq, Michael Deem was found dead in his bunk. The \nArmy determined that he died of an enlarged heart ``complicated by \nelevated levels'' of Prozac. We cannot have servicemembers on \nmedications for serious conditions out in the field with inadequate \nmonitoring, and nonexistent followup. We must do better for those \nwilling to make the ultimate sacrifice for us.\n  We have also learned that troops with preexisting mental health \nconditions and serious mental health disorders are being sent into \ncombat zones. This amendment would make sure young men and women who \nare unable to serve are not sent into combat zones that make their \nconditions worse or place them and their units in danger.\n  The Courant series also told the story of a young man from \nPennsylvania. Eddie Brabazon had a history of bipolar disorder and \nspent time in group homes and psychiatric hospitals during his \nadolescent years. In March of 2004, less than 3 months into his second \ndeployment to the Middle East, Eddie shot himself and took his own life \nat the age of 20. There were signs before this act that something was \nterribly wrong. In the days leading up to his suicide, Eddie had locked \nhimself in a portable toilet with his rifle for 45 minutes, causing his \nsergeant concern. But no one sent Eddie to receive intensive treatment \nto prevent his suicide or send him away from the combat zone where his \ncondition was worsening. Young men with Eddie's history of mental \nhealth problems and exhibiting such clearly communicated signs of \ndistress should not continue to serve in a combat zone.\n  To protect servicemembers similar to the ones the Courant has written \nabout and their units, Senators Boxer, Kennedy, Clinton, and I are \nintroducing this amendment. The military mental health amendment has \ntwo purposes. First, it is meant to keep these courageous young men and \nwomen out of the way of any further harm. Second, we must make sure \nthat our units have the strongest and healthiest soldiers, and this \namendment moves us in the right direction. By deploying servicemembers \nwith serious mental health problems, we are compromising the strength \nof our military units.\n  Our amendment will ensure that the military would conduct a thorough \nscreening for determining whether a servicemember has a significant \nmental health problem before deploying; servicemembers with a \nsignificant mental health problem are seen by someone with experience \nin mental health assessment; access to mental health professionals in a \nmore timely manner; the military identifies preexisting mental health \nconditions to determine appropriateness for deployment; and the \nmilitary develops a plan for how to continue to provide mental health \nservices during deployment for any servicemembers receiving mental \nhealth services before their deployment.\n  Senator Boxer and I, along with Senators Clinton and Kennedy, \nintroduced this amendment to ensure that servicemembers like Jeffrey \nHenthorn, Michael Deem, and Eddie Brabazon receive the care they \ndeserve before it is too late. I thank both Senators Levin and Warner \nfor adopting this amendment into the Defense authorization bill for \n2007, and I encourage the conferees in both Houses to maintain the\n\n[[Page S6364]]\n\nprovisions of this amendment to ensure we keep our troops strong and \nhealthy.\n\n\n                           amendment no.4507\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes of the \nSenate's time to discuss an amendment that I understand Senator Warner \nand Senator Levin have included in the managers' package.\n  This amendment--that I worked on with my colleague Senator Snowe--\nwould move toward expanding eligibility for the Purple Heart to all \nprisoners of war who die in captivity regardless of the cause of death.\n  The need for this important amendment was brought to my attention by \na group of Korean War veterans--the Tiger Survivors--who identified \nwhat many of my colleagues agree is a glaring loophole in current law.\n  You may be surprised to learn that currently, only prisoners of war \nwho die during their imprisonment of wounds inflicted by the enemy--\nsuch as a gunshot wound or intentional poisoning--clearly meet the \ncriteria for posthumous Purple Heart recognition.\n  Those who die of starvation, disease, or other causes during \ncaptivity do not. I would like to give you an example of what I mean by \nrecounting the story of the crew members who survived the sinking of \nthe USS Houston, a Navy cruiser that was sunk by the Japanese off the \ncoast of Java in February 1942.\n  After swimming to shore, the Japanese transported American POWs to \nBurma to work as slave labor building the Burma-Thai Railway, which \nwould stretch 250 miles between mountains, across rivers, and through \njungles.\n  These American POWs cut down trees, built road beds and bridges, and \nlaid ties and rails for what is known as the Death Railway.\n  Conditions for these Americans were appalling. Each man received half \na cup of bug-infested rice a day, and some POWs dropped below 80 \npounds. Malnutrition brought on diseases like beri beri, pellagra, and \nscurvy--severe vitamin deficiencies that result in horrible suffering \nand even death.\n  The tropical environment also bred cases of dysentery, malaria, \ncholera, and tropical ulcers that ate through flesh to expose bone.\n  Although Japanese doctors were present in the camps, they were not \nallowed any drugs or tools for practicing medicine. Those workers who \nwere too slow were beaten; those who were too sick to work received no \nfood, and were eventually sent off to die.\n  Under current law, many of these individuals would not be eligible \nfor the Purple Heart.\n  Doesn't it make sense that our young service members who died in this \nmanner would be recognized as having died at the hands of the enemy?\n  Doesn't it make sense that the Houston crew members who were denied \ntreatment and died of starvation and disease in captivity would be \neligible for the Purple Heart?\n  Language that would correct this injustice was accepted as part of \nthe House version of the Defense authorization bill, where it had the \noverwhelming bipartisan support of 216 cosponsors.\n  Equally important, correcting this important loophole in the law has \nbeen endorsed by the American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, \nMilitary Order of the Purple Heart, the National Association for \nUniformed Services, the Military Officers of America Association, the \nKorean War Veterans Association, National League of POW-MIA Families, \nTiger Survivors, and a number of other prominent veterans \norganizations.\n  I can think of no stronger endorsement than from these fine groups \nwho know first-hand the suffering of war.\n  I would like to tell you one more story by a World War II soldier by \nthe name of John Coleman. This is his story as recounted in his book, \nBataan and Beyond:\n\n       The treatment of the death march and imprisonment . . . is \n     beyond the imagination's ability to comprehend. If there ever \n     was a hell on earth, this was administered to the 7,000 souls \n     of some of the bravest and most devoted of our military \n     personnel. Day after day they were in agony, seemingly \n     blotted out in memory by their nation. They suffered under \n     the burning tropical sun, on starvation rations, with little \n     water to drink. They could not even wash the filth from their \n     bodies or clothes, matted hair, and beards. They were \n     mentally depressed, had swollen limbs from beri beri, \n     unhealed festered wounds that were never treated. They also \n     had distended stomachs, bloody dysentery, and raw, sore \n     mouths from pellagra. Even a drink of water would cause their \n     mouths to burn. Everyone had stomach worms that would \n     sometimes find their way out of the body through the nose. No \n     attempt was made by the Imperial Japanese Army to furnish any \n     kind of medication to alleviate the suffering.\n  Unimaginable. Simply unimaginable.\n  Mr. President, these brave members of the Armed Forces suffered these \ncruelties so that we might enjoy the freedoms we have today. I can \nthink of no more fitting tribute for their sacrifice than to \nposthumously make them eligible for the Purple Heart.\n  While the amendment that I originally offered would have provided \ncongressional authorization expanding eligibility for the Purple Heart, \nI worked with Senators Warner and Levin on compromise language that \nwould require the President to determine whether eligibility for the \nPurple Heart should be expanded to all POW's who died in captivity.\n  I sincerely hope the President will take a serious look at this \nproposal, and ensure that our POWs are afforded the recognition they \ndeserve.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4371\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of amendment No. \n4371, which is being offered today by my friend, Senator Coburn. \nSenator Coburn and I have been working tirelessly to improve \naccountability and transparency in Federal contracting so that the \nAmerican people can rely on their Government for the excellence and \nefficiency that they deserve.\n  Award and incentive fees are often used in defense contracts to \nencourage outstanding performance. But too often these awards are given \nwithout regard to performance. That doesn't make sense. This amendment \nprohibits unsatisfactory performance from being rewarded by the Federal \nGovernment. It sets a higher standard for defense contractors and \nrequires them at least to satisfy the basic requirements of a contract \nin order to be eligible for any award or incentive fee.\n  It is a simple concept. No bonus awards when the work is \nunsatisfactory. Period. You don't tip a waiter who doesn't bring you \nyour food. You don't give a bonus to an employee who doesn't do his or \nher job at work. The Government should not permit awards for work that \nis less than satisfactory. Awards should be used as an incentive for \nexcellence, not as a backdoor for undeserved payments.\n  The authorization bill makes some progress by requiring the Secretary \nof Defense to provide needed guidance on the use of awards and \nincentive fees. It requires guidance that award fees be tied to \nperformance outcomes. It requires guidance on designating contractor \nperformance as ``excellent,'' or ``superior.'' It requires standards \nfor when performance awards are appropriate.\n  This amendment just makes it clear that unsatisfactory work should \nnever be eligible for an award. Contractors can and must be held to a \nhigher standard. Our troops deserve no less. American taxpayers deserve \nno less. Americans should reward excellence, not mediocrity; success, \nnot failure; contract fulfillment, and nothing less.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 4496\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the National Biocontainment Lab, NBL, \nat the University of Texas Medical Branch, UTMB, in Galveston is an \nimportant tool in our continued fight against bioterrorism and emerging \ninfectious diseases. As a Regional Center of Excellence for Biodefense \nand Emerging Infectious Diseases Research, RCE, for Federal Region VI, \nUTMB's lab is able to research and develop new therapies, vaccines, and \ntests for microbes that might be used as weapons by terrorists, as well \nas naturally occurring diseases such as SARS and West Nile virus.\n  I was happy to support UTMB in 2003 in their efforts to establish the \nNBL in Galveston. In letters and conversations with Dr. Anthony Fauci, \ndirector of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, \nand Dr. Elias Zerhouni, director of National Institutes of Health, I \nconveyed the importance of this facility and the benefits to housing \nthe NBL at UTMB.\n  Once again, I am pleased to support the NBL and UTMB with this \namendment. By understanding the staffing\n\n[[Page S6365]]\n\nand training requirements needed at this new facility, our doctors and \nscientists will be better prepared and more able to recognize a \nbioterrorist attack.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4222\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today marks the anniversary of the \npassage of a sense-of-the-Senate resolution on climate change. One year \nago the Senate convened to debate the appropriate policy direction for \nthe United States on this issue.\n  The Senate debate on climate change included discussions on various \nproposals from Senators Hagel and Pryor, as well as Senators McCain and \nLieberman and others. Although I had worked very closely with Senator \nDomenici on a specific policy proposal of our own, we were not able in \nthe time allotted to find agreement on various aspects of that \nproposal. We ultimately decided that we should put the question to the \nSenate of whether or not our efforts should continue over the remainder \nof the 109th Congress.\n  I am pleased to say that passage of the sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution gave us the foundation to continue our collaboration. Over \nthe course of the last year, I have worked with Chairman Domenici and \nothers to explore the basic workings of a mandatory market-based system \nto limit greenhouse gases. We have held hearings in the Energy \nCommittee, participated in workshops and conferences, and engaged \ninterested stakeholders through a White Paper process that culminated \nin an important day-long conference in April.\n  Other Members of this body have been actively engaged in the \ncontinuing conversation, such as Senators Carper, Feinstein, Lugar, and \nBiden just to name a few, but it is important for us to recognize how \nmuch faster this issue is progressing outside of Washington, DC.\n  The European Union Emissions Trading Scheme is in its second year of \nexistence. There has been some debate about how the program is \nprogressing, but there is no debate about the fact that they are moving \nforward and addressing global warming in a ground-breaking manner. Here \nin the United States, my colleagues from California and the \nNortheastern States are intimately aware of State initiatives to \naddress global warming. My own State of New Mexico has been a leader in \nreducing emissions as well.\n  Most importantly, I think we need to recognize how much we have \nlearned in the past year about the science of climate change. Last \nyear, the National Academies of Science from 11 countries, including \nthe United States, declared that ``scientific understanding of climate \nchange is now sufficiently clear to justify nations taking prompt \naction.'' According to NASA scientists, 2005 was the warmest year since \nthe late 1800s. 1998, 2002, 2003, and 2004 followed as the next four \nwarmest years.\n  With regard to the impacts of global warming, a recent study shows \nthat we are on track to initiate the melting of the Greenland ice \nsheet, which will contribute to continued sea-level rise and will also \nhave major impacts on oceanic circulation from freshwater influx. Even \nsmall amounts of sea-level rise will have substantial impacts on \ncoastal erosion, increased susceptibility to storm surges and \ngroundwater contamination by salt intrusion. The effect on many of the \nworld's coastal areas and population centers could be devastating.\n  We are also in the early stages of hurricane season. I have not yet \nseen any studies that would indicate global warming will create more \nhurricanes, but I have seen two recent studies that conclude that the \nwarming we are seeing in the world's oceans is caused by human-induced \nclimate change. In addition, there are more studies that have recently \nconcluded that the intensity of individual hurricanes has increased, \nwhich in part is attributed to the warming of the oceans.\n  In conclusion, I believe that this is evidence that we need to act \nnow. Since the sense-of-the-Senate resolution passed last year, the \nU.S. has emitted roughly 6 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide. EIA \nforecasts continued steady emissions growth at a rate that, if not \nslowed and ultimately stopped and reversed, will make it increasingly \ndifficult to avoid dangerous climate impacts.\n  I want to thank Senators Domenici and Specter, along with all of the \ncosponsors of the sense-of-the-Senate Resolution and everyone who \nsupported it. We have learned a great deal over the course of the last \nyear, and I would like to continue the progress. I would like to urge \nall of my colleagues who are interested in this issue to work with us \nto find a solution we can implement sooner, rather than later.\n  I would like the references to some of the studies I have mentioned \nprinted in the Record so that others can review them as well.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Alley, R.B., P.U.

I thank our \nstaffs for working so hard on these amendments. There is a lot of \ninterest in them by a lot of Members. We owe thanks to the staff for \ntheir great work. I have not only no objection but enthusiastically \njoin in moving their adoption. I gather they have been agreed to by \nunanimous consent.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my distinguished colleague for his remarks.\n  If I might draw to the attention of my distinguished colleague, we \nhave been consulting with our respective leadership and their staffs. \nWe have a joint goal of trying to complete this bill today and have \nthird reading and final passage. The bill is now open for amendment. We \nhave some knowledge of some amendments that may be offered. We would \nurge those who wish to offer amendments, recognizing cloture has been \nagreed to by the Chamber, nevertheless within the confines of that \ncloture, we are ready to have the opportunity to consider further \namendments.\n  I believe I am about to put in the first quorum call for the purpose \nsolely that we have no amendments at the moment pending. That is the \nfirst time in the consideration of this bill, I believe.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I commend the chairman for the way in which he has been \nable to manage this bill, as always. It is a testament to his ability \nand the respect that everybody has for him in the Chamber. I have never \nseen fewer quorum calls on a bill of this size than we have had this \nweek. I am sure there have been a few. I have not counted them. There \nmay have been a quorum call yesterday during the 8 or 9 hours of \ndebate. If there was, I missed it.\n  I commend the chairman for putting us in a position where we can \nhopefully get this bill agreed to as soon as possible today. Again, I \njoin him in not urging people to bring amendments to\n\n[[Page S6366]]\n\nthe floor--we never do that--but in notifying people that if they have \namendments, they should bring them to the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague who has worked side by side with me \nthese 28 years on these matters. When I look back on my modest career \nin the Senate, I can't think of any other Senator with whom I have had \na better relationship and a more trusting one, although we do disagree \non occasion.\n  Mr. LEVIN. There is recent evidence of that. But we agree on process. \nWe agree on civility. We agree on most matters. We are able to work \nthings out. It is his nature to do that, and we are all very much in \nhis debt. Our wives are on the same path that we have been on.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is right. Who quoted Edward R. Murrow, something \nabout the strength of our Nation depends on the diversity of thinking \nand expression?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Well, it was quoted this morning. It didn't carry the day, \nbut it was very appropriate.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague. I do believe those two amendments \non which we spent so much time were carefully and fully debated. I \naccept with a sense of humility the outcome, that we were able to \nprevail on this side of the aisle. However I underline that I do that \nwith a sense of deep humility.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4471, as Modified\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up my \namendment No. 4471 and ask that it be modified with the changes that \nare at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nlaid aside.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I further ask unanimous consent that Senators Allard, \nKyl, Thune, and Vitter be added as cosponsors.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, there is a \nlittle uncertainty as to the modifications.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I don't think the Senator will find that objectionable. \nIt dealt with funding allocations, the offsets.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is the one at the desk the modified version?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will please withhold for a moment.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will be pleased to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Sessions], for himself, Mr. \n     Allard, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Thune, and Mr. Vitter, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4471, as modified.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle C of title II, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 236. TESTING AND OPERATIONS FOR MISSILE DEFENSE.\n\n       (a) Additional Amount for Missile Defense Agency.--Of the \n     amount authorized to be appropriated by section 201(4) for \n     research, development, test, and evaluation for Defense-wide \n     activities, the amount that is available for the Missile \n     Defense Agency is hereby increased by $45,000,000.\n       (b) Availability of Amount.--Of the amount authorized to be \n     appropriated by section 201(4) for research, development, \n     test, and evaluation for Defense-wide activities and \n     available for the Missile Defense Agency, as increased by \n     subsection (a), $45,000,000 may be available for Ballistic \n     Missile Defense Midcourse Defense Segment (PE #63882C)--\n       (1) to accelerate the ability to conduct concurrent test \n     and missile defense operations; and\n       (2) to increase the pace of realistic flight testing of the \n     ground-based midcourse defense system.\n       (c) Supplement.--Amounts available under subsection (b) for \n     the program element referred to in that subsection are in \n     addition to any other amounts available in this Act for that \n     program element.\n       (d) Offset.--The amount authorized to be appropriated by \n     section 421 for military personnel is hereby reduced by \n     $45,000,000 due to unexpended obligations.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, recent concerns over a long-range \nballistic missile launch or possible launch toward the United States by \nNorth Korea is an event that many experts have predicted and an event \nof serious import for the world.\n  President Bush, in December of 2002, directed the Department of \nDefense to begin fielding a missile defense system to protect the \nUnited States. There were many concerns expressed at that time, but \nCongress followed his orders and has moved forward. Today, we have nine \nGBIs--ground-based interceptors--in Alaska in silos in the ground, and \ntwo in California that are able to be launched to attack and destroy \nincoming missiles. The system and those missiles that we have are not \ncomplete nor fully perfected, but the Commander of Strategic Command, \nGeneral Cartwright, says it does have capability to defend our Nation.\n  So I would first like to give my thanks to President Bush and to the \nDepartment of Defense for moving on this issue some time ago.\n  I would also like to express my appreciation for a bipartisan effort \nthat was begun not long after I came to the Senate by Senator Thad \nCochran and Senator Joe Lieberman and the legislation they passed that \ncalled on this Government to deploy a ground-based missile defense \nsystem as soon as feasible. That was a major step forward. Following \nthat, President Bush's actions in 2002 have moved us farther forward.\n  These missiles that we have in the ground are able to be launched, \nthey are able to attack and destroy incoming systems. So it is a \nremarkable thing that has been accomplished. Many doubted it. We have a \nlot more testing to do to deal with decoys and other matters to make \nsure the entire system works in an harmonious and effective way, from \nthe ground-based radar, sea-based radar, to launch sites and our \nintercept capabilities and all of the computer systems that are \nnecessary to make these missiles move at incredible speeds to collide \nin the air with such great force that they basically vaporize without \nany explosives being involved. So I think, Mr. President, it is an \nimportant event in our lifetime as a nation to note that this defense \nshield is now being employed.\n  I also was pleased that our Democratic leader a few days ago noted \nthat: ``We live in a dangerous time and the threats to our Nation are \nmany.'' He said, ``They range from terrorist attacks like those on 9/11 \nto rogue nations with nuclear ambitions like North Korea and Iran.'' He \nwent on to note the: ``Headlines about North Korea's new missile \ntest.'' He discussed that and noted: ``It is important that we as a \ncountry address each of these threats.''\n  Mr. President, I suggest, based upon the events of the past few \nweeks, that the debate over the need for missile defense is no longer \nan academic one, but it is a debate that must now take place in the \nreality of current events.\n  As we convene today, North Korea may perhaps still be preparing to \ntest launch its Taepo-Dong II long-range ballistic missile. According \nto U.S. intelligence agencies, this missile has the potential to reach \nthe shores of the United States, given its purported maximum range of \n9,000 miles, far enough to hit the west coast of the U.S. mainland and \nall of the Pacific bases, according to an article in the Washington \nPost earlier this week.\n  The leaders of South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, China, Japan, and \nthe United States are warning, as Secretary of State Rice did Monday, \nthat, as she said, ``The launch of a ballistic missile would be a \nprovocative act that would deepen North Korea's isolation.'' She urged \nthe North Koreans not to end their moratorium on long-range missile \ntesting. Japan's warning was even stronger. Japanese Prime Minister \nKoizumi said that Japan ``would have to respond harshly'' if there were \na missile attack.\n  North Korea also fields some 200 medium-range No-Dong ballistic \nmissiles that can reach Japan, and it deploys some 600 short-range \nballistic missiles tha could reach throughout the Korean Peninsula, \nwhere we have some 30,000-plus troops.\n\n  Likewise, on the other side of the world, Iran continues to enhance \nand\n\n[[Page S6367]]\n\ntest its SHAHAB-3 medium-range ballistic missile to extend its range \nand effectiveness. U.S. intelligence agencies estimate that Iran could \nhave an ICBM capable of reaching the United States before 2015 with \ncontinued foreign assistance.\n  According to press reports, Israeli intelligence noted in April of \n2006 that Iran received a shipment of North Korean-made BM-25 ballistic \nmissiles which have a range of 2,500 kilometers.\n  This activity was noted by the Prime Minister of Israel, who stated \nin a press conference with President Bush on May 23 that:\n\n       There is a major threat posed by the Iranians in their \n     attempts to have nonconventional capabilities and the \n     ballistic missiles that can hit major centers all across \n     Europe, not just the Middle East.\n\n  These are real, not hypothetical, threats to the United States and \nits allies posed by these ballistic missiles.\n  These missiles are threats that require a multifaceted response, not \nthe least of which is by means of an effective ballistic missile \ndefense system.\n  I would imagine that over the past 5 weeks, the Department of Defense \nhas been carefully watching the arrival and fueling of Taepo-Dong \nmissiles at its launch pad on the eastern coast of North Korea. And I \nwould suspect that our missile defense capabilities have been carefully \nintegrated into our diplomatic and deterrent options for dealing with \nthe situation--a situation that Secretary Rice said is an ``abrogation \nof obligations'' of North Korea, a path not of compromise or peace \n``but rather instead to once again saber-rattle.''\n  So our Secretary of State has called the situation correctly. The \nNation and Congress should heed her words.\n  While I have no direct knowledge of any administration plans beyond \nwhat is being said in the press, I would hope that our U.S. Navy ships, \nwhich are capable of tracking and potentially intercepting ballistic \nmissiles, have been deployed in the area. I saw this part of our fleet \nlast year when I was in Pearl Harbor right after they conducted a \nseries of successful intercept tests in the Pacific.\n  I would also hope that the ground-based midcourse defense system, \nwith missiles deployed in both Alaska and California to provide \nprotections against long-range missile attack, has been activated in \ncase it is needed. To be sure, these systems are still undergoing \ntesting. They have been designed to be available in an emergency, and I \nwould think an imminent Taepo-Dong launch falls into that category.\n  At the very least, such a capability would add to the options \navailable to our President. In a radio interview last week, Ambassador \nVershbow, the top U.S. envoy in South Korea, commented on a potential \nNorth Korean launch saying, ``Since it would be clearly a provocative \nstep vis-a-vis the region and international community, we should not \nsimply let it pass without some response.''\n  I don't know what response the Ambassador had in mind, but certainly \nthe ability to intercept that missile before it struck a populated area \nwould be high on my list.\n  My main point to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and in both \nHouses of Congress, Mr. President, is that missile defenses must now be \nconsidered an integral and important tool of U.S. diplomacy and \nnational security policy.\n  This is all the more reason to support the administration's efforts \nto develop test and field effective missile defenses against missiles \nof all ranges. So I am pleased to report that the Defense authorization \nbill reported out of the Armed Services Committee fully funds the \nPresident's request for missile defense to include $56 million for site \nsurvey and design work associated with the European defense missile \ndefense site.\n  The European missile defense site, scheduled to begin construction in \n2008 with full fielding expected in 2011, will allow 10 ground-based \ninterceptors capable of protecting both the United States and much of \nEurope against a long-range missile fired by Iran.\n  If you look at the globe carefully, you could indicate a long-range \nmissile launched towards the United States from Iran would fly over \nnortheastern Europe. That would be an excellent site to protect both \nthe United States as well as protecting Europe.\n  Congressional support for this activity is timely for our defense and \nto support Western diplomatic efforts aimed at halting Iran's \nacquisition of a nuclear weapon capability.\n  Should diplomacy fail, a European missile defense site will be \ncritical to defer Iranian ballistic missile threats aimed at attacking \nor intimidating the West.\n  Our NATO allies recognize the threat posed by the proliferation of \nballistic missiles. In 2010, the alliance expects to have the \ncapability to protect deployed troops against short- and medium-range \nmissiles. The alliance is now reviewing the results of a 4-year \nfeasibility study that examines options for protecting alliance \nterritory--that is the North Atlantic Treaty Organization alliance--and \npopulation against a full range of missile threats.\n  Congressional commitment to a U.S. missile defense site in Europe at \nthis time would be a significant factor in shaping NATO's decision to \nprovide missile defense protection in Europe. Our commanders tell us \nthat. They tell us it is very important.\n  I realize some of our colleagues are concerned that funding a \nEuropean site would be premature at this time. They suggest a slow \nfielding program until more extensive tests and evaluations have been \ncompleted. While I appreciate that concern, I do believe that current \nMissile Defense Agency approach of simultaneously fielding and testing \na GMD system has proven to be wise, as we see the threats to our Nation \nincrease in just recent days.\n  The Commander of the U.S. Strategic Command has testified that the \ncurrent missile system provides a thin line of defense that could be \nused. The independent Pentagon Director of Operational Tests and \nEvaluation stated on April 4 of this year:\n\n       With the current program and the tests that have been \n     scheduled, it's very likely that the GMD system will \n     demonstrate that it is effective.\n\n  The things that are needed to turn this thin line of defense into a \nrobust defense system are more interceptors coupled with more flight \ntesting, both of which are programmed by the missile defense agency and \nfunded by our bill.\n  While we have crafted a good funding stream in our committee--and I \nthank my colleague, Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, and others, for the \nbipartisan way he worked on this--we have worked hard at containing \ncosts and keeping the costs under control.\n  The possible launch of a long-range North Korean missile that could \neven reach the United States of America calls for us to evaluate this \nyear's authorization to ensure that all necessary funding exists to \nmove forward with deployment as well as testing, and to be sure that \nthroughout that time we are ready. General Trey Obering, who directs \nthe program, understands these challenges.\n  My review of this authorization has convinced me that an additional \nappropriation of $45 million is critically important in allowing us to, \nin the words of our amendment:\n\n     accelerate the ability to conduct concurrent tests and \n     missile defense operations [and] to increase the pace of \n     realistic flight tests.\n\n  The funds that I am talking about and the projects that I am talking \nabout are already in the 2008 budget. This would allow them to move \nforward to the 2007 budget.\n  The amendment for which I am seeking support today will help ensure \nthat we can continue testing and always remain ready; not have to have \nthe readiness of our system degraded by testing that we need to be \ndoing. This is necessary so that we can respond to any possible missile \nlaunch that may threaten our Nation.\n  The key matter is that we test and we test regularly. But we cannot \nshut down the readiness of our system that could have the capability to \nknock down incoming missiles that could be aimed at us.\n  Congressional support for this amendment, I think, will send a strong \nmessage to any nation, North Korea or Iran, that we will be constantly, \n24/7, ready to respond and knock down and destroy any missile that \nwould be directed at our Nation. It will also reassure our allies that \nwe will be ready to protect them and help us create the kind of \numbrella of defense that we have dreamed of for many years and \naccelerate our ability to make that a reality.\n  I thank my colleagues. I thank those who indicated they would accept \nthis\n\n[[Page S6368]]\n\namendment. I think it is a good step forward.\n  It is great to see my colleague, Senator Allard, here. He used to \nchair the subcommittee that I have now, the Strategic Subcommittee. He \nhas been a long-time champion of national missile defense.\n  I say to Senator Levin, he is due to be recognized next, but I know \nSenator Allard is here also.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we do accept the amendment on this side. \nThere are no differences in terms of the North Korean threat. The \nquestion is whether or not we will be deploying a system which will be \nadequate to meet that threat. Right now we do not know. There has been \nno operational testing, realistic testing of our system. It needs \ntesting.\n  Although we have differences and have expressed those and argued over \nthose differences as to whether we ought to be producing 10 more \nmissiles which have not been tested operationally or realistically--\nwhether we ought to be buying these final 10 missiles given the fact we \nwant to make sure if we are going to have a system that it works, and \nwe don't know that yet--as far as this Senator is concerned, I very \nmuch disagreed with this approach of buying before we fly. Usually we \nfly and test before we buy, but this system, we have decided, at least \nthe majority of Senators have decided, that we are going to buy before \nwe test. I think that is a mistake, but that is not the issue on this \namendment.\n  This amendment would authorize $45 million, mainly for testing, \nmainly to improve the likelihood that a missile which has been deployed \nwill in fact do the job. Since I have been one who has been arguing \nregularly for more testing, more realistic testing, more operational \ntesting, it seems to me that I can very readily support funding which \nis going to go to more testing, which is really what this amendment is \nall about.\n  We have not had a single successful intercept test with an \noperational system. There have been two failures with this operational \nsystem. We don't know if our system would work. We obviously want it to \nwork if we are going to have it.\n  Since this amendment basically is going to increase not only the pace \nof realistic flight testing of this ground-based, mid-course defense \nsystem but also is going to accelerate the ability to conduct \nconcurrent testing while the missile defense operations are going on, \nsince in both instances the focus is on testing and making sure that \nthis system will work if ever called upon, I accept the amendment. I \nhave no objection to it and, indeed, support its purpose.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \namendment offered by my good friend, Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, \nwho has worked hard on this issue. I know he is a strong, dedicated \nSenator as far as making sure that we have a good, strong national \ndefense, which is important in today's times.\n  There is no doubt that this has been an unusual approach where we \ndevelop and purchase at the same time. But these are unusual times. We \nhave had an emerging threat that, according to many of our defense \nexperts, is real. We had to move forward at an unprecedented rapid \npace.\n  Over the last 2 weeks, the North Koreans have moved toward the brink \nand have been preparing to test fire a long-range ballistic missile \ncapable of reaching the United States. We were in the same position in \n1998. Then all we could do is threaten to retaliate if North Korea \nlaunched a ballistic missile attack against us. We did not have a \nsystem that was capable of defending our country from attack.\n  Today the situation is different. Acting upon the direction of \nCongress, which mandated in 1999 that our country deploy a missile \ndefense system as quickly as technologically possible, the Department \nof Defense has developed and deployed a missile defense system that is \ncapable of defending our Nation against limited ballistic missiles.\n  Given the real-world ballistic threats, such as North Korea, the \nDepartment of Defense has pursued a strategy of concurrent tests and \noperations. The Department recognizes that our current missile defense \nsystem does not have sufficient capability and needs more testing. That \nis why the Department continues to test the system and add new \ncapabilities.\n  At the same time, it is clear that situations such as the ongoing \nNorth Korean threat require that our missile defenses be ready in case \nof a ballistic missile attack. Leaving our Nation defenseless to \nballistic missile attack while such situations persist is folly in the \nextreme. We currently have 11 ground-based interceptors deployed and \noperational. We have also upgraded our early warning radars, improved \nour Aegis tracking radars, built new forward-based and sea-based \nradars, and created an integrated command-and-control battle management \nsystem.\n  These are significant achievements that together provide our country \nwith a limited ballistic missile defense. Yet, as we all know, our \nmissile defense still needs more work. It has a limited capability, \nwhich is certainly better than having none at all, but we need to do \nmore--particularly with regard to testing.\n  The amendment offered by Senator Sessions puts us on the right track. \nThe Missile Defense Agency needs to test its ballistic missile defense \nsystem more often and under more complicated conditions. This \namendment, offered by Senator Sessions, will help in that effort.\n  The amendment will also help pay for the unexpected costs of \noperating the missile defense system 24 hours a day over the last \ncouple of weeks. Soldiers who man the system in Colorado and Alaska \nhave performed exceptionally well, and there is cost for keeping the \nsystem on full-time alert status. This amendment helps address this \ncost.\n  This body mandated that the Department of Defense deploy a missile \ndefense system as quickly as technologically possible. I supported this \nmandate and believe that our current missile defense system can provide \na limited defense against a ballistic missile attack. It still needs \nwork, which is why this amendment is so important and necessary.\n  I do support the Sessions amendment and urge my colleagues to do so \nas well. I am pleased to hear that the ranking member on the Armed \nServices Committee has agreed to support this amendment.\n  I thank, again, Senator Sessions, for his leadership on this very \nimportant issue. I think this is a valuable system, and we need to be \nvery sure that we do not get behind in this kind of technology.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and thank the Members for their \nsupport.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of the amendment \nsponsored by the Senator from Alabama, concerning the need to add an \nadditional $45 million to the Missile Defense Agency for testing and \noperations of the ground-based midcourse defense, GMD, system.\n  In December of 2002, the President directed the Department of Defense \nto begin fielding an initial set of missile defense capabilities that \nincluded ground-based interceptors for the defense of the United States \nagainst the long-range ballistic missile threat. Given our total \nvulnerability to that threat, the Missile Defense Agency chose to begin \nthe simultaneous fielding of missile defense interceptors even while \ndevelopmental testing continued to validate the effectiveness of the \nsystem. While this is not a conventional acquisition approach, I \nbelieve it was prudent given the emerging ballistic missile threats we \nexpected to face.\n  Recent North Korean preparations for the test launch of a long-range \nballistic missile confirm the wisdom of the administration's approach: \nwe need to have an emergency missile defense capability in place, even \nwhile development and testing of the system continues.\n  Moreover, I believe Iran's continuing development of longer range \nballistic missiles, coupled with their intention to acquire nuclear \nweapons, also argues for fielding missile defense capabilities as soon \nas technically feasible and in numbers sufficient to stay ahead of the \nthreat.\n  Just last month, from the floor of the Senate, I spoke to my \ncolleagues about how NATO might respond to the greatest threat to \nregional and global stability that we face today: Iran. I noted\n\n[[Page S6369]]\n\nthat I support the principle of preserving as many options as possible \nin diplomacy, and to bolster those diplomatic options, NATO should \nconsider erecting a ``ring of deterrence'' that would surround Iran to \ndeter the use of actual force, as was done so successfully during the \ncold war.\n  I believe that a ground-based interceptor site in Europe, as is being \nproposed by the Department of Defense, would contribute to this \ndeterrence of Iranian--or any other--missile threats, and would be \nconsistent with NATO activities already underway to provide missile \ndefense capabilities for the Alliance in the next decade. Most \nimportant, a missile defense site in Europe would send a message to \nnations developing longer-range missiles that the United States and its \nallies will not be intimidated by the threat of ballistic missiles \narmed with weapons of mass destruction.\n\n  The amendment before us now recognizes the accomplishments of the \nDepartment of Defense in fielding, in such a short time, a limited \nmissile defense system that is now available in an emergency to provide \na measure of protection for the American people against a long-range \nmissile threat--such as the missile that now sits on a North Korean \nlaunch pad.\n  One of the limitations of the current GMD system, however, is that it \nis difficult to maintain the system on alert while it is undergoing the \ntesting necessary to further improve its capability and reliability. To \naddress this limitation, the Missile Defense Agency plans to create the \ninfrastructure and redundant communications links necessary to permit \nthe system to remain on alert even while test events are underway. This \namendment helps advance these plans so that we are better prepared to \naddress the threat posed by the development of a North Korean \nintercontinental ballistic missile.\n  In closing, I would note that in my many years here in the Senate, I \nhave been privileged to participate in many a debate over missile \ndefense. We have examined this issue from every conceivable angle--\ncost, technology, policy, strategy, and diplomacy--and the debate \nalways appeared to me to be somewhat theoretical, since we lacked \nactual missile defense capabilities.\n  But today this is no longer the case. The United States now has a \nlimited capability to defend its territory, deployed forces, and its \nallies against missiles of all ranges. It is a limited capability, to \nbe sure, but one that now provides the President and his senior \nofficials with additional options that can reinforce diplomacy and \ndeterrence or, as a last resort, protect against the growing ballistic \nmissile threat.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I, too, rise in support of this amendment of \nthe Senator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions. It is a modest increase in \nfunding. But as the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee \nsaid, it will enable us to accelerate the pace of testing, which I \nthink we are all supportive of. And as a result, I think it is a good \namendment. I appreciate the support of both the minority and the \nmajority. Because of that, I will not take a long time to detail the \nreasons why I think it is so important.\n  Suffice it to say, with the recent news of the preparations of the \nNorth Koreans and our knowledge that they have been very closely \nconnected to the development of weapon capabilities, in particular the \nmissile capabilities of the Iranians, and given the fact that both of \nthose countries have not only become increasingly capable but \nincreasingly belligerent in recent months and years, it is very obvious \nthat we have to move forward and accelerate our testing and development \nand our deployment of the missile interception system with all the \nspeed we can muster.\n  It is a program that we are developing as we go along, and we are \nlearning a lot in the process. Our most recent tests have been \nsuccessful. We can build on those successes.\n  I am delighted that the missile defense system is receiving the kind \nof support that it needs to receive so that in the years to come, when \nthe American people look back on this and realize that they are \nprotected from a missile attack, they can say it was during these years \nwhen that threat was evolving and developing that we had the fortitude \nto put the money in the program for development and testing that would \nenable us to protect the American people.\n  I remember back, right after 9/11, when the intelligence communities \nwere criticized for not connecting the dots. Now the dots on the \nmissile fronts are pretty clear. We are beginning to get big red \ncircles coming at us with both North Korea and Iran, and others are on \nthe way as well. It is during this period of time, before they become \ncompletely capable then, we have to develop our interceptor \ncapabilities with our ground-based missile systems and the follow-on \nsystems which we are working on as well.\n  I applaud the efforts of my colleague from Alabama and his foresight \nfor proposing this modest increase.\n  I appreciate the support of the ranking minority member on the \ncommittee, and I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona for his \ncomments, and in particular I want to express my appreciation to him \nfor his steadfast leadership to ensure that this Nation has a ballistic \nmissile defense.\n  He was active in this long before 9/11. Ever since he has been in the \nSenate, this has been a long passion of his. I am delighted that he \ncould be here today to share some thoughts about it.\n  The system is not yet where we want it to be. But it has been proved. \nWe have demonstrated hit-to-kill technology on two occasions. Now we \nhave this entire system in place where we have ship-based radar, \nground-based radar, our missile satellite system, and the computers are \ntied all together.\n  I ask my colleague, Senator Kyl, a Member of the leadership in this \nSenate, if he remembers those debates in the late the 1990s--I guess it \nwas when the Cochran-Lieberman bill passed to deploy this system. Maybe \nhe could share some of his thoughts. He must feel some satisfaction to \nknow that we now have a system in place that can give us at least some \nprotection from a missile attack.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will respond quickly to make this point. A \nlot of folks over the years asked, Why has it taken us so long? It is a \ngood question. There are several different answers to it.\n  First of all, this is hard. It is hard to hit a bullet with a bullet. \nIt has taken a lot of time and effort by very smart people.\n  I am glad we were there at the beginning, providing them the \nresources they needed to conduct these kinds of tests and demonstrate \nthat we could really intercept an intercontinental ballistic missile, \nwhich is the equivalent of hitting a bullet with a bullet.\n\n  There were years in which there was opposition to the missile defense \nsystem, in which funding was cut from the program. That crippled the \nprogram and slowed it down. There were times when we were ready to \ndeploy something and then opponents said we don't want to deploy yet, \nwe want to do some more testing. As a result, every time we seemed to \nbe ready to put up something, we were pulled back--all the way back to \nthe early 1980s when Ronald Reagan started talking about this. You have \nto scratch your head and wonder why it has taken us this long to get to \nthis point.\n  I think the most important thing, as the Senator from Alabama pointed \nout, is we are now making tremendous progress. We have a system \ndeployed. It is better with every subsequent test, and as time goes on, \nthe American people can at least begin to feel a little bit more \nsecure. We are not there yet, as everybody has pointed out. But we are \nmaking great progress.\n  Because we worked hard during some of those lean years to keep the \nfunding going and keep the progress going forward, we are at the stage \nwe are today.\n  I thank both Members of the minority and majority for their support \nfor the program this year.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside.\n\n[[Page S6370]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Dodd \nbe added as a cosponsor to the Levin-Reed Iraq amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I might first thank my colleague from \nOklahoma. A few people around here will say they are going to be here \nat a certain time and show up at a certain time. The Senator was \ncommitted to come here at a certain time, and I thank him.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  I want to spend a few minutes, first of all, praising the chairman \nand ranking member of this committee. It is important, I think, that we \nsee the relationships that develop, as well as the standards that have \nbeen developed on this bill, the fact that Chairman Warner was here \nvery late last night, the fact that we are moving forward in an \nexpeditious way.\n  I have several areas and several amendments I am going to call up. I \nwill try to be cooperative as to whether we have votes. But I think the \nissues are important enough that the American people ought to hear the \ndebate about them.\n  I am not under any illusion that will necessarily win some of them. \nBut I think we need to pay attention to them and the debate needs to be \na part of the Record.\n  With that, I call up amendment No. 4454 and ask unanimous consent to \nmodify it with the language of 4491, which I have here in my hand.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, is it possible for the managers to look at \nthis for a moment before it is sent up? I think it would help \nfacilitate matters.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4491, as Modified\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4491, as modified, \nand I ask unanimous consent to make it a first-degree amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4491), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. REFORMS TO THE DEFENSE TRAVEL SYSTEM TO A FEE-FOR-\n                   USE-OF-SERVICE SYSTEM.\n\n       No later than one year after the enactment of this Act, the \n     Secretary of Defense may not obligate or expend any funds \n     related to the Defense Travel System except those funds \n     obtained through a one-time, fixed price service fee per DOD \n     customer utilizing the system with an additional fixed fee \n     for each transaction.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this is a great case for the American \npeople to see what is not operating right in many of the branches of \nour Government.\n  There is a procurement contract that started out 8 years ago. The \ntotal cost was to be $200 million. The idea was to save money on \npurchasing travel vouchers for our military. That was the goal. The \noriginal cost was $246 million. We are now 8 years into this, and we \nare over $464 million. It is working at a 30-percent level. It was \nworking at less than 10 percent last year. Even though we have the GAO \nsaying they may have saved $13 million this year, the fact is that \nstudy didn't consider the fact that the vast majority of time when they \nbuy an airplane ticket they do not get the best price. So that wasn't \neven considered. The purpose of this amendment is to cause us to focus \nagain on what we are doing.\n  There are no-bid contracts, contracts that change in terms of \nviolation of the contracting laws, performance bonuses, pay for back \ncosts, negotiating through the procurement procedure. There is no \nsignificant oversight in this Congress on procurement in the agencies \nof this Government. That has to change. Nobody in the private world \nwould get away with this. Nobody in their personal life would be able \nto get away with this.\n  Yet we have a system now where almost every ticket that is bought \nthrough this $464 million program still has to be checked by a travel \nagent, of which we pay anywhere from $5 to $11 an hour, even though we \nmight have saved $20 on a payment system through the Pentagon.\n  What is the problem? I have worked with the comptroller at the \nPentagon. They were aware of this. The Secretary of Defense is aware of \nit. The chairman is aware of the problem. The ranking member and I have \nhad multiple discussions.\n  The problem is the Pentagon has hundreds of computers that won't talk \nto each other. Instead of fixing that problem, we contract to make a \nsystem that should be off the shelf for less than $59 million, and we \npay $500 million for it so it will speak to all these different \nprograms--and it is not doing it effectively.\n  The purpose of this amendment is to quit sending good money after bad \nand say don't get rid of the program, but let us incentivize the \nprogram. If it is a good program, then let us pay the contractor every \ntime it is used. If it is not used enough, and if it doesn't get used--\nand it is not getting used now because it is too hard to use in the \nvast majority of the cases, most people go straight to a travel agent--\nlet us pay them on a per-transaction basis just like this contractor \nhas on every other travel program that it has with the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Why would we do it differently in the Pentagon? We are doing it \ndifferently because our procurement system is broken in terms of how we \nhold people accountable.\n  I have nothing against the contractor.\n  If you would let me continue to do a program and not perform and \ncontinue to give me money, I will take it. But what it is doing is \nbreeding incompetency. It is wasting taxpayer dollars, and we ought to \nsay there is a point in time.\n  What do we know about travel systems in the Federal Government? What \nwe know is in five other agencies they don't have any problems at all, \ntwo of which were developed by their same contractor.\n  Why are we having problems here? One of them is because we have a \ncost-plus contract. What is the incentive to fix the problem? There is \nnot any because it is going to continue to be renewed.\n  This amendment says very simply change the incentive. If this is a \ngood program--Oh, I know. This doesn't say throw the money out or throw \nthe program out.\n  It says, change the program to incentivize it to be operational. It \nis in less than 30 percent of our military bases now. It is still not \nused. The one place it has been used is one Air Force base where it was \nmandated by the commander: You will use this system.\n  Do you know what the utilization rate is? Ninety percent. And the \ncost in terms of getting it done is about three times the benefit in \nterms of savings for paying for the bill.\n  On that same Air Force base, over 50 percent of the time they never \nget the cheapest fare, so what we save in terms of paying--the actual \naccounting work within the Pentagon, which I agree is a worthy goal--we \nlose because the system does not find the best fare.\n  As a matter of fact, most Pentagon employees would be better off to \ngo to Travelocity or Orbitz, buy their own ticket on their own dime, \nget reimbursed, and the Pentagon can do it cheaper than with this.\n  This is a very straightforward amendment. It says don't get rid of \nthe defense travel system, keep it going, but fund it on a per-\ntransaction basis that says if this is good for the Pentagon, then use \nit and we will pay for it. That incentivizes the contractor to make it \neasy, to make it useful, and to get our value for it. Isn't half a \nbillion enough to pay for a travel system that you could have bought \noff the shelf for $50 million? It reflects on what we have as problems \nwithin the Pentagon.\n  Let me touch on that. I am a supporter of the Pentagon. I am a \nsupporter of our Defense Secretary. He has told me this is one of the \nareas where they have great problems. Last year, the Pentagon paid $6 \nbillion in performance bonuses to contractors who\n\n[[Page S6371]]\n\ndid not meet their performance requirements. Think about that for a \nminute. That means if you are told where you work: If you meet a \ncertain expectation you are going to get a bonus, except we will pay \nyou even if you do not meet that expectation--what are you going to \nthink next year? You are going to think: I don't have to meet the \nexpectation because I am going to get paid.\n  That is exactly what is happening within our contracting within the \nPentagon and several other agencies within the Federal Government.\n  I ask the chairman and the ranking member to consider this. I believe \nit is a way to straighten out a contract and also send a signal. At \nbest, we are going to have a $350 billion deficit this year. Should we \nspend our kids' and grandkids' money in an inefficient way? This is a \ngood message we ought to send so other contractors see it. You will not \nget a cost-plus contract if you do not perform, and you are not going \nto continue to have contracts renewed.\n  There are a lot of other details, and I ask unanimous consent to have \nthem printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                               Background\n\n       The Defense Travel System, DTS, is an end-to-end electronic \n     travel system intended to integrate all travel functions, \n     from authorization through ticket purchase to accounting for \n     the Department of Defense. The system was initiated in 1998 \n     and it was supposed to be fully deployed by 2002. DTS is \n     currently in the final phase of a six-year contract that \n     expires September 30, 2006. In its entire history, the system \n     has never met a deadline, never stayed within cost estimates, \n     and never performed adequately.\n       To date, DTS has cost the taxpayers $474 million--a \n     staggering $200 million more than it was originally projected \n     to cost.\n       In short, the American taxpayer has funded a project that \n     is FOUR YEARS behind schedule, is deployed in barely half of \n     the 11,000 DOD travel sites, cannot be relied upon to provide \n     DOD travelers with the lowest available airfare, and is \n     plagued with contracting problems.\n       And yet . . . Congress continues to fund this broken \n     system.\n       This amendment prohibits continued funding of DTS and \n     instead shifting to the fixed price per transaction e-travel \n     systems used by government agencies in the civilian sector, \n     as set up under General Services Administration, GSA, \n     contracts.\n\n\n                       DTS is far behind schedule\n\n       According to testimony given by Thomas F. Gimble, Acting \n     Inspector General Department of Defense, before the Senate \n     Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations on September 29, \n     2005, ``The Defense Travel System was at `high risk' for not \n     being an effective solution to streamlining the DOD travel \n     management process. Furthermore, DTS experienced significant \n     testing and deployment problems.''\n       By comparison, according to a March 6, 2006 GSA internal \n     review of its own in-house Program Management Office for e-\n     travel systems, two/thirds of civilian agencies fully \n     deployed their systems on time.\n       In a January 2006 report, GAO noted that DTS, as originally \n     envisioned, was to commence within 120 days after the \n     effective date of contract award in September 1998, with \n     complete deployment to approximately 11,000 locations by \n     April 2002. However, that date has been changed to September \n     2006--a slippage of over 4 years.\n\n\n                       DTS is not being utilized\n\n       Dr. Scott A. Comes of Program Analysis and Evaluation in \n     the Defense Department testified last year that the estimated \n     savings projected for DTS assumed a utilization rate of 60 \n     percent in the first year of operation, rising to 90 percent \n     thereafter.\n       In actuality, the utilization rate for DTS was \n     approximately zero through 2004, reached approximately 15 \n     percent in 2005 and now in the last year of the contract \n     period remains about 30 percent. It is already too late for \n     DTS ever to recover the enormous investment that has been \n     wasted on it.\n       Furthermore, DTS fails to find the lowest applicable \n     airfare in a significant number of cases. Industry expert \n     Robert Langsfeld, who did a comparative study of DTS with the \n     three civilian e-travel systems approved by GSA, testified \n     last year that DTS performed less efficiently than any of the \n     civilian GSA systems.\n       According to GAO testimony before the PSI Committee, during \n     fiscal years 2001 and 2002, DOD spent almost $124 million on \n     airline tickets that included at least one leg of the trip in \n     premium class--usually business class.\n       Because of control breakdowns within DTS, DOD paid for \n     airline tickets that were neither used nor processed for \n     refund--amounting to about 58,000 tickets totaling more than \n     $21 million. Based on limited data provided by the airlines \n     to GAO, it is possible that the unused value of the fully and \n     partially-used airline tickets that DOD has purchased could \n     be at least $100 million during the lifespan of DTS.\n       GAO also found that DOD sometimes paid twice for the same \n     airline ticket through DTS. Based on GAO's mining of limited \n     data, the potential magnitude of the improper payments was \n     27,000 transactions for over $8 million.\n       In GAO's latest report, January 2006, they examined \n     agencies that continue to use existing legacy travel systems \n     at locations where DTS is already deployed! This means that \n     all of the proclaimed savings that DTS was supposed to reap \n     are nowhere to be found--because DOD continues to use legacy \n     systems to do the same thing.\n       A blatant example of the waste from the use of these two \n     systems can be seen in the way that travel vouchers are \n     processed: According to an April 13, 2005, memorandum from \n     the Assistant Secretary of the Army, Financial Management and \n     Comptroller, from October 2004 to February 2005, at locations \n     where DTS had been deployed, the Army paid the Defense \n     Finance and Accounting Service, DFAS--the system where the \n     majority of DOD payments are routed through--approximately $6 \n     million to process 177,000 travel vouchers manually, or $34 \n     per travel voucher, versus about $186,000 to process 84,000 \n     travel vouchers electronically, $2.22 per travel voucher. \n     Overall, for this 5 month period, the Army reported that it \n     spent about $5.6 million more to process these travel \n     vouchers manually as opposed to electronically using DTS.\n       This example here shows that DTS is not even being \n     utilized! Why in the world are we--the Congress--continuing \n     to fund two duplicative travel payment systems at DOD which \n     has proven to lose millions of dollars in a matter of months?\n\n\n                 Testing of the System is Not Accurate\n\n       In a January 2006 GAO Report, GAO found that testing for \n     selected requirements for display of flights and airfares was \n     ``ineffective in ensuring that the promised capability was \n     delivered as intended.''\n       This means that not only is DTS not performing, the current \n     system is incapable of testing properly in order to determine \n     what is required in order to meet DOD's plan.\n       Further, DOD could not prove that DOD travelers even had \n     access to the flights that were available for travel. There \n     is no doubt such a flaw would have produced higher travel \n     costs.\n       Confirming the problems with DTS, their own officials \n     acknowledged that this problem has existed before deployment \n     of the system--since 2002. In August 2005, DTS officials \n     stated that the problem was corrected and went ahead with \n     deploying the system.\n\n\n                       DTS is not cost effective\n\n       DTS is claiming that they saved over $13 million this year, \n     but their spokesman was unable to say in comparison to what. \n     Apparently that ``savings'' is the amount estimated in \n     reduced paperwork and accounting, estimated at about $20 per \n     transaction. This does not take into account the numerous \n     instances in which DTS fails to display the lowest applicable \n     airfare, the necessity to hand-check all its transactions, or \n     the fact that the great bulk of DOD travel is still arranged \n     through old-fashioned conventional travel agents. The alleged \n     savings are completely illusory.\n       Under the DTS contract Northrop is being paid millions of \n     dollars each month for operation and maintenance, training, \n     help desk, development and deployment--regardless of the \n     actual extent of use by DOD travelers. In addition, DOD is \n     also paying travel agents, commercial travel managers, fees \n     ranging from $5.25 to $12.50 to perform a travel transaction \n     using DTS, the agent still has to buy the ticket and perform \n     other administrative functions, and higher fees, up to $23, \n     if a travel agent has to ``touch'' or assist in completing \n     or correcting a DTS transaction.\n       Under the GSA Contract DOD would pay only $5.25 per \n     transaction to whichever of three contractors won the \n     contract. GSA e-travel systems are fully automated and do not \n     require the assistance of a travel agent. Ironically, one of \n     the three GSA-approved vendors for e-travel for civilian \n     agencies is Northrop Grumman, the company that holds the DTS \n     contract.\n\n\n                 DTS is beset with contracting problems\n\n       The facts show that DTS is another instance of a \n     guaranteed-profit, cost-plus contract. The government is \n     responsible for paying all of the costs of the system in \n     addition to the amount the contractor receives as profit.\n       The original DTS contract provided for compensation on a \n     per-transaction basis--pay for performance. By April 2001, \n     after years of testing failures, it was clear that the \n     original DTS would not work and the contract was secretly \n     rewritten.\n       In 2002, the DOD and TRW, later purchased by Northrup \n     Grumman, secretly negotiated a total restructure of the \n     contract, in which the government agreed to pay for all the \n     of losses sustained to date by the DTS contractor and to \n     shift from a pay for performance to a cost-plus arrangement.\n       DOD has paid Northrop Grumman over $264 million to develop \n     DTS, when this program was supposed to be fully operational \n     in 2001 and development costs were to be at no cost to the \n     Federal government in the original contract.\n       Another contract change was an agreement by the government \n     to pay the $43.7 million that had been spent in development \n     costs by the original contractor, subsequently acquired by \n     Northrop Grumman. We got absolutely nothing for that money; \n     it\n\n[[Page S6372]]\n\n     just covered the losses covered by the contractor when the \n     original contract stipulated that the contractor would bear \n     all risks for the development and deployment of DTS.\n       Last year Judge George Miller of the Federal Court of \n     Claims decided that he would not even look into allegations \n     of violations of the Competition in Contracting Act because \n     the software and source codes are owned by the contractor, so \n     if the contract were opened for bidding and another bidder \n     was awarded the contract, the Government would have nothing \n     left than a $500 million loss. But just a week before the \n     September 29, 2005 hearing of the Senate Permanent \n     Subcommittee on Investigations the contractor promised to \n     transfer ownership of this intellectual property to the \n     Defense Department at the end of the contract period if \n     requested, ostensibly to maintain the fiction that the open \n     bidding on the contract in 2006 is on the level. Ownership of \n     DTS seems to bounce around to wherever it is most convenient \n     to avoid serious scrutiny.\n       The Director, Defense Finance and Accounting Service, \n     testified before the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on \n     Investigations in September 2005, and promised that when \n     Northrop Grumman's contract expired on September 30, 2006, \n     the DTS contract would be re-bid.\n       However, this pledge has proved to be false. In February \n     2006, the Program Director, Defense Travel System Program \n     Management Office, admitted to the Court of Federal Claims \n     that when Northrop Grumman's contract expired on September \n     30, 2006, DOD planned to extend it on a sole source basis to \n     Northrop Grumman through September 30, 2007 for an additional \n     $20 million.\n\n\n             Agencies currently using GSA's E-travel system\n\n       Northrop Grumman's e-travel system has been in use at the \n     Department of Transportation for six months. Northrop also \n     has GSA e-travel contracts with the Environmental Protection \n     Agency, Department of Energy, and the Department of Health \n     and Human Services and it is likely that it will reach early \n     full deployment in each of these.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. There were violations in contracting law with this. There \nwere promises made last year when we had this same discussion in the \nSenate that certain things were happening that did not happen in terms \nof this contract. There is no question there has been some improvement, \nbut they have not achieved a level that would say we are anywhere close \nto the level of making this an efficient system.\n  Mr. WARNER. If I can address the Senator with regard to this \namendment, it is an amendment the Senate has visited before.\n  I would like to have the Senator's observation of whether my \ninformation is correct. The Senator has been at this 2 years. I commend \nthe Senator for that work. As a consequence of that work, the \nDepartment has done some things, have they not?\n  Mr. COBURN. They have.\n  Mr. WARNER. It has been told to me that 95 percent of the Senator's \ngoals have been achieved and that by October 1 of this year, it will be \n100 percent.\n  Mr. COBURN. The actual numbers on utilization of this system, if the \nSenator can bear with me for a minute, the utilization rate right now \nis 30 percent in the military. In other words, 3 out of 10 facilities \nthat purchase travel are utilizing this. If that is what we wanted when \nwe contracted it, great. But that is not what was in the contract.\n  This same contractor, by the way, had a system developed through the \nDepartment of Transportation 6 months ago that is working just fine.\n  I portend that proves the problem with the system is the contracting, \nnot the contractor. We ought to send a signal. Say it is 90 percent, if \nthat is the case, they will make more money doing it on a per-\ntransaction basis than they would under a contract basis.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, my friend is an expert on this, and I \nfreely admit I am not.\n  Mr. COBURN. I am not an expert, but I don't like waste. I think we \nhave wasted money.\n  Mr. WARNER. It is represented to me the DTS, the defense system is \nnot merely a travel booking system, but it has much broader \nfunctionality than any of the Federal Government e-travel systems. In \nshort, DTS is an end-to-end accounting system that automatically \nhandles the entire range of otherwise very expensive and time-consuming \nmanual tasks associated with DOD travel.\n  Any fair comparison has to begin with the fact that DTS offers an \nend-to-end travel management capability that incorporates military \nentitlements and DOD travel policies, and e-travel services simply do \nnot.\n  Mr. COBURN. Early in my statement I made this point: We are fixing \nthe wrong problem. The problem is the computer system. The reason this \nis so expensive, the computer systems in the Pentagon do not talk to \none another. We have designed a monstrous computer system to make it \ntalk to all these systems that will not talk to one another rather than \nto fix the computer system in the Pentagon to make them talk to one \nanother.\n  If we do that on every project that we need to enhance and overfill \nfor the Pentagon, we are going to get into the same problem. They make \nall their money by being able to pay the bill. But it is a travel \nsystem.\n  If they make efficiency in terms of being able to pay the bill--which \nis the problem the Pentagon was having--we ought to also expect them to \nget the fares right and not have to pay another $6 to a travel agent \nfor every ticket they write, to doublecheck to see if the system was \nright. That is what is happening.\n  When you say 90 percent, that is 90 percent, plus we are having the \ntravel agents check it. It is not an automated system.\n  Have they made improvements? Yes, I do not deny that. But if they are \nwhere they need to be, and if their contract as originally specified \nand modified, if they are at 90 percent, they will make a ton more \nmoney on a per-transaction basis, and we will get what we need and they \nwill get what they need.\n  But they are not. That is why we have the resistance to a transaction \nbasis. You cannot have it both ways. If they are at 90 percent, any \nprudent businessman would say: Sure, we want it on a transaction basis. \nIf they are not at 90 percent, if they are at 30 percent, as I propose \nthey are, and inefficiently at 30 percent, the reason they want a \ncontract through next year is because they are going to make a lot more \nmoney than they would on the transaction basis.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I continue to be very depressed by the \nknowledge that this Senator has on the subject. I freely admit that I \ndo not have the depth of knowledge.\n  I understand initially the amendment called for a study. Then, as \nprovided under the rules of the Senate, the Senator modified the \namendment, and it is now a very specific piece of legislation that I am \nadvised could well end the program.\n  Somewhere between a study and trying to end the program, should the \nSenator prevail, there must be a basis on which we can have an \naccommodation so I can accept some measure to meet the Senator's goals \nand incorporate it in the bill, assuming my distinguished ranking \nmember will accept my recommendation.\n  Mr. President, why doesn't the Senator go to his next amendment? In \nthe meantime staff can go to work.\n  Mr. COBURN. I will gladly do that, and I am happy to work with you.\n  I make a final point. Supposedly, this contract is going to be out \nfor bid at the end of this year. It was supposed to have been out for \nbid last year. They renewed the contract without putting it out for \nbid, so I don't have any hope it will go out, first.\n  And, No. 2, nobody is going to bid on this. It is a mess. Nobody is \ngoing to bid on it. The only person you will have bid on it is the \noriginal contractor. Whether that is accurate or not, I am willing to \nwork with the chairman to bring down the costs.\n  The fact is, the real problem is the computer systems in the \nPentagon. We all know that. The Senator is aware of it, the ranking \nmember is aware of it. The comptroller is working hard to change that. \nThat is a 4- to 7-year program that we have embarked on which everyone \nknows has to happen.\n  Here is my worry: I will be back here next year doing the same thing \nbecause it is still not going to work. That is my worry. That is not \nfair to our grandkids.\n  Mr. WARNER. I say that is not fair to the men and women of the Armed \nForces who use this program.\n  I am not trying to keep in place something that is not adequately \nserving this constituency and the Department of Defense. I would rather \nput in a fix if I can get in my mind what that fix can be. The \namendment could virtually bring what is in existence at DTS to a \nstandstill.\n  Mr. COBURN. If I could ask the chairman a question, if, in fact, it \nis at 90 percent, as the contractor says it is,\n\n[[Page S6373]]\n\nthen by the contract they should have already converted over to a per-\ntransaction plan. So why haven't they? They haven't because it is not \nat 90 percent because they would be making a whole lot more money if it \nwas.\n  I am happy to ask unanimous consent to set this amendment and discuss \nother amendments and work with the Senator and his staff prior to the \nvoting or conclusion of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the cooperation of the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4365\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, if it is acceptable to the chairman, I \nwould like about 10 minutes, maybe less, to talk about a managers' \namendment that has been accepted by the chairman and ranking member, to \nput in the record how important I think this is regarding military \nretirement, Guard and Reserves.\n  Mr. WARNER. We certainly want to accommodate the Senator. I suggest \nat the conclusion of the presentation of this next amendment.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I apologize.\n  Mr. COBURN. I am happy to let the Senator from South Carolina \nintervene for a short period of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina has the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I will be very brief.\n  One, I thank the chairman and ranking member for their willingness to \nhelp Senator Chambliss and Senator Clinton and myself with a package of \nreforms that would be very beneficial to the Guard and Reserves \nregarding Reserve retirement.\n  Right now, the current system will not allow you to retire until you \nare 60. You can serve your 20 years, 30 years, but you have to wait \nuntil you are 60 to get your retirement. We are trying to incentivize \nthose Guard and Reserves to take part in active-duty operations, and if \nyou are called up to active duty involuntarily, for every 90 days a \nmember spends on active duty, from September 11 forward, you will get a \nday-for-day credit in terms of retirement. If you serve a whole year on \nactive duty, voluntarily or involuntarily, you could retire at 59.\n  We have had this scored. It is minimum cost. But I can assure you it \nwill go a long way in the Guard and Reserve community as a much needed \nreform.\n  It will be well received by our troops. It will be good for them and \ntheir families. Quite honestly, the level of commitment, the level of \nActive Duty service is on par with World War II among the Guard and \nReserves, and it is the least we can do. This will certainly benefit \nour guardsmen and reservists and their families. I appreciate the \nchairman and ranking member putting it in the managers' package.\n  I have enjoyed working with Senators Chambliss and Clinton on this \nissue. The reduced retirement provision was from Senator Chambliss. It \nwas his amendment. And we used his amendment also to improve health \ncare for the Guard and Reserves.\n  What we have done--there is a three-tiered system. For every 90 days \nyou are called to active duty, you get a year of TRICARE at a 28-\npercent premium share rate, which is the same as for Federal employees. \nEveryone who works in our offices as Federal employees pays 28 percent \nof the cost of their Federal health care. The only group in the Federal \nGovernment not to have Federal health care were the Guard and Reserves. \nWe fixed that last year. And we are going to have a change in the \nallocation.\n  Tier 2: If you are an unemployed or an uninsured guardsman or \nreservist, we are going to have a 50-50 cost share. If you are in the \nprivate sector with health care, and you want to come into TRICARE, to \nhave continuity of health care, not bouncing back and forth, we are \ngoing to have a 75-25 share. So if you want to get out of your private-\nsector health care and come into TRICARE, you will have to pay 75 \npercent. That will be down from 85 percent. We put a cap on premium \ngrowth rates.\n  The entire package, from allowing people to retire early if they \nserve on active duty, voluntarily or involuntarily, is a great idea. \nBalancing out the premiums to be paid will go a long way to make our \nGuard and Reserve family members and Active Duty and military members \nmore appreciated. And it will certainly help them with their budget \nproblems, because we all know how costly health care is.\n  I have introduced a separate stand-alone bill that would allow every \nguardsman and reservist who is eligible for TRICARE to participate in \npremium conversions. It would allow them to have their TRICARE premiums \non a pretax basis, like every other Federal employee. That is a stand-\nalone bill. We will do it later.\n  I thank Senator Chambliss for coming up with a package that would \nallow military members and the Guard and Reserves to get credit for \ntheir active service in terms of retiring below age 60. Senator Clinton \nand I have worked for several years on TRICARE benefits for guardsmen \nand reservists. I think we have improved that benefit in a very \nreasonable way. I put that on the record and hope every Member of the \nSenate will appreciate what we have done because our guardsmen and \nreservists have served above and beyond the call of duty.\n  Mr. President, I now yield to Senator Clinton, who, as I have \nindicated, has been with us every step of the way, leading on this \nissue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am honored and delighted to join my \nvoice along with my colleagues, Senator Graham and Senator Chambliss, \nand thank them for their efforts.\n  Today, we have made further progress in improving benefits for \nNational Guard members and reservists. This bill makes great strides in \nimproving retirement benefits for reservists and Guard members who \nserve for longer periods. For every consecutive 90 days a member spent \nin an active Federal status, the age at which they receive their \nretirement annuity would be decreased by 3 months. The lowest a member \ncould collect retirement pay as a result of this provision would be age \n50. The age at which they would qualify for health care benefits would \nnot decrease.\n  Any Guard or Reserve member who is called or ordered to active duty, \nor volunteers for active duty, would qualify. This will greatly help us \nwith recruitment and especially retention. We have a problem in our \nReserve component which has been under great stress over the last \nseveral years.\n  Last year, thanks to the leadership of Senator Graham, we made great \nprogress in expanding access to TRICARE. All members of the Selected \nReserve are eligible to enroll in TRICARE, and we created a separate \ncategory based on whether a Guard member or reservist had been \ndeployed.\n  Category one, for members of the Selected Reserves who have been \nactivated: Members would accumulate 1 year of TRICARE coverage for \nevery year of service and would only have to pay 28 percent of the \ncost. Category two established a 50-50 cost share for those without \nhealth insurance owing to unemployment or lack of employer-provided \ncoverage. And category three was for the remainder of members of the \nSelective Reserve who did not fit in the other categories, allowing \nthem to buy into coverage at an 85 percent cost share.\n  Our improvements this year will allow small businesses with fewer \nthan 20 employees to qualify for the 50-50 cost share. And it reduces \nthe amount paid, by those who qualify for category three, to 75 \npercent.\n  This is not only a win-win for Guard members and reservists. This is \na win-win for our military services and for our country. We are sending \na clear message--not just rhetoric, not just rah-rah--but a very clear, \nsolemn message to those who volunteer to be our citizen soldiers. \nPerhaps in the past they might have thought they would have a weekend a \nmonth, 2 weeks in the summer. Well, now they know they are part of the \nwar against terrorism. They are on call literally at any moment.\n  What we found is that when we began to activate those Guard and \nReserve members, 20 to 25 percent of them were found to be medically \nunready. They had physical problems. They had dental problems. They \nwere not ready because they did not have health insurance. They fell \ninto the category of Americans who go without health care because they \ncannot afford it or their employer does not provide it.\n\n[[Page S6374]]\n\n  So in addition to the work I have been privileged to do with Senator \nGraham on health care benefits, and under the leadership of Senator \nChambliss with respect to retirement, we have really sent a great \nmessage to our men and women in the Guard and Reserve that we care \nabout you. We care about your families. We value your service. And we \nwant you to know that when it comes to retirement and health care, your \ncountry is grateful.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4370\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and that amendment No. 4370 be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4370.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require notice to Congress and the public on earmarks of \n             funds available to the Department of Defense)\n\n       At the end of subtitle A of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1008. REPORTS TO CONGRESS AND NOTICE TO PUBLIC ON \n                   EARMARKS IN FUNDS AVAILABLE TO THE DEPARTMENT \n                   OF DEFENSE.\n\n       (a) Annual Report and Notice Required.--The Secretary of \n     Defense shall submit to Congress, and post on the Internet \n     website of the Department of Defense available to the public, \n     each year information as follows:\n       (1) A description of each earmark of funds made available \n     to the Department of Defense for the previous fiscal year, \n     including the location (by city, State, country, and \n     congressional district if relevant) in which the earmarked \n     funds are to be utilized, the purpose of such earmark (if \n     known), and the recipient of such earmark.\n       (2) The total cost of administering each such earmark \n     including the amount of such earmark, staff time, \n     administrative expenses, and other costs.\n       (3) The total cost of administering all such earmarks.\n       (4) An assessment of the utility of each such earmark in \n     meeting the goals of the Department, set forth using a rating \n     system as follows:\n       (A) A for an earmark that directly advances the primary \n     goals of the Department or an agency, element, or component \n     of the Department.\n       (B) B for an earmark that advances many of the primary \n     goals of the Department or an agency, element, or component \n     of the Department.\n       (C) C for an earmark that may advance some of the primary \n     goals of the Department or an agency, element, or component \n     of the Department.\n       (D) D for an earmark that cannot be demonstrated as being \n     cost-effective in advancing the primary goals of the \n     Department or any agency, element, or component of the \n     Department.\n       (E) F for an earmark that distracts from or otherwise \n     impedes that capacity of the Department to meet the primary \n     goals of the Department.\n       (b) Earmark Defined.--In this section, the term ``earmark'' \n     means a provision of law, or a directive contained within a \n     joint explanatory statement or report accompanying a \n     conference report or bill (as applicable), that specifies the \n     identity of an entity, program, project, or service, \n     including a defense system, to receive assistance not \n     requested by the President and the amount of the assistance \n     to be so received.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this is an amendment that is going to have \nsome emotion with it. I want to talk about it first. There is no \nquestion when it comes to the wisdom of many of the Members of our body \nthat directing the Pentagon to do certain things is valuable. We know \nthat from anecdotal experience. But what we don't know is how many \ntimes we have told them to do something that has been a complete waste. \nWhat I am talking about are earmarks in the Defense authorization bill \nas well as in the Defense appropriations bill.\n  There is a wonderful body of knowledge, plus an institutional \nknowledge, here that helps give wisdom to direct the Armed Services. I \nbelieve we ought to be in that position. What this amendment does is \nask for a report. I want to explain, for a second--and I want the \nAmerican public to see--what has happened in terms of earmarks.\n  In 1994, there were $4.2 billion worth of earmarks in the Defense \nappropriations bill. Last year, there were $9.4 billion. The question \nwe should be asking is not whether or not there should be earmarks, but \nwhat is the result of those earmarks? What is the consequence of the \nearmarks? Not only were the numbers up, the dollars up, but the numbers \nhave skyrocketed.\n  So the question which I think would be prudent for us to ask is, No. \n1: Earmarks are consuming a larger percentage of defense dollars. They \nalso, according to Pentagon reports and some Members of this body, are \ntaking money away from other priorities that are deemed to be higher a \nlot of the time. They also account for some of the problems we are \nhaving in the emergency supplementals and adding to the rising cost of \nour debt. Many times they are not needed, but, in fact, they are \nassociated with benefiting a region or an industry that is not \nnecessarily in the highest priority.\n  So this is not about eliminating earmarks. This is about looking at \nearmarks and saying: What are we getting for them? Where are they \nworking great for us? Where are they not working? Are they beneficial \nto the defense of this country? Is it something that gives us a \nbenefit?\n  The other thing I would remind us of is, in the most recent history \nwe have seen an ethical lapse in association with some earmarks, and we \nhave actually seen some criminal behavior in association with earmarks. \nThat ought to be a part of the report as well.\n  So the whole idea is to add transparency and accountability to \nearmarks. Let's look at them. What are we getting for them? What are we \nlosing? What are the opportunity costs that are lost because we have \nthem there? The total annual cost of earmarks in Defense appropriations \nbills would be put in this report.\n  We can determine the actual numbers of earmarks and the actual price \ntags. But we don't know the hidden costs of those earmarks, which \ninclude staff time and administration. And we don't know the \nopportunity cost of those earmarks: What did not happen for our \nsoldiers, what did not happen in terms of procurement because we put in \nsomething else of maybe a lesser priority?\n  The annual report will provide Congress and the public a more \ncomplete understanding of the total cost of the earmarks to the \nDepartment of Defense, the purpose and location of each earmark, and an \nanalysis of the usefulness of each earmark in advancing the goals of \nthe Department of Defense. This will provide Members of Congress a more \ncomplete view of the cost-effectiveness of each project and whether \nthose projects warrant continued funding.\n  The last amendment we were on started as an earmark. I remind the \nMembers of this body, it started at $200 million, and now will have \ngrown to over $500 million in initiatives and earmarks, but we did not \nhave the benefit of a report such as this to see if we were getting \nvalue for this money.\n  This is a simple amendment. It is not going after earmarks. It is not \nsaying they are bad. It is not saying they are good. What it is saying \nis: Shouldn't this body know? Shouldn't we know the impact, positively \nand negatively? Shouldn't we know the lost opportunity cost?\n  I hope both the ranking member and the chairman of this committee \nwill give this amendment consideration. And I ask for their response.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the managers are working to try to resolve \na number of issues in the hopes we can complete this bill. I will \neventually reply to the Senator from Georgia. I wonder if at this time, \nwithout losing the floor, he will yield to his colleague to speak on \nanother matter.\n  Mr. COBURN. I say to the Senator, I will be happy to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and thank my good \nfriend from Oklahoma for yielding for just a minute.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4365\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to address amendment No. 4365, \ncosponsored by myself, Senator Graham, Senator Clinton, and Senator \nBurns.\n  This amendment, which I am speaking on today, makes what I believe is \na\n\n[[Page S6375]]\n\nrelatively minor but very important adjustment to the Reserve \nretirement system. My amendment would lower the age at which a \nreservist can receive their retirement annuity by 3 months--counting \ndown from age 60--for every 90 days a reservist spends on active duty \nduring a fiscal year.\n  This amendment specifically rewards the members of the Guard and \nReserve who have been called or ordered for active duty, interrupted \ntheir civilian lives for an extended period of time, and in many cases \nplaced themselves in harm's way in defense of their country.\n  Currently, the average reservist, if they collect any retirement pay \nat all, receives a small fraction of the annuity that an Active Duty \nmember receives. If this amendment becomes law, that percentage will \nrise slightly. But in no way will this amendment result in a major \nchange with large financial implications.\n  I do not have a formal CBO estimate for the current version. However, \nbased on CBO scoring for an earlier version, I suggest the cost of this \namendment will be approximately $300 million over 5 years. There have \nbeen several other bills and amendments related to Reserve retirement \nintroduced in Congress, and for the sake of comparison, I believe my \namendment provides the right incentives and rewards. It is also the \nleast costly alternative which has been offered so far.\n  I believe this amendment is significant and important because it \nrecognizes the increased contributions our reservists are making, \nrewards them for their service in the global war on terrorism, and \nprovides reservists in the middle of their careers with an incentive to \nstay on board. I have received great feedback from the Department of \nDefense on this amendment because it provides incentives for \nvolunteers, provides motivation for retention, and is relatively low \ncost.\n  The Reserve Officers Association of America, the National Guard \nAssociation of the United States, the Naval Reserve Association, the \nReserve Enlisted Association, and several other military associations \nalso support the amendment and see it as an important, responsible step \nforward in support of our reservists.\n  With the coauthorship of my good friends Senator Graham of South \nCarolina and Senator Clinton of New York, this amendment also makes two \nimportant changes to the current laws related to TRICARE by allowing \nsmall businesses under 20 to participate in the 50-50 cost share in the \nTRICARE program and changing third tier beneficiaries from paying 85 \npercent to 75 percent. These are important changes, which benefit our \nmen and women in the Guard and Reserve and further provide for the \nhealth care benefits of our servicemembers in a way that is affordable \nand enhances their service.\n  I commend its inclusion in the bill. It has been a pleasure to work \nwith Senators Graham and Clinton, as well as Senator Burns, on this \nmatter. We have had great cooperation from both the chairman and \nranking member. I can't tell them how much we appreciate this.\n  This is the No. 1 issue of the Guard and Reserve this year. It is \ngoing to be a great package. I commend Senator Graham for his hard \nwork, Senator Clinton for her hard work, as well as Senator Burns for \nhis hard work on this issue. I appreciate very much the cooperation of \nthe staff, as well as the chairman and ranking member, in making sure \nthat we continue to look after our men and women in the Guard and \nReserve who are being called up all the more often than we have ever \nanticipated and all the more often than what they anticipated.\n  The chairman and ranking member have accepted the amendment, and I am \nappreciative of that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4471, as Modified\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I know in a few moments we will be voting. \nI did want to come to the floor and speak strongly in support of the \nSessions missile defense amendment.\n  More than 23 years have passed since President Reagan announced his \nStrategic Defense Initiative--the idea that our Nation should develop \nthe ability to protect itself against the threat of missile attack by \nbeing able to shoot down incoming missiles.\n  President Reagan's idea has been very controversial ever since it was \nannounced.\n  For some reason there has always been a very substantial school of \nthought, especially on the other side of the aisle, that we are better \noff being defenseless against missile attack; that instead of being \nable to shoot down incoming missiles, we should rely instead \nexclusively on the threat that we will strike back after someone else \nattacks us first.\n  This policy of intentional vulnerability--of intentionally exposing \nour cities and our people to the threat of missile attack--has never \nmade sense to me or to the American people.\n  But that hasn't stopped repeated efforts over the years by opponents \nof missile defense to reduce or even eliminate funding for research, \ndevelopment, and deployment of missile defenses.\n  Fortunately, Republican administrations and Republican Congresses \nover the last 23 years have fought to continue our national investment \nin missile defense.\n  Thanks to our efforts, our Nation today has a number of missile \ndefense systems and components in place, including a total of 11 \nground-based midcourse interceptors fielded in Alaska and California, \nand more are on the way.\n  This system is working today to defend the American people.\n  As Assistant Secretary of Defense Peter Flory testified 3 months ago \nbefore a House committee:\n\n       The United States today has all of the pieces in place \n     needed to intercept an incoming long-range ballistic missile: \n     ground based interceptors in Alaska and California; a network \n     of ground, sea, and space-based sensors; a command and \n     control network; and most importantly, trained servicemen \n     and women ready to operate the system. Our ballistic \n     missile defense system today is primarily oriented toward \n     continued development and testing. But we are confident \n     that it could intercept a long-range ballistic missile if \n     called upon to do so.\n       The existence of this system, rudimentary though it may be, \n     is a great source of comfort to the American people, \n     especially as we confront the threat that North Korea may \n     test fire an ICBM eastward across the Pacific Ocean any day \n     now.\n       No less an expert than Dr. William J. Perry, President \n     Clinton's Secretary of Defense, has seen the risk of such a \n     test launch by North Korea as sufficiently threatening to \n     America to justify a preemptive U.S. attack on the North \n     Korean ICBM while it is still sitting on its launch pad.\n       Secretary Perry, in his op-ed in today's Washington Post, \n     acknowledges that attacking the North Korean ICBM on the \n     ground in North Korea would be a high-risk action that could \n     lead to war between the United States and North Korea.\n       I certainly want to avoid a war with North Korea if at all \n     possible. At the same time, I cannot disagree with Secretary \n     Perry that North Korea's missile program poses a great threat \n     to our Nation that we cannot ignore.\n       It was precisely to avoid having to choose between \n     preemptive war and defenselessness that our Nation has been \n     pursuing missile defense for the last 23 years.\n\n  Senator Session's amendment underscores and increases our Nation's \ncommitment to missile defense by increasing the funding for it in this \nbill by $45 million.\n  It is a worthy amendment that builds on the commitment that many of \nus have demonstrated over the years to missile defense.\n  I understand that the distinguished ranking member, Senator Levin, \nhas expressed his support for the amendment, which I welcome--not only \nbecause I value his support, but also because, it renews my faith in \nthe power of redemption.\n  I know we will be voting shortly, but I urge strong support of the \nSessions amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for his \ncooperation. We are trying to reduce the number of rollcall votes so \nthat we can conclude this bill. We are very close to doing so.\n  I yield the floor for the purposes of the Senator from Oklahoma being \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n[[Page S6376]]\n\n                    Amendment No. 4491, as Modified\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I would like to call up amendment No. 4491 \nagain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is pending.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask for its consideration for the purpose of a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 4491, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 4491), as modified, was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4370\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I call up amendment No. 4370.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to amendment No. 4370.\n  The amendment (No. 4370) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, as a courtesy to the Senator, I move to \nreconsider the votes and to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  I believe we will shortly have a UC request to present, but I am \nlooking for the Senator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions. If I could have his \nattention, my understanding is that the Senator desires a rollcall vote \non his amendment.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I do think that is appropriate.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine, the amendment has been debated on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we support the amendment. Obviously, if \nthere is a desire for a rollcall, that is their right. We will be \nrecommending a ``yea'' vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we want to schedule that vote. So it is \nagreed that will be the subject of a rollcall vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 3:45 p.m. \ntoday, the Senate proceed to stacked votes in relation to the following \namendments to the Defense authorization bill: Chambliss No. 4261, \nSessions No. 4471, as modified. I further ask that there be no \namendments to the amendments in order prior to the votes and that after \nthe first vote, all rollcall votes be 10 minutes in length; further \nthat there be 2 minutes equally divided between each vote after the \nfirst.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n            Unanimous-Consent Agreement--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent that following the stacked votes \nthat begin shortly in relation to the Defense authorization bill, the \nSenate proceed to executive session and to immediate votes on the \nfollowing nominations: No. 704, Andrew Guilford, U.S. District Judge \nfor the Central District of California; No. 714, Frank D. Whitney, U.S. \nDistrict Judge for the Western District of North Carolina.\n  I ask unanimous consent that prior to each vote it be in order for \nthe Senators from California and the Senators from North Carolina to \nspeak for up to 3 minutes each or to submit statements for the Record \nprior to the votes; provided further, that following those votes, the \nSenate proceed to the consideration of No. 715, the nomination be \nconfirmed, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's \naction, and the Senate then resume legislative session.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, we understand that District \nJudge Frank Whitney would probably be a voice vote; is that correct?\n  Mr. FRIST. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will turn to the chairman and the ranking \nmember to comment on what they expect over the course of the afternoon, \nbut the two unanimous-consent requests that we just did means that we \nwill have a series of two or three rollcall votes and one by voice. And \nthen after that, I will turn to the chairman and ranking member as to \nwhat we might expect in terms of completion of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, could those three votes be sequenced, the \nfirst vote will take the normal course and the next two votes be 10 \nminutes each?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is part of the order.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer. Secondly, \nthere seems to be only one remaining amendment which we are trying to \nresolve. Then I would approach the leadership jointly for final passage \nof the bill.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, that is my understanding. Is that the \nunderstanding of the ranking member?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I understand that unresolved amendment on our side may \nhave just been resolved. That adds a note of optimism.\n  Mr. FRIST. Things are sounding better and better.\n  Mr. WARNER. Would the majority leader authorize the chairman to seek \nfinal passage when we are ready to go?\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4261\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous of order, the hour of 3:45 \nhaving arrived, the question is on agreeing to the Chambliss amendment \nNo. 4261.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senator was necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Wyoming (Mr. Enzi).\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. \nRockefeller) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee).

Mr. President, before we proceed to the next vote, I \nwould like to propound the following unanimous-consent request:\n  I ask unanimous consent that following the next vote, which is on the \nSessions amendment, I then be recognized in order to send to the desk a \nseries of amendments that have been cleared on both sides. I further \nask unanimous consent that following action on those cleared \namendments, the bill be read a third time and the Senate proceed to a \nvote on final passage of the bill, with no intervening action or \ndebate; provided further, that after passage, the Senate proceed to the \nvotes in executive session as under the previous order.\n  Mr. LEVIN. No objection.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot object; I wish to clarify with the distinguished chairman, should \nwe make a clarification with respect to pay raise now or when we are \ndone?\n  Mr. WARNER. We have reached an agreement on the pay raise issue. I \nwould prefer to do that following final\n\n[[Page S6377]]\n\npassage and have the colloquy inserted in the Record prior to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Presiding Officer, and I thank my colleagues.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4471, as Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are now 2 minutes equally divided for \ndebate before a vote in relation to the Sessions amendment No. 4471. \nWho yields time? Is all time yielded back?\n  The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I think there is strong support on both \nsides of the aisle for this amendment. This is money which goes to \ntesting of the missile defense system mainly; it surely needs testing. \nThat has always been the question. So I support this amendment, and I \nbelieve we could have a voice vote, but there has been a request for a \nrollcall vote. We support the amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this is an amendment by the distinguished \nSenator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions, and the distinguished Senator from \nTennessee, Mr. Frist, and it has been carefully worked and debated. I \nask that the vote begin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama still has 1 minute \nremaining.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would just say that the projected \nlaunch from North Korea has caused us to focus intensely on the missile \ndefense system. To celebrate what we have accomplished, we have nine \nmissiles now in place in Alaska and two in California that are capable \nof knocking down such an attacking missile. This amendment would allow \nthe capability for continued testing and, at the same time, be on 24/7 \nreadiness to knock down an incoming missile.\n  We think it is a good amendment, and it is offset. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it. In effect, we would also be sending a message \nto North Korea and Iran and other rogue nations that we would be ready \nto defend this Nation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n4471, as modified. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

That is a strong \nvoice from the Senate of the United States in support of the men and \nwomen of the Armed Forces. I thank each and every one of you.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, it is also a \nvery strong voice for testing a missile system as well as supporting \nthe men and women in the Armed Forces.\n  I wonder if we could get the attention of the Senate. It is our \nunderstanding now that we are going to proceed to a package which has \nbeen cleared and then move to final passage?\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN.

MINUTEMAN III INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC MISSILES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In the Joint Explanatory Statement of the Committee of \n     Conference on H.R. 1815, the National Defense Authorization \n     Act for Fiscal Year 2006, the conferees state that the policy \n     of the United States ``is to deploy a force of 500 ICBMs''. \n     The conferees further note ``that unanticipated strategic \n     developments may compel the United States to make changes to \n     this force structure in the future.''.\n       (2) The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) conducted under \n     section 118 of title 10, United States Code, in 2005 finds \n     that maintaining a robust nuclear deterrent ``remains a \n     keystone of United States national power''. However, \n     notwithstanding that finding and without providing any \n     specific justification for the recommendation, the \n     Quadrennial Defense Review recommends reducing the number of \n     deployed Minuteman III Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles \n     (ICBMs) from 500 to 450 beginning in fiscal year 2007. The \n     Quadrennial Defense Review also fails to identify what \n     unanticipated strategic developments compelled the United \n     States to reduce the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile force \n     structure.\n       (3) The commander of the Strategic Command, General James \n     Cartwright, testified before the Committee on Armed Services \n     of the Senate that the reduction in deployment of Minuteman \n     III Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles is required so that \n     the 50 missiles withdrawn from the deployed force could be \n     used for test assets and spares to extend the life of the \n     Minuteman III Intercontinental Ballistic Missile well into \n     the future.

Mr. President, I appreciate very much that there has been \nconsent to agree to my amendment No. 4337 on Congressional oversight of \nIran policy. I would like to explain why I believe it is important that \nthe Senate pass this amendment and sustain it in conference with the \nHouse.\n  Mr. President, we live in a dangerous time. The threats to our \nfreedom are many.\n  As the administration embarks on serious diplomacy with Iran, the \nSenate must be engaged and consulted. We Senators must take seriously \nour responsibility to insist on a thorough review of the facts, a full \ndebate of the threat, and full consultation as events move forward.\n  The amendment I propose today would help put in place the rigorous \noversight necessary to hold the administration accountable for its \nrhetoric and its policy decisions.\n  Yesterday, Senate leadership met with State Department officials to \nget briefed on the details of the ``offer'' the administration laid on \nthe table for Iran a few weeks ago. The meeting was welcome. I respect \nthe hard work of Secretary Rice and Ambassador Burns in moving \ndiplomacy forward. However, I am surprised the meeting happened several \nweeks after the deal was already offered. To the best of my knowledge, \nuntil yesterday, Congress had not been briefed on the key details of \nthe deal offered to Iran a few weeks ago. The Iranians had been \nbriefed. The Europeans had been briefed. The Russians and Chinese had \nbeen briefed. But not the United States Senate.\n  This reminds me of how the administration handled the proposed Indian \nnuclear deal, which Members first found out about from the Indian prime \nminister and the press, not from the Administration.\n  I am also reminded of the sales campaign that the administration \nengaged in, in the runup to war in Iraq. A sales campaign--rather than \na serious effort to consult and treat Congress as a partner in figuring \nout how to protect America.\n  It makes the executive branch's job a lot tougher when Congress is \nconsulted last, rather than first. Congress should be in the take off, \nnot asked to join for the crash landing.\n  This amendment requires the administration to give Congress and the \nAmerican people three things: an updated intelligence assessment of the \nthreat of Iran, a clear statement of the President's policy objectives \nand strategy, and a confirmation that administration officials' public \nstatements about the threat of Iran are being reviewed for accuracy.\n  These are reasonable requests to ensure a rigorous debate about the \nway forward. The amendment's adoption would increase the \nadministration's information flow to Congress on Iran issues and \nimprove the Senate's oversight in this important area of national \nsecurity policy.\n  I would note that the House Armed Services Committee included \nparallel reporting requirements on the threat of Iran and the U.S. \nstrategy for responding to it in its report on the House version of \nthis bill. I trust that the conference of the two bodies will, in \nstriving to reconcile these parallel reporting requirements, put the \nUnited States Congress on record in law about the importance of \nrigorous Congressional oversight of U.S. policy regarding Iran and the \nimportance of the administration working in close consultation with \nCongress in this area.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 4528\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss amendment No. \n4528. This amendment honors Representative Joel Hefley, Congressman of \nColorado's 5th district, for his outstanding service to the people of \nColorado and to our Nation.\n  As you may know, Mr. President, Representative Hefley made the \ndecision earlier this year to retire after 2 decades of service in \nCongress. This was a very difficult decision for him. He was the 3rd \nranking Republican on the House Armed Services Committee and had \ngarnered considerable influence because of his integrity and his \nrespect of the legislative branch as an institution. He worked \ndiligently over his 20 years in Congress and served the people of \nColorado's 5th District well.\n  Representative Hefley was first elected to represent Colorado's 5th \nCongressional district in 1986 and has served in the House of \nRepresentatives since that time with distinction, class, integrity, and \nhonor. As his current and former colleagues will attest, Representative \nHefley is a fair and effective lawmaker who works for the national \ninterest while never forgetting his Western roots.\n  For most of his two decades in the House, Representative Hefley \npoured his time and energy into the Committee on Armed Services of the \nHouse of Representatives. He served as chairman of the Subcommittee on \nMilitary Installations and Facilities from 1995 through 2000 and, since \n2001, as chairman of the Subcommittee on Readiness.\n  Representative Hefley's efforts on the Committee on Armed Services \nhave instrumental to the military value of, and quality of life at, \ninstallations in the State of Colorado, Cheyenne Mountain, Peterson Air \nForce Base, Schriever Air Force Base, Buckley Air Force Base, and the \nUnited States Air Force Academy.\n  Representative Hefley was a leader in efforts to retain and expand \nFort Carson as an essential part of the national defense system during \nthe Defense Base Closure and Realignment process.\n  Representative Hefley has also consistently advocated for providing \nmembers of the Armed Forces and their families with quality, safe, and \naffordable housing and supportive communities.\n  Representative Hefley's leadership on the Military House \nPrivatization Initiative has allowed for the privatization of more than \n121,000 units of military family housing, which brought meaningful \nimprovements to living conditions for thousands of members of the Armed \nForces and their spouses and children at installations throughout the \nUnited States.\n  In honor of Representative Hefley's achievements and his work on \nmilitary housing privatization, this amendment designates the military \nfamily housing areas at Fort Carson, Colorado in his name.\n  I served with Representative Hefley in the House of Representatives \nfor 6 years before I was elected to the Senate. I consider him to be \none of my closest colleagues in Congress and a dear friend. I have \ntremendous respect for his character and for his ability to get things \ndone. He has been a champion for over two decades for the Colorado \nSprings community and for conservative values. I know that he will be \nsorely missed in the House of Representatives.\n\n[[Page S6391]]\n\n  I believe Representative Hefley deserves the honor and recognition \nthat this amendment provides. I am pleased my colleagues agreed to join \nme in adopting this amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4424\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I appreciate the support of Chairman Warner \nand Senator Levin in agreeing to accept amendment No. 4424 to S. 2766, \nwhich I have sponsored.\n  Section 1023 relates to a counternarcotics authority granted to the \nDepartment of Defense in the fiscal year 1998 Defense Authorization \nAct. P.L. 105-85, specifically section 1033 of that Act. The original \nprovision, enacted in 1997, gave the Department authority to provide \ncounterdrug support to the Governments of Peru and Colombia, including \nauthority to transfer riverine patrol boats to those Governments, and \nto maintain and repair equipment used for counter-drug activities by \nthose Governments. In recent years, the so-called 1033 authority has \nbeen expanded to cover the other countries in the Andes, and to \nAfghanistan and many of its neighboring states.\n  The bill now before the Senate would expand the list of eligible \ngovernments still further, to include a long list of countries in Asia, \nthe Americas, and Africa. It also provides the Department the authority \nto transfer aircraft to eligible governments.\n  The amendment I have proposed to section 1023 would ensure that the \ntransfer of aircraft is subject to section 484(a) of the Foreign \nAssistance Act of 1961, which requires that the United States retain \ntitle to aircraft made available to a foreign country primarily for \nnarcotics-related purposes, unless the President makes a national \ninterest determination and so notifies Congress. The requirement that \nsuch aircraft be made available only on a loan or lease basis has been \nthe law for 20 years, since the enactment of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of \n1986, P.L. 99-570, and no good argument has been offered as to why it \nshould not apply to Department of Defense programs. Simply put, the \nrequirement strengthens the ability of the United States to make sure \nthat the aircraft provided is used for the intended purpose.\n  In my view, section 484(a) already does apply to Defense Department \ncounternarcotics programs. By its terms, it applies to any aircraft \n``made available to a foreign country primarily for narcotics-related \npurposes'' under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 or ``under any \nother provision of law.'' This expansive statutory language makes clear \nthat any U.S. Government agency providing aircraft to a foreign \ngovernment for counterdrug purposes must retain title to that aircraft. \nYet inquiries to the Department of Defense officials about whether the \nauthority provided in section 1023 of S. 2766 would be governed by \nsection 484(a) have proven inconclusive. So that there is no doubt \nabout this question, I have proposed this amendment, which I understand \nthe managers of the bill have agreed to accept.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 4364\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment that \nwould rename the Navy and Marine Corps Reserve Center at Rock Island, \nIL, in honor of Representative Lane Evans.\n  Representative Evans has been a tireless advocate of our men and \nwomen in uniform during his 24 years in Congress. Unfortunately, \nCongress will lose a great man when he retires at the end of this year, \nand we can honor him and his accomplishments by renaming the Navy and \nMarine Corps Reserve Center at Rock Island after him.\n  Lane Evans came to Congress as a Marine Corps veteran, and military \npersonnel and veterans were always on the forefront of his mind during \nhis service on the House Committee on Armed Services and Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs. Throughout his career, Representative Evans has \nfought to ensure that veterans receive the medical care they need and \nhas provided outspoken support for individuals suffering from post-\ntraumatic stress disorder and gulf war syndrome. Additionally, \nRepresentative Evans is credited with bringing new services to veterans \nliving in his congressional district. In particular, he was responsible \nfor the development of outpatient clinics in the Quad Cities and \nQuincy, IL, as well as the establishment of the Quad-Cities Vet Center.\n  Representative Evans also has worked to ensure that military \npersonnel experience a smooth transition from active military service \ninto the care of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Generations of \nveterans will continue to benefit from his hard work long after he has \nretired.\n  Representative Evans has worked in conjunction with local leaders to \npromote the Rock Island Arsenal, and through his support, the facility \nhas received new jobs and new missions. It is fitting and proper that \nthe Navy and Marine Corps Reserve Center at Rock Island Arsenal be \nnamed in honor of Representative Evans in order to commemorate his \nservice to America's military personnel, its veterans, and his 17th \nCongressional district.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 4336\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, Social Security numbers are included \non all military identification cards including the service member, \nmilitary spouse, and all dependents over the age of ten. In light of \nthe recent theft of millions of veterans' personal information from the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, all federal agencies must take measures \nto protect crucial information. To this end, I have introduced an \namendment that would require the Department of Defense to conduct a \nfeasibility study on prohibiting the use of Social Security numbers on \nall military identification cards.\n  When the Department of Defense began using Social Security numbers on \nidentification cards in 1967, identity theft was not a problem most \nAmericans worried about. Electronic transactions were, for the most \npart, non-existent, and we did not have the kind of access to personal \nrecords that we have today. By simply gaining access to someone's \nSocial Security number, a malicious person could attempt to open a line \nof credit, obtain a false driver's license or passport, or completely \nsteal another person's identity. Our military men and women should not \nhave to worry about these problems while defending our country.\n  We cannot wait until an incident occurs within the Department of \nDefense that compromises the security of our military members. The \nfederal government must be proactive. The feasibility study I have \nproposed has a reasonable finish date of six months from enactment and \nwould give the Department ample time to study this issue and find a \nself-imposed solution.\n  Social Security numbers are not included on driver's licenses or \npassports. Colleges and universities are using generic numbers for \nstudent identification rather than Social Security numbers. It is time \nthe Department of Defense provides this important safeguard for our \ntroops.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 4398\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this amendment to ensure that the Defense Department invests \nin critical basic research and maintains the workforce it needs to stay \nglobally competitive.\n  Our military is first in the world because of the quality and \ntraining of our personnel and the technological sophistication of our \nequipment and weaponry. But many of our Nation's best civilian \nscientific minds in the Defense Department are nearing retirement age, \nand our uncertain commitment to basic research funding makes it harder \nto attract a new corps of scientists to do this research.\n  Our amendment that the Senator from Maine and I are offering includes \nan additional $5 million for the Department's SMART Scholars Program \nwhich is essentially an ROTC program for its civilian scientists. The \namendment will more than double the funding level provided last year \nand provide more than 100 full college scholarships and graduate \nfellowships in science, technology, engineering, and math.\n  Our amendment also adds $40 million to the Department's funding of \nbasic research in science and technology to ensure that its investment \nin the field is maintained and our military technology remains the best \nin the world. The amendment is supported by more than 60 of the most \nprestigious institutions of higher education in the Nation.\n  Advances in military technology often have their source in the work \nof civilian scientists in Department of\n\n[[Page S6392]]\n\nDefense laboratories. Unfortunately, a large percentage of these \nscientists are nearing retirement. Today, nearly one in three DOD \ncivilian engineers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics \nis eligible to retire. In 7 years, 70 percent will be of retirement \nage.\n  It is distressing that the number of new doctoral level scientists \nbeing produced by our major universities each year has declined by 6 \npercent since 1997. Many of those who do graduate are ineligible to \nwork on sensitive defense matters, since about a third of all science \nand engineering doctorate degrees awarded at American universities go \nto foreign students.\n  It is unlikely that retiring DOD scientists can be replaced by \ncurrent private industry employees. About 5,000 science and engineering \npositions are unfilled in private industry in defense-related fields. \nThe Department of Labor estimates that by 2012, more than 40 percent of \njobs in science and engineering occupations will be unfilled.\n  We face a major math and science challenge in both higher education \nand in elementary and secondary education. We are tied with Latvia for \n28th in the industrial world in math education, and that is far from \ngood enough. We have fallen from 3rd in the world to 15th in producing \nscientists and engineers. Clearly, we need a new National Defense \nEducation Act of the size and scope passed nearly 50 years ago.\n  At the very least, however, the legislation before us needs to do \nmore to maintain our military's technological advantage. In 2004, over \n100 ``highly rated'' SMART Scholar applications were turned down \nbecause of insufficient funding. Our amendment provides enough funds to \nsupport every one of those talented young people who want to learn and \nserve.\n\n  Our amendment also deals with the critical need to provide the basic \nresearch dollars that enable science and technology graduates and \nstudents to pursue their research. Basic research investments by the \nDefense Department in science and technology a generation ago helped \nthe United States win the Cold War. But funding for basic research has \nfallen by more than 10 percent in the past decade.\n  Investing in basic research and attracting the best minds to science \nand engineering are as important today as they have ever been. Almost \nevery day, you can pick up the paper and see yet another high-\nperforming company setting up an R shop in India or China. Those \ncountries get it. They know how important basic research is to their \nprospects for growth. But this Congress and this President ignore how \nimportant it is to invest in our talent and our research capacity.\n  China now graduates over 2\\1/2\\ times the number of engineers and \ncomputer science majors as the United States. We still have an edge in \ndollars invested, but our average annual investment growth in R is \nfar less than China and other countries.\n  These countries are increasing their government investment in science \nand technology, but our Federal research investment is stagnating as a \nshare of the U.S. economy. It has plateaued at 1.1 percent of GDP. We \nare still ahead of most other nations, but they are catching up. In \ncombined Federal and private R, the fastest growing countries such as \nIreland and Singapore are clearly challenging us.\n  Yet the President's proposed budget reduces Defense Department basic \nresearch, and this authorization bill does little to increase it over \nlast year's appropriation, even though we know we have to increase it.\n  The Defense Science Board recommends that funding for science and \ntechnology reach 3 percent of total defense spending, and the \nadministration and Congress have adopted this goal in the past. But the \nPresident's budget cuts science and technology funding by 18.6 percent \nand falls well short of this goal. The board also recommends that 20 \npercent of that amount be dedicated to basic research. Again, the \nadministration's budget falls short: basic research accounts for only \n12.6 percent of total science and technology funding.\n  Our leading economic and scientific thinkers are telling us we need \nto invest in these areas to stay globally competitive. The National \nAcademy of Sciences, the Council on Competitiveness, and others say it \nis wrong to ignore the need to increase investment in basic research. \nNobel prize-winners such as American physicist Steven Chu say that we \nneed to increase Federal investment in long-term basic research because \n``there are growing signs that all is not well.''\n  The Internet, the laser, MRIs, global positioning systems-all came \nfrom basic research at the Department of Defense. We can't forget that \nthis type of research leads to the kinds of innovations that can \ngenerate millions of jobs and major new economic activity.\n  Our global competitiveness deserves high priority, and our amendment \nprovides it. The goal is to see that American innovation grows and that \nwe continue to attract and retain the best and the brightest men and \nwomen to these critical fields in math and science.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this needed amendment \nto provide more scholarships to math and science students and to \nincrease our Federal commitment to basic research at the Department of \nDefense.\n\n\n LEGISLATIVE INTENT WITH REGARD TO EXPANDED NATIONAL GUARD AUTHORITIES\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank Mr. Levin for agreeing to join me \nin this discussion of the legislative intent of the Senate in approving \nseveral provisions related to the integration between the Active-Duty \nmilitary and the Reserve component. This bill will enhance the \nauthority of the Department of Defense to achieve future total force \nintegration between the Active-Duty and Reserve components. I would be \ngrateful in the ranking member could explain in more detail the intent \nof section 531 of S. 2766, the National Defense Authorization Act for \nFiscal Year 2007.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Specifically, the changes contained in this bill will \nincrease the efficiency of the Department of Defense's operations by \nallowing the Guard and Reserve to train and instruct other component \nmembers as an additional duty. It is desirable for Active Guard and \nReserve, AGR, and technician members of the National Guard and Reserve \nto be able to train members of all components to the extent that these \nduties do not interfere with the performance of the member's primary \nduties. Currently, titles 10 and 32, United States Code, limit the \nefficiencies that can be realized by restricting the employment of AGRs \nand technicians to ``organizing, administering, recruiting, \ninstructing, or training'' the Reserve components. This bill will \nexpand the role of AGRs and technicians so that they may instruct and \ntrain members of any other component, and also DOD civilian employees, \nDOD contractor personnel, and foreign military personnel.\n  The changes included in this bill will also increase the Department's \nflexibility in using the Guard and Reserve to support certain \noperations or missions. It is the committee's belief that members of \nthe Reserve and National Guard need increased flexibility to support \ncertain operations or missions assigned in whole or in part to the \nReserve, or undertaken by the National Guard at the request of the \nPresident or Secretary of Defense. This bill will facilitate the \ntransformation of the National Guard and Reserve from a Cold War \n``strategic reserve'' to a present day ``operational reserve.'' An \n``operational reserve'' actively supports ongoing operational missions \nwhere appropriate, while also providing the additional reserve capacity \nneeded to meet surge requirements or support wartime or contingency \noperations. These amendments would make some distinctions between the \nduties that may be performed, in addition to their primary duties, by \nReserve AGRs and technicians and those that may be performed by Guard \nAGRs and technicians in title 32 status. Generally, full-time Reserve \npersonnel would be permitted to support title 10 operational \nactivities, while full-time Guard, including AGRs and technicians, \nwould be permitted to perform operational activities if authorized by \nthe President or the Secretary of Defense.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the ranking member. These are very important \nexpansions to the National Guard's role and will play an important part \nin allowing the Air Force to achieve its objectives for total force \nintegration. It is my belief that the provisions included in this bill \nwill permit, for example, the North Dakota Air National\n\n[[Page S6393]]\n\nGuard to provide a security forces squadron to augment the Active-Duty \nsecurity forces in the ICBM field at Minot Air Force Base, assuming \nthat the Secretary requests that they perform such a mission. Air Force \nSpace Command is eager to begin this initiative and has secured funding \nfor it in the Air Force Program Objective Memorandum. This unit would \ninclude both traditional guardsmen and AGRs and would augment, not \nreplace, the Active-Duty security forces group currently assigned to \nthe mission. I would encourage Secretary Rumsfeld to give serious \nconsideration to requesting that the North Dakota Air National Guard \naugment the Active-Duty Air Force in carrying out this important \noperational mission, and I thank my colleagues for their time and their \nsupport.\n\n\n           Killing of U.s. Soldiers by Iraqi Security Forces\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. This week, the military informed two California families \nthat their sons were shot and killed by the very same Iraqi troops they \nwere training.\n  SGT Patrick McCaffrey and 1LT Andre Tyson were killed near Balad in \n2004. At first, the Army told the families that these two National \nGuardsmen were killed by Iraqi insurgents.\n  An investigation by the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command \ndetermined in September 2005 that both soldiers were shot and killed by \nmembers of the Iraqi security forces.\n  In addition to the fact that Iraqi security forces are killing U.S. \nsoldiers, this situation raises several troubling questions.\n  First, according to his parents, there were two prior incidents in \nwhich Sergeant McCaffrey was fired upon by Iraqi security forces and \nthe chain of command took no action. Why was nothing done? Are there \nother incidents where American troops are being shot at by the Iraqi \nforces they are training?\n  Second, why did the Army close its investigation in September 2005 \nbut fail to inform the family until June 2006? Was there a coverup of \nthis incident? What other explanation could there be?\n  Third, why were the families denied official government reports on \nthe events that led to the deaths of these two soldiers? One of the \nfamilies needed the help of my office to make any progress in learning \nthe truth. How could the Army treat the families of dead soldiers in \nsuch a callous and dismissive way? Where are the military case officers \nwho are supposed to help the families of slain U.S. soldiers?\n  And, fourth, a Defense Department spokesmen has called this incident \n``extremely rare.'' How can the Department of Defense conclude that the \nincident is rare when such incidents are evidently not being reported \nup the chain of command? Members of Sergeant McCaffrey's unit told his \nfather that insurgents were offering Iraqi soldiers about $100 apiece \nfor each American they could kill.\n  I ask the Senator from Michigan, is he willing to work with me to get \nanswers to these troubling questions?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I share the Senator's concern and will work with her to \naddress these important questions.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, the Senate today accepted three amendments \nthat I offered to S. 2766, the National Defense Authorization Act for \nFiscal Year 2007, intended to improve transparency and accountability \nof taxpayer funds provided to the Department of Defense.\n  Amendment No. 4370 addresses the practice of the earmarking of \nFederal funds by members of Congress. ``Earmarks,'' more commonly known \nas ``pork projects,'' are provisions inserted into bills or directives \ncontained within a joint explanatory statement or reports accompanying \nbills specifying the identity of an entity, program, project or service \nto receive assistance.\n  Many Congressional earmarks inserted within Defense appropriations \nbills are not needed, or even wanted, by the Pentagon. Just this week, \nthe Washington Post published an article titled, ``The Project That \nWouldn't Die; Using earmarks, members of Congress kept money flowing to \na local company that got $37 million for technology the military \ncouldn't use.''\n  Earmarks contained within Defense appropriations bills have been \nlinked to a number of recent Congressional corruption and ethics \nprobes. Convicted super-lobbyist Jack Abramoff openly boasted that \nearmarks were his political currency and he called the Appropriations \nCommittee that doles them out a ``favor factory'' for lobbyists.\n  The $80 billion emergency supplemental passed last year was riddled \nwith add-ons. It included $10 million to expand wastewater facilities \nin Swiftwater, PA. The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center \ngot $3 million. A wastewater treatment plant in Desoto County, MS, got \n$35 million, and $4 million went to the Fire Sciences Academy in Elk, \nNV. While these many have been local priorities for these communities, \nit is difficult to argue that they are needed for our national defense.\n  In its report on its fiscal 2001 Defense appropriations bill, the \nSenate Appropriations Committee wrote: ``The committee understands that \nmedical studies indicate the potential benefits of cranberry juice and \nother cranberry products in maintaining health. The committee urges the \nSecretary of Defense to take steps to increase the department's use of \ncranberry products in the diet of on-base personnel and troops in the \nfield. Such purchases should prioritize cranberry products with high \ncranberry content such as fresh cranberries, cranberry sauces and \njellies and concentrate and juice with over 25 percent cranberry \ncontent.''\n  Most Americans do not support earmarking Federal funds, especially \nfor such dubious purposes that serve parochial interests at the expense \nof our national defense. A recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, in \nfact, found that of all the issues facing our nation, curtailing \nearmarks was identified as ``the single most important thing for \nCongress to accomplish this year.''\n  The number of earmarks in Defense appropriations laws has grown from \nabout 587 in fiscal year 1994 to about 2,847 in fiscal year 2006, \naccording to a recent report by the Congressional Research Service, \nCRS. The amount of money earmarked has increased over the same period, \nfrom about $4.2 billion to $9.4 billion. The amount earmarked as a \npercentage of the total in the Defense appropriations bill has \ncorrespondingly increased from about 1.8 percent in 1994 to \napproximately 2.4 percent in 2006.\n  While we can determine the total number of earmarks and the actual \npricetag of each, we have no way of calculating the hidden cost of \nearmarking, which includes staff time and administration expenses.\n  Specifically the amendment accepted today requires the Department of \nDefense to report annually: The total annual cost of earmarking in \nDefense appropriations bills; the purpose and location of each earmark; \nan analysis of the usefulness of each earmark in advancing the goals of \nthe Department of Defense. This will provide Members of Congress a more \ncomplete view of the cost effectiveness of each project and if such \nprojects warranted continued funding.\n  This annual report will provide Congress and the public a more \ncomplete understanding of the total cost of ``pork'' to the Department \nof Defense.\n  The earmark grading system will, likewise, provide needed information \nto lawmakers and the public about projects inserted into bills that \nhave not had proper oversight, debate or discussion. This added \ntransparency will ensure that every Member of Congress can cast a truly \ninformed vote and ensure greater accountability for how Federal funds \nare allocated and hopefully return some integrity to the appropriations \nprocess that has been undermined by recent investigations into \nearmarking.\n  My second amendment, No. 4371, accepted by the Senate today seeks to \nend the practice of Defense contractors being rewarded for poor \nperformance. The Department of Defense has been improperly paying \nawards and incentives to contractors that do not fulfill the terms and \nconditions of their contracts. These are intended to be paid only for \noutstanding performances on contracts but are routinely paid out \nwithout regard to performance.\n  In a recent study conducted by the Government Accountability Office, \nGAO, DOD paid out at least $8 billion in fees over 4 years, the vast \nmajority of which were not earned and were improperly awarded. This of \ncourse, was just a small fraction of the overall\n\n[[Page S6394]]\n\ntotal of award fees given out to contractors every year.\n  My amendment seeks to end this process and require performance as a \nprerequisite for award fee bonuses. My amendment specifically requires \nthat a contractor cannot receive an award fee unless the contractor has \nmet the basic requirements of the contract.\n  This amendment has the potential to save the Federal Government \nbillions of wasted tax dollars every year and improve contractor \nperformance.\n  The third amendment, No. 4491, as modified, will require DOD's \nDefense Travel System, DTS, to transform its ``cost plus'' contract to \na fee-for-use-of-service system similar to the private sector travel \nreservation systems currently available in the marketplace.\n  DTS was initiated in 1998 DTS and intended to make travel \narrangements for the military service branches and defense agencies. It \nwas supposed to be fully deployed by 2002. However, that date has been \npushed back to September 2006--a delay of over 4 years--and has cost \nthe American taxpayer $474 million--a staggering $200 million more than \nit was originally projected to cost.\n  DTS has a long record of failure. In July 2002, the DOD inspector \ngeneral released a report on DTS which highlighted numerous concerns \nwith the program and stated that DTS was being ``substantially \ndeveloped without the requisite requirements, cost, performance, and \nschedule documents and analyses needed as the foundation for assessing \nthe effectiveness of the system and its return on investment.'' \nFollowing on that IG report, DOD's office for Program Assessment and \nEvaluation prepared a report recommending termination of the program.\n  In January 2006, GAO reported that ``DTS's development and \nimplementation have been problematic . . . thus it is not surprising \nthat critical flaws have been identified, resulting in significant \nslippages between the planned and actual deployment dates of the \nsystem'' and that selected requirements for display of flights and \nairfares found that system testing was ``ineffective in ensuring that \nthe promised capability was delivered as intended.''\n  This means that not only is DTS not performing, the current system is \nincapable of testing properly in order to determine what is required in \norder to meet DOD's plan.\n  Further, DOD could not prove that DOD travelers even had access to \nthe flights that were available for travel. There is no doubt such a \nflaw would have produced higher travel costs.\n  Compounding this problem is the fact that some DOD agencies continue \nto use the existing legacy travel systems at locations where DTS is \nalready deployed. This means that all of the proclaimed savings that \nDTS was supposed to reap are nowhere to be found--because DOD continues \nto use legacy systems to do the same thing.\n  As originally envisioned, DTS was supposed to be a pay-for-use-of-\nservice system in which the DTS was paid by the government based only \non the extent to which the system was used--thereby creating an \nincentive for DTS to be a cost effective travel reservation system for \nthe Department of Defense.\n  This amendment requires the Department of Defense to honor the \noriginal intentions of the DTS contract. Within a year of enactment of \nthis bill, DTS will be required to utilize a fee-for-use-of-service \nsystem. The funds raised through fees charged will be used by DTS to \npay for its operational and maintenance costs as the system is slated \nto be fully developed and deployed by September 2006. DTS will be \nrequired to: (1) levy a one-time, fixed price service fee per DOD \nconsumer using the system, and (2) charge an additional fixed fee for \neach transaction.\n  Together these three amendments ensure greater transparency and \naccountability of Federal funds and ensure taxpayers and our men and \nwomen in service are guaranteed that the funds we are spending on the \ndefense of our Nation are better spent.\n  I would like to thank Chairman Warner and his staff and look forward \nto continuing to work with them on these issues as this bill goes to \nconference.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I offered an amendment on behalf \nof the brave men and women of our National Guard and Reserve who have \nsacrificed so greatly for our freedom. This amendment would allow \nmembers of the Selected Reserve who have been activated for extended \ndurations to utilize some of the educational benefits they have earned \nonce they separate from service.\n  Since World War II, providing educational benefits to returning \nservicemembers has served an invaluable role in stimulating recruitment \nand retention for our armed services. In assisting veterans readjusting \nto civilian life, these educational benefits have also enhanced our \nNation's competitiveness through the development of a more highly \neducated and productive workforce.\n  When the Montgomery GI bill was signed into law in 1984, members of \nthe Selected Reserve--members of the National Guard and Reserve on \nactive status or performing initial Active Duty training--were seldom \nmobilized. Consequently, standard Montgomery GI Bill benefits reflected \nthat reality. That is not the same reality today.\n  More than 500,000 members of the National Guard and Reserve have been \ncalled up since the terrible events of September 11, 2001, and more \nthan 70,000 have pulled two or more tours of duty. In my State of \nArkansas, nearly 3,400 of our National Guard's 39th Infantry Brigade \nwere called to serve in Operation Iraqi Freedom. These citizen soldiers \nserved with distinction and did so in some of the worst conditions \nimaginable. While their families and their communities have welcomed \nthem home with open arms, our Nation should do the same by ensuring \nthey receive the benefits and services they need as they transition \nback to their civilian lives.\n  The rising price of higher education, increases in the interest rates \non student loans, and the limited earnings ability of those who return \nfrom the service with only high school credentials make educational \nbenefits a primary means of helping members of the Selected Reserve \nmake that transition. In addressing this issue, Congress took a step in \nthe right direction in October 2004 with creation of the Reserve \nEducation Assistance Program. This program provided enhanced Montgomery \nGI bill benefits for members of the Selected Reserve who were activated \nsince September 11, 2001, and mobilized for more than 90 days in \nresponse to a contingency operation--a war or national emergency as \ndeclared by the President or Congress.\n  Although increasing benefits was a step in the right direction, it \ndid not address the lack of a readjustment or transition component to \nthese educational benefits. As a result, Active-Duty servicemembers \nhave up to 10 years after their separation of service to utilize their \nMGIB benefits, while members of the Selected Reserve must forfeit all \nof the educational benefits they have earned once they separate from \nthe Selected Reserve. Montgomery GI bill benefits continue to be the \nonly benefit that those who have served Selected Reserve activated duty \nin the war on terrorism may not access when they eventually separate or \nretire.\n  For example, a young man enlists in the Arkansas National Guard for a \n6-year commitment after graduating from high school in 2001. He is \nmobilized in June 2005 and will return home from Iraq in September \n2006, a 15-month mobilization. He plans to complete his service in June \n2007 and use the Montgomery GI bill benefits he earned during his \nmobilization to attend the University of Arkansas. Under current law, \nhe would forfeit all of these benefits once he leaves the Guard. I \nbelieve our young men and women who have fulfilled their service \nobligations deserve better than that.\n  Specifically, my amendment would allow members of the Selected \nReserve to have portability of their chapter 1607 Montgomery GI bill \nbenefits for up to 10 years from their last date of service. To \nclarify, this amendment applies only to their chapter 1607 benefits--\nthose they have earned through activated service--and not their \nstandard Selected Reserve educational benefits, chapter 1606 benefits.\n  Some have raised concerns that this amendment would have an effect on \nretention because it would provide a post-service portability of \nbenefits. I disagree. There are many valid personal and family reasons \nthat influence a volunteer's decision to serve. Military analysts have \nconsistently noted that reenlistment bonuses in lump-sum cash payments \nhave been effective in\n\n[[Page S6395]]\n\nmeeting or exceeding reenlistment goals in the Active and Reserve \nForces, not the educational benefits that are deferred over time.\n  Further, there is a built-in incentive to continue serving in the \nSelected Reserve because reenlistment or extension in the Guard and \nReserve enables the servicemember to retain their standard Selected \nReserve Montgomery GI bill benefits under chapter 1606 with the \npotential to acquire more chapter 1607 benefits through successive \nactivations. If they reenlist, they would also remain eligible for any \nother educational ``kickers'' such as Federal tuition assistance and \nstate Guard or Reserve educational benefits.\n  Young high school graduates thinking about furthering their \neducations and whether to join the Guard or Reserve should know that \nthey will earn Montgomery GI bill benefits by joining the Reserves and \neven more if they are called up. When it is time to reenlist, they can \nkeep all earned educational benefits by staying in or can take with \nthem into civilian life the benefits they earned when they were called \nup to defend our Nation.\n  As the daughter of a Korean war veteran, I was taught from an early \nage about the sacrifices our troops have to make to keep our Nation \nfree and have been grateful for the service of so many of our brave men \nand women from the State of Arkansas and across the Nation. On behalf \nof them and their families, I will continue to fight to ensure they are \nprovided with the benefits, pay, and health care that they have earned. \nI urge my colleagues to support this amendment. It is the least we can \ndo for those whom we owe so much and to reassure future generations \nthat a grateful nation will not forget them when their military service \nis complete.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 includes a provision that would \nrepeal section 5062(2), title 10, United States Code that requires the \nNavy to keep a minimum of 12 operational aircraft carriers in the \nfleet. As many of my colleagues know, I oppose this repeal. I am \nconvinced that as a nation at war, we should not increase our strategic \nrisk by reducing our ability to place U.S. naval aviation anywhere and \nat any time as may be required to respond to crises around the world.\n  Although this bill would repeal the 12-carrier minimum requirement, \nthe Armed Services Committee was clear that we should not allow our \ncarrier fleet to fall dangerously lower than 11 ships. I believe \nstrongly that the size and capability of our carrier fleet is a matter \nof highest national concern. Once mothballed, scrapped, or a combat \nloss, a carrier is extremely difficult and expensive to replace. The \nNation needs 12 carriers for worldwide presence and crisis response. \nCongress should support a funding program to ensure that we achieve and \nsustain that level as soon as practical.\n  As concerned as I am about reducing the size of our carrier fleet, I \nam equally concerned about the risk of failing to adequately disperse \nthem. Stationing all our Atlantic coast carriers in a single port only \ncompounds the challenges we will face with a smaller fleet. I am not \nalone in that assessment. The former Chief of Naval Operations, ADM \nVernon Clark, told the Armed Services Committee in February 2005 that \nin his view, ``overcentralization of the [carrier] port structure is \nnot a good strategic move . . . the Navy should have two carrier-\ncapable home ports on each coast.'' Admiral Clark went on to say, ``. . \n. it is my belief that it would be a serious strategic mistake to have \nall of those key assets of our Navy tied up in one port.''\n\n  As recently as March this year, Deputy Secretary of Defense and \nformer Secretary of the Navy, Gordon England, testified to this \ncommittee that the Navy needed to disperse its Atlantic coast carriers \nsaying, ``My judgment is that [dispersion] is still the situation . . . \na nuclear carrier should be in Florida to replace the [USS John F.] \nKennedy to get some dispersion. `` Secretary England explained that, \n``the concern there was always weapons of mass destruction. Even though \ncarriers were at sea, the maintenance facilities, et cetera, are all \nstill there and the crews . . . so having some dispersion would be of \nvalue to the Department of the Navy.''\n  At the same hearing, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, ADM \nEdmund Giambastiani, shared his own judgment that we should disperse \nour carriers. He illustrated his sense of risk to the Nation's east \ncoast carriers when he recalled his own visit to Norfolk one Christmas, \n``where we had five aircraft carriers all sitting next to one another, \nand that is not something we'd like to routinely do.''\n  I am opposed to cutting our Nation's aircraft carrier fleet as a \nmatter of strategic necessity during time of war. The risk, in my view, \nis unacceptable. As a matter of protecting our smaller carrier force, I \nam convinced that the Nation must establish a second Atlantic coast \nnuclear carrier base as quickly as possible. An environmental impact \nstudy in 1997 found Naval Station Mayport, FL, current home of the USS \nJohn F. Kennedy, suitable to permanently station a nuclear aircraft \ncarrier. The Navy should complete its update of that study as quickly \nas possible. Additionally, in order not to lose any time once the study \nis complete, the Navy should include funding in its fiscal year 2008 \nFuture Years Defense Program to begin building the maintenance and \nsupport facilities necessary to stationing a nuclear aircraft carrier \nat Naval Station Mayport. Availability of these funds should naturally \nbe contingent upon but timed in the budget's outyears to coincide with \nthe completion of an updated environmental impact study. I look forward \nto working with my colleagues on both these vital issues.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, at the outset, I have and I will continue \nto support our military personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan. They deserve \nno less than our complete backing.\n  I recently returned from visiting Iraq, where I had the honor of \nmeeting with our troops and visiting with Iraqi officials. I left with \na deep admiration for the spirit of our fighting men and women who \ncontinue to give their all under very difficult circumstances. I was \nalso impressed by the willingness of many Iraqis to put themselves in \nharm's way as they dedicate their lives to the future of their Nation. \nHowever, I continue to harbor grave concerns over the current situation \nin Iraq and the President's strategy for fighting the Iraq conflict.\n  So far, more than 2,500 Americans have died and 18,000 have been \nwounded. We owe it to both our honored dead and wounded to ensure that \ntheir sacrifices were not in vain and that we successfully accomplish \nour mission in Iraq and Afghanistan. However, as I have said from the \nbeginning of this conflict, we need a clear understanding of what the \nmission is, what is needed to accomplish the mission, and the true \naccounting of the cost of the mission.\n  It is time for the President to tell Congress, the American public, \nand most importantly, the families of our fallen heroes and the men and \nwomen in the Armed Forces what is his exit plan. Instead, we only get \nvague assertions such as in the President's address to the Nation a \nyear ago at Fort Bragg in which he said: ``. . . our strategy can be \nsummed up this way: As the Iraqi's stand up, we will stand down.'' What \nthis country needs now is a detailed exit strategy that puts the Iraqi \nGovernment and its people on the path to controlling their own destiny.\n  It is not clear why we went to war, what we are trying to achieve, \nand how we will measure success. There are many of us who believe that \nwe went into Iraq for the wrong reason: because the President and his \nadvisers miscalculated or misrepresented the threat. And now that we \nare there, the President continues to come up with new reasons for \nstaying. Before the war, President Bush said we needed to remove Saddam \nHussein's weapons of mass destruction. It turned out there were none. \nFaced with the absence of weapons of mass destruction, the \nadministration has argued that our presence in Iraq is necessary to \nprotect the United States from acts of global terrorism and to ensure \nthat Iraq successfully transforms into a stable democracy.\n  As Brian Jenkins of the RAND Corporation, one of the country's most \nnoted terrorism experts, has written, ``Taking the fight to terrorists \nabroad--as America did by invading Afghanistan and by continuing \nefforts against terrorists worldwide--makes sense. But Iraq is a \nseparate and special case, because many of the combatants killed or \ncaptured by American\n\n[[Page S6396]]\n\nand allied forces in Iraq are insurgents created by opposition to the \nU.S. invasion itself.'' It is my understanding that terrorist cells \nhave become even more decentralized since the war in Iraq, spreading to \nmany corners of the globe. Islamic extremists in Iraq are reportedly \ntraining Taliban and al-Qaida fighters. Furthermore, Brigadier General \nRobert Caslen says that 30 new terrorist groups have been created since \n9/11, and ``we are not killing them faster than they are being \ncreated.'' Even Defense Secretary Rumsfeld admits that the United \nStates is not winning the battle of ideas over the terrorists.\n\n  A week ago, President Bush justified our presence in Iraq by stating \nthat our mission now ``is to develop a country that can govern itself, \nsustain itself, and defend itself, and a country that is an ally in the \nwar on terror. While I support building a strong democracy in Iraq, I \nam still very concerned that the number of troops stationed there \nstands in the way of the Iraqi people developing their own nation.\n  If we remain in Iraq without a clear exit strategy, I believe that \nthe situation there will worsen. Iraq is a country that is becoming \nmore polarized along ethnic and sectarian lines. The December elections \nfor a new National Assembly were dominated by the religious-based \npolitical parties.\n  Furthermore, the Iraqi public's perception of the economy is becoming \nincreasingly pessimistic. The social situation in Iraq is just as \ndisheartening. As a recent Pentagon report notes, we have spent almost \n$1 billion in electricity projects and are planning an additional $1.1 \nbillion, but the gap between demand and supply is growing.\n  The price for not having a clear exit strategy is being borne by the \nAmerican taxpayer and future generations of Americans who will truly \npay the cost of this war. So far, the United States has spent about $40 \nbillion for Iraqi reconstruction and much of that has been wasted. For \nexample, instead of building 142 health centers in Iraq, only 20 \nclinics have been completed at a cost of $200 million. In addition, \nformer Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz confidently promised \nthe Congress a week after the war had started that ``. . . we're \ndealing with a country that can really finance its own reconstruction, \nand relatively soon.'' His economic projections were exceptionally \nfaulty. Americans are paying inflated prices for Iraqi reconstruction \nprojects that are only partially complete, instead of Iraqi oil \nrevenues paying for Iraqi reconstruction.\n  The President's policy gives the Iraqis veto power over when American \ntroops withdraw. Whether our troops remain there, should not be subject \nto an Iraqi veto. Making the departure of U.S. troops dependent on the \nIraqis places the health and welfare of our brave men and women at the \nmercy of Iraqi decisions.\n  When I spoke with Iraq's National Security Adviser, Dr. Mowaffak \nRubaie, he shared his view that the removal of foreign troops will \nlegitimize Iraq's Government in the eyes of its people. In my view, a \nphased withdrawal of American troops will encourage the Iraqi \nGovernment and military to take responsibility for their future. In \naddition I support maintaining sufficient security forces to continue \ntraining the Iraqi military, sufficient security forces to protect the \ncontinued American civilian presence, and sufficient security forces to \nattack al-Qaida terrorist networks. The result will be a strengthened, \nnot weakened, Iraqi Government and military.\n\n  I agree with the President when he said that ``success in Iraq \ndepends upon the Iraqis. If the Iraqis don't have the will to succeed, \nthey're not going to succeed. We can have all the will we want, I can \nhave all the confidence in the ability for us to bring people to \njustice, but if they choose not to . . . make the hard decisions and to \nimplement a plan, they're not going to make it.''\n  We must empower the Iraqis to defend and govern themselves. For that \nreason, phased withdrawal is the only road to success.\n  Mr. President, some say that asking this administration to provide a \nplan detailing the eventual withdrawal of our troops from Iraq \ndemonstrates a lack of courage. To me, it takes courage to do what is \nright for our Nation and for Iraq. What is right for our Nation is to \nestablish an exit strategy to bring our troops home to their families. \nWhat is right for Iraq is to empower them to control their own destiny.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I wish to speak about an amendment I \noffered to the 2007 Defense authorization bill that would be very \nbeneficial to the members of our Reserve Component. The amendment would \naward them 15 days of paid leave at the end of their deployment, \nprovided they have been deployed more than 6 months and have been \ndeployed in a combat zone. The members of the Reserves and National \nGuard face a different situation and different challenges when they \nreturn from combat than do those on active duty because they return to \ncivilian life and civilian jobs almost immediately. In many cases I \nbelieve it happens too soon, primarily for financial reasons.\n  The need to return to their jobs as soon as possible means Reservists \nand Guardsmen have little or no time to make what can be a difficult \nadjustment. Combat experiences may never be forgotten, especially by \nthose who are not professional soldiers, but a chance to begin to do \nso, to talk to people if that seems appropriate, would be very helpful. \nPost Traumatic Stress Disorder is a very real disability. We must do \nwhatever we can to help our citizen soldiers avoid it. And to help \nthose who get it despite our efforts.\n  The experiences of our combat soldiers are stressful at best, \ndebilitating at worst. I believe 2 weeks to readjust, to spend time \nwith their families, and to make whatever preparations are necessary \nwould be tremendously helpful and very well deserved. These men and \nwomen have left their families and their jobs to serve our country \noverseas for extended periods at great personal sacrifice. Two weeks of \npaid leave would relieve the financial pressure to return to work \nimmediately. I believe not only the soldiers would benefit, but so \nwould the employers and coworkers. They would at long last regain an \nemployee who has had time to adjust and is ready to become a productive \nworker again. So the benefits would not go solely to the soldiers and \ntheir families.\n  This is an important amendment, one that would help soldiers, their \nfamilies, and their communities around the nation. I believe it \ndeserves to be included in the Defense authorization bill, and I ask my \ncolleagues for their support.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, last Thursday, we passed by a 99-to-1 vote \nan emergency spending bill to support our troops in Iraq and \nAfghanistan and provide relief to the victims of Hurricane Katrina. \nUnfortunately, behind closed conference doors, a key provision of both \nthe House and Senate versions was stripped out--an amendment, \nintroduced by Representative Barbara Lee and myself, that would bar any \nfunds from being used to establish permanent U.S. military bases in \nIraq or to control Iraq's oil.\n  I voted to support our troops, though I was surprised that my \namendment was removed in conference after not a single Senator spoke \nagainst it during the floor debate. By removing the ``no permanent \nbases'' amendment, we make life more difficult for our men and women in \nuniform and undercut our Nation's broader effort against terrorism. So \nI am happy that my amendment has now been accepted as part of the \nDefense authorization bill.\n  It is straightforward, clear, and simple: It affirms that the United \nStates will not seek to establish permanent military bases in Iraq and \nhas no intention of controlling Iraqi oil. I will repeat what I said 6 \nweeks ago: While it may be obvious to Americans that we don't intend to \nstay in Iraq indefinitely, such conspiracy theories are accepted as \nfact by most Iraqis. In an opinion poll conducted by the University of \nMaryland in January, 80 percent of Iraqis--and 92 percent of the Sunni \nArabs--believe we have plans to establish permanent military bases. The \nsame poll found that an astounding 88 percent of Sunni Arabs approve of \nattacks on American forces.\n  Why do Iraqis believe we want permanent bases? Why do they think we \nwould subject ourselves to the enormous ongoing costs of Iraq in blood \nand treasure? Do they think we want their sand? No, they think we want \ntheir oil. To my mind, the connection between these two public opinion \nfindings is incontrovertible.\n\n[[Page S6397]]\n\n  Before you dismiss these as simple conspiracy theories, remember what \nIraqis have been through in the past three decades: three wars and a \ntyrannical regime that turned brother against brother and made paranoia \na way of life. And there is a longer history, too: 400 years of British \nand Ottoman occupation have led to a deeply ingrained suspicion of a \nforeign military presence.\n  These views extend well beyond Iraq. In a 2004 Pew Charitable Trust \nsurvey, majorities in all four Muslim states surveyed--Turkey, \nPakistan, Jordan, and Morocco--believed that control of Mideast oil was \nan important factor in our invasion of Iraq. Our enemies understand the \nboon these misconceptions provide to their recruiting efforts and use \nthem as a rallying cry in their calls-to-arms. Last year, in a letter \nintercepted by the U.S. military, Ayman al-Zawahiri, the deputy leader \nof al-Qaida, wrote to the recently killed Jordanian terrorist Abu Musab \nal-Zarqawi: ``The Muslim masses . . . do not rally except against an \noutside occupying enemy.''\n  Our military and diplomatic leaders understand that countering this \nvicious propaganda requires clear signals about our intentions in Iraq. \nAnd they have done just this: GEN George Casey, the ground force \ncommander in Iraq, told the Committee on Armed Services last September: \n``Increased coalition presence feeds the notion of occupation.'' At the \nsame hearing, GEN John Abizaid, the commander of all U.S. troops in the \nMiddle East, told Congress: ``We must make clear to the people of the \nregion we have no designs on their territory or resources.'' In March, \nthe American Ambassador to Iraq, Zalmay Khalilzad, told an Iraqi \ntelevision station that the United States has ``no goal in establishing \npermanent bases in Iraq.''\n  Unfortunately, this clarity has been clouded by mixed messages from \nthe senior-most decision-makers in the Bush administration: To my \nknowledge, President Bush has never explicitly stated that we will not \nestablish permanent bases in Iraq. And both the Secretary of Defense \nand the Secretary of State have left the door open to do just that. On \nFebruary 17, 2005, Secretary Rumsfeld told the Committee on Armed \nServices: ``We have no intention, at the present time, of putting \npermanent bases in Iraq.'' ``At the present time'' is not exactly an \nunequivocal statement.\n  On February 15, 2006, at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nhearing, Senator Kerry asked Secretary Rice: ``Is it, in fact, the \npolicy of the administration not to have permanent bases in Iraq?'' \nRather than answering the simple one word, ``Yes,'' Secretary Rice said \nduring a 400-word exchange on the question: ``I don't want to in this \nforum try to prejudice everything that might happen way into the \nfuture.'' Just last Thursday, columnist Helen Thomas asked the White \nHouse Press Secretary to unambiguously declare that the United States \nwill not seek permanent bases in Iraq. Again, the Press Secretary could \nnot unequivocally declare this to be the case.\n  These mixed messages are confusing to the American people and the \nIraqi people alike. They feed conspiracy theories and cede rhetorical \nspace to our enemies. They make it that much more difficult to win the \nbattle for the hearts and minds of 1.2 billion Muslims in the world. \nOur success in that battle will determine our success in the struggle \nbetween freedom and radical fundamentalism. Against this backdrop, I \nbelieve that it is incumbent upon us to speak where the administration \nhas not.\n  My amendment will have no detrimental effect on the military \noperations of our Armed Forces in Iraq or their ability to provide \nsecurity for Iraqi oil infrastructure. United Nations Council \nResolution 1546 recognizes that the American and coalition forces are \npresent in Iraq at the invitation of the Iraqi Government and that \ntheir operations are essential to Iraq's political, economic, and \nsocial well-being. In his first speech to the Iraqi Parliament last \nmonth, Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki endorsed that resolution. We are \nanxious for the day when Iraqis can take control of their own destiny, \nbut the Iraqis are suspicious of our intentions and are growing \nincreasingly impatient.\n  This amendment may not in itself change a lot of minds on the ground \nor in the region, but it can mark the beginning of a sustained effort \nto demonstrate through words and deeds that we have no intention of \ncontrolling Iraq's oil or staying there forever. I believe it is our \nduty to do so.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and the ranking member \nof the Armed Services Committee for working with my office and Senator \nEnsign's office on scaling back the new exceptions to the Berry \namendment--the Buy American rules--that were ultimately included in \nthis legislation. The changes to narrow the language as originally \nproposed go a long way toward addressing the concerns of the U.S. \nspecialty metals industry, including titanium production in Nevada. So \nagain I thank the chairman and ranking member for working with us on \nthese changes.\n  Still, I have concerns about provisions in this bill that were \nadopted as part of amendment 4286 on June 15 that weaken the Buy \nAmerican provisions of the Berry amendment. I know this is not the \nintention of the Senate or the committee, but I am concerned that we \nmay be opening a door to the use of foreign specialty metals in \nproduction of U.S. military equipment that is very dangerous, and we \nmay have started down the proverbial slippery slope.\n  Right now, due in no small part to the policy of the Berry amendment, \nthe United States has the most sophisticated titanium and specialty \nmetals sector in the world. The Berry amendment policy is good national \npolicy because these are materials that a modern military must have, \nand so we need to maintain a robust domestic manufacturing capability \nto meet our national security needs.\n  My starting point, then, and I know the Senators agree, is that we \nneed strong Buy American provisions for purchases of specialty metals \nfrom the Defense Department. There have been some complaints about \nadministrability--some of which are legitimate but some of which \nunfortunately I think may be driven by opponents of Buy American rules \nin and outside the administration.\n  I think the legitimate concerns can and should be addressed with some \nminor tweaking and appropriately limited waivers. If material of the \nright quality or grade is not available in the United States, the \nPentagon could exercise its existing waiver authority. We could pass \nlegislation that could improve that authority. If lax enforcement has \nled to a buildup in foreign inventories, we could create a temporary \n``get well period.'' If a few off-the-shelf items should not be \nincluded under the Berry amendment, let's figure out what they are and \nexempt them.\n  But I worry we have gone much further than that. The Senate's bill \nintroduces a number of new concepts that I am not sure we fully \nunderstand individually, and I am very concerned we do not understand \nhow all of these different concepts will interact together.\n  Let me be clear about one thing. Outside of the U.S. companies, there \nis only one other worldwide producer of aerospace-quality titanium. In \nother words, one titanium company in the whole world will get the new \nU.S. defense business from weakening the Buy American provisions of the \nBerry amendment. That company is a Russian company called VSMPO. It was \nbuilt by the Government of the Soviet Union, later privatized, and \nrecently the Government of Russia has indicated that it intends to take \na controlling share of the company.\n  That is right, the Kremlin intends to take a large ownership position \nin this company. This is the same Kremlin that used access to energy \nsupplies to try to bully the Ukraine as an intimidation tactic. I have \na series of newspaper articles on VSMPO and its relation to the Russian \nGovernment and I will ask unanimous consent that they be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The administration has talked about needing to change the Berry \namendment and has said that it wants greater ``commercial and military \nintegration.'' But, I am concerned that if it is not appropriately \nnarrow, changes to the Berry amendment will create greater ``Kremlin-\nDefense integration.'' So if this new language would have the result of \nincreasing U.S. dependence on Russian titanium producers, I think it \nwould be terrible military and defense policy.\n\n[[Page S6398]]\n\n  I hope that as the bill moves forward, we will have an opportunity to \ntake a closer look at these provisions and narrow them even further. \nPerhaps some concepts we will determine deserve to be dropped \naltogether.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the articles to which I referred be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Kremlin Capitalism\n\n\n         russian car maker comes under sway of old pal of putin\n\na tight circle in government is drawing key industries into the state's \n                                 orbit\n\n                       Frictions with partner gm\n\n                            (By Guy Chazan)\n\n       Moscow.--Last December, the head of Russia's state arms-\n     trading agency emerged from the shadows as one of the \n     country's most powerful businessmen. Aided by 300 heavy armed \n     police, he took control of Russia's largest auto maker.\n       His agency had no experience running a car company, nor did \n     it own any shares of this one, OAO Avtovaz, producer of the \n     ubiquitous Lada. But the chief arms trader, Sergei Chemezov, \n     had one invaluable asset: He is an old friend of Russia's \n     president, Vladimir Putin.\n       Mr. Chemezov says he has known Mr. Putin since the two were \n     KGB agents in the 1980s. He acknowledges that his ties give \n     him a leg up in business. ``It means we can get a lot of \n     issues resolved fast,'' he says.\n       Since being tapped in 2004 to run the arms-export business, \n     Mr. Chemezov has been using his unique access to turn the \n     state agency, called Rosoboronexport, into a conglomerate \n     with interests ranging from to oil-drilling gear to cars. Its \n     newest target is one of the world's largest titanium \n     producers, a critical supplier for Airbus and Boeing Co.\n       Rosoboronexport is one of several fast-growing companies \n     headed by friends of Mr. Putin that embody his particular \n     brand of state capitalism. Across Russian industry, private \n     capital is in retreat as state-controlled entities ride a \n     wave or consolidation and confiscation to dominate oil, gas, \n     aviation, engineering and other sectors Mr. Putin deems \n     strategic.\n       It's a process with strange echoes of the past. In the \n     1990s, a generation of aggressive young businessmen used \n     connections to snap up assets at rigged privatization \n     auctions. Now, some of Mr. Putin's closest associates are \n     taking advantage of their proximity to the Kremlin to build \n     up similarly huge, although nominally state-owned business \n     empires.\n       Their growth worries the few outspoken advocates of market-\n     oriented policies left in the top ranks of the Putin \n     government. We do not have enough ways and means to keep \n     track of state-controlled firms, many of them monopolies, as \n     they grab market assets,'' said Economics Minister German \n     Gref at a conference in April.\n       Long noted for graft and inefficiency, Russian state-owned \n     behemoths increasingly have become tools of government \n     policy. In January, gas monopoly OAO Gazprom briefly shut off \n     the fuel to neighboring Ukraine in a price dispute that was \n     widely denounced as a move to punish the pro-West government \n     in Kiev. The Kremlin rejects those accusations and says big \n     state-owned companies will be subject to the discipline of \n     the market, often with some shares available to foreign \n     investors. (The government is planning an initial public \n     offering of state oil company OAA Rosneft this summer.)\n       But at Avtovaz, Rosoboronexport's takeover wasn't good news \n     for General Motors Corp.'s $340 million joint venture with \n     the Russian auto giant. The change in management brought to a \n     head simmering tensions at the operation. Now there are signs \n     the entire deal, the largest foreign investment in Russia's \n     auto sector, could unravel.\n       Until recently, Rosoboronexport was barely known, an \n     operation with a few hundred employees headquartered on a \n     quiet Moscow boulevard. It was, and remains, one of Russia's \n     most opaque companies: Its business activities are largely a \n     state secret. With Mr. Chemezov at the helm, however its \n     profile began to grow.\n       According to Mr. Chemezov, he and Mr. Putin met when both \n     were KGB intelligence officers in Dresden, East Germany--a \n     claim the Kremlin won't comment on but one published in a \n     government-controlled magazine. Mr. Chemezov says the two \n     lived in the same apartment block and their families \n     socialized. They kept in touch after their return to Russia. \n     In 1996, when Mr. Putin got a job as a mid-level Kremlin \n     bureaucrat, he made Mr. Chemezov his deputy.\n       In 1999 Mr. Chemezov moved to the arms industry. It was a \n     time of corruption and chaos. The advent of capitalism had \n     left defense factories starved for cash. Desperate to \n     survive, the mostly state-owned firms competed with one \n     another for foreign contracts, often with the help of dubious \n     middlemen.\n       After Mr. Putin became Russian president the following \n     year, he took control of the trade. He formed Rosoboronexport \n     as a state monopoly to squeeze out freelance arms salesmen \n     and root out graft, staffing it with old comrades. Mr. \n     Chemezov became its deputy head and then, in 2004, its chief.\n       Russian weapons exports boomed. They totaled $6 billion \n     last year, up 70% since 1999. Rosoboronexport, which takes a \n     3.8% commission on all sales, prospered.\n       The agency expanded its horizons. Last year, it merged all \n     of Russia's helicopter makers, some of them privately owned, \n     into one of its subsidiaries. Now it is involved in a similar \n     effort to consolidate Russia's struggling airplane \n     manufacturers under state control.\n       Chemezov's influence grew as the Kremlin picked him to \n     represent the state on the boards of a string of large \n     defense firms. But his most ambitious gambit yet involved \n     Avtovaz. The auto story developed fast last fall, ignited by \n     a meeting in the Kremlin between President Putin and the \n     long-serving CEO of the publicly held car company.\n\n\n                            Down on Its Luck\n\n       Avtovaz was built in the late 1960s in Togliatti, a drab \n     Volga River city named after an Italian Communist. In the \n     1990s the city was torn apart by mafia wars, as rival gangs \n     vying for control of the auto works staged shootouts at the \n     factory gates. The company was broke. Big profits, however, \n     were being racked up by trading firms--some linked to Avtovaz \n     management--that supplied auto parts and sold the company's \n     finished cars.\n       More recently, Avtovaz has struggled to hold market share \n     as some in Russia's growing middle class switch from clunky \n     Ladas to foreign-brand cars, By mid-2005, corporate raiders, \n     some alleged to have criminal connections, were tightening \n     their grip on the big auto maker. They bought up parts \n     suppliers and dealerships, installing loyal managers and \n     acquiring shares.\n       Mr. Chemezov says that when President Putin met last fall \n     with Avtovaz's chief, 64-year-old Vladimir Kadannikov, the \n     veteran auto executive said he wanted to retire. Mr. \n     Kadannikov declined to be interviewed. People close to him \n     say he didn't have much choice in his decision to leave. A \n     Kremlin spokesman said Mr. Putin doesn't fire the managers of \n     private companies.\n       After consulting with aides, Mr. Putin gave Rosoboronexport \n     the task of cleaning up Avtovaz, Mr. Chemezov says.\n       Moving in was a simple operation. Avtovaz's managers \n     control the auto maker through an arcane system of cross-\n     shareholdings. By replacing the bosses, Rosoboronexport could \n     take charge of the company without having to buy any shares.\n       First, though, the old management team had to be persuaded \n     to leave peacefully. After Mr. Kadannikov resigned in \n     October, a team of police investigators and prosecutors was \n     airlifted in to begin the process. ``To impose order . . . \n     the state had to bring in 300 policemen from outside,'' says \n     Mr. Chemezov. ``Over the next few months, we had to replace \n     virtually the entire police force, both in Togliatti and in \n     the factory itself!'' Soon, three of Avtovaz's senior \n     accountants found themselves facing charges of theft and tax \n     evasion. The charges were dropped a few weeks later.\n       On Dec. 22, a tight police cordon encircled Avtovaz's high-\n     rise headquarters in Togliatti as shareholders gathered to \n     elect a new board. Within half an hour, they had voted for \n     the new, state-approved slate. Most had never even seen the \n     candidates before. No alternatives were on the ballot.\n\n\n                               Auto Giant\n\n       President Putin defended the takeover. ``Let's face it, the \n     enterprise is in a bad way,'' he told reporters in January. \n     ``And if a state structure goes in as crisis manager to try \n     to improve the situation, then that's no bad thing.''\n       The new bosses are pushing for $4.5 billion in state money \n     to roll out new models and build a new factory to make \n     450,000 cars a year. Some in the government want Avtovaz to \n     go further, absorbing other, smaller Russian car makers to \n     form a national auto giant. Mr. Chemezov has a personal \n     notion of how to restore the car company's onetime glory. He \n     has just announced it will build a Jeep-type vehicle for the \n     army, to be called the Kalashnikov.\n       On the whole, workers appear to have welcomed the change at \n     the top. ``With the new lot, at least there's hope they'll \n     get rid of the mafia. They're the only ones who can,'' says \n     Pyotr Zolotaryov, head of Edintsvo, Avtovaz's independent \n     trade union.\n       Rosoboronexport moved quickly to get control over Avtovaz's \n     lucrative sales operations. One of the first steps was to put \n     the company's Moscow office in the hands of the brother of \n     Avtovaz's new chairman.\n       Then the new regime shifted a big chunk of Avtovaz's \n     financial flows, including some of its hard-currency \n     accounts, to a preferred bank. Called Novikombank, it is tiny \n     but has close links to Russia's defense industry. For years, \n     one of its main shareholders was Russia's Association of \n     Foreign Intelligence Veterans, and in the late 1990s it was \n     run by Mr. Chemezov's Rosoboronexport predecessor, another \n     old KGB hand.\n\n\n                             A Spat with GM\n\n       Rosoboronexport soon was in a spat with Avtovaz's American \n     joint-venture partner, General Motors. GM had seen relations \n     cool with the previous management team. But it was stunned in \n     February when the new bosses at Avtovaz suddenly stopped \n     supplying parts to the companies' five-year-old joint \n     venture, closing down its production line for 10 days. \n     ``There was no discussion at all about a shutdown,'' says \n     Warren Browne, head of GM in Russia. ``They took that \n     decision unilaterally.''\n       Avtovaz had long grumbled that the joint venture wasn't \n     paying enough for the parts\n\n[[Page S6399]]\n\n     Avtovaz supplied. After tough negotiations, the sides worked \n     out a compromise that raised the price, though not by the 60% \n     that Avtovaz had demanded. But that deal expires at the end \n     of this year, and beyond that, the venture's prospects look \n     murky. ``There's still a lot of distrust on both sides,'' \n     says a banker familiar with the project. ``I think one will \n     buy the other out.''\n       That would be a big blow for a pioneering project that in \n     its time put GM way ahead of competitors in one of the \n     world's fastest-growing car markets. GM took the risky step \n     of putting its Chevrolet logo on a Russian-designed car, a \n     strategy that initially paid off as Chevrolet became Russia's \n     top-selling foreign brand in 2004. After this year's tiff, GM \n     says it remains committed to the joint venture. ``It's debt-\n     free, it's got cash flow and it achieved a profit a year \n     before we expected it to,'' says Mr. Browne.\n       Avtovaz's new bosses are less effusive. ``When it started, \n     the venture was a breakthrough, but times change,'' says \n     Vladimir Artyakov, Avtovaz's new chairman. ``It got stuck in \n     its original format . . . and began to limp. It no longer \n     really fits into Avtovaz's strategy.'' Asked if Avtovaz might \n     seek to buy out GM, he said, ``Why not?''\n       GM appears to be looking at other alternatives. It has \n     taken out an option on land in St. Petersburg for a possible \n     assembly plant there, which it would own with no local \n     partners.\n\n\n                              Metals Race\n\n       Mr. Chemezov is also on the lookout for other business. \n     He's in talks to have his Rosoboronexport buy a stake in \n     publicly held OAO VSMPO-Avisma one of the world's main \n     producers of titanium. It would become part of a big new \n     state company producing metals and alloys for the Russian \n     defense industry.\n       VSMPO has just signed a $1.4 billion contract to sell the \n     lightweight metal to Airbus through 2015. It's also a key \n     supplier to Boeing. Rosoboronexport says it wants to make \n     sure not all of the country's store of the metal ends up \n     abroad. VSMPO ``is a strategic enterprise,' 'Mr. Chemezov \n     says. ``It supplies all our defense plants with titanium. And \n     naturally we want it to be . . . under state control.''\n       He denies that plan would amount to nationalization, \n     although he acknowledges that the price Rosoboronexport is \n     offering is only about half the titanium maker's current \n     share price.\n       As Mr. Chemezov's influence expands, the line separating \n     his different roles--civil servant and entrepreneur--is \n     increasingly blurred. ``You know, we're not really the state, \n     we're businessmen,'' he says of Rosoboronexport. ``Call it \n     state commerce.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  Russian State To Buy Stake in VSMPO\n\n                    (By Arkady Ostrovskyin, Moscow)\n\n       The owners of VSMPO-Avisma, the world's largest titanium \n     producer, have succumbed to advances from the Russian \n     authorities to sell a stake to Rosoboronexport, the state \n     arms trading monopoly, which is fast emerging as one of the \n     most powerful players in the Russian economy.\n       While talks between Rosoboronexport and VSMPO-Avisma \n     shareholders are still going on, a decision in principle to \n     sell some of their shares to the state has been made, the \n     shareholders said.\n       The company is controlled by Vladislav Tetyukhin and \n     Vyacheslav Bresht, who have transformed the former Soviet \n     military plant into a highly profitable and globally \n     competitive business. VSMPO supplies Airbus and Boeing with \n     most of their titanium, increasingly used in aircraft \n     construction because of its toughness and lightness.\n       Both Mr. Tetyukhin and Mr. Bresht have previously resisted \n     attempts by Rosoboronexport to take control over the plant.\n       Mr. Bresht said yesterday: ``I am ready to sell my shares \n     to the state.'' He declined to comment on the reasons for his \n     decision. Mr. Tetyukhin, said: ``The state will definitely \n     become a shareholder in VSMPO-Avisma.'' He said it was a \n     question of time, the size of the stake, and the price.\n       Observers said the shareholders' decision to give up \n     control over the company was the latest illustration of the \n     Kremlin squeezing out private owners from what it deemed to \n     be strategic industries.\n       It was also a sign of the growing power of Rosoboronexport, \n     which was set up to trade arms but has a licence for a wide \n     range of commercial activities.\n       Last year it seized control of Avtovaz, the country's \n     largest carmaker, which it is now trying to revive.\n       It has also consolidated control over Russia's helicopter \n     makers and is believed to be interested in buying large \n     shipbuilding companies.\n       It emerged this week that Rosoboronexport, which has the \n     status of a state department, wants to transform itself into \n     a state-owned corporation, which would give its managers more \n     freedom.\n       VSMPO-Avisma last month struck a $1.4bn deal to supply \n     between 60 and 70 per cent of all titanium consumed by \n     Airbus.\n       Russia recently consolidated civil and military aircraft \n     manufacturers into a single holding company, which could \n     become a customer of VSMPO.\n       Rosoboronexport wants at least 25 per cent of VSMPO, but a \n     source close to the talks said the agency was interested in \n     gaining control.\n                                  ____\n\n\n         Kremlin Moves to Take Control of Key Mineral Titanium\n\n       Yekaterinburg, Russia.--The huge new Airbus A380 cannot \n     take off without it, nor can Boeing's 787 Dreamliner--\n     titanium has become an essential component in modern \n     aircraft.\n       The Urals contain much of the world's reserves of this \n     metal, and the Russian company VSMPO-Avisma, as the world's \n     largest producer, has closed lucrative contracts with \n     aerospace sector in the West. The fact has not gone unnoticed \n     in Moscow. After recovering control of oil and gas, the \n     Kremlin is now looking at retaking control of the metal \n     industry.\n       Aircraft manufacturers in Europe and North America are \n     concerned. They fear the Russian state could exert influence \n     in the way it has recently in energy politics.\n       But at VSMPO-Avisma the concern is that circles around \n     President Vladimir Putin are less concerned about national \n     strategy than about personal gain.\n       With every billion dollars that flows into the Russian \n     state coffers as a result of the continuing high energy \n     prices, the Kremlin's confidence in its economic policy \n     grows.\n       A few months ago Putin announced the formation of a state \n     holding company for the decaying Russian aircraft \n     construction sector. It is to fall under the arms exporter \n     Rosoboronexport.\n       Rosoboronexport head Sergey Jemesov, a close Putin \n     associate, made clear to the titanium producer while on a \n     visit to the Urals that the state would not tolerate an \n     independent concern in a key strategic area of this kind.\n       VSMPO-Avisma, which produced around 30,000 tons in 2005, \n     also supplies titanium for submarines, rockets and nuclear \n     power stations. VSMPO-Avisma general director and major \n     shareholder Vladislav V. Tetiyukhin believes it only a matter \n     of months before the company is sold to the state.\n       ``We are currently in talks about deadlines, price and the \n     extent of the future state holding,'' the 73-year-old \n     businessman says. He does not appear happy at the prospect.\n       Speaking at the company's headquarters in Verknyaya Salda \n     near Yekaterinburg, Tetiyukhin says that neither the clients, \n     such as Boeing and Airbus, nor the company's employees need \n     be concerned about the future.\n       But there are other voices being raised. A manager says she \n     fears a state takeover. ``We have never seen the state \n     managing a business effectively,'' she says, pointing to \n     reports of poor management at the huge gas production company \n     Gazprom, which has effectively been renationalized over \n     recent years.\n       A colleague who works in public relations agrees. ``Putin's \n     immediate circle are merely aiming at personal gain. Once the \n     president stands down in 2008, our concern will soon be \n     converted to cash,'' he believes. Western aircraft \n     manufacturers could also find that renationalization could \n     have unfortunate consequences for them.\n       There are fears that Rosoboronexport could make deliveries \n     of the strong and light metal dependent on Western countries \n     buying Russian aircraft in return.\n       The current owners of VSMPO-Avisma have made the \n     responsibilities clear to Rosoboronexport. ``If the new \n     managers make just one mistake, they will pay heavily for \n     it,'' says one of the main shareholders, who puts the value \n     of the concern at 2 billion euros.\n       VSMPO-Avisma is unusual among Russian commodity producers, \n     as it does not export the raw materials but actually \n     processes them. With an annual turnover of 400 million \n     dollars, the company supplies around a third of world \n     titanium demand. Almost 75 percent of its production goes to \n     exports.\n       In an attempt to allay the concerns of the company's staff, \n     Tetiyukhin says it is not yet clear whether the Kremlin will \n     take a majority shareholding. He has backed on principle a \n     minority holding by the state in the company which was built \n     up under the Soviet Union and then privatized during the \n     tumultuous 1990s.\n       But Putin may not be satisfied with this.\n       The alarm bells started ringing when the tax authorities \n     began taking a keen interest in VSMPO-Avisma and the \n     prosecution services began making ominous visits.\n       Tetiyukhin sees the threat to his company as not yet \n     serious, but the example of Yukos has shown how quickly that \n     situation can change. Precisely these agencies--tax officials \n     and the prosecutors' office--acted as the long arm of the \n     Kremlin in destroying what was the largest Russian oil \n     concern and then selling it to the state-owned competition.\n                                  ____\n\n\n    Back in Business--How Putin's Allies are Turning Russia Into a \n                            Corporate State\n\n                 (By Neil Buckley and Arkady Ostrovsky)\n\n       Leaders of Russian industry, lined up under company banners \n     to greet President Vladimir Putin in St. Petersburg last \n     week, looked like soldiers standing to attention for their \n     commanding officer. Some had flown hundreds of miles for a \n     place in the parade.\n       A month before world leaders fly into the city for the \n     summit of the Group of Eight industrialised nations, the \n     investment forum in Mr. Putin's home city was designed to \n     showcase Russia's economic resurgence. As top executives \n     oozed a confidence born of $70-a-barrel oil and the economic \n     recovery it has generated, the message was clear: Russia is \n     back--and is aggressively eager to use its\n\n[[Page S6400]]\n\n     natural resources as tools to regain its influence in the \n     world.\n       Its renewed assertiveness could scarcely have been imagined \n     eight years ago when, still in the throes of its post-Soviet \n     transformation, the country defaulted on $40bn ($22bn, =32bn) \n     of debt and plunged into financial crisis.\n       But the forum also displayed the new economic order in \n     Russia. Pride of place was given to the state-controlled \n     giants: Gazprom, the natural gas producer that has a market \n     worth of $225bn--bigger than Wal-Mart or Royal Dutch Shell; \n     Rosneft, the oil company about to launch a $10bn initial \n     public offering; and Russian Railways, also planning IPOs of \n     some of its units.\n       Directors of these companies are intimately linked to the \n     president. Alexei Miller, the Gazprom chief executive, worked \n     with Mr. Putin in the St Petersburg mayor's office in the \n     1990s. So, too, did Dmitry Medvedev, who combines his job as \n     first deputy prime minister with chairing Gazprom, and Igor \n     Sechin, who is the president's deputy chief of staff as well \n     as Rosneft chairman. Dmitry Yakunin, chief executive of \n     Russian Railways, also forged a bond with Mr. Putin in the \n     same period.\n       All are part of a network of Putin associates, either from \n     his spell in Russia's second city or former fellow officers \n     in the KGB secret police, who have quietly come to dominate \n     state-controlled businesses--and who often double up as \n     government ministers or senior Kremlin officials. Together, \n     they form the quasiboard of what might be called Russia Inc., \n     comprising the country's most lucrative assets not just in \n     oil and gas but also nuclear power, diamonds, metals, arms, \n     aviation and transport.\n       The dominant force in Russia is no longer the oligarchs of \n     Boris Yeltsin's presidency, who hustled their way to wealth \n     in murky post-Soviet privatisations, then parlayed their \n     riches into political power. Mr. Putin's associates have \n     formed a new marriage of economic and political power. Add in \n     the state's resumption of control of most mass media and, \n     says Boris Nemtsov, the liberal former deputy prime minister, \n     this group has all the resources that defined the old \n     oligarchy.\n       ``The 1990s oligarchs have ceased to be oligarchs and just \n     become businessmen again,'' says Mr. Nemtsov. ``Now we have a \n     chekist oligarchy,'' he says, using Russian slang for a \n     secret policeman.\n       When Mr. Putin succeeded Mr. Yeltsin in March 2000, his \n     goal was to reassert Kremlin control over a chaotic, cash-\n     strapped state dominated by big businessmen powerful enough \n     to shape legislation to their own advantage. Through a 1995 \n     ``loans for shares'' scheme, in which some oligarchs lent \n     money for the budget in return for stakes in the most coveted \n     unprivatised businesses, and by funding Mr. Yeltsin's 1996 \n     presidential election victory, they established a hold over \n     the then president.\n       By helping Mr. Putin to power, they expected to hold \n     similar sway over him. But, by making high-profile examples \n     of some Yeltsin-era oligarchs, Mr. Putin radically clipped \n     the wings of the rest. Two, Boris Berezovsky and Vladimir \n     Gusinsky, fled abroad in 2000 facing fraud charges after \n     clashing with the president.\n       When Mikhail Khodorkovsky, owner of Yukos, was arrested \n     three years later on fraud charges and his oil company was \n     hit with a $28bn back tax bill, it seemed to be part of the \n     same process. Mr. Khodorkovsky had shown political ambitions \n     and was financing opposition parties. It did not just open a \n     new chapter in the wielding of Kremlin power but began a \n     process of redistribution of assets that has been dogging \n     Russia's economy ever Since.\n       The president has not ``liquidated the oligarchs as a \n     class'', as he once pledged--three of the big seven from the \n     1990s are still in business. Alongside the state companies in \n     St. Petersburg last week were leaders of private companies \n     including Lukoil, the energy group, and Rusal, the aluminium \n     giant.\n       But Mr. Putin has made private businessmen loyal and \n     pliant. The Yukos case taught them that they held their \n     assets at the Kremlin's pleasure and became involved in \n     politics at their peril. Asked if he has had any recent \n     contacts with Mikhail Kasyanov, the former prime minister \n     turned anti-Kremlin presidential candidate, one 1990s \n     oligarch grimaces.\n       ``Are you crazy? Seeing Kasyanov today would be like \n     meeting the head of the CIA in the 1970s,'' he says.\n       As the Yeltsin-era oligarchs have declined, the ``state'' \n     oligarchs have emerged. One reason is Mr. Putin's propensity \n     for using trusted acquaintances or former KGB colleagues in \n     every aspect of his attempt to re-establish state power. He \n     packed the presidential administration and government with \n     them--and increasingly in his second term has given the same \n     people supervisory roles in state business.\n       The second is the still largely unacknowledged policy of \n     using state businesses to reestablish Kremlin control of \n     strategic assets. Sometimes, as with Rosneft's purchase of \n     the main production arm of Yukos in 2004, or Gazprom's \n     acquisition of Sibneft from the UK-based Roman Abramovich, \n     this has amounted to a re-nationalisation of assets \n     privatised in the loans-for-shares scheme. In other cases, \n     state-controlled assets are being regrouped into national \n     champions in airlines, aviation or nuclear power (see \n     diagram).\n       Andrei Illarionov, Mr. Putin's former economic adviser \n     turned Kremlin critic, says Russia's ruling apparatus has \n     turned into a kind of corporation. ``The main incentive for a \n     corporation member is the prospect of being placed in charge \n     of a state-controlled company; the size of that company's \n     financial flows is the most accurate indicator of that \n     person's place in the corporate hierarchy,'' he says.\n       On the other hand, Mr. Med-vedev--a leading contender to \n     succeed Mr. Putin--tells the Financial Times: ``I don't \n     believe we're seeing any significant increase in the state's \n     participation in business.\n       ``True, in a number of cases . . . state-controlled \n     companies increased their presence. Above all we're talking \n     about the energy sector. But . . . we're not talking about \n     nationalisation but about buying appropriate assets on the \n     market.''\n       Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for Mr. Putin, says he \n     ``categorically does not agree'' that a new oligarchy has \n     formed in Russia--although he makes no bones about the fact \n     that many senior officials and associates of the president \n     hold positions in state companies. The officials, he says, \n     rightly represent the state's interests. ``These people are \n     not businessmen; they don't have operational control of the \n     company.''\n       As for managers such as Gazprom's Mr. Miller or Russian \n     Railways' Mr. Yakunin, he--like other senior officials--says \n     it is not unusual in Europe or North America for big \n     companies to be run by people who happen to know the \n     country's leader. ``Gas and railways are life-and-death \n     industries for a country the size of Russia,'' says Mr. \n     Peskov. ``Whether Mr. Yakunin is a friend of the president is \n     of minor importance. What is important is whether he is a \n     good manager.''\n       But FT research has found Russian officialdom and business \n     to be extraordinarily intertwined. Of its presidential \n     administration, 11 members chaired six state companies and \n     had 12 further state directorships; 15 senior government \n     officials held six chairmanships and 24 other board seats. In \n     no other G8 country do ministers or senior aides to the head \n     of state or government sit on government companies' boards.\n       The state has also become a big player in mergers and \n     acquisitions. Two transactions--its move to increase its \n     stake in Gazprom from 38 to 51 per cent and Gazprom's \n     purchase of Sibneft--totalled $20.21bn, or half the $40.5bn \n     value of all Russian M deals last year, according to KPMG. \n     Figures from the European Bank for Reconstruction and \n     Development show the public sector's share of the economy \n     rose from 30 per cent to 35 per cent last year.\n       Just like the rise of the 1990s-era oligarchs, the \n     increasing role of state business and its directors has \n     important implications. It does not represent a return to \n     Soviet-era central planning. The Kremlin has embraced the \n     market--as demonstrated by the planned Rosneft IPO and its \n     move to lift restrictions on foreign investors buying the 49 \n     per cent of Gazprom shares not owned by the state. But the \n     new model is a much more directed capitalism.\n       Take aviation. As Chris Weafer, chief strategist at Alfa \n     Bank (owned by Mikhail Fridman, another 1990s oligarch), \n     points out, in order to recreate a national carrier, Aeroflot \n     is being reunited with several regional airlines carved out \n     of it in the 1990s. Instead of replacing its aging fleet with \n     Boeings or Airbuses, it may buy aircraft from United Aircraft \n     Corporation, the national aviation giant now being formed. \n     UAC may, in turn, buy parts from VSMPO-Avisma, a privately \n     owned world leader in titanium that also seems set to fall \n     under state control. Throw in the possibility that windfall \n     oil revenues sitting in Russia's $60bn ``stabilisation fund'' \n     could rebuild crumbling airports and the vision of state \n     capitalism takes shape.\n       There are risks in such an approach. Around the world, \n     public ownership has generally been less effective than \n     private. Instead of focusing on areas where Russia has real \n     global advantages, the state might focus on propping up \n     ailing dinosaurs.\n       State companies can also seek to use a compliant judiciary \n     and tax police to put pressure on targets. One leading \n     businessman says some bureaucrats see themselves as ``Robin \n     Hoods'' taking assets from private ``fat cats.'' ``This is \n     worse than in the mid-1990s, when businessmen paid courts to \n     make particular decisions,'' he says. ``At that time, \n     everyone knew that what they were doing was bad. Now, judges \n     think that by giving preference to state interests in a \n     dispute, they are doing the right thing.'' There is also the \n     danger of well-connected state managers winning favours for \n     their businesses in a way that distorts competition. The \n     leading Russian businessman warns that the state's growing \n     role ``kills initiative.''\n       ``A businessman who can't rely on state orders comes up \n     with something the market needs,'' this businessman says. \n     ``But if the state starts handing out orders and money, \n     people start thinking in terms of lobbying their interest in \n     this or that government project. This requires not \n     entrepreneurial skills but lobbying skills.''\n       State companies may simply attempt to cherry-pick \n     attractive private assets. One example is the pursuit of \n     VSMPO-Avisma, the privately held titanium company, by \n     Rosoboronexport, a state arms export agency headed by Sergei \n     Chemezov, another longtime Putin friend. The same group last \n     year took control of Avtovaz, the Lada car maker, and is \n     emerging as a prime mover in the new state capitalism.\n       The Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, a \n     lobby group, has raised the\n\n[[Page S6401]]\n\n     alarm about the government's failure to protect property \n     rights. In April it published research that concluded \n     Russia's economic model had been most favourable for \n     investment in 2002 and 2003, before state capitalism started \n     to emerge. Had the climate been maintained, it added, a real \n     investment boom would have boosted industrial output and the \n     economy could have grown at nearly twice last year's 6.4 per \n     cent. Even ministers have weighed in. German Gref, the \n     liberal economy minister, recently warned that the sheer \n     number of deals meant the government could not ``keep track \n     of state-controlled firms . . . as they grab market assets.''\n       But is this asset grab the result of ideology--that state \n     control is best--or attempts by officials to line their \n     pockets? Mr. Putin himself has denied that senior officials \n     running state businesses are enriching themselves. Supporters \n     say he put trusted allies into state companies partly to \n     clamp down on corruption--notably Mr. Miller, who has \n     reclaimed $1 bn of Gazprom assets spirited out of the \n     company's control by Yeltsin-era management.\n       Yegor Gaidar, the former prime minister who masterminded \n     Russia's post-communist economic reforms, says state control \n     tends to breed corruption. ``When you are the owner, you \n     don't cheat the company,'' he says. ``But when it isn't your \n     money but the state's money, being a manager you suddenly \n     find you have a lot of good friends and relatives who could \n     benefit from this money.''\n       Some observers say the process could go further: state \n     managers could become owners through flotations or partial \n     privatisations that would give them the chance to buy shares.\n       Most analysts agree Mr. Putin was right to break the \n     influence of the 1990s-era oligarchs, which was distorting \n     competition and deforming the development of Russian \n     capitalism. Yet rather than separating political and business \n     interests in a stable system governed by the rule of law, he \n     has created a new class of politically connected business \n     people.\n       Russia risks becoming locked in a vicious circle of \n     property redistribution and mutating oligarchies. To ensure \n     they do not lose their own assets, those who have gained \n     under Mr. Putin will be prepared to use every resource at \n     their disposal to ensure the election of his chosen successor \n     in 2008.\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, once again I thank colleagues for the \nunanimous vote, 96 to 0, sending a strong message to the men and women \nof the Armed Forces.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We will have more to say on this after the next vote. \nWhile everyone is here, I thank our chairman. This is the sixth bill he \nhas brought to the Senate of the United States as chairman. It gets \nbetter every time. It gets smoother every time. That is owed to this \ngreat Senator from Virginia. We will have more to say about that when \nwe bring the conference report back. A lot of Members need to leave. I \nwant everyone to know before they leave, this Senator is entitled to \ntheir thanks.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my distinguished colleague.\n  Mr. KERRY. First of all, I join in congratulating the managers of \nthis bill.\n  Very quickly, Senator Hagel and I had an amendment with respect to \nthe pay raise of the troops. The House has raised the pay level by 2.7 \npercent. In this bill, there is a 2.2-percent raise. Senator Hagel and \nI sought to equal what the House did and raise it across the board, but \nit is our understanding that the committee has made the determination, \nin consultation with people in the services, the needs of the services, \nthat there is a particular problem with respect to retention of \nnoncommissioned officers. Instead of taking that .5 percent \ndifferential and spreading it throughout the services, it is the \nintention of the committee on the Senate side to try to address the \nretention issue and put that money into noncommissioned officers.\n  If that is the understanding, I think Senator Hagel and I, for that \nreason, will pull back our amendment, and we agree to support the \nposition of the Senate.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator from Massachusetts is correct.\n  The group that has consulted with the committee staff was the senior \nenlisted ranks. The problem rests in the senior enlisted ranks, the \nwarrant officer ranks. That is where the targeted money was applied. We \nwill look at it further in conference.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/22/senate-section/article/S6401-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6401-S6402]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n ANDREW J. GUILFORD TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE CENTRAL \n                         DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Andrew J. \nGuilford, of California, to be United States District Judge for the \nCentral District of California.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate will confirm two more \nlifetime appointments to our Federal courts. I am glad that we are \nvoting on Andrew Guilford, who has been nominated to the District Court \nfor the Central District of California and who has the support of his \nDemocratic home State Senators, Mrs. Boxer and Mrs. Feinstein. Frank \nWhitney, a nominee for the District Court for the Western District of \nNorth Carolina, has the support of his Republican home State Senators. \nBoth nominations were reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee.\n  I am pleased that the Republican leadership has scheduled debate and \nconsideration of these nominations and am glad that the Republican \nleadership\n\n[[Page S6402]]\n\nis this month taking notice of the fact that we can cooperate on swift \nconsideration and confirmation of consensus nominations. Working \ntogether, we confirmed five judges in 1 week earlier this month. We \nhave confirmed three more this week. Many of these judges could have \nbeen confirmed last month if the Republican leadership had chosen to \nmake progress instead of picking a fight on a controversial nomination. \nI look forward to working with the Republican leadership to schedule \ndebate and consideration of other noncontroversial nominees.\n  I, again, commend the Republican Senate leadership for wisely passing \nover the controversial nominations of William Gerry Myers III, Terrence \nW. Boyle, and Norman Randy Smith. The Republican leadership is right to \nhave avoided an unnecessarily divisive debate over these nominations \nthat were reported on a party-line vote.\n  The President and Senate Republican leadership have too often, \nthough, chosen to pick fights over judicial nominations rather than \nfocus on filling vacancies. Judicial vacancies have now grown to well \nover 40 from the lowest vacancy rate in decades. More than half these \nvacancies are without a nominee. The Congressional Research Service has \nrecently released a study showing that this President has been the \nslowest in decades to nominate and the Republican Senate among the \nslowest to act. If they would concentrate on the needs of the courts, \nour Federal justice system, and the needs of the American people, we \nwould be much further along.\n  Still, we have passed several milestones. When the Senate today \nconfirms Andrew Guilford and Frank Whitney as district court judges, \nthe Senate will have confirmed 251 of this President's judicial \nnominees, crossing the 250 threshold. This milestone is an indicator of \nhow cooperative Senate Democrats have been in confirming this \nPresident's nominees. Despite the slow pace of the President and the \nRepublican leadership in filling the needs of the judiciary, the Senate \nhas confirmed more of this President's nominees in the 66 months of his \nPresidency than the Republican-controlled Senate did in the last 66 \nmonths of the Clinton Presidency. During that time, many good nominees \nwere never even given a vote in committee, and only 230 judges were \nconfirmed. That dubious total was the result of their pocket-filibuster \nstrategy to stall and maintain vacancies so that a Republican President \ncould pack the courts and tilt them decidedly to the right. It is a \nstrategy which has been working.\n  Also with these two nominations, the Republican-controlled Senate \nwill have this year confirmed 24 judicial nominations. That surpasses \nthe number of judges confirmed last year, 22. During the 17 months I \nwas chairman of the Judiciary Committee and the Senate was under \nDemocratic control, we confirmed 100 of President Bush's nominees. \nAfter today, in the last 17 months under Republican control, the Senate \nwill have confirmed 46. So the fact that the Senate has confirmed more \nnominees in the past 5\\1/2\\ years than in the last 5\\1/2\\ years of the \nClinton administration is due in no small part to the much faster pace \nof confirmations of this President's nominees when Democrats controlled \nthe Senate.\n  Working together, we could do better. I urge the White House to work \nwith us to select nominees with bipartisan support like Andrew \nGuilford, rather than explosive partisan nominees like Terrence Boyle. \nI hope that the Republican-controlled Senate will stop using \ncontroversial judicial nominations to score partisan political points. \nOur courts are too important.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I regret that I will not be able to vote on \nthe nomination of Andrew Guilford. I have been called back to Idaho \nbecause of a family emergency. Had I been present to vote, I would have \nvoted in his favor. It is my understanding that there are no known \nvotes against this nominee, so his certain confirmation will not be \naffected by my absence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Andrew J. Guilford, of California, to be \nUnited States District Judge for the Central District of California?

WHITNEY TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR \n                 THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF NORTH CAROLINA\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the next nomination.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Frank D. Whitney, of \nNorth Carolina, to be United States District Judge for the Western \nDistrict of North Carolina.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, I am speaking today to offer my \nunconditional support for the nomination of Frank DeArmon Whitney to \nserve as a U.S. district judge in the Western District of North \nCarolina. Mr. Whitney has an impressive record of accomplishment and \nachievement, and he will make an outstanding judge.\n  Frank Whitney has deep roots in North Carolina and in public service. \nHe attended Wake Forest University and the business and law schools at \nthe University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. After receiving his \nlaw degree with honors, Frank clerked on the prestigious U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia Circuit for the Honorable David \nSentelle.\n  Upon completing his clerkship and a year in private legal practice, \nFrank returned to North Carolina and dedicated himself to public \nservice. For nearly 11 years, he served as an assistant U.S. attorney \nfor the Western District of North Carolina, where he acquired \nsubstantial trial experience--both criminal and civil--and earned the \nabiding respect of his colleagues and peers.\n  In 2002, Frank was elevated to the post of U.S. attorney for the \nEastern District of North Carolina. As a result of his leadership, \nenergy, and enthusiasm, the Eastern District has experienced a period \nof robust and resounding success. Among his many accomplishments, Frank \nWhitney has supervised what has been called the most successful public \ncorruption prosecution in North Carolina history. He also has helped \nprepare Iraqis for the process of drafting a constitution and \nestablishing a judicial system. He has even recovered North Carolina's \noriginal copy of the U.S. Bill of Rights, which was stolen from the \nState capitol in 1865.\n\n[[Page S6403]]\n\n  His performance as U.S. attorney has elicited high praise. The \nRaleigh News & Observer credited Frank Whitney for awakening elected \nofficials to the ``importance of ethics in government,'' and the \nnewspaper attributed his incredible success to his ``restless mental \nand physical energy'' and ``Boy Scout idealism.'' Others who have had \nthe opportunity to observe Frank's work have described him as \ndetermined, yet fair.\n  Those who know Frank best--including those who have worked for him in \nthe U.S. Attorney's Office--are effusive in their support for his \nnomination. One of Frank's colleagues made the following assessment: \n``Frank is personable and gracious, yet knows the law and seeks \njustice. He has an abiding love for our country and is deeply committed \nto the principles that have made it great. He appreciates the historic \nseparation of powers and understands judicial self-restraint. Frank \npossesses vast legal knowledge and demonstrates admirable judicial \ntemperament.'' This description is consistent with everything that I \nknow about Frank Whitney, and I submit to my colleagues that this is \nprecisely the type of person we need on our Federal courts.\n  There is another component of Frank's career that I must commend. \nThat is his impressive record of military service, which began during \nhis collegiate days at Wake Forest, where he participated in ROTC. \nFrank is presently a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army Reserves, and \nhas worked as an intelligence officer and as a judge advocate. He has \nbeen awarded numerous military honors, including a Parachutist's Badge \nand three Meritorious Service Medals. Frank Whitney truly has dedicated \nhis life to serving his country--as a civilian and as a soldier.\n  Frank comes to the Senate floor with impeccable credentials and with \nthe unanimous approval of the Senate Judiciary Committee. I am \nconfident that he will serve with great distinction as a member of the \nFederal judiciary, and it is my great privilege to give him my \nstrongest endorsement. I implore my colleagues to confirm him.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, today, I rise in support of a highly \nqualified individual to be confirmed to the Federal bench--Frank \nWhitney to be a U.S. district court judge in the Western District of \nNorth Carolina.\n  President Bush nominated Frank Whitney on February 14, 2006. Frank \nhas impressive academic and professional credentials: He is currently a \nU.S. attorney in my home State of North Carolina; he has practiced in \ntwo very distinguished law firms; he was an assistant U.S. attorney in \nNorth Carolina for several years; he clerked for the DC Circuit Court \nof Appeals; he graduated with honors from law school at the University \nof North Carolina where he also received his MBA; and he graduated Phi \nBeta Kappa from my alma mater of Wake Forest University.\n  But perhaps one of the most honorable characteristics of Frank \nWhitney is that he has done all of this while serving his country in \nthe military. Frank continues his service in the Army Reserve both as \nan intelligence officer and as a judge advocate. He is a former \nparatrooper, has received three Meritorious Service Medals, and \nrecently was selected for promotion to lieutenant colonel.\n  As I mentioned in my testimony to the Judiciary Committee and what I \nwant to mention about Frank here today is that Frank is a good man. I \nhave had the pleasure of meeting Frank's family--his wife Catherine, \nand one of his daughters.\n  Personally, as a husband and as a father, I want to feel confident \nthat the individuals we confirm to a lifetime appointment on the \nFederal bench understand the seriousness and significance of the job \nfor which they are being considered.\n  I am confident that Frank does understand the importance of being a \nFederal judge. I know Frank is qualified to serve on the bench, and I \nam confident that Frank will continue to serve his Nation with honor \nand dignity. I believe Frank will continue to make his family proud, \nand I am confident that North Carolina will have one of the best \nFederal judges in the country in Frank Whitney.\n  Frank Whitney possesses qualities necessary to serve as a U.S. \ndistrict court judge. He is fairminded, evenhanded, and treats all with \nrespect. He has repeatedly demonstrated a commitment to public service \nand a spirit of impartiality and cooperation. I believe Frank Whitney's \nhonesty, integrity, and intelligence have earned him strong bipartisan \nsupport and he will continue to proudly serve as a representative of \nour country.\n  I thank my colleagues for supporting the nomination of Frank Whitney \nto be the next U.S. district court judge for the Western District of \nNorth Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Frank D. Whitney, of North Carolina, to be \nUnited States District Judge for the Western District of North \nCarolina?\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/22/senate-section/article/S6403-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n NOMINATION OF THOMAS D.

ANDERSON\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today we confirm Thomas D. Anderson as U.S. \nattorney for the District of Vermont. I am pleased that we acted \npromptly in the Judiciary Committee to report Tom's nomination to the \nfloor and that the Senate is acting promptly to confirm him. As an \nassistant U.S. attorney in Burlington for 14 of the last 19 years, the \nmanaging partner of a respected Burlington law firm, and as deputy \nstate's attorney in Newport, Tom's varied experience and long ties to \nVermont have prepared him well to be Vermont's top Federal law \nenforcement official.\n  We have a strong tradition of good law enforcement in Vermont. Our \nmost recent U.S. attorneys are part of that tradition. Charlie Tetzlaff \nserved an extended term and has gone on to distinguish himself as the \nExecutive Director of the U.S. Sentencing Commission. Peter Hall served \nably and now fills the Vermont seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Second Circuit.\n  Tom is the kind of well-qualified consensus nominee who can be easily \nconfirmed by the Senate. In fact, I joined with Republican Gov. Jim \nDouglas in recommending Tom to President Bush. As a former prosecutor, \nI have been particular impressed with his work since returning to the \nU.S. Attorney's Office in 2001 as head of the narcotics unit and as the \nlead attorney of the Department of Justice's Organized Crime Drug \nEnforcement Task Force. He has worked closely with both Federal and \nState drug investigators to identify and target the highest level drug \ntraffickers in Vermont and to coordinate major drug investigations \ncovering many districts. I believe his work on drug crime is especially \nimportant preparation as we continue to target those crimes, which are \none of Vermont's most difficult law enforcement challenges.\n  In addition to his work combating drug crimes, Tom has gained a wide \nvariety of experience in private practice and as a prosecutor. He spent \n3 years at the U.S. Attorney's Office in the civil division, \nprosecuting civil enforcement actions in Federal court brought under \nthe False Claims Act and other statutes. In 1994, he was assigned as a \nspecial assistant attorney general for the\n\n[[Page S6404]]\n\nState of Vermont to prosecute police officers charged with obstruction \nof justice. While a partner at Sheehey Furlong Rendall & Behm, Tom's \nfirm represented the State of Vermont in its litigation against the \ntobacco industry. And of course I must discuss one of Tom's finest \naccomplishments, his 1979 graduation from St. Michael's College in \nColchester, VT, my alma mater.\n  Tom has a keen legal and will bring a great deal of experience and \nenthusiasm to this important law enforcement post. Congratulations to \nTom, his wife Wendy, and his entire family on his confirmation today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Thomas D.

And \nthere is never enough attention that is paid to staff. No matter how \nmany times we take a moment to just say thanks to our staff, it never \ncomes close to paying the tribute which is really owed to them.\n  Charlie Abell, who is the majority staff director, is just a \nwonderful human being as well as a gifted professional. He and all the \nother members of your staff, I say to Senator Warner, are really, \nreally terrific. And I cannot say enough about Rick DeBobes, Peter \nLevine, and all of the members of my staff. Rick, our minority staff \ndirector, leads a truly extraordinary staff.\n  Mr. President, I guess the best way I can express my gratitude is to \nask that the names of my staff be printed in the Record at this time. I \nask unanimous consent that a list of their names be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       Jon Clark, Chris Cowart, Dan Cox, Madelyn Creedon, Rick \n     DeBobes, Brie Eisen, Evelyn Farkas, Richard Fieldhouse, \n     Creighton Greene, Bridget Higgins, Mike Kuiken, Gary Leeling, \n     Peter Levine, Mike McCord, Bill Monahan, Mike Noblet, Arun \n     Seraphin.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, also, talking about accolades, I want to \nsingle out Senator Cantwell for an amendment which she authored \nrelative to the replacement of National Guard equipment that has been \nleft in Iraq and Afghanistan. The absence of this equipment has \nundermined the ability of the National Guard units to train and to meet \nthe requirements in their home States. And the Cantwell amendment is \ngoing to require the Department to establish a comprehensive plan to \nrecapitalize or to replace this equipment.\n  It is going to be an essential addition, replacement for the National \nGuard. There was not enough attention paid to this amendment as things \nkind of flew through here. I want to thank Senator Cantwell for her \nleadership in making sure our National Guard is well equipped and given \nthe support they deserve.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I might join my distinguished colleague \nfrom Michigan, it has been a privilege for me, as it has for these 28 \nyears we have been together, to work as partners and in many respects \nequals. He has been chairman of the committee. I have been chairman of \nthe committee. We have both occupied positions of chairman and ranking \nmember in these many years that we have been fortunate to serve on this \ncommittee together, and we have a very outstanding group of colleagues \nwho are members of the committee. I thank my good friend for these many \nyears. I am very proud, as he is, of this piece of legislation, which \nat this critical juncture in our Nation's history, with our forces \nserving in over 60 Nation across the world, and their families here at \nhome are with them, we have them in mind at all times and, indeed, a \nvery significant group of Civil Service employees who likewise are \nserving our Nation in their capacities with the Department of Defense \nand other departments and agencies related to our national security.\n  Senator Levin mentioned particularly our senior staff, our full \nstaff, as a matter of fact. In many ways, some of the juniors work \nharder than seniors some days, but I won't get into that. I best leave \nthat to my able staff director, Charlie Abell, as you leave that to \nyour staff director. But we are fortunate to have these two staff \ndirectors and these magnificent staffs. They really are professional \nstaffs. The appointment of our staff, I don't even recall inquiring as \nto the political affiliation of so many of these individuals that I \nhave had the privilege of working with these many years in the Senate. \nBut indeed, they do work long hours. Their reward is not the pay. Their \nreward is a sense of satisfaction, as it is for you and me and members \nof our committee and, indeed, the Members of the Senate, of what we are \ntrying to do on behalf of the uniformed men and women of the Armed \nForces and their families and their civilian counterparts.\n  I thank my distinguished colleague.\n  I ask unanimous consent that S. 2766, as amended, be printed as \npassed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed immediately to the consideration en bloc of S. 2767 \nthrough S. 2769, Calendar Order Nos. 427, 428, and 429, that all after \nthe enacting clause of those bills be stricken and that the appropriate \nportion of S. 2766, as amended, be inserted in lieu thereof, according \nto the schedule which I am sending to the desk; that these bills be \nadvanced to third reading and passed, the motion to reconsider en bloc \nbe laid upon the table, and that the above actions occur without \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank each and every one.\n  If there is no other Senator seeking recognition, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 \nminutes, followed by Senator Talent and following that, as much time as \nSenator Byrd might consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to thank the distinguished \nSenator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, and Senator Levin of Michigan for \ntheir leadership in getting this legislation passed and for accepting \nlanguage from legislation that I have sponsored, the National Guard \nEquipment Accountability Act, and making it part of the Defense \nauthorization bill we just passed. They have done an outstanding job \nmanaging this legislation on the floor.\n  I also thank the Senator from Delaware, Mr. Biden, the Senator from \nConnecticut, Mr. Dodd, and the cochair of the Senate National Guard \nCaucus, Mr. Leahy, who also cosponsored this important legislation.\n  As a nation, we have a solemn duty to honor, prepare and properly \nequip all the men and women in uniform. The National Guard and Reserve \nare an essential part of our national defense, and confronting our \nenemies in distant lands is one of their obligations. Responding to \nthreats here at home is another. In Washington State, the threats of \nvolcanos, tsunamis, and other natural disasters are never far from our \nminds. We are aware of our porous northern border and the threat that \nposes to our safety and security. We know that the National Guard is \nnot only the first line of response but also the first line of defense. \nWhether it is Mount St. Helens or floods or a variety of issues, we \nknow the National Guard in Washington State has been there when we need \nthem most.\n  They do more than just preserve our security at home. Thousands of \nNational Guard members are currently deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan--\nin fact, there are about 500 members of the Washington National Guard \ndeployed overseas. All of those serving in the National Guard make \ngreat sacrifices. They accept enormous responsibilities to help us. We \nowe it to them to make sure their missions are successful and that \nNational Guard members have the resources they need to execute their \nmissions.\n  Right now, I want to make sure we are upholding our part of the \nbargain. When our Reserves and National Guard are deployed on \noperations overseas, they are deployed with equipment from their unit. \nThey go to their mission with the tools that they have trained with--\nfamiliar humvees, radios, trucks, whatever it takes to make them \nsuccessful. While they serve abroad, their equipment actually becomes \npart of the greater mission. As a result, when these men and women \nreturn home to places like Camp Murray, their equipment often does not \nreturn with them. It is left behind, helping other Guard units complete \ntheir portion of the mission and to fill in where there are gaps in \nsupplies. The problem is that we have no plan to help the National \nGuard and Reserve units deal with the loss of that equipment. These \nreturning units are left underequipped and lacking the equipment \nnecessary for continued training for their next deployments.\n  That is why I offered this language to make sure that we are taking \ncare of this shortfall. According to the Department of Defense, the \nArmy National Guard has left more than 75,000 items valued at $1.7 \nbillion overseas in ongoing operations. So that is why this language \nwas so important to add to the Defense bill.\n  Last October, the Government Accountability Office found that at the \ntime the Army, in leaving this equipment and resources behind, did not \nhave a replacement plan. So specifically my amendment codifies language \ntelling the Department of Defense to provide our men and women in \nuniform with the protection and resources they deserve. The language \nrequires a tracking system of all this equipment and for a replacement \nplan to make sure that these men and women get the equipment they need \nin the theaters of operation, when they return home--enabling them to \nplan ahead for their next mission.\n  Finally, my amendment would also require a memorandum of \nunderstanding, specifying exactly how equipment will be tracked and \nwhen it will be returned. This will help our National Guard and Reserve \nunits plan ahead for future obligations and missions. Given the current \nequipment situation and aggressive use of our National Guard, I believe \nit is critical that we have them fully equipped for both their missions \nat home and abroad.\n  Again, I thank the Senators for helping to get this language into the \nDefense authorization bill. Our soldiers, our Active Duty, our Reserve \nunits, and the men and women of the Guard have chosen to stand and \nserve our country with pride and to sacrifice and accept enormous \nresponsibility. We, too, have the responsibility of giving them the \nresources they need to fulfill their mission. I know this legislation \nwill help them do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia for \nallowing me to go ahead of him for a moment or two. I do want to take a \nfew minutes to talk about an amendment which I cosponsored with Senator \nNelson of Florida that passed the Senate in the Defense bill and that \naddresses a problem which has been growing and\n\n[[Page S6406]]\n\nwhich is affecting the readiness of our Armed Forces.\n  The fact is, predatory payday lenders are targeting American troops \nand are trying to make a buck off of their service to our country. We \nrely on the military to protect us, and we have just taken a \nsignificant step to protect them from predatory lenders. The Nelson-\nTalent amendment limits the annual percentage rate that payday lenders \ncan charge soldiers and their spouses to 36 percent or about 1\\1/2\\ to \n2 times what credit cards typically charge. I recognize that payday \nlending can be a risky business, but a triple-digit interest rate, \nwhich is commonly charged today, is simply too much.\n  Some estimate that the average APR on a payday loan today is over 400 \npercent, and there have been reports of payday loans with more than 800 \npercent interest rates. This is a national problem. Predatory payday \nlenders set up shop near our military bases throughout the country and \nprey on our servicemembers. We know about this problem in Missouri. We \nhave the unfortunate distinction of having a relatively large number \nand high density of payday lenders around our largest military base, \nFort Leonard Wood, in Pulaski County. It is a great base with a lot of \nservice men and women in it. As a result, there are a lot of payday \nlenders around. St. Robert, which is a small gateway town near the \nbase, only has 5,200 residents but has eight payday lenders. Examples \nsuch as St. Robert led professors at the University of Florida and \nCalifornia State University to say that ``irrefutable geographic \nevidence demonstrates that payday lenders are actively and aggressively \ntargeting U.S. military personnel.'' Military families pay an estimated \n$80 million annually in payday loan fees.\n  The problem not only affects military families' financial well-being, \nit directly impacts troop readiness because these young men and women, \nmany of whom are just out of high school, are not financially \nsophisticated and fall way behind in these payments. They have to go \nbankrupt, and then that affects their ability to get security \nclearances.\n  In this month's issue of Seapower magazine, Admiral Mike Mullen, \nChief of Naval Operations, U.S. Navy, said, ``A sailor's financial \nreadiness directly impacts unit readiness and the navy's ability to \naccomplish its mission . . . I am concerned with the number of sailors \nwho are taken advantage of by predatory lending practices, the most \ncommon of which is the payday loan.''\n  The Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Military Community and \nFamily Policy, John Molino, has also said this problem ``affects unit \nreadiness.''\n  Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy, Terry Scott, has said ``the \nNo. 1 reason our sailors are forced from one job to another is because \nthey lose their security clearance . . . and the No. 1 reason they lose \ntheir security clearance is because of financial difficulties.''\n  The number of security clearances of sailors and Marines that were \nrevoked or denied due to financial problems have soared from 124 in FY \n2000 to 1,999 in 2005. The total for the 6-year period is 5,482. And, \nthat's just for one of the departments.\n  The impact on readiness is one of the serious ramifications of this \nproblem. But, another consequence is that some servicemembers have \nruined their financial lives by taking out payday loans--that \nautomatically rollover--at exorbitant rates they can never payoff.\n  Navy Petty Officer 2nd Class Jason Withrow, stationed on a nuclear \nsubmarine at Kings Bay Naval Submarine Base in Georgia, took a $300 \npayday loan in summer 2003. He borrowed more to service the fee, and by \nFebruary 2004, he'd paid about $5,000 in interest on $1,800 in payday \nloans at four different lenders.\n  Army Specialist Myron Hicks, stationed at Fort Stewart, GA, borrowed \n$1,500 for a car repair. He paid back $3,000--twice what he borrowed. I \ncould give a hundred stories like that.\n\n  Cristie Worrow, a 29-year-old petty officer second class at the Naval \nAir Reserve in Jacksonville, FL, took out a $500 payday loan in 1998. \nOver 3 years she had two more loans and was paying fees that sometimes \nreached $200 per month. Eventually, she had paid $2,400 in fees.\n  Our troops deserve uniform, national protection against abusive \nfinancial practices that target them. This is clearly a step in the \nright direction.\n  An impressive list of military and veteran service organizations, \nwith over 5.5 million members, support the legislation. The Military \nCoalition includes the Association of the United States Army (AUSA), \nMilitary Officers Association of America (MOAA), Veterans of Foreign \nWars (VFW), Navy League of the United States (NLUS), Air Force \nAssociation (AFA), and Marine Corps League (MCL).\n  The Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, Dr. David \nChu, has expressed his support for the legislation. He has said the \nlegislation ``provides reasonable and appropriate limits.''\n  Numerous consumer groups like the Center for Responsible Lending, \nConsumer Federation of America, and Institute of Consumer Financial \nEducation also support the bipartisan amendment.\n  Mr. President, I feel strongly that we can hold this amendment in \nconference. I thank the chairman and ranking member. They know how bad \nthis problem is. I am grateful for their help in getting this in the \nbill. Chairmen Craig and Shelby of the Veterans' and Banking Committees \nwere cooperative in getting this on the bill. I trust our colleagues \nand friends in the House will understand the importance of holding this \namendment.\n  This abuse of payday lending is compromising the readiness of the \nU.S. military. The problem has become that big. It is ruining the \nfinancial lives of thousands of our service men and women who \nunknowingly, because of their lack of sophistication, get into debts \nfrom these abusive lenders, far greater than they are able to pay.\n  We have put a stop to that with this amendment. We need to hold it in \nconference committee. I am confident we will be able to do that. I look \nforward to working with the Senate and the House to pass this provision \ninto law on behalf of our troops.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank our colleague from Missouri. He \nworked very diligently on this amendment. It is another example of how \nwe must reach down from time to time and provide a caring hand for \nparticularly those young men and women in uniform today who, \nunfortunately, can be victimized because of their individual needs and \nrequirements at a special time. I believe this amendment will go a long \nway to remedy that situation. I congratulate the Senator for his hard \nwork.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and appreciate his \nand Senator Levin's work on this amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/22/senate-section/article/S6406-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6406]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, I have come to the floor this evening to \ncongratulate my esteemed colleague, the very distinguished and able and \nhonorable and highly respected chairman of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, on the completion of his final Defense authorization bill.\n  He is my chairman, Mr. President. His tenure at the helm of the Armed \nServices Committee, on which I have the privilege to serve, has been \neventful and very distinguished. But then distinguished tenure is not \nunusual for this Virginia gentlemen--another term I use lovingly and \nfondly and respectfully because it means something to me, having been \nin this Senate now for almost 48 years, having been on the \nAppropriations Committee for almost 48 years, having been on the Armed \nServices Committee for almost that long. This is a very special man--a \nVirginia gentleman in every sense of the term. I say this with the \nutmost admiration. Distinguished tenure is not unusual for this \nVirginia gentlemen, whose entire life has been spent in the service to \nhis country, to his great State, the Commonwealth of Virginia, the \ncradle of Presidents.\n\n[[Page S6407]]\n\n  Since his enlistment in the Navy at the tender age of 17, during \nWorld War II, John William Warner, Jr., has put his immense and very \nconsiderable talents completely--I say completely--at the disposal of \nhis beloved country. He is in a long line of Virginia gentlemen who \nhave put their talents at the disposal of this beloved country of \ntheirs and ours. A Virginia gentleman. What more noble term could be \nused? A Virginia gentleman. Whether serving in World War II, the Korean \nconflict, as an officer in the Marine Corps, or on the U.S. Circuit \nCourt of Appeals, John Warner always said, ``Here am I. Send me.'' Look \nat your Bible. Someone else said that. ``Here am I. Send me.'' John \nWarner has always said that--``send me.''\n  John Warner's remarkable career spiraled ever upward, eventually \ntaking him to the office of assistant U.S. attorney, then to the office \nof Under Secretary of the Navy, then to the office of the Secretary of \nthe Navy from 1972 to 1974, and finally to his present position as \nsenior U.S. Senator from the great State of Virginia, having now won \nfive consecutive elections to the Senate, beginning in 1978. I was then \nthe majority leader of the Senate, yes, when he came to the Senate.\n  This year, my friend John Warner became the second longest serving \nSenator from Virginia, second only to the illustrious Harry Flood Byrd, \nSr., in the 218-year history of the Senate. Senator John Warner--what a \nman--is currently serving his 27th year in the U.S. Senate.\n  What a record of achievement for his country and my country and your \ncountry, Mr. President. And what a shining example of dignity, \nintellect, style, integrity, and talent Senator Warner presents for the \nyoung people of his country and his State and my country and my State. \nHe presents integrity and talent for the young people. Never given to \nharsh criticism--I have never heard him utter a word of harsh \ncriticism--never given to rhetoric, never succumbing to the rank \npartisanship which has become so prevalent today in American politics \non both sides of the aisle, John Warner is his own man. That is a lot \nto say. He is his own man. What more noble attribute? He is his own \nman, and I am proud to serve with him. I enjoy working with him. I \nshall miss his very steady hand on the wheel, at the helm of the Armed \nServices Committee. What a great position, what an honorable position--\nthe helm of the Armed Services Committee. But I will relish the \nopportunity to work with him for the good of our country in the years \nto come. Talk about class acts--John Warner is the classiest of class \nacts, and his comity, his courtesy, his unfailing good humor, and his \nrefreshing bipartisan attitude are of incalculable benefit to this \nbody. May we be blessed in the Senate by many more like him. I salute \nSenator John Warner for his patriotic service--my, look at that \nrecord--his patriotic service. How many times has he put his life on \nthe line for the good old red, white, and blue, for Old Glory? I thank \nhim for his patriotic service and for his selfless--selfless--selfless, \nI say, selfless, leadership. He is my kind of Senator. May God bless \nhim. He is my kind of Senator.\n\n  He is the best kind of man. I could say more and more and more about \nhim, and I could say more and more and more about his colleague who \nworks with him on the Armed Services Committee, the Senator from \nMichigan, Mr. Carl Levin. They are two of a kind.\n\n     God, give us men! A time like this demands strong minds, \n           great hearts, true faith, and ready hands.\n     Men whom the lust of office does not kill;\n     Men whom the spoils of office cannot buy;\n     Men who possess opinions and a will;\n     Men who have honor; men who will not lie.\n     Men who can stand before a demagogue and brave his \n           treacherous flatteries without winking.\n     Tall men, sun-crowned; who live above the fog, in public duty \n           and in private thinking.\n     For while the rabble with its thumbworn creeds,\n     Its large professions and its little deeds, mingles in \n           selfish strife, lo! Freedom weeps!\n     Wrong rules the land and waiting justice sleeps.\n     God, give us men!\n\n     Men who serve not for selfish booty; but real men, \n           courageous, who flinch not at duty.\n     Men of dependable character; men of sterling worth;\n     Then wrongs will be redressed and right will rule the Earth.\n     God, give us men!\n  Men like Senator John William Warner.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, at the end of this long day and the \nconclusion of this Armed Services bill, I thank my colleague. I \nrecognize that under the rules of our caucus I have done my 6 years, \nand I step down.\n  Mr. BYRD. And I am sorry about that.\n  Mr. WARNER. Anyway, I accept that, as we accept other things in life. \nBut the rewards of this institution and service in the Senate are many \nfold, but none is coveted or desired more than the thoughts and indeed \nthe praise of our fellow colleagues with whom we serve.\n  I counted up the other day my record--as you say, in the 28th year--\nwhich pales in comparison to yours. Senator Levin and I have been here \nthese years together, and my calculation is that we have served with \n241 Senators in this period of almost 28 years. And I remember--I \nthought of it last night, Senator Byrd, when I was debating--I think it \nwas close to 11 o'clock--with Senator Kerry. We had the old-fashioned \ndebate with questions and answers, back and forth together.\n  But when I first came and you were the majority leader, the Halls of \nthis Chamber were literally trembling with the thunder of the debates \nof Ted Kennedy, Lowell Weicker, Bob Dole. And you were not sparing in \nthe thunder that you have expressed from time to time; not in angst or \nanger but with thunder as to your convictions. My good friend, Senator \nLevin, we are perhaps a little more modest than those such as Strom \nThurmond, and we could go on and name those individuals, back when we \ndid a great deal more debate than we do now in the Senate.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. But the thoughtful remarks that Senator Byrd give me on \nthis very special day in my humble career in this institution are \ndeeply appreciated by me, by my mother and father who are no longer \nwith me, but they would be grateful, as will be my children when I have \nthe privilege of showing them what the Senator has said.\n  I remember the trips that we have been on. Senator Byrd took the \nfirst group of Senators to meet Gorbachev when he was elevated in the \nSoviet Union. But I suppose the trip I remember the most was an \nofficial trip that we took to Italy, and Senator Byrd took myself and \none or two others down, and we saw the Roman forum. It was a hot day, \nand I remember we paused and he recounted the history of those ruins \nthat stood there, and how so much of the origins of the Senate are \nderived from that particular chapter of history.\n  I recall that Senator Byrd--he may not remember this--but he \npresented each of us with a Roman coin, an old one--I still have it--\nand on it is printed two letters: S and C--Senatus consultum--which in \nthose times, those coins would not be a factor unless it had ``SC,'' \nwhich indicated it is with the approval of the Roman Senate.\n  Fascinating. Senatus consultum. Advise and consent. How well I \nremember. He and I serve on this group that we call respectfully the \nGang of 14, and the hours that we have spent in your office going over \nthe history of the advise and consent clause in the Constitution, and \nhow best to express the balance between the executive branch and \nthe legislative branch in the process of advice and consent.\n\n  Mr. President, I could go on for an endless period. And, yes, I have \nenjoyed your friendship. I must say that I remember with the deepest of \nsympathy your lovely wife because she would go with us on those trips--\n--\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. And spare us from some of your wrath and your ability to \ndrive those delegations to utter exhaustion to perform our official \nduties and perhaps such other things that we did at other times, mostly \nrelated to history. How lucky we all are to have served with Senator \nByrd. But above all, it is what he has taught us by way of dignity and \nhonesty, or as MacArthur said: ``Duty, honor, and country.''\n  Mr. BYRD. Thank you.\n\n[[Page S6408]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. There you sit, Mr. Byrd, and there is not one among us \nwho will ever be able to match you, I think, in so many ways.\n  Mr. BYRD. Thank you. Thank you.\n  Mr. WARNER. I shall always remember you as my teacher in the past, my \nteacher today, and my teacher so long as the good Lord keeps us here \ntogether.\n  Mr. BYRD. Thank you, thank you.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank you, Senator. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I wanted to get back \nin time to hear Senator Byrd speak about Senator Warner. I knew that is \nwhat you were going to do, and I missed only the opening. I was back \nlong enough to get the full flavor of what Senator Byrd was saying. The \nhonor that he has just bestowed upon Senator Warner is genuinely \ndeserved and genuinely delivered. It comes from perhaps not just a \nSenate man, but the Senate man to another Senate man.\n  This institution we occupy for different lengths of time, but all \nrelatively brief compared to its history, is really entrusted to all of \nus. I know of no two Senators sitting right across the aisle from each \nother in whom that trust is more genuinely felt and recognized and \nhonored than Senator Byrd and Senator Warner. Just to be able to get \nback and listen to, Senator Byrd as he spoke about Senator Warner was a \ngenuine treat for me.\n  He captured the essence of Senator Warner. I tried to do it a few \ntimes in the last few weeks very briefly, always saying that when we \nbring back that conference report, which will be Senator Warner's last \nconference report as chairman, that I hope there will be many Members \non the Senate floor who can try to do what you did so beautifully \ntoday, Senator Byrd, which is to capture the essence of the great \nSenator and to express the gratitude of each of us and everybody in \nthis body, and I know the men and women in the Armed Forces--but truly \nbroader than that, the men and women of the United States--for the \nservice that Senator Warner is providing.\n  So I thank Senator Byrd for taking the time to do what each one of us \nwould want to do in our own ways, and that is just simply to \nacknowledge our love and our respect for a truly great man, a Senate \nman, from the Senate man, Senator Byrd.\n  Mr. BYRD. Thank you.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Carl Levin. As I \nsay, we came here to this institution together and served our entire \ncareers on the Armed Services Committee, and we have shared back and \nforth the chairmanship and ranking member positions. But I do believe \nmany of the comments that Senator Byrd made about me rest on your \nshoulders likewise.\n  He and I have developed a trust and respect. Even though we often \nvote and cancel one another out on some issues, I think we have managed \ntogether to carve out a place in history for the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, a committee where there is the highest degree of \nbipartisanship, because our calling is the defense of this Nation and \nthe welfare of the men and women of the Armed Forces and their \nfamilies. And I have always felt that, and I say with a deep sense of \nhumility that member after member on that committee has always put \nthose obligations, those special trusts ahead of all other \nconsiderations. I thank both Senators very much.\n  Mr. President, I see another Senator seeking recognition, so at this \npoint I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I would just like to take a moment to \nexpress some accolades to my fellow colleagues who are on the Senate \nfloor and say that it is an honor and a pleasure to have an opportunity \nto serve on the Armed Services Committee under the leadership of the \nchairman, Senator Warner, as well as the ranking member, Senator Levin. \nIt has also been an honor for me to serve on the Appropriations \nCommittee under the leadership of Senator Byrd, as well as the \nchairman, Senator Cochran. It is the institutional memory that they \nbring to the process that so many of us appreciate. It is the \nbipartisan approach they take to solving our legislative problems that \nbrings some peace and understanding, I think, to this process.\n\n  I just want to take a moment before I make my official remarks \nhonoring my Congressman from Colorado, to express to the Senators on \nthe floor how much I appreciate their leadership and what they have \ndone and congratulate them on a great Defense bill that we have just \npassed.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Colorado. I must \nsay that he is my eldest daughter's Senator. She lives in his State \nwith her husband and child, and therefore I have a very special \naffinity for the Senators from Colorado. I have known them for years.\n  My only regret is that the Senator once served on the Armed Services \nCommittee, but he could not resist the temptation of joining our \nesteemed colleague, Senator Byrd, on the Appropriations Committee. I \nhave seen many Senators succumb to that same temptation.\n  At any rate, the Senator from Colorado will always have a place on \nour committee should he wish to return someday. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Chairman. I still recognize him as ``Mr. \nChairman.'' He has connections to Colorado. I want to share with him my \nconnection I have with Virginia. I have an ancestor who fought in the \nRevolutionary War who came right out of Bedford, VA. We have deep roots \nin Virginia. It is always a pleasure for me to get to know your State. \nI venture to say I have probably spent a lot more time in his State \nthan he realizes, just getting to know it because of my family roots \nthere.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I know the community of Bedford. It is a \nvery historic community.\n  Mr. ALLARD. It is.\n  Mr. WARNER. They are very proud of the fact that they erected a \nmagnificent memorial to the men and women of the Armed Forces who \nserved in World War II, and particularly on D-day. The President of the \nUnited States came down to speak at the time of the dedication. The \nsons of Bedford are well known.\n  As a matter of fact, as a footnote to history, in World War II, of \nall the communities across this great Nation that lost so many men and \nwomen--as you know, over a half million casualties in World War II--\nBedford, per capita, on D-day lost more than any other community in \nAmerica of its sons who fell on those beaches in that historic battle, \nJune 6, 1944.\n  Mr. ALLARD. That is worth noting. I thank him again for his gracious \nhospitality and the help he has extended to me in trying to serve the \npeople of Colorado in the debate on this very important bill.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/22/senate-section/article/S6408-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6408-S6409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            HONORING BARBARA HAWKINS: A PILLAR OF JOURNALISM\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, when I was a boy growing up in Mercer \nCounty, WV, I made it a point to read the Bluefield Daily Telegraph. \nThat was more than a few years ago, but I have not stopped reading the \nBluefield newspaper. It is a strong instrument of information and \neducation in the southern coalfields of West Virginia.\n  That paper has been fortunate to publish the insights and analysis of \nmany fine reporters. One of the best is Barbara Hawkins, who has \nannounced her retirement after three decades of service. She is not \nonly one of the best reporters from the Bluefield paper; she also is \none of the best reporters to walk the hills of West Virginia.\n  Local news media represent a community's window on the school board, \ncity council, and county commission, the State legislature, and the \nCongress. The local media, more than any other resource, educate people \nabout the issues that directly affect their lives. Barbara Hawkins \nknows, better than most, how vital a reporter's job is. She understands \nthat newspapers are an instrument to inform the public about\n\n[[Page S6409]]\n\nthe issues and events that affect their daily lives.\n  Through her work, Barbara Hawkins served as a teacher and a \ncounselor, a defender of right and a pursuer of wrong, an advocate, a \nchampion, and a friend to all in southern West Virginia.\n  Now, after three decades of service, Barbara has decided to retire \nfrom daily reporting. But, as much as we would expect, she is not \ngiving up the art of writing and informing. Her columns and special \nprojects will continue, allowing all of us to learn from her insights \nand her experiences.\n  Most of Barbara's work at the newspaper was in the public eye. But, \nmore than anything else, Barbara's strength came from her deep devotion \nto her family. We have all walked the terrible journey with her after \nher daughter, Pam, was taken from this world, a victim of domestic \nviolence more than 20 years ago. Barbara has never been shy about that \nloss nor about her efforts to prevent that shattering experience from \ntouching other families. But what is not in the headlines is Barbara's \nincredible commitment to her daughter, Kimberleigh, her granddaughter, \nPami, and all of the members of her family. While her work at the paper \nmay be a great love of Barbara's, it pales in comparison to her love of \nfamily. Barbara's family is her source of strength and inspiration, now \nand always.\n  On a personal level, I will miss reading Barbara's daily reporting. I \nmade a habit of looking for her byline. She has always shown a keen \ninsight into not only southern West Virginia but also statewide and \nnational issues. Her instincts, her institutional knowledge, and her \ncommentary have always caused me, like so many others, to stop and \nthink and to consider alternate approaches. Her commitment to the \ngreater good in society is something for each of us to emulate.\n  I have often said that as long as there is a forum in which questions \ncan be asked by men and women who do not stand in awe of a chief \nexecutive and one can speak as long as one's feet will allow one to \nstand, the liberties of the American people will be secure. That forum \nis this Senate. But the same can be said of the news media--the \nnewspapers, radio stations, television stations, and other outlets that \nprovide information that is important to the lives of all Americans. \nFreedom of the press is a key of this Republic. Without it, the \nAmerican people can be led to disaster without so much as a whisper. \nTheir freedoms can be trampled; their rights can be subverted.\n  Barbara Hawkins defended that freedom. She exercised it every single \nday. And all of us are better for her work.\n  I thank Barbara for her many years of service to the people of West \nVirginia and wish her well in the challenges that certainly are ahead \nof her in her life's journey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/22/senate-section/article/S6409-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     NEVADA'S STATE HEALTH INSURANCE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM VOLUNTEERS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to commend Marilyn Wills, the \ndirector of Nevada's State Health Insurance Assistance Program, for her \nefforts during the implementation of the Medicare drug program in my \nState. I would like to recognize Marilyn for not only her service to \nNevada's Medicare beneficiaries, but also for her dedication to her \nprofession and her contributions to the community.\n  As most of us have surely heard from beneficiaries, the enrollment \nperiod for the new drug program was a time of great stress, confusion, \nand frustration. As seniors, people with disabilities, and their loved \nones tried to understand the complicated new drug benefit, decide \nwhether to sign up, and then find the best drug plan to join, many \nfound themselves overwhelmed. And with the May 15 enrollment deadline \nlooming, it became increasingly clear that the public needed better \ninformation and better help using that information.\n  I commend Nevada's State Health Insurance Assistance Program, or \nSHIP, for heeding this call in my State. Hundreds of SHIP volunteers \ngave their time and energy to counsel their fellow Nevadans about the \nnew Medicare drug benefit, as well as other components of Medicare, \nsupplemental health insurance, and long-term care. As more Medicare \nbeneficiaries, their families, and friends turned to Nevada SHIP for \none-on-one counseling and assistance, SHIP volunteers were eventually \nresponding to over 1,000 phone calls every month. Nevada SHIP also made \narrangements for homebound seniors and held outreach events for the \ncommunity at large. During one 3-day event alone, over 500 Nevadans \nwith Medicare received help from SHIP volunteers. The work of Nevada's \nSHIP volunteers is truly a testament to the value of public service.\n  As the director of Nevada's SHIP, Marilyn Wills was at the center of \nits operations. In that role, she was charged with a wide range of \nresponsibilities, including overseeing the outreach events, giving \neducational presentations to the public, and training new volunteers. \nMoreover, Marilyn and the SHIP volunteers had to carry out their work \nin an environment that is continually evolving with new, uncertain, or \nchanging program rules and details. The manner with which Marilyn \ncarried out her responsibilities has earned her high praise from her \ncolleagues, as well.\n  In one of many glowing stories about Marilyn that has reached my \ndesk, one says, ``Marilyn worked tirelessly to ensure that all the \ncommunity groups working on Part D outreach were aware of every event \nand that this was an inclusive effort. She believes in maximizing \nefforts to reach the entire community, but her passion focuses on every \nindividual beneficiary and how to help each person get the help they \nneed.'' The observer continues to write, ``She made sure her volunteers \nknew this was about people helping people. It was important to her that \nthe volunteers and staff feel good about what they were doing, and \nalways see how they were truly helping people that needed the \ninformation, or just the human contact to help them be comfortable in \nunderstanding all the options.''\n  The challenge was to inform the citizens of the State of Nevada about \nthe new Medicare drug benefit and to guide them through the enrollment \nprocess. It is my pleasure to recognize Marilyn Wills and the Nevada \nSHIP volunteers for their success in tackling this challenge. They are \na credit to all of us working toward the success of the new Medicare \ndrug benefit in Nevada.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/22/senate-section/article/S6409-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6409-S6410]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF GARRETT HALL AND CHRIS SHEA\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to commend Garrett Hall and \nChris Shea, fellow Nevadans who deserve praise for their efforts during \nthe implementation of the new Medicare Part D drug benefit in Nevada.\n  As most of us have surely heard, the enrollment period was a time of \ngreat stress, confusion, and frustration for nearly everyone involved. \nAs seniors, people with disabilities, and their loved ones tried to \nunderstand the complicated new drug benefit, decide whether to sign up, \nand then find the best drug plan to join, many found themselves \noverwhelmed. Emerging from those reports were also stories about \npharmacists who struggled with the numerous implementation problems.\n  Garrett and Chris, who operate PAX Rx in Reno, NV, are fine examples \nof pharmacists across the country who did their best to assist those \nseeking their help and advice. However, Garrett and Chris did more than \nsimply rise to the occasion. By all accounts, they went above and \nbeyond the minimum bar set for them.\n  For one particularly vulnerable group, the Medicare-Medicaid dual \neligible beneficiaries, Garrett and Chris came to the rescue countless \ntimes to ensure that they did not fall through the bureaucratic cracks. \nAs many of us know, newspapers widely reported the numerous \nimplementation problems that threatened to keep these dual-eligible \nbeneficiaries from receiving their vitally important medications. \nGarrett and Chris know that there are real lives behind these facts and \nstatistics because their PAX Rx pharmacy repeatedly intervened on \nbehalf of affected customers. At no cost to such beneficiaries, they \nprovided the needed medications, either by mail or hand delivery.\n  These two Nevadans' contributions extended beyond the scope of their \npharmacy practice. Garrett and Chris also attended townhall meetings \nand\n\n[[Page S6410]]\n\nother public events, seeking out stakeholders in need of guidance and \nlending their expertise. In the words of one observer, Garrett and \nChris ``saved the day for Nevada during the early days of \nimplementation.'' They are among the countless pharmacists who deserve \nrecognition for their efforts in Nevada and across the country.\n  For these deeds, Garrett and Chris are a credit to all of us working \ntoward the success of the new Medicare drug benefit in Nevada.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/22/senate-section/article/S6410-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6410]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                  U.S. Army Sergeant Daniel R. Gionet\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to U.S. Army \nSGT Daniel R. Gionet, a brave young American who gave his last full \nmeasure in service to our Nation while deployed with the U.S. Army to \nIraq, a land far overseas from his Pelham, NH, roots.\n  Daniel was a 2001 graduate of Pelham High School where he was a \nthree-season athlete competing on the school's football, baseball, and \nwrestling teams, winning the sportsmanship award his senior year. \nFriends say he was a team player and the type of guy who, no matter \nwhere you went or what you did, could have fun and make you laugh.\n  Daniel Webster, speaking of early American leaders said, ``While \nothers doubted, they were resolved; where others hesitated they pressed \nforward.'' In this spirit, Daniel joined the U.S. Army when he turned \n18 and left for basic training after graduating from high school. He \nwas assigned to the 3rd Battalion, 6th Field Artillery Regiment, Fort \nDrum in upstate New York and served at Kandahar Air Field, Afghanistan, \nfrom July 2003 to May 2004 in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. \nBelieving in what he was doing and wanting to make the world a safer \nplace, he reenlisted in the U.S. Army to become a medic after his \noriginal tour ended in May 2004. After training at Fort Sam Houston in \nTexas, he was assigned as a health care specialist in the 1st \nBattalion, 66th Armored Regiment, 1st Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry \nDivision, Fort Hood, TX. In December 2005, Daniel deployed with his \nunit to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  Tragically, on June 4, 2006, this brave soldier, and a comrade from \nhis unit, died of injuries sustained while on patrol in Baghdad, Iraq, \nwhen an improvised explosive device detonated near their M1A2 tank \nduring combat operations. Sergeant Gionet's awards and decorations \ninclude the Bronze Star, Purple Heart, Army Commendation Medal, Army \nAchievement Medal, Army Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service \nMedal, Iraq Campaign Medal, Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary \nMedal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Army Service Ribbon, \nOverseas Service Ribbon 2, Combat Medical Badge, and Expert Weapons \nQualification Badge.\n  Patriots from the State of New Hampshire have served our Nation with \nhonor and distinction from Bunker Hill to Baghdad--and U.S. Army SGT \nDaniel Gionet served in that fine tradition. Honor, humor, and huge \nhugs, according to family and friends, were among the qualities Daniel \nshared with others. They remember him as a true patriot, who had a love \nfor his school, his town, and his country. He was dedicated to serving \nhis Nation during these chaotic and violent times because, in his \nheart, he felt it was his duty.\n  My heartfelt sympathy, condolences, and prayers go out to Daniel's \nwife Katrina, to whom he was married in November 2005, as well as to \nDaniel's parents, Daniel and Denise, brother Darren, sister Alycia, and \nother family members and many friends who have suffered this grievous \nloss. The death of Daniel, only 23 years old, on a battlefield far from \nNew Hampshire is also a great loss for our State, our benevolent \nNation, and the world. He will be sorely missed by all; however, his \nfamily and friends may sense some comfort in knowing that because of \nhis devotion, sense of duty, and selfless dedication, the safety and \nliberty of each and every American is more secure. In the words of \nDaniel Webster--may his remembrance be as long lasting as the land he \nhonored. God bless Daniel R. Gionet.\n\n\n                    Private First Class Justin King\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a brave soldier, PFC \nJustin King. After graduating college and working as a civilian, \nPrivate King enlisted in the Army Reserve so he could, in his words, do \nsomething ``for his country and more than himself.'' While in advanced \nindividual training, Justin was diagnosed with terminal cancer.\n  Although his body has not responded to chemotherapy treatments and \nhis hope to serve in the field will go unrealized, his illness has \nfailed to break his ironclad spirit. The first time Private King's \ncommanding officer visited him in the hospital, Private King insisted \non getting into full uniform before she entered the room. He said that \nhe wanted to ``look like a soldier and stand like a soldier.''\n  Since returning to Robinson, IL, to be with his family, Private King \ntold his CO: ``I want to serve in some capacity to the best of my \nability and until my health fails, as a soldier. I want to tell other \nsoldiers how to deal with a terminal illness, I want to do something \nuseful.''\n  I am thoroughly impressed by this young man's desire to serve and the \nresolve he has displayed when faced with adversity. I admire Private \nKing's patriotism, sacrifice, and strong character. He is a role model \nfor all Americans, and I am proud to recognize him today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/22/senate-section/article/S6410-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6410]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CLEAN WATER ACT CHALLENGES\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the Supreme Court's decision earlier \nthis week in the consolidated cases of Rapanos v. United States and \nCarabell v. Army Corps of Engineers should be a source of great concern \nin this body and this Nation. The plurality opinion, while it did not \nwin the support of a majority of the court, is completely at odds with \nthe text and purpose of the Clean Water Act, would put much of the \nNation's waters in jeopardy, and as many have noted, will likely lead \nto increased litigation.\n  To prevent further legal wrangling about what Congress meant when it \npassed what has come to be one of the country's fundamental public \nhealth and environmental statutes, Congress must pass the Clean Water \nAuthority Restoration Act. This legislation, S. 912, which I most \nrecently introduced in April 2005, reestablishes protection for all \nwaters historically covered by the Clean Water Act. It also makes clear \nthat Congress's primary concern in 1972 was to protect the Nation's \nwaters from pollution, rather than just sustain the navigability of \nwaterways, and it reinforces that original intent.\n  Mr. President, I hope that my colleagues--the 85 who are not \ncosponsors of the bill--will now join me, in light of this week's \nSupreme Court ruling, to clarify that all of the Nation's waters are \nimportant for the health and vitality of our country by supporting \npassage of the Clean Water Authority Restoration Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/22/senate-section/article/S6410-3", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6410-S6411]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO BONNY JAIN\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to note with pride an \naccomplishment of one of my constituents. Bonny Jain, of Moline, IL, \nwon the National Geographic Bee here in Washington, DC, on May 24 by \ncorrectly identifying the Cambrian Mountains on a map. I don't know if \nthey have ``phone a friend'' in the bee, but it is good that he didn't \ncall me because I thought a Cambri was a small Toyota.\n  His victory in this competition demonstrates a laudable dedication to \nscholarship. As technology makes the world smaller, knowledge of other \npeoples and cultures becomes more important. And cultures are shaped by \ngeography. Geography is often the main factor in the path of national \nborders.

Along with 86 percent \n     of the general public, I agree with you on this issue. In \n     this regard, I would also like to bring to your attention \n     another issue that deals with the English language: as a \n     result of the President's 2007 budget request process, the \n     Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) plans to eliminate the \n     Voice of America's global English radio broadcasts, VOA News \n     Now.\n       Since you realize the importance of the English language to \n     this country, I believe you will agree that it is critically \n     important that we communicate with the rest of the world in \n     our de facto national language, in particular because English \n     is the language of business, higher education, youth, \n     international diplomacy, aviation, the Internet, science, \n     popular music, entertainment, and international travel.

Mr. President, I rise today to call attention to an \narticle published in the New York Times earlier this spring titled \n``Bombs Away,'' authored by my dear friend, Ambassador Max Kampelman, \nand to offer it into the Senate record. Ambassador Kampelman \nexemplifies the American tradition of bipartisan service in foreign \naffairs. After coming to Washington as an aide to Senator Hubert \nHumphrey, he was appointed by President Carter to serve as Ambassador \nand head of the U.S. Delegation to the Conference on Security and \nCooperation in Europe. President Reagan reappointed him to that \nposition.\n  For his long and distinguished service, Ambassador Kampelman was \nawarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Clinton and \nthe Presidential Citizens Medal from President Reagan.\n  Now Ambassador Kampelman has penned this insightful essay on the goal \nof globally eliminating all weapons of mass destruction. He believes \nthat this goal is even important in an age of nuclear proliferation. He \nspeaks from the heart and head and from his long experience as a \nhardnosed negotiator.\n  Ambassador Kampelman argues that we can reach this objective by \ndistinguishing between what ``is'' and what ``ought'' to be, utilizing \nboth realism and idealism. He recalls President Regan's successful \ndeployment of the MX missile in Europe to deter Soviet aggression and \nhis ability to recognize new openings, such as the willingness of \nMikhail Gorbachev to negotiate steep reductions in nuclear arsenals--\nwith the ultimate goal of eliminating nuclear weapons.\n  We all recognize that the total elimination of nuclear weapons is an \nextraordinarily difficult journey in a world where nuclear technology \ncontinues to spread and distinction between civilian and military \nnuclear development can be opaque. Nonetheless, it is important that we \nenvision this worthy goal, however idealistic it may seem today. \nAmbassador Kampelman stared down the very real prospect of nuclear \nannihilation during the Cold War. With this article, he offers us hope \nthat with wisdom and constancy, we have a chance to make this world \nsafer for our children and grandchildren.\n  I therefore request unanimous consent that the attached article by \nAmbassador Max Kampelman be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 24, 2006]\n\n                               Bombs Away\n\n                         (By Max M. Kampelman)\n\n       In my lifetime, I have witnessed two successful titanic \n     struggles by civilized society against totalitarian \n     movements, those against Nazi fascism and Soviet communism. \n     As an arms control negotiator for Ronald Reagan, I had the \n     privilege of playing a role--a small role--in the second of \n     these triumphs.\n       Yet, at the age of 85, I have never been more worried about \n     the future for my children and grandchildren than I am today. \n     The number of countries possessing nuclear arms is \n     increasing, and terrorists are poised to master nuclear \n     technology with the objective of using those deadly arms \n     against us.\n       The United States must face this reality head on and \n     undertake decisive steps to prevent catastrophe. Only we can \n     exercise the constructive leadership necessary to address the \n     nuclear threat.\n       Unfortunately, the goal of globally eliminating all weapons \n     of mass destruction--nuclear, chemical and biological arms--\n     is today not an integral part of American foreign policy; it \n     needs to be put back at the top of our agenda.\n       Of course, there will be those who will argue against this \n     bold vision. To these people I would say that there were \n     plenty who argued against it when it was articulated by Mr. \n     Reagan during his presidency.\n       I vividly recall a White House national security meeting in \n     December 1985, at which the president reported on his first \n     ``get acquainted'' summit in Geneva with President Mikhail \n     Gorbachev of the Soviet Union the previous month.\n       Sitting in the situation room, the president began by \n     saying: ``Maggie was right. We can do business with this \n     man'' His reference to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher \n     prompted nods of assent. Then, in a remarkably matter-of-fact \n     tone, he reported that he had suggested to Mr. Gorbachev \n     that their negotiations could possibly lead to the United \n     States and the Soviet Union eliminating all their nuclear \n     weapons.\n       When the president finished with his report, I saw uniform \n     consternation around that White House table. The concern was \n     deep, with a number of those present--from the secretary of \n     defense to the head of central intelligence to the chairman \n     of the Joint Chiefs of Staff--warning that our nuclear \n     missiles were indispensable. The president listened carefully \n     and politely without responding.\n       In fact, we did not learn where he stood until October \n     1986, at his next summit meeting with Mr. Gorbachev, which \n     took place in Reykjavik, Iceland. There, in a stout \n     waterfront house, he repeated to Mr. Gorbachev his proposal \n     for the abolition of all nuclear weapons. Though no agreement \n     was reached, the statement had been made.\n       More remarkably, it had been made by someone who understood \n     the importance of nuclear deterrence.\n       In March 1985, before Reagan's first meeting with Mr. \n     Gorbachev, I received a telephone call on a Friday from the \n     president's chief legislative strategist telling me that the \n     administration's request for additional MX missiles was \n     facing defeat in the House of Representatives, and that the \n     president wanted me to return from Geneva (where I was posted \n     as his arms negotiator) for a brief visit. The hope was that \n     I might be able to persuade some of the Democrats to support \n     the appropriation.\n       I was not and never have been a lobbyist, but I agreed to \n     return to Washington. I wanted my first meeting to be with \n     the speaker of the House, Tip O'Neill, who, I was informed, \n     was the leader of the opposition to the appropriation.\n       So there I was on Monday morning in O'Neill's private \n     office. I briefed the speaker on the state of negotiations \n     with the Soviets. I made the point that I too would like to \n     live in a world without MX missiles, but that it was \n     dangerous for us unilaterally to reduce our numbers without \n     receiving reciprocal reductions from the Soviets. I then \n     proceeded with my round of talks on the Hill.\n       At the end of the day, I met alone with the president and \n     told him that O'Neill said we were about 30 votes short. I \n     told the president of my conversation with the speaker and \n     shared with him my sense that O'Neill was quietly helping us, \n     suggesting to his fellow Democrats that he would not be \n     unhappy if they voted against his amendment.\n       Without a moment's hesitation, the president telephoned \n     O'Neill, and I had the privilege of hearing one side of this \n     conversation between two tough Irishmen, cussing each other \n     out, but obviously friendly and respectful.\n       I recall that the president's first words went something \n     like this: ``Max tells me that you may really be a patriot. \n     It's about time!'' Suffice it to say that soon after I \n     returned to Geneva I learned that the House had authorized \n     the MX missiles.\n       There is a moral to these stories: you can be an idealist \n     and a realist at the same time.\n\n[[Page S6412]]\n\n       What is missing today from American foreign policy is a \n     willingness to hold these two thoughts simultaneously, to \n     find a way to move from what ``is''--a world with a risk of \n     increasing global disaster--to what ``ought'' to be, a \n     peaceful, civilized world free of weapons of mass \n     destruction.\n       The ``ought'' is an integral part of the political process. \n     Our founding fathers proclaimed the ``ought'' of American \n     democracy in the Declaration of Independence at a time when \n     we had slavery, property qualifications for voting and \n     second-class citizenship for women.\n       Yet we steadily moved the undesirable ``is'' of our society \n     ever closer to the ``ought'' and thereby strengthened our \n     democracy. When President Gerald Ford signed the Helsinki \n     Final Act in 1975, he was criticized for entering into a \n     process initiated by the Soviet Union. But the agreement \n     reflected a series of humanitarian ``oughts,'' and over the \n     course of the next 10 years, the Soviets were forced by our \n     European friends and us to live up to those ``oughts'' if \n     they were to attain international legitimacy.\n       An appreciation of the awesome power of the ``ought'' \n     should lead our government to embrace the goal of eliminating \n     all weapons of mass destruction.\n       To this end, President Bush should consult with our allies, \n     appear before the United Nations General Assembly and call \n     for a resolution embracing the objective of eliminating all \n     weapons of mass destruction.\n       He should make clear that we are prepared to eliminate our \n     nuclear weapons if the Security Council develops an effective \n     regime to guarantee total conformity with a universal \n     commitment to eliminate all nuclear arms and reaffirm the \n     existing conventions covering chemical and biological \n     weapons.\n       The council should be assigned the task of establishing \n     effective political and technical procedures for achieving \n     this goal, including both stringent verification and severe \n     penalties to prevent cheating.\n       I am under no illusion that this will be easy. That said, \n     the United States would bring to this endeavor decades of \n     relevant experience, new technologies and the urgency of \n     self-preservation. The necessary technical solutions can be \n     devised. Now, as I can imagine President Reagan saying, let \n     us summon the will.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/22/senate-section/article/S6412-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6412]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               CAREGIVERS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to commend the ongoing efforts of \nrelative caregivers all over the State of Illinois, who have opened \ntheir hearts to children whose homes have been broken. Children are \nplaced into foster care for a variety of reasons stemming from neglect \nto drug-addicted parents and often suffer the consequences of the \nseparation. The fate of children who are not adopted or reunited with \ntheir birth parents often spells a legacy of instability. Relatives who \nwelcome these children into their homes offer them a stability that can \nrarely be found in the foster care system.\n  Subsidized guardianship helps to remove some of the barriers to \nkeeping displaced children within the family. The main obstacle faced \nby guardians is the cost of upkeep of additional children. Subsidized \nguardianship allows relatives to access the same programs that regular \nfoster parents have. These State programs support permanent \nguardianship placements with relatives by offsetting some of the costs \nof child rearing.\n  The correlation between relative placement and success of foster \nchildren has never been more apparent than in my own office. One of my \nsummer interns attributes her current success to her aunt and uncle who \ntook both herself and sister in when she was 16. This act of generosity \nprevented her from dropping out of high school to support her sister. \nBoth girls were too old for adoption and hard to place in foster homes. \nThe placement made it possible for the girls to stay in their current \nschool and their community. Relative care was home when they needed one \nthe most.\n  As of February 2006, there were over 17,000 children placed in \nsubstitute care in Illinois. Across the country, more than 6 million \nchildren live in households headed by a grandparent or other relative. \nKinship care is important because it helps keep children closer to \ntheir family and to their sense of normalcy. Supportive programs such \nas the Subsidized Guardianship Program help children leave the foster \ncare system for the permanent care of nurturing relatives.\n  Today I offer my formal acknowledgement and deepest appreciation for \nthe ongoing service of these caregivers to our country and our Nation's \nmost valuable asset, our children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/22/senate-section/article/S6412-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6412]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO BEVERLY McDAVID\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the winner \nof the Daughters of the American Revolution Medal of Honor Award, Mr. \nJohn Gonsalves of Taunton, MA. Mr. Gonsalves was nominated by the \nmembers of the Molly Stark Chapter of the Daughters of the American \nRevolution, DAR, in Manchester, NH, to receive this national award.\n  In the wake of September 11, Mr. Gonsalves was left, like many \nAmericans, with the insatiable desire to do something to help those \nintimately affected by the tragedy. He was particularly struck by those \nwho have made extraordinary sacrifices on the front lines in the \nmilitary operations that have followed the September 11 attacks, our \nwounded soldiers.\n  Upon seeing these injured soldiers in news reports, Mr. Gonsalves was \ndetermined to use his lifelong trade to help these wounded heroes. \nHaving worked extensively in the construction field throughout the last \n20 years, he gained expertise in all phases of the construction \nprocess, business management, and OSHA safety standards. He started \nHomes For Our Troops--a nonprofit organization that builds and refits \nhomes across the country for veterans wounded while serving in the \nMiddle East. Mr. Gonsalves has pledged to build these specially adapted \nresidences for our wounded soldiers so long as the need exists at no \ncost to them.\n  The brave men and women who put their lives at risk every day to \nprotect our country need to know that their fellow citizens appreciate \ntheir sacrifices and will support them long after they return home from \nthe front lines. Mr. Gonsalves' work promotes an extremely noble cause \nwhich ensures that our wounded troops, who have worked extraordinarily \nhard to protect our Nation, have the opportunity to find suitable \nhousing when they return home.\n  Mr. Gonsalves has shown tremendous qualities of leadership, service, \nand patriotism by selflessly dedicating himself to a cause that serves \na greater purpose and aids those who have sacrificed for our country, \nand he is certainly deserving of the DAR Medal of Honor Award. I \ncongratulate him on his recognition and commend him for his service to \nthe military community and the positive effects his organization has \nfor our country and especially on our wounded soldiers.\n Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I also wish to recognize John \nGonsalves, a Taunton, MA, resident whose selfless work to improve the \nlives of troops returning home from battle will be honored with the \nDaughters of the American Revolution's, DAR, Medal of\n\n[[Page S6414]]\n\nHonor Award. Members of the Molly Stark Chapter of the DAR in \nManchester, NH, nominated him to receive this distinction.\n  John was one of millions of Americans who, in the aftermath of the \nSeptember 11 terrorist attacks, wanted to serve his Nation and fellow \ncountrymen. Having worked extensively in different phases of the \nconstruction industry, he sought an opportunity to give back by helping \nwounded soldiers return to home life.\n  Unable to find an existing organization that would allow him to \nvolunteer his construction and homebuilding skills, John took action \nand founded a nonprofit organization that would--Homes for Our Troops. \nThe group, which is based in Taunton, works to build or adapt \nresidences across the country for injured veterans at no cost to these \nindividuals.\n  American soldiers have left the comfort of home for the perils of \nfaraway battlefields to protect our country and to spread freedom in \nthe world. It is critical that these brave men and women know that \ntheir fellow citizens support them--and will continue to do so long \nafter their active duty service is over. John's work to establish Homes \nfor Our Troops helps represent a solemn promise: that the American \npeople will neither forget, nor cease to be grateful, for the courage \nof our heroic soldiers.\n  By returning seriously injured veterans to the normalcy of home life \nas quickly as possible, we honor their enormous sacrifices for our \ncountry. Homes for Our Troops performs an invaluable role in this \nnational effort, coordinating donations of money, labor and materials \nto ensure that seriously injured veterans' homes are handicapped \naccessible. This work, which contributes conspicuously to the quality \nof life for severely wounded soldiers, represents the best of the \nAmerican spirit.\n  John Gonsalves' patriotism sets an example for all Americans. I join \nhis friends, supporters and members of the DAR's Molly Stark Chapter in \ncommending his praiseworthy efforts on behalf of our veterans, and \ncongratulate him on being selected to receive this prestigious award.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/22/senate-section/article/S6414-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6414]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  KATHLEEN MIRABILE RECEIVES OUTSTANDING TEACHER OF AMERICAN HISTORY \n                                 AWARD\n\n Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and \ncommend an outstanding teacher from New Hampshire, Kathleen Mirabile, \nwinner of the Daughters of the American Revolution, DAR, Outstanding \nTeacher of American History Award.\n  Mrs. Mirabile has dedicated the past 45 years to teaching Social \nStudies and U.S. History in two public high schools in Manchester, NH. \nShe continues to share her in-depth understanding of the democratic \nsystem of government in our country with students every year.\n  Throughout her 45 years in the Manchester school system, she has come \nto intimately understand and personify the concept of living history as \nshe has opened students' minds to endless possibilities. She subscribes \nto the theory that in order to be loyal to our country today, one must \nbe keenly aware of the history that has shaped the extraordinary \nfoundation upon which our country and our government were built. She \nhas made it her goal to ensure students understand the impact that \nhistory has on them today and, conversely, the impact that today will \nhave on history.\n  Entrenched in her belief that every citizen ought to be a student of \nU.S. history, Mrs. Mirabile has remained a student throughout her \nentire teaching career--completing graduate studies at the University \nof New Hampshire and Boston College, as well as participating in \ncountless educational conferences, institutes, and fellowship programs \nranging from the National Endowment for the Humanities to Harvard \nUniversity, allowing her to further her own education as a student \nwhile simultaneously enriching her teaching knowledge.\n  Mrs. Mirabile has taken her passion for history outside of the \nclassroom and required school hours. Beyond her role as a teacher in \nthe high school classroom, Mrs. Mirabile has shared her time and her \nlife with members of the Granite State community by participating and \nassuming important leadership and advisory roles in numerous \neducational societies, extracurricular activities, and professional \norganizations, furthering her own development and gaining the respect \nand friendship of her students and peers alike.\n  Teachers like Mrs. Mirabile exemplify the greatest asset in the \neducational system in our country--dedicated and devoted teachers who \ntake tremendous pride in preparing generations of students to \nparticipate in the American dream. Her commitment to her students and \nthe entire community serves as a great role model for everyone around \nher, and she certainly is deserving of the DAR Outstanding Teacher of \nAmerican History Award. I congratulate her on this recognition and \ncommend her for her excellence in teaching and the overwhelmingly \npositive effect she has had on her students and her community.\n Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I also wish to recognize an \noutstanding teacher from New Hampshire who will be honored next month \nwith the Daughters of the American Revolution's, DAR, Outstanding \nTeacher of American History Award.\n  Kathleen Mirabile has taught history and social studies in \nManchester, New Hampshire's public schools for nearly four decades. \nThrough her strong commitment to lifelong learning, Mrs. Mirabile has \ninspired generations of students in the Queen City. Having contributed \nconspicuously to the life of her community, Mrs. Mirabile has earned \nthe respect of her peers and students--which is reflected in her \nnomination by the DAR's Molly Stark Chapter in Manchester to receive \nthis prestigious national award.\n  A democratic nation such as ours requires informed, active citizens \nwho are able to think critically about complex issues. Knowledge and \nunderstanding of American history is therefore essential to ensuring a \nthoughtful citizenry that is capable of the responsibility of self-\ngovernment. During her long service as a teacher, at Manchester High \nSchool Central and Manchester Memorial High School, Mrs. Mirabile has \nworked to convey these enduring truths as part of her classroom \ninstruction.\n  Mindful of the necessity of being prepared to compete in today's \nsociety, Mrs. Mirabile has set high standards for her students. \nAlthough she has taught students who represent a range of academic \nability--including those in her advanced placement U.S. history \ncourse--Mrs. Mirabile has consistently pushed them to achieve beyond \ntheir limits. In doing so, she has helped her students to mature as \nlearners and as individuals.\n  A central component of Mrs. Mirabile's approach to teaching--one that \ndistinguishes her--has been to remain a student of history herself. As \npart of that commitment, she completed graduate studies at the \nUniversity of New Hampshire and at Boston College; additionally, Mrs. \nMirabile has pursued study through the National Endowment for the \nHumanities, the U.S. Department of Education, and at Harvard \nUniversity. These experiences have broadened her knowledge, and have \nhelped to make her a more thoughtful, engaging teacher.\n  Mrs. Mirabile also brings her extensive experience working with the \nManchester Historic Association, MHA, to the classroom. Manchester, \nwhich was home to the world famous Amoskeag Mills, is a city that is \nrich in history and culture. As an MHA leader, Mrs. Mirabile has taken \nher intimate knowledge of Manchester and made the City a history \nclassroom for her students. Through such hands-on learning, Mrs. \nMirabile's students are shown that history lessons are not confined to \ntext books; that history is alive in our communities.\n  Having distinguished herself as a talented and committed educator who \nhas made a difference in the lives of her students, Mrs. Mirabile has \nset a standard to which other teachers may aspire. I am pleased to join \nher many friends and admirers--at Central High School, in the city of \nManchester, and with the Molly Stark Chapter--in extending \ncongratulations to her for being honored by the DAR for a long career \nof excellence in teaching.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/22/senate-section/article/S6415-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6415]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S6415]]\n                    PASSING OF EVELYN ``EVY'' DUBROW\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I to celebrate the life \nand work of Evelyn ``Evy'' Dubrow, a longtime champion for working \npeople in our country, who passed away this week at the age of 95.\n  Evy was loved by many Members of Congress, but I think I will miss \nher more than most. She came from my hometown of Paterson, NJ. Her \nparents were immigrants, like my own mother and father. And one of her \nfirst jobs was as a reporter at the Paterson Morning Call, which was \nour local newspaper.\n  Evy soon moved into union work, first as a secretary for the textile \nworkers union, and then as an assistant to the president of the New \nJersey Congress of Industrial Organizations.\n  In 1956, she came to Washington as a lobbyist for the International \nLadies Garment Workers Union. At that time, lobbying was almost \nexclusively a man's world but although Evy stood just a little bit shy \nof five feet tall, she never backed down from anyone.\n  Although she eventually became vice president of the ILGWU, and later \nof the textile workers union UNITE, she continued to fight here on \nCapitol Hill for issues that affect working people--especially women.\n  She was a lobbyist in the most honorable sense of the profession, \nbecause she never tried to browbeat or buy a vote. She simply told you \nwhy she felt her position was right--and she always did it with \nconviction. In 1982, a Washington business newspaper named her one of \nthe town's 10 best lobbyists.\n  In 1999, President Clinton awarded the Medal of Freedom to Evy. It \nwas quite an honor for a daughter of immigrants from Paterson--and it \nmade me proud.\n  Evy never married, but she doted on her nieces and nephews, and five \ngrand-nieces. And workers all across the country thought of her as \nfamily. They loved her and trusted her to look out for them.\n  Everyone who cares about working people will miss Evy. We should also \ngive thanks for her long life and the many things she accomplished. And \nwe must honor her memory by carrying on her fight for fair pay, better \neducation and job training, and safer conditions for working \npeople.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/22/senate-section/article/S6415-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6415]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO PHILIP MERRILL\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to the life \nand legacy of Philip Merrill--journalist, diplomat, philanthropist, \npatriot--and friend.\n  Phil Merrill was an original. Yet his life story was the American \ndream. He was born in a row house in Baltimore. Through hard work and \nbrilliant business sense, he built a major publishing company--Capital-\nGazette Newspapers. He was a champion for sound environmental \nstewardship. He endowed the School of Journalism at the University of \nMaryland. He served his Nation, and he served his State. And he was \npart of a strong, loving family.\n  Phil Merrill ran the oldest continually published newspaper in the \nUnited States--the Annapolis Capital. Each of his newspapers is known \nfor strong local coverage and for strong opinion pages. He endowed the \nPhilip Merrill School of Journalism at the University of Maryland--\nwhich trains the next generations of journalists in the skills and \nvalues that Phil Merrill put into action every day of his life.\n  Phil Merrill served three Presidents in important international \nappointments--including Assistant Attorney General of NATO. When he was \nappointed by President Bush to be president of the Export-Import Bank--\nI laughed with him, saying ``I thought diplomats were supposed to keep \nus out of wars.'' A dainty diplomat--no. A determined advocate for \ndemocracy--yes.\n  Phil was also a passionate environmentalist. He especially loved the \nChesapeake Bay. He endowed a ``green'' building for the Chesapeake Bay \nFoundation. This is not just a building where the Bay Foundation does \nits outstanding education and advocacy work; it is a building with a \ndesign that is environmentally friendly.\n  Much has been said of Phil Merrill's feistiness. Well, I happen to \nlike feisty people. He stood up for what he believed in. He fought for \nwhat he felt was right. And he made a difference.\n  His partner in life was his wife Eleanor. In publishing, in \nphilanthropy, she shared his zest for life and his many passions. I \nknow that Ellie Merrill will continue to guide the institutions that \nshe and Phil built and supported. She and her family are in my thoughts \nand prayers during this very difficult time.\n  Phil Merrill's death is a tragedy. Yet his life was a triumph. I ask \nmy colleagues to join me in saluting this extraordinary man.\n  I ask that an article from the Annapolis Capital be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The material follows.\n\n             Philip Merrill, Capital Publisher, Dead at 72\n\n       Philip Merrill, 72, publisher, diplomat and philanthropist, \n     died June 10 after going sailing aboard his 41-foot sailboat \n     Merrilly on the Chesapeake Bay. His body was discovered \n     yesterday in the bay near Poplar Island.\n       A longtime resident of Arnold, Phil Merrill combined \n     publishing and public service throughout his career. The \n     Baltimore native received a degree in government in 1955 from \n     Cornell University where he was managing editor of the \n     student newspaper. After serving in the Army, he worked for \n     newspapers in New Jersey until 1961 when he joined the State \n     Department and graduated from Harvard University's management \n     development program.\n       In 1968 he returned to journalism when he bought The \n     Evening Capital with several partners. Later he brought in \n     Landmark Communications Inc. as a minority partner and grew \n     the newspaper's circulation from 13,000 to 48,000. Chairman \n     of the board of Capital-Gazette Communications, he also owned \n     Washingtonian magazine and five other newspapers--the \n     Maryland Gazette, the Bowie Blade-News, the Crofton News-\n     Crier, the West County Gazette and South County Gazette. He \n     also formerly owned Baltimore magazine.\n       During his public service, he took leaves of absences from \n     the publishing business to serve six presidential \n     administrations.\n       From 1981 to 1983 he was counselor to the under secretary \n     of defense for policy and from 1990 to 1992 was assistant \n     secretary-general of NATO for defense support in Brussels, \n     Belgium, at the treaty organization headquarters. He also had \n     served on the Department of Defense Policy Board. From 2002 \n     until last summer he was chairman and president of the \n     Export-Import Bank of the United States.\n       Mr. Merrill represented the U.S. in negotiations on the Law \n     of the Sea Conference, the International Telecommunications \n     Union and various disarmament and exchange agreements with \n     the former Soviet Union. He was a former special assistant to \n     the deputy secretary of state, served as the State \n     Department's senior intelligence analyst for South Asia and \n     worked in the White House on national security affairs.\n       He was vice chairman of the Center for Strategic and \n     Budgetary Assessments and the U.S. director of the \n     International Institute of Strategic Studies. He also served \n     on the Department of Defense Policy Board and the Department \n     Business Board. During the Gulf War he was on President \n     George H.W. Bush's Air Power Survey and served on President \n     Reagan's Commission on Cost Control.\n       In 1988 the Secretary of Defense awarded him the Medal for \n     Distinguished Service, the department's highest civilian \n     honor.\n       Mr. Merrill was chairman of the Capital-Gazette Foundation \n     and the Merrill Family Foundation. He was a trustee of the \n     Aspen Institute, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, the Johns \n     Hopkins University and the Corcoran Gallery of Art. He was on \n     the board of visitors of the University of Maryland and the \n     boards of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International \n     Studies, the Advanced Physics Laboratories, the American \n     Council of Trustees and Alumni, the Johnson School of \n     Management at Cornell, the University of Maryland Foundation, \n     the Federal City Council, the National Archives Foundation \n     and the World Affairs Council of Washington.\n       His board memberships also included those of Cornell, the \n     Amos Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth, the Washington \n     Airports Task Force and Genesco.\n       A former fellow of the Institute for International Affairs \n     of the University of Chicago, he also was a member of the \n     Council on Foreign Relations, the Chief Executives \n     Organization and the World Presidents' Organization. For many \n     years he was chairman of the White House Fellows Commission \n     regional panels.\n       A sailor since age 7, he served in the Merchant Marine to \n     earn money for college. He supported the America's Cup \n     campaigns and the Hospice Cup sailing regatta which raises \n     money for charity.\n       He donated $1 million to Cornell for a sailing center, $10 \n     million to the University of Maryland School of Journalism, \n     $4 million to the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced \n     International Studies at Johns Hopkins and $7.5 million to \n     the Chesapeake Bay Foundation for its ``green'' headquarters \n     in Annapolis. Since 1988 Capital-Gazette newspapers have \n     awarded $661,000 in academic scholarships to outstanding high \n     school students.\n       Mr. Merrill enjoyed his family, snow skiing, sailing and \n     ice cream.\n       Surviving are his wife of 45 years, Eleanor Pocius Merrill, \n     who has assumed his publishing duties; his family, Doug and \n     Lisa Merrill of Shelburne, Vt., Cathy and Paul Williams of \n     Washington, D.C., and Nancy Merrill of Arlington, Va.; four \n     grandchildren, Alexander Merrill, 6, Jack Merrill, 4, Wynne \n     Williams, 17 months, and Bryce Williams, two weeks old; and \n     one sister, Suzanne Watson of Chicago, Ill.\n       A celebration of life ceremony for family and friends will \n     be held at 2 p.m. Thursday at Mellon Auditorium, 1301 \n     Constitution Ave. NW, Washington, D.C.\n       In lieu of flowers, the family requests you cherish a \n     memory.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/22/senate-section/article/S6416-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6416]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S6416]]\n                      OUR LADY OF LOURDES ACADEMY\n\n Mr. NELSON of Florida.

In accordance with this provision, I have sent the \nenclosed notice to the Federal Register for publication, stating that \nthe Western Balkans emergency is to continue in effect beyond June 26, \n2006. The most recent notice continuing this emergency was published in \nthe Federal Register on June 24, 2005, 70 FR 36803.\n  The crisis constituted by the actions of persons engaged in, or \nassisting, sponsoring, or supporting (i) extremist violence in the \nRepublic of Macedonia, and elsewhere in the Western Balkans region, or \n(ii) acts obstructing implementation of the Dayton Accords in Bosnia or \nUnited Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 of June 10, 1999, in \nKosovo, that led to the declaration of a national emergency on June 26, \n2001, in Executive Order 13219 has not been resolved. Subsequent to the \ndeclaration of the national emergency, I amended Executive Order 13219 \nin Executive Order 13304 of May 28, 2003, to address acts obstructing \nimplementation of the Ohrid Framework Agreement of 2001 in the Republic \nof Macedonia, which have also become a concern. The acts of extremist \nviolence and obstructionist activity outlined in Executive Order 13219, \nas amended, are hostile to U.S. interests and pose a continuing unusual \nand extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of \nthe United States. For these reasons, I have determined that it is \nnecessary to continue the national emergency declared with respect to \nthe Western Balkans and maintain in force the comprehensive sanctions \nto respond to this threat.\n                                                      George W.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 3557. A bill to reduce deaths occurring from overdoses of drugs or \ncontrolled substances; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, on the first Monday and Tuesday of June, \n14 people in Chicago died from an apparent overdose of heroin laced \nwith fentanyl. That brings to 74 the lives lost to heroin and fentanyl \nin Cook County, IL, this year.\n  We know that abuse of prescription drugs is on the rise. The \nmanufacture of mind-altering substances is getting easier. Meanwhile, \nChicago first responders have treated more than 600 drug overdoses \nsince April. Today I am introducing the Drug Overdose Reduction Act to \nstrengthen and expand the work our communities are doing to prevent \noverdose deaths from both prescription drug and illicit drug abuse.\n  The legislation authorizes funding to train first responders, law \nenforcement officials and corrections officials on how to recognize and \nrespond to an overdose. Funding also would be available for drug \noverdose prevention programs that provide direct services to people \nmost at risk of an overdose death.\n  The act would support the important work of organizations like the \nChicago Recovery Alliance, which works with a population of people at \nhigh risk for overdose deaths. Dr. Sarz Maxwell, medical director for \nthe Alliance, said she knows of several people whose lives have been \nsaved by the consumer education the group provides.\n  These local outreach and education efforts may be the best tool we \nhave right now for saving lives that would otherwise be lost to drug \noverdoses. By implementing the Drug Overdose Prevention Act, we can \navert the tragic deaths caused by the most recent wave of deadly \nheroin.\n  One of the victims in Chicago was just 17 years old. Joseph graduated \nfrom high school on Sunday and was found dead in the back of his car on \nTuesday.\n  Deaths like this are tragic for those who have died and their \nfamilies, but also for the high schools and communities they grew up \nin. A Chicago police official was quoted in the New York Times saying \nthat it appeared the drug cocktail had killed the young man instantly. \nPerhaps his death contributed to the decision at the Substance Abuse \nand Mental Health Administration 2 days later to issue an alert to \nrehab centers and addiction specialists about the heroin mixed with \nfentanyl.\n  I am encouraged that the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, \nworking with Chicago police, this week descended on what they believe \nis the headquarters for local distribution of this deadly drug. I \ncommend the law enforcement officials who are cracking down on illicit \ndrug traffic in my home State of Illinois and across the country. Their \nwork is fundamental to a comprehensive response to senseless deaths due \nto drug overdoses.\n  The time has come to put an end to these tragedies. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting the Drug Overdose Reduction Act to \nbring resources to community-based efforts to prevent unnecessary \ndeaths by providing information about the dangers of drug abuse, how to \nfind help to break addictions and how to stay alive in the interim.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3557\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Drug Overdose Reduction \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports \n     that 28,723 deaths in the United States in 2003 were \n     attributable to drug-induced causes.\n       (2) Deaths resulting from drug overdoses have increased 540 \n     percent between 1980 and 1999.\n       (3) According to the Federal Drug Abuse Warning Network, \n     most drug-induced deaths involve multiple drugs.\n       (4) An increase in the number of deaths attributable to \n     heroin mixed with fentanyl, a narcotic considered 50 to 100 \n     times more potent than morphine, has been documented in 2005 \n     and 2006.\n       (5) An estimated 3,000,000 individuals in the United States \n     have serious drug problems.\n       (6) The damage caused by drug use is not limited to drug \n     abusers. The collateral damage from drug use is enormous, and \n     drug abuse costs society over $60,000,000,000 in social costs \n     and lost productivity.\n       (7) Community-based programs working with high-risk \n     populations have successfully prevented deaths from drug \n     overdoses through education and access to effective reversal \n     agents, such as naloxone.\n\n     SEC. 3.

COLMERY\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself and Mr. Roberts) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 104\n\n       Whereas the life of Harry W. Colmery of Topeka, Kansas, was \n     marked by service to his country and its citizens;\n       Whereas Harry Colmery earned a degree in law in 1916 from \n     the University of Pittsburgh and, through his practice of \n     law, contributed to the Nation, notably by successfully \n     arguing 2 significant cases before the United States Supreme \n     Court, 1 criminal, the other an environmental legal dispute;\n       Whereas during World War I, Harry Colmery joined the Army \n     Air Service, serving as a first lieutenant at a time when \n     military aviation was in its infancy;\n       Whereas after World War I, Harry Colmery actively \n     contributed to the growth of the newly formed American Legion \n     and went on to hold several offices in the Legion and was \n     elected National Commander in 1936;\n       Whereas in 1943, the United States faced the return from \n     World War II of what was to become an active duty force of \n     15,000,000 soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines;\n       Whereas Harry Colmery, recognizing the potential effect of \n     the return of such a large number of veterans to civilian \n     life, spearheaded the efforts of the American Legion to \n     develop legislation seeking to ensure that those Americans \n     who had fought for the democratic ideals of the Nation and to \n     preserve freedom would be able to fully participate in all of \n     the opportunities the Nation provided;\n       Whereas in December 1943, during an emergency meeting of \n     the American Legion leadership, Harry Colmery crafted the \n     initial draft of the legislation that became the Servicemen's \n     Readjustment Act of 1944, also known as the GI Bill of \n     Rights;\n       Whereas the GI Bill of Rights is credited by veterans' \n     service organizations, economists, and historians as the \n     engine that transformed postwar America into a more \n     egalitarian, prosperous, and enlightened Nation poised to \n     lead the world into the 21st century;\n       Whereas since its enactment, the GI Bill of Rights has \n     provided education or training for approximately 21,000,000 \n     men and women.\n       Whereas as a result of the benefits available to veterans \n     through the initial GI Bill of Rights, the Nation gained over \n     800,000 professionals as the GI Bill of Rights transformed \n     these veterans into 450,000 engineers, 238,000 teachers, \n     91,000 scientists, 67,000 doctors, and 22,000 dentists;\n       Whereas President Truman established the Presidential Medal \n     of Freedom in 1945 to recognize notable service during war \n     and in 1963, President Kennedy reinstated the medal to honor \n     the achievement of civilians during peacetime;\n       Whereas pursuant to Executive Order No. 11085, the \n     Presidential Medal of Freedom may be awarded to any person \n     who has made an especially meritorious contribution to ``(1) \n     the security or national interest of the United States, or \n     (2) world peace, or (3) other significant public or private \n     endeavors''; and\n       Whereas Harry Colmery, noted for his service in the \n     military, in the legal sector, and on behalf of the Nation's \n     veterans, clearly meets the criteria established for the \n     Presidential Medal of Freedom: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that the \n     President should posthumously award the Presidential Medal of \n     Freedom to Harry W.

MINUTEMAN III INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC MISSILES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In the Joint Explanatory Statement of the Committee of \n     Conference on H.R. 1815, the National Defense Authorization \n     Act for Fiscal Year 2006, the conferees state that the policy \n     of the United States ``is to deploy a force of 500 ICBMs''. \n     The conferees further note ``that unanticipated strategic \n     developments may compel the United States to make changes to \n     this force structure in the future.''.\n       (2) The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) conducted under \n     section 118 of title 10, United States Code, in 2005 finds \n     that maintaining a robust nuclear deterrent ``remains a \n     keystone of United States national power''. However, \n     notwithstanding that finding and without providing any \n     specific justification for the recommendation, the \n     Quadrennial Defense Review recommends reducing the number of \n     deployed Minuteman III Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles \n     (ICBMs) from 500 to 450 beginning in fiscal year 2007. The \n     Quadrennial Defense Review also fails to identify what \n     unanticipated strategic developments compelled the United \n     States to reduce the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile force \n     structure.\n       (3) The commander of the Strategic Command, General James \n     Cartwright, testified before the Committee on Armed Services \n     of the Senate that the reduction in deployment of Minuteman \n     III Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles is required so that \n     the 50 missiles withdrawn from the deployed force could be \n     used for test assets and spares to extend the life of the \n     Minuteman III Intercontinental Ballistic Missile well into \n     the future. If spares are not modernized, the Air Force may \n     not have sufficient replacement missiles to sustain the force \n     size.\n       (b) Modernization of Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles \n     Required.--The Air Force shall modernize Minuteman III \n     Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles in the United States \n     inventory as required to maintain a sufficient supply of \n     launch test assets and spares to sustain the deployed force \n     of such missiles through 2030.\n       (c) Limitation on Termination of Modernization Program \n     Pending Report.--No funds authorized to be appropriated for \n     the Department of Defense may be obligated or expended for \n     the termination of any Minuteman III ICBM modernization \n     program, or for the withdrawal of any Minuteman III \n     Intercontinental Ballistic Missile from the active force, \n     until 30 days after the Secretary of Defense submits to the \n     congressional defense committees a report setting forth the \n     following:\n       (1) A detailed strategic justification for the proposal to \n     reduce the Minuteman III Intercontinental Ballistic Missile \n     force from 500 to 450 missiles, including an analysis of the \n     effects of the reduction on the ability of the United States \n     to assure allies and dissuade potential competitors.\n       (2) A detailed analysis of the strategic ramifications of \n     continuing to equip a portion of the Minuteman III \n     Intercontinental Ballistic Missile force with multiple \n     independent warheads rather than single warheads as \n     recommended by past reviews of the United States nuclear \n     posture.\n       (3) An assessment of the test assets and spares required to \n     maintain a force of 500 deployed Minuteman III \n     Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles through 2030.\n       (4) An assessment of the test assets and spares required to \n     maintain a force of 450 deployed Minuteman III \n     Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles through 2030.\n       (5) An inventory of currently available Minuteman III \n     Intercontinental Ballistic Missile test assets and spares.\n       (6) A plan to sustain and complete the modernization of all \n     deployed and spare Minuteman III Intercontinental Ballistic \n     Missiles, a test plan, and an analysis of the funding \n     required to carry out modernization of all deployed and spare \n     Minuteman III Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles.\n       (7) An assessment of whether halting upgrades to the \n     Minuteman III Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles withdrawn \n     from the deployed force would compromise the ability of those \n     missiles to serve as test assets.\n       (8) A description of the plan of the Department of Defense \n     for extending the life of the Minuteman III Intercontinental \n     Ballistic Missile force beyond fiscal year 2030.\n       (d) Remote Visual Assessment.--\n       (1) Additional amount for research, development, test, and \n     evaluation, air force.--The amount authorized to be \n     appropriated by section 201(3) for research, development, \n     test, and evaluation for the Air Force is hereby increased by \n     $5,000,000.\n       (2) Availability of amount.--Of the amount authorized to be \n     appropriated by section 201(3) for research, development, \n     test, and evaluation for the Air Force, as increased by \n     paragraph (1), $5,000,000 may be available for ICBM Security \n     Modernization (PE #0604851) for Remote Visual Assessment for \n     security for silos for intercontinental ballistic missiles \n     (ICBMs).\n       (3) Offset.--The amount authorized to be appropriated by \n     section 103(2) for procurement of missiles for the Air Force \n     is hereby reduced by $5,000,000, with the amount of the \n     reduction to be allocated to amounts available for the \n     Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle.\n       (e) ICBM Modernization Program Defined.--In this section, \n     the term ``ICBM Modernization program'' means each of the \n     following for the Minuteman III Intercontinental Ballistic \n     Missile:\n       (1) The Guidance Replacement Program (GRP).\n       (2) The Propulsion Replacement Program (PRP).\n       (3) The Propulsion System Rocket Engine (PSRE) program.\n       (4) The Safety Enhanced Reentry Vehicle (SERV) program.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 4521.

Mr. President, I rise today to endorse passage of the \nCoast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2006. However, I would \nlike to clarify several points with regard to section 414 of the \nconference report. This section deals with construction of offshore \nwind energy facilities in the area off the coast of Massachusetts known \nas Nantucket Sound, and it will require the Secretary of the Interior \nto incorporate any ``reasonable terms and conditions the Commandant of \nthe Coast Guard determines to be necessary to provide for navigational \nsafety.'' Interpretation of this clause will be critical to ensuring \nthat navigation, aviation, and communications are not adversely \nimpacted by construction of such a facility.\n  A company known as Cape Wind, LLC has proposed the permanent \ninstallation of 130 wind turbines, each reaching 417 feet in height, on \n24 square miles of Nantucket Sound in an area surrounded by three \ncommercial airports, two busy ferry routes, and a major shipping \nchannel. The area is heavily utilized by commercial fishermen and \nrecreational boaters as well. Perhaps most importantly, the project \nwould be situated less than 15 miles from the only PAVE/PAWS missile \ndefense radar station on the entire eastern seaboard. Studies conducted \nin and around offshore wind farms in Britain have shown that these \ninstallations can have adverse impacts on radar for boats, aircraft, \nand air traffic controllers, and they may pose a hazard to navigation.\n  It must be left up to the Commandant of the Coast Guard to decide \nwhat is necessary to prevent negative impact to navigation, aviation, \nand communications caused by the proposed wind farm. We trust the \nCommandant to act responsibly and only\n\n[[Page S6440]]\n\nprescribe reasonable terms and conditions. If someone wants to \nchallenge his decision as unreasonable, they will have to raise the \nmatter in court. It will be up to the courts, not the Secretary of the \nInterior, to decide if the Commandant's terms and conditions are \nunreasonable.\n  Further, we must remain open to the possibility that the Commandant \nmay find that no amount of mitigation could be sufficient to eliminate \nthe potential detrimental effects of the specific siting of this \ndevelopment. If the final determination of the Commandant is that the \nproposed siting is unacceptable, the Secretary must abide by that \ndecision as well, and therefore fail to issue a permit, lease, \neasement, or right-of-way that would allow the facility to be \nconstructed on the proposed site.\n  The arrangement dictated by section 414 of this bill has precedence \nin the procedure for granting hydroelectric licenses under the Federal \nPower Act. This process requires the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission to include in the terms and conditions of its licenses for \nhydroelectric licenses any conditions deemed necessary to protect the \ninterests of other agencies. The United States Supreme Court determined \nthat such conditions had to be ``reasonable'' and the reasonability of \nthe conditions was a matter to be determined by the courts, not the \nCommission.\n  I support development of renewable sources of energy, but not at the \nexpense of public safety or national security. The provisions included \nin section 414 of this bill ensure that the impacts of Cape Wind's \npotential development on the citizens of Massachusetts and the rest of \nthe country will be evaluated fairly and appropriately by those who \nhave the expertise to make a final determination on how best to \nmitigate any adverse effects. I urge my colleagues to act swiftly to \npass the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2006.\n  Mr. WARNER. I further ask that when the Senate receives from the \nHouse a message that the House agrees to S. Con. Res. 103 and the \nconference report to accompany H.R. 889 is received from the House, the \nconference report be considered agreed to and the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
