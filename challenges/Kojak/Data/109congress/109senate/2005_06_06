Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to resume consideration of Calendar No. \n72, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Janice Rogers \nBrown, of California, to be United States Circuit Judge for the \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit.\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I have just a few announcements and then I \nwill have a short statement. We will have a full day of debate today on \nthe nomination of Janice Rogers Brown. To allow for an orderly debate, \nI now ask unanimous consent that following the remarks of myself and \nthe Democratic leader, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee be \nrecognized to speak. Further, I ask that the time from 3 to 4 be under \nthe control of the Democratic leader or his designee, and the time from \n4 to 5 be under the control of the majority leader or his designee. I \nfurther ask that the time from 5 to 5:30 be under the control of the \nother side of the aisle, and the time from 5:30 to 6 be under the \ncontrol of the majority.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, as a reminder to our colleagues, the \ncloture vote on the Brown nomination is scheduled for noon tomorrow. I \nhope and expect that cloture will be invoked at that time and that we \nwill be able to move quickly to an up-or-down vote on her nomination. \nThe Democratic leader and I will be talking shortly this afternoon and \nwill make more specific plans in terms of voting times and give some \nidea of how quickly we can move with other nominations.\n  We do have another cloture vote on the Pryor nomination, which would \nimmediately follow the up-or-down vote on Janice Rogers Brown.\n  In addition to those judicial nominations, we have agreements to \ndebate and vote on of two Sixth Circuit judicial nominations, as well \nas one DC Circuit Court nominee. This week, we may also reconsider the \nvote with respect to the Bolton nomination. As you can tell, we have a \nvery busy week as we return from recess. I thank our colleagues in \nadvance as we move through these issues.\n\n  Mr. President, I will have a brief opening statement as well, but I \nnow yield to the Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader. We do have our \nweek cut out for us. I think the Republican leader and I will get \ntogether later today to try to make a decision as to what we are going \nto do later. If we get through this block of judges that the leader \ntalked about, we should be in pretty good shape to move on to other \nthings and take the judges on a more regular basis, not eating up so \nmuch\n\n[[Page S6076]]\n\ntime. This is something the leader and I will discuss.\n  We have a work period of 4 weeks, so there is much we have to do \nbecause, as the Presiding Officer knows, we are entering the \nappropriations process time, which is always very hectic. We need to \nturn to that as soon as we can. I hope we can move through the \nappropriations bills one at a time and not have to do an omnibus or a \ncontinuing resolution. That would be better for individual Senators, \nour States, and our country.\n  As I have said, we have devoted a lot of time to this situation on \njudges. After this week, we should be able to move on to other items. I \nhope so.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I welcome our colleagues back from the \nMemorial Day recess. I know everybody enjoyed spending time with family \nand friends and constituents, reconnecting with the people we serve. It \nis always a very busy time during a recess period, and this particular \nrecess period, because it was the Memorial Day recess, where everybody \ndid take that day--or several days or moments on several days--to pause \nand honor the brave Americans who made the ultimate sacrifice in the \ncourse of their service to our Nation and in the cause of liberty.\n  In addition to Memorial Day, it was a time of graduations, a time of \ncommencements for students, whether it be from elementary school, \nmiddle school, high school, college, or graduate school. A number of \nour colleagues participated--I am sure most colleagues participated in \ngraduation ceremonies at all of those levels over the last couple of \nweeks.\n  I also hope that last week was a time when people rested and \nrecharged their batteries because, as was just implied in the remarks \nof the Democratic leader and myself, we have a very busy 4 weeks ahead \nof us. We have a lot of work to do in a very short period of time \nbefore we have the Fourth of July recess.\n  Today, we will continue, shortly, to debate the nomination of Janice \nRogers Brown to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. After having been \ndelayed for 2 years by partisan obstruction, she will finally receive a \nfair up-or-down vote--something she deserves. It will be this week on \nthe floor of the Senate. So I am very pleased because that demonstrates \nreal progress in this body. So after 2 years of partisan obstruction, \nshe is going to receive an up-or-down vote.\n  The President made a great choice in selecting Judge Brown to serve \non the Federal bench. I have had the opportunity to meet and spend time \nwith Judge Brown personally and have studied her record. She is a woman \nof great accomplishment and talent. She is tough, smart, and \nprincipled. Her story is nothing short of remarkable.\n  From humble beginnings as a sharecropper's daughter in segregated \nAlabama, Janice Rogers Brown has climbed to the peaks of the legal \nprofession. She was educated in segregated schools and worked her way \nthrough college and law school. She went on to serve in prominent \npositions in California State government.\n  Today, Janice Rogers Brown is a justice on the California Supreme \nCourt, the first African-American woman to serve on California's \nhighest court. Her fellow California judges, both Democrat and \nRepublican, have called her a ``superb judge'' who ``applies the law \nwithout favor, without bias, and with an even hand.''\n  The people of California believe she is doing a great job. They \nreelected her with 76 percent of the vote, the highest voting \npercentage of all of the justices on the ballot.\n  The Senate will have a spirited debate on Justice Brown's nomination, \nbut I hope Senators will remember that this is about treating nominees \nwith fairness. Nominees deserve not only a fair up-or-down vote but to \nbe treated fairly during the debate. Civility is more than a word. It \nis a value we must all work to uphold in our deliberations, and may \nthat be respected on the floor of the Senate.\n\n  Before the recess, the Senate voted up or down on Justice Priscilla \nOwen and she was confirmed. I hope this progress will continue with \nJustice Brown this week and with Judge Pryor this week, as well as \nfuture nominees. We should have a very positive week on judges. As long \nas that progress continues, a process that continues to give these up-\nor-down votes, gives these nominees the consideration they deserve, not \nblind obstruction of the Constitution, the constitutional option, of \ncourse, will not be needed.\n  Our job as Senators is to govern with meaningful solutions, and we \nmust always remain focused on that larger picture of making America \nsafer and stronger and more secure. That is why it is imperative that \nwe address matters such as America's intolerable dependence upon \nforeign oil. We have gone on for more than a decade without a \ncomprehensive national energy policy. It is time now to change that. As \na result, we have become dependent on foreign sources of oil, putting \nour security and our economy at risk. That is too long. It is time for \nus to act now--not just talk about it--for families worried about gas \nprices as they anticipate summer driving, for families who have to \nsacrifice next winter to pay their heating bills. They expect us to \nact, and we will in this body on the floor of the Senate and deliver \nfor the American people.\n  We must diversify our sources of energy and balance new production \nwith conservation and development of renewable resources.\n  We must do so in a way that reduces our reliance on foreign sources--\nby increasing America's domestic production of clean coal, oil, and \ngas, nuclear, solar, ethanol, and other renewable energy sources--a \ncomprehensive energy plan that will make America safer and more secure \nand will inject much needed jobs into the economy.\n  I thank Chairman Domenici and Senator Bingaman for their hard work \nand for working together to get this bill out of committee and ready \nfor the floor on a strong, bipartisan vote.\n  I am confident that we can move forward in the same bipartisan spirit \non the Senate floor to move this bill quickly and get it to conference \nwith the House and have it on the President's desk for his signature.\n  America needs an energy policy that reflects our modern economic and \nsecurity challenges.\n  In the days ahead, we will address the Energy bill and we will \ncomplete action on the highway bill, which is currently in conference. \nAs soon as that conference completes its action, we will bring it to \nthe floor. We will address the President's nominees and a host of other \nissues.\n  As we do so, I am determined to work with my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle to take whatever action is necessary--that bold action to \nmove America forward.\n  We have made great progress in the 109th Congress thus far. We passed \nfair and thoughtful legislation to end class action and bankruptcy \nabuse. We took quick and decisive action to support our troops in the \nfield and to give relief for the victims of the tsunami disaster. We \npassed the Genetic Nondiscrimination Act, a victory that will provide \nprotections against genetic discrimination in health insurance. And we \nare now finally giving judges the votes they deserve.\n  We passed a budget in the fifth fastest time in Senate history.\n  We are leading today on tomorrow's challenges. We can be proud of our \nefforts to expand freedom here at home and across the globe.\n  With mutual trust and civility and a sharp focus on our ultimate \ngoals, we can continue to deliver to the American people the solutions \nthey need and the leadership our Nation deserves.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to support the \nproceeding to invoke cloture, cut off debate, on California State \nSupreme Court Justice Janice Rogers Brown, and to bring her to a vote \nfor confirmation to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia \nCircuit. Justice Brown comes to this body with a truly outstanding \nacademic and professional record. She is a graduate of the California \nState University-Sacramento in 1974. She received her law degree from \nthe University of California at Los Angeles in 1977 and then has had an \nillustrious career in government in the practice of law and on the \nbench. She has served in very important legislative roles with the \nCalifornia Legislative Counsel Bureau where she was deputy legislative \ncounsel. She was deputy\n\n[[Page S6077]]\n\nattorney general for some 8 years; deputy secretary and general counsel \nfor the State of California Business, Transportation and Housing Agency \nfor 3 years, and then came to the court of appeals, which is an \nintermediate appellate court in California, for 3 years before becoming \na justice on the Supreme Court of California, where she has sat since \n1996 until the present time.\n  During the midst of her career, she has gone on to get a master's \ndegree at the University of Virginia School of Law in the year 2004 \nwhich, I would say, is quite an achievement for someone who has been in \nthe California court to take on that kind of academic endeavor and to \nearn a master's degree.\n  Beyond her professional work, she has been very active in the \ncommunity, working with the Youth for Citizenship which serves young \npeople, high school students, teaching them history, civics, reasoning, \nand debating skills.\n  She is a participant in a program called ``Playing by the Rules'' \nsponsored by a local baseball team, which brings together lawyers, \njudges, baseball, and elementary and junior high school students to \nexplore life lessons, good citizenship, and the rule of law.\n  She is a founding board member of Rio Americano High School's Academy \nCivitas, a 3-year program which specializes in history and political \nphilosophy and seeks to encourage civic virtue by having students \nparticipate in internships with Government agencies.\n  She is the first African-American woman to serve on California's \nhighest court. She is the daughter of sharecroppers, having been born \nin Greenville, AL, in 1949, 5 years before Brown v. Board of Education. \nShe attended segregated schools and came of age in the midst of Jim \nCrow policies in the South, which is not easy to do.\n  With all of that, she has had an extraordinary and really illustrious \ncareer.\n  I suggest to my colleagues in the Senate that the confirmation \nprocess of Justice Janice Rogers Brown would not be nearly so \ncomplicated if it were not set in a timeframe where, for the past two \ndecades, virtually, there has been an exacerbation of the issue of \nconfirmation of judges when one party held the White House and the \nother political party held the Senate and the Judiciary Committee.\n  I have served on the Judiciary Committee since my election in 1980. I \npersonally observed, in the last 2 years of President Reagan's \nadministration, after Democrats won control of the Senate in the 1986 \nelection, that the process was slowed down, and the process was further \nslowed down during the full 4 years of the administration of President \nGeorge Herbert Walker Bush. I have detailed these in previous floor \nstatements and will not now reiterate them.\n  Then, in the last 6 years of President Clinton's administration, \nnearly 70 nominees by President Clinton were held up in committee, and \nthat was payback, in effect, for what had happened for the last 2 years \nof President Reagan's administration and the 4 years of the \nadministration of the first President Bush.\n  When the Republicans won control of the Senate, the Democrats then \nresorted to the filibuster, which was the first systematic use of the \nfilibuster against judicial nominees in the history of this country. \nThat was followed by President Bush's use of the interim appointment \npower, the first time in history that the interim appointment power had \nbeen used for a judicial nominee after a rejection by the Senate, \nalbeit by the filibuster route. That stopped when there was a \ncommitment made not to use it any more, and the nomination process went \nforward.\n  Let us take a look at the record of Justice Janice Rogers Brown and \ntake a look at the record of Justice Owen, now Judge Owen confirmed to \nthe Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, or Judge Pryor, whose nomination \nwill be before the Senate hopefully in the next several days. We have \nconfirmed many circuit judges during my tenure since my election in \n1980, all which I have spent in the service of the Judiciary Committee, \nwho had records not as good as those of Justice Brown or Justice Owen \nor Judge Pryor. Had we had not been in this situation of holding up \njudges when one party controlled the White House and the other \ncontrolled the Senate and the exacerbation of this situation, we would \nnot have reached the critical stage in which the Senate has been in the \nimmediate past.\n  We have seen a situation where the filibuster went on and, in my own \npersonal opinion--and I have expressed this at some length in prior \nfloor statements--Democrats were not really pleased with this \nsystematic filibuster. That led to the potential retaliation of the \nConstitution or nuclear option. I do not think many, if not most, of \nthe Republicans were pleased with that sort of an alternative. But the \nwhole situation had spiraled out of control.\n  As Senators, we do have a fundamental constitutional obligation to \nconsent, if we choose to do so, to the President's nominees to the \nbench. This is an advice and consent function under the United States \nConstitution. That does specify--I think it is more than implication, I \nthink it is really specification--that there be independent judgment \nused by Senators in coming to that decision. Just as there is a \nrequirement of independence, if there is to be separation of power, \nthen the party which controls the White House ought not to be an \nautomatic rubberstamp for the President. Similarly, the party out of \npower ought not to be an automatic filibustering machine; there ought \nto be independent judgment. And that is why I had urged the leaders, \nagain in extended floor statements which I shall not now repeat, to \nliberate their Members from the straight party-line, straitjacket vote \nand allow them to exercise their independence. I think if the 100 \nSenators were left to our own judgments as to what kind of a nominee \nought to be filibustered, Justice Janice Rogers Brown would never have \nbeen filibustered. Similarly, if we Senators--Republicans on the \nsituation of the constitutional or nuclear option--had been left to our \nown judgment, we would have rejected the idea of having the \nconstitutional or nuclear option.\n  So we have come to a situation now where at least we have moved to \nconfirm Justice Owen, and we are on the brink of the confirmation \nprocess of Justice Brown with, as we all know, the agreement of some 14 \nSenators that there would not be a filibuster as to Justice Brown.\n  It is true that if you take a look at some of Justice Brown's \nstatements in a context of diplomacy, they might have been left better \nunsaid, but if everybody in public life--and that would even include \nSenators--were held to every last syllable that each of us uttered, it \nwould not be a very difficult matter to go through the tracks of \nspeeches each of us has made and find some items on which to be highly \ncritical.\n  Justice Brown has been criticized for a comment which she made \ncriticizing Justice Holmes' dissent in Lochner, where she referred to \nthe ``triumph of our own socialist revolution'' in 1937. But if we take \na look at Justice Brown's decisions, we find her decisions are not in \nline with that kind of a loose condemnatory statement.\n  In Lochyer v. Shamrock Foods, Justice Brown joined the court's \nopinion upholding California's stringent standards, which exceeded \nFederal standards, for identifying and labeling milk and milk products. \nThat is hardly an inactive government.\n  In the case of Lungren v. Superior Court, she joined the court's \nopinion, broadly construing the phrase ``source of drinking water'' in \nthe State's clean water statute so that plaintiffs could proceed with \ntheir case. Again, not exactly denial of governmental authority.\n  In the case of Ramirez v. Yosemite Water Co., she joined the court in \nupholding State regulations regarding overtime pay that applied greater \nprotection to workers than Federal law. Here, again, that is active \nState regulation.\n  In Pearl v. Worker's Compensation Appeals Board, she joined the \ncourt's opinion, upholding the Worker's Compensation Board's stringent \nstandards for ensuring the safety of workers, awarding the plaintiff, \nan injured police officer, higher benefits; again, sound judicial \nthinking and not exactly denial of the authority of the State to \nlegislate and look after the common welfare.\n  She made a statement with respect to discrimination saying it is not \n``. . . based on age is not . . . like race and sex discrimination. It \ndoes not mark\n\n[[Page S6078]]\n\nits victim with a `stigma of inferiority and second class citizenship'; \nit is the unavoidable consequence of that universal leveler: time.''\n  That is perhaps an effort to be scholarly, perhaps to be poetic, but \nhardly disqualifying.\n  If we take a look at her opinions on the bench, they demonstrate a \nvery distinctive regard for civil rights. In People v. McKay, hers was \nthe lone dissent, arguing for the exclusion of evidence of drug \npossession that was discovered after the defendant was arrested for \nriding his bicycle the wrong way on a residential street. Her dissent \npointedly suggested that the defendant was the victim of racial \nprofiling and included an impassioned critique of that practice.\n\n  In Kasky v. Nike, the court held that Nike's statements denying \nmistreatment of overseas workers constituted commercial speech subject \nto the State truth in advertising laws. Justice Brown dissented saying \nthat Nike's speech constituted noncommercial speech worthy of more \nstrict first amendment protection. Upon appeal, the Supreme Court \ndenied certiorari, but in opinions issued by Justices Breyer and \nStevens, there were strong suggestions that if the Court had taken the \nappeal, Justice Brown's position might well have been upheld, in a very \ndifficult case, where it is hard to draw the line as to what \nconstitutes commercial speech or what is noncommercial speech entitled \nto more stringent protections under the first amendment.\n  In this case, as in so many others, Justice Brown demonstrated a real \nconcern for constitutional protections.\n  In re Brown, she wrote the court's opinion reversing a verdict and \ndeath sentence on grounds that the prosecutor deprived the defendant of \na fair trial by failing to discover and disclose an arguably \nexculpatory blood test.\n  In Visciotti, she dissented from the majority opinion, arguing that a \ndefendant's death sentence should be set aside on grounds of \nineffective assistance of counsel.\n  In the interest of time, I am not going to delineate any more of \nJustice Brown's opinions, but I would like to put into the Record some \nsummaries of criticism of Justice Brown where she has been criticized \nfor her attitude toward big Government, where she has been criticized \nfor some rulings on civil rights, where she has been criticized for \nrulings on the first amendment, and where she has been criticized for \nrulings on criminal law.\n  I ask unanimous consent that these summaries be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            Opposition--Brown's Criticisms of Big Government\n\n\n  justice brown's critics overlook a record on the bench of moderation\n\n     Much of the criticism of Justice Brown centers on speeches \n         she made off the bench, but does not hold up next to her \n         judicial opinions\n       Most notably, Justice Brown criticized the demise of the \n     Lochner era and the rise of the New Deal in a speech before \n     the Federalist Society. While her speech was indeed critical \n     of Justice Holmes' dissent in Lochner, her judicial opinion \n     on the subject in Santa Monica Beach, Ltd. v. Superior Court \n     criticized Lochner in terms echoing the United States Supreme \n     Court.\n       Justice Brown also has been attacked for speeches that \n     criticize government as profligate in creating new rights and \n     privileges and redistributing wealth. Again, the attack loses \n     force when the focus turns to her judicial opinions, which \n     are untainted by personal ideology. To give just a few \n     examples, she has voted to employ an expansive interpretation \n     of a state clean water statute so that plaintiffs could \n     proceed with their case; upheld the right of a plaintiff to \n     sue for exposure to toxic chemicals using the government's \n     environmental regulations; upheld state regulations regarding \n     overtime pay; and upheld a workers compensation board's \n     stringent standard for ensuring the safety of workers.\n       In a recent column, law professor Jonathan Turley, a self-\n     described ``pro-choice social liberal,'' points out that \n     ``Brown's legal opinions show a willingness to vote against \n     conservative views . . . when justice demands it'' and that \n     Democrats should confirm her. The attempt to brand her as an \n     extremist, derived from a combination of half-truths and the \n     extremism of her critics, is demagoguery of the first order, \n     and should not be permitted to obstruct the confirmation of a \n     jurist who has been a credit to the bench.\n\n              Opposition--Brown's Rulings on Civil Rights\n\n     Justice Brown's rulings on racial bias have been distorted\n       In Peatros v. Bank of America, she dissented on grounds \n     that a state law-based discrimination claim was preempted by \n     the National Bank Act. The dissent in fact deferred to \n     federal jurisdiction under the Supremacy Clause and notably \n     pointed to Title VII as the appropriate civil rights \n     provision to invoke in an area governed by federal law--a far \n     cry from an ideologue who appreciates neither federal \n     authority nor civil rights laws.\n       Another subject of attack was her dissent from Aguilar v. \n     Avis Rent A Car System, a decision upholding an injunction \n     against the use of racial slurs in the workplace. Unmentioned \n     in the attack is that her dissent was based on well \n     established First Amendment prohibitions on prior restraint \n     and that she was joined by the court's late liberal icon, \n     Justice Mosk.\n       In Hi-Voltage Wire Works v. City of San Jose, Justice Brown \n     deferred to precedent in her court opinion invalidating a \n     minority contracting program under Proposition 209. That \n     issue was so straightforward that every judge who reviewed it \n     from the trial court on up reached the same result--including \n     every member of the state supreme court.\n       Justice Brown's opinion asserted that ``discrimination on \n     the basis of race is illegal, immoral, unconstitutional, \n     inherently wrong, and destructive of democratic society.''\n       Justice Brown further acknowledged that ``equal protection \n     does not preclude race-conscious programs.''\n     The innuendo that this jurist is insensitive to racial bias \n         disparages her firm commitment to civil rights\n       Consider Justice Brown's lone dissent in People v. McKay. \n     There she argued for the exclusion of evidence of drug \n     possession that was discovered after the defendant was \n     arrested for riding his bicycle the wrong way on a \n     residential street.\n       Justice Brown had this to say: ``In the spring of 1963, \n     civil rights protests in Birmingham united this country in a \n     new way. Seeing peaceful protesters jabbed with cattle prods, \n     held at bay by snarling police dogs, and flattened by \n     powerful streams of water from fire hoses galvanized the \n     nation. Without being constitutional scholars, we understood \n     violence, coercion, and oppression. We understood what \n     constitutional limits are designed to restrain. We reclaimed \n     our constitutional aspirations. What is happening now is more \n     subtle, more diffuse, and less visible, but it is only a \n     difference in degree. If harm is still being done to people \n     because they are black, or brown, or poor, the oppression is \n     not lessened by the absence of television cameras.''\n       Justice Brown criticized what she called ``the disparate \n     impact of stop-and-search procedures of the California \n     Highway Patrol. The practice is so prevalent, it has a name: \n     `Driving While Black.' ''\n       When you read such powerful statements, you have to wonder \n     whether this judge, far from being too conservative, may not \n     in fact be a bit too liberal for some of my friends who have \n     opposed her.\n\n           Opposition--Brown's Rulings on the First Amendment\n\n     Justice Brown's First Amendment opinions have been distorted\n       When she is cognizant of First Amendment rights in a \n     discrimination case, she receives no credit. Her critics \n     simply turn to three other First Amendment cases to spin an \n     attack that she gives broad protection to corporate speech \n     while shortchanging individual free speech.\n       In one case, Justice Brown wrote a plurality opinion \n     upholding an injunction against gang members congregating in \n     a specified area in San Jose, a position supported by the \n     Democratic mayor of the city at the time, the Los Angeles \n     Times, and the San Francisco Examiner.\n       In another, Justice Mosk, the California Supreme Court's \n     late, liberal icon, joined Justice Brown in a dissent that \n     would have upheld an injunction against a disgruntled former \n     employee sending disruptive mass emails.\n       In the third case, Kasky v. Nike, Justice Brown dissented \n     on grounds that Nike's speech deserved more stringent \n     protection than was provided by a California law. This third \n     case provides the hook for her detractors' spin, but the \n     baselessness of the critique is underscored by strong \n     evidence that a majority of the United States Supreme Court \n     would have taken her position had it considered the merits.\n       In dismissing the writ of certiorari, Justice Stevens, \n     joined by Justices Ginsburg and Souter, noted in the same \n     vein as Justice Brown that the case involved ``novel First \n     Amendment questions.''\n       Justice Breyer, joined by Justice O'Connor, stated in a \n     dissent to the dismissal of certiorari in Kasky that ``it is \n     likely, if not highly probable'' that the law violated the \n     First Amendment.\n\n[[Page S6079]]\n\n              Opposition--Brown's Rulings on Criminal Law\n\n     Justice Brown has demonstrated her respect of Fourth \n         Amendment rights and has argued for reversing verdicts or \n         sentences for capital defendants\n       In addition to the dissent in People v. McKay that I cited, \n     she wrote the court's opinion in In re Brown reversing a \n     verdict and death sentence in a case where the prosecutor \n     deprived the defendant of a fair trial by failing to discover \n     and disclose an arguably exculpatory blood test.\n       In In re Visciotti, she dissented from the majority \n     opinion, arguing that a defendant's death sentence should be \n     set aside on grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent that quotations from certain of \nJustice Brown's supporters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Quotes From Supporters--What Those Who Know Her Best Are Saying About \n                             Justice Brown\n\n       Letter from a bi-partisan group of 12 of Justice Brown's \n     current and former judicial colleagues (including all of her \n     former colleagues on the Court of Appeal, Third Appellate \n     District and four current members of the California Supreme \n     Court) to the Honorable Orrin G. Hatch, October 16, 2003:\n       ``Much has been written about Justice Brown's humble \n     beginnings, and the story of her rise to the California \n     Supreme Court is truly compelling. But that alone would not \n     be enough to gain our endorsement for a seat on the federal \n     bench. We believe that Justice Brown is qualified because she \n     is a superb judge. We who have worked with her on a daily \n     basis know her to be extremely intelligent, keenly \n     analytical, and very hard working. We know that she is a \n     jurist who applies the law without favor, without bias, and \n     with an even hand.''\n       Statement of former senator and governor Pete Wilson, for \n     whom Justice Brown served between 1991 and 1994:\n       ``She served as my legal affairs secretary for three years \n     because a number of excellent lawyers in the state, whose \n     judgment I trust, said, `You will not do better.' They were \n     right. She was not only a legal scholar--so that I could rely \n     upon her judgment as to what the law was--she was an \n     excellent guide when I was trying to decide what the law \n     ought to be . . . I would simply say to you that, by \n     intellect and by character, by experience, by capability, \n     Justice Brown deserves not only a vote, but deserves a seat \n     on the District Court of Appeals, where I predict she will, \n     if seated, be a brilliant addition.''\n       Letter from a bi-partisan group of 15 California law \n     professors to the Honorable Orrin G. Hatch, October 15, 2003:\n       ``We know Justice Brown to be a person of high \n     intelligence, unquestioned integrity, and even-handedness. \n     Since we are of differing political beliefs and perspectives, \n     Democratic, Republican and Independent, we wish especially to \n     emphasize what we believe is Justice Brown's strongest \n     credential for appointment to this important seat on the D.C. \n     Circuit: her open-minded and thorough appraisal of legal \n     argumentation, even when her personal views may conflict with \n     those arguments.''\n       Letter from 18 members of the California delegation in the \n     House of Representatives to the Chairman and Ranking Member \n     of this committee, April 14, 2005:\n       ``Janice Rogers Brown is an outstanding jurist with more \n     than eight years of experience on the California appellate \n     bench. She is well-regarded by her colleagues and known to be \n     a person of great intellect, integrity and dedication. \n     Moreover, Justice Brown is a first-rate judge respected by \n     many for her even-handed and unbiased application of the \n     law.''\n       Letter from Ellis Horvitz, a Democrat and one of the deans \n     of the appellate bar in California, to the Honorable Orrin G. \n     Hatch, September 29, 2003:\n       ``In my opinion, Justice Brown [possesses] those qualities \n     an appellate justice should have. She is extremely \n     intelligent, very conscientious and hard working, \n     refreshingly articulate, and possessing great common sense \n     and integrity. She is courteous and gracious to the litigants \n     and counsel who appear before her.''\n       Undated Letter from Regis Lane, Director of Minorities in \n     Law Enforcement, a coalition of ethnic minority law \n     enforcement officers in California, to Chairman Orrin G. \n     Hatch.\n       ``We recommend the confirmation of Justice Brown based on \n     her broad range of experience, personal integrity, good \n     standing in the community and dedication to public service . \n     . . In many conversations with Justice Brown, I have \n     discovered that she is very passionate about the plight of \n     racial minorities in America, based on her upbringing in the \n     south. Justice Brown's views that all individuals who desire \n     the American dream, regardless of their race or creed, can \n     and should succeed in this country are consistent with MILE's \n     mission to ensure brighter futures for disadvantaged youth of \n     color.''\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. One of the cases which I studied in law school was the \nfamous dissent by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, who argued for dissent \nand for freedom of speech, saying what I think is, if not the most \nfamous quotation in Supreme Court history--that is pretty hard to \ncategorize--certainly one of the most famous where he said that ``time \nhas upset many fighting faiths.''\n  That is why we encourage independent thought. That is why we \nencourage dissent. There are many dissents which have become the law of \nthe land. Dred Scott was overturned. Plessy v. Ferguson on segregation \nwas overturned. Brown v. Mississippi established the rule of due \nprocess of law for State court criminal proceedings, and dissenting \nopinions of Brandeis and Holmes and Cardozo have become the law of the \nland.\n  So when one sees someone who might not conform exactly to the kind of \nthought or might be a little more colorful in phraseology, it is not \nnecessarily something to be discouraged. If one takes a close reading \nas to what Justice Brown has had to say, she is worthy of confirmation \nby this Senate. As we analyze nominees for the Federal court, as we \nanalyze nominees for any important position, we ought not to discourage \nindividualism, independence, and free thought. The phrase that ``time \nhas upset many fighting faiths,'' encouraging independence and free \nthought has been a great bulwark for the progress of this country.\n  I yield the floor, and in the absence of any other Senators seeking \nrecognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we are in the midst of debate on Janice \nRogers Brown. I know we have the time divided from 3 to about 6 \ntonight. I ask to speak for about 7 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n               First Anniversary of Ronald Reagan's Death\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, yesterday marked the first anniversary of \nthe passing of President Ronald Wilson Reagan, the 40th President of \nthe United States. I will take a moment to reflect very briefly on his \nextraordinary life and on his leadership that changed history.\n  Ronald Reagan was raised in a small town, and it was those small-town \nroots that never, ever left him. As he explained when he grew up in a \nsmall town, reflecting on those small-town roots, in his words:\n\n       You get to know people as individuals, not as blocs or \n     members of special interest groups. You discover that despite \n     their differences, most people have a lot in common: . . . \n     [W]e all want freedom and liberty, peace, love and security, \n     a good home, and a chance to worship God in our own way; we \n     all want the chance to get ahead and make our children's \n     lives better than our own.\n\n  Ronald Reagan believed that the Government should serve the people. \nHe believed that America's strength came from creativity, ingenuity, \nand productivity of the people, not the plans of Government bureaucrats \nor the theories of intellectual elites. This core belief guided \neverything he did, everything he said.\n  When he came to office, the American economy was in shambles. \nInflation was in double digits. Interest rates were soaring. The \nAmerican worker was demoralized. He set about slashing Federal income \ntaxes and cutting burdensome regulations. It was his mission to free \nthe American worker and unleash the American entrepreneur. His sweeping \ntax reforms overhauled the Tax Code and removed 6 million taxpayers \nfrom the tax rolls. By the time he left, it was morning in America. \nPresident Reagan believed in the aspirations and dignity of the \nindividual. As he said in his second inaugural address, there are no \nlimits to growth in human progress when men and women are free to \nfollow their dreams.\n  He reminded the American people that economic liberty and human \nfreedom were two sides of the same coin. He reminded the world that \nfreedom is the birthright of all peoples. Some call it the Reagan \nRevolution. Others call\n\n[[Page S6080]]\n\nit the Reagan Restoration. I prefer the latter.\n  The man from Dixon--lifeguard, radio announcer, actor, Governor, \nfather, adoring husband, President of the United States--restored not \nonly our confidence but our fundamental understanding of the source of \nAmerica's greatness: each and every one of us striving to realize the \nAmerican dream.\n  In his 1982 State of the Union Address, President Reagan told the \nNation:\n\n       We do not have to turn to our history books for heroes. \n     They're all around us.\n\n  To the freedom fighters in the former Soviet Union to his fellow \ncitizens here at home, Ronald Wilson Reagan was one of those real life \nheroes who brought hope, freedom, and opportunity to millions.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning business for up to 20 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Reauthorizing the USA-PATRIOT ACT\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, tomorrow the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence gets back on the national security high wire as the \ncommittee continues to work on legislation reauthorizing the USA \nPATRIOT Act. I described this process as a high-wire act because \nsuccess means striking a balance, an equilibrium, between fiercely \nprotecting our country from terrorism while still preserving the \nprivacy and civil liberties that make our democracy so precious.\n  Chairman Pat Roberts, to his credit, has held several open hearings \non this issue. I gladly participated because I believed the open \nhearings would help to address some of the skepticism about why the \nPATRIOT Act has almost totally been debated in secret.\n  Unfortunately, the most important part of the debate, the part where \nthe committee must actually discuss how to walk that high wire, is \nstill going to be done behind closed doors. In my view, this secrecy in \ngoing forward will undermine any public confidence that open hearings \nhelped to create.\n  I have repeatedly and vigorously opposed making these decisions out \nof public view. Holding the decisionmaking process in secret is a \nmistake because it makes it harder for citizens to hold elected \nofficials accountable. Holding the decisionmaking process in secret is \nunnecessary because it is not difficult for the committee to go behind \nclosed doors, certainly, briefly, when necessary, to discuss any \nPATRIOT Act-related issue that requires secrecy. Holding the \ndecisionmaking process in secret gratuitously feeds the cynicism that \ncitizens have about the Government's true intentions with respect to \nthis law. Keeping these proceedings secret fuels concerns that the \ncommittee is making choices that will not stand up to public scrutiny--\ndeciding, for example, that you can only have security if you sacrifice \nprivacy. In my view, that is a false choice. I simply do not believe \nthat protecting our country from terrorism and securing the privacy \nrights of our citizens are mutually exclusive objectives.\n  So here is my bottom line: Give law enforcement and intelligence \nofficials the tools they need to protect our country, but stay away \nfrom the fishing expeditions. I do not think anybody will argue with me \nwhen I say that Congress passed the PATRIOT Act shortly after September \n11, 2001, because it was necessary to move in a hurry. It was clear no \none could have conceived of the way in which our country was exposed to \nattack. It was clear that the Federal Government needed to make major \nchanges in how it fought terrorism, and those were needed immediately.\n  The best parts of the law tore down the unnecessary walls that had \ngrown up between law enforcement and the intelligence agencies. Today, \nif you go out to the National Counterterrorism Center, the people on \nthe ground there will tell you that those walls have been torn down, \nand they have stayed down. So the men and women on the front lines in \nthe fight against terror are, in my view, more effective than they \nwere.\n  However, other provisions of the law have sparked serious concerns. \nGiving Federal authorities broad powers of investigation has raised the \nspecter that the rights of law-abiding citizens might be severely \ncompromised, accidentally or even intentionally. In moving forward, I \nwant to make sure that the right of our citizens to privacy is \ncertainly not compromised intentionally.\n  I am not suggesting our national intelligence or law enforcement \nagencies are currently being misused the way they have been during our \nhistory--such as in the Watergate scandal. But it is important for us \nto make sure that appropriate safeguards are in place to prevent \nunintentional abuses and prevent future even darker episodes in our \ncountry's history.\n  In my view, a proposed addition to the PATRIOT Act, one that \ncertainly warrants open debate, is the administrative subpoena which, \nin my view, raises the risk of real abuse. I want to make it clear on \nthis subject today, I believe reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act should \nsimply not include new administrative subpoena authority for the FBI.\n  I am opposed to giving the FBI this authority to write their own \nadministrative subpoenas for foreign intelligence investigations for a \nnumber of reasons. Doing so would give the FBI the authority to demand \njust about anything from just about anybody, with no independent check, \nsimply by claiming that it is relevant to a national security \ninvestigation. The FBI already has access to the waterfront of personal \ninformation through the FISA warrant process. All they have to do is go \nbefore a judge and explain why it is relevant in the most general \nterms. By giving the FBI the authority to write their own \nadministrative subpoenas, the Congress would be removing this even last \nmodest safeguard.\n  Administrative subpoenas are currently used by many Federal agencies \nin many contexts. But, except in a very few limited cases, they are not \nused for national security investigations. National security \ninvestigations are simply different than criminal investigations. They, \nof course, are conducted in secret and do not require evidence of a \ncrime. This is why there are different rules for the two types of \ninvestigations. It is not enough, in my view, to say what is good for \nthe goose is good for the gander. The question here is, What is good \nfor the American people? The answer is not administrative subpoenas.\n\n  As proposed, these subpoenas would be extraordinarily broad in their \nscope. They could be used to gain access to your credit records, your \nvideo rentals, your medical records, your gun purchases. They could be \nused to obtain just about anything. These subpoenas would only be seen \nby a judge if the recipient of the subpoena decided to challenge it. \nEven if the recipient was properly notified of his or her right to \nchallenge, they might not be in the position to have the time or the \nresources to even make that challenge.\n  For example, there are 56 FBI field offices, one in just about every \nmajor American city. The head of the local field office could issue an \nadministrative subpoena to a hospital director and ask for all the \nhospital's medical records simply by claiming they were relevant to an \ninvestigation. If the hospital director was busy or did not have the \nresources to make a challenge, then no judge--no judge would ever see \nthis administrative subpoena. The patients would not even know that \ntheir records had been seized. They would be totally in the dark.\n  Even the FBI acknowledges that the agency can get all the information \nthey could possibly need with the investigative powers they currently \nhave. The only reason they have suggested for supporting this judge-\nfree administrative subpoena is speed. They say that the FISA warrant \nprocess is simply too slow for time-sensitive, emergency situations.\n  This afternoon I would like to propose on the floor of the Senate an \nalternative. In this year's reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act, \nCongress can balance protection for the public with the right of \nprivacy by creating an emergency use provision to the FISA business \nrecords authority. This way, under the proposal I make today, if the \nFBI needs information right away, the FBI could notify a judge that \nthey\n\n[[Page S6081]]\n\nwere going to get it--send an e-mail, leave a voice message--and then \ngo get it without waiting for a response. Then they would have 72 hours \nto apply for the warrant so they could do it after the emergency had \nbeen addressed. If the judge felt the FBI had acted inappropriately and \ndecided not to grant the warrant, then the Agency would not be able to \nuse whatever information they had gathered. The idea of adding an \nemergency use provision along the lines I have described would address \nthe FBI's concern for speed without creating a broad new authority that \nwould remove all the independent checks, even in situations where there \nwere not emergencies.\n  Although time was not taken in 2001 to thoroughly discuss the privacy \nissues related to the PATRIOT Act, most of the law's more controversial \nprovisions were made subject to sunset. This was done in hopes of a \nmore thoughtful, informed debate during the reauthorization. The \nsunsets, in my view, have had an unanticipated benefit. They have made \nthe agency very careful about how it uses the powers that have been \ngranted.\n  In addition to the proposal that I am making today to give the FBI \nmore authority to deal with emergencies, I believe the Senate should \nalso focus its attention on sharper scrutiny for the sunset provisions \nin the act. Some of the sunset provisions that have existed have not \nattracted any controversy. Others have not only attracted controversy, \nserious questions have been raised about their use and possible misuse. \nI want to consider some of these provisions in detail today and, in \naddition to the proposal I have made with respect to giving the FBI \nemergency authority, I urge firm action to safeguard the American \npeople as the sunset provisions are considered in the PATRIOT Act's \nrenewal.\n\n  The provision that has attracted the most attention is probably \nsection 215 of the PATRIOT Act. It is commonly referred to as the \nlibrary records provision, but in fact it ought to be called the \nbusiness records provision. Suffice it to say, it is a sweeping one. \nThis provision gives law enforcement access to all types of information \nfrom video rentals and gun purchases to tax and medical records. In a \nnutshell, here is how it works.\n  Under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, FISA--which I have \nreferred to several times already--it is possible for FBI agents to go \nto a judge and request a secret warrant to obtain business records. The \nperson to whom the records pertain is not informed. This means that if \nthe FBI serves a FISA warrant on a bank or hospital, the bank president \nor hospital director would know about it, but the customers or patients \nwhose records had been seized would know nothing at all.\n  Before the PATRIOT Act, if the FBI wanted to get one of these \nwarrants, they had to show a judge specific and articulable facts that \nthe records pertained to a terrorist or a spy. The PATRIOT Act lowered \nthe standard, so now the FBI simply has to assert that the records are, \nin their view, relevant to a terrorism inquiry. To protect innocent \nAmericans, the business records provision needs to be modified in \nseveral ways.\n  First, the Congress should require that the application for a FISA \nwarrant include a statement of facts explaining why the records are \nrelevant to an investigation. Congress should also raise the standard \nfor the most sensitive type of records. The ``relevance'' standard may \nbe appropriate for a hotel or car rental record, but it may be \nnecessary to require the FBI to show hard evidence before giving access \nto more sensitive records such as medical records.\n  Finally, there must be an increase in the reporting that is done in \nthis area. Congress's duty to look out for abuses of the PATRIOT Act is \noften a challenging one. Little reporting is required on the use of \nsome provisions. Details regarding the use of the PATRIOT Act are \nreported, even when reporting is not required. When there is a report, \nthe information is often classified. National security investigations \noften need to be conducted in secret, but revealing how often \nparticular techniques are used does not make them less effective. \nCongress needs this information to perform its constitutional \nresponsibilities, and the fact is too often Congress has been doing \noversight over the intelligence community in the dark.\n  The Intelligence reform bill that passed a few months ago tried to \nfill several of the reporting gaps, but there are others that need to \nbe closed as the PATRIOT Act is reauthorized. These reports should also \nbe made public, to the maximum extent possible so that the American \npeople can know all that is safely to be known about FBI activity under \nthe law.\n  One of the major reporting gaps I am concerned about involves what \nthe FBI calls discreet inquiries that the agency uses to obtain library \nrecords. The FBI Director, Mr. Mueller, has testified before several \nSenate committees that, while FISA warrants could be used to obtain \npeople's library records, this has never been done. But the FBI \ndirector went on to say that the Agency does obtain library records \nthrough what he called discreet inquiries. So I think that the American \npeople deserve to know what a discreet inquiry is. The American people \ndeserve to know how often they are used. And I have asked the FBI to \nget me this information.\n  Over a month later, despite multiple requests by the staff of the \nIntelligence Committee, the FBI has still not provided an answer to the \nquestion. Suffice it to say, the longer the Agency waits, in terms of \nanswering the question of how they obtain library records, the more \nAmericans believe that the Agency is stepping over the line and into \nthe lives of law-abiding citizens. Those most directly affected by the \nlibrary records provision have been expressing strong concerns. The \nAmerican Library Association recently wrote me:\n\n       ``[D]iscreet inquiries'' by the FBI put our librarians at \n     risk of breaking state laws if agents approach them for \n     information without subpoenas or other properly executed \n     legal documents and intimidate them into complying with the \n     request.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent the letter from the American Library \nAssociation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 American Library Association,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 25, 2005.\n     Hon. Ron Wyden,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wyden: On behalf of the over 65,000 members of \n     the American Library Association (ALA) I am writing to \n     express our appreciation for your efforts to seek further \n     information about the nature and scope of FBI investigations \n     into library records. We thank you for your hard work \n     examining law enforcement activity in libraries under Section \n     215 of the USA PATRIOT Act, national security letters, and \n     ``discreet inquiries'' without, apparently, warrants or \n     subpoenas.\n       Librarians across the country, in all kinds of libraries, \n     take their jobs as public servants very seriously. We are as \n     concerned about our Nation's security as any other sector of \n     the American public. At the same time, the issue of privacy \n     and the confidentiality of library records is a long-held and \n     deep principle of our profession. The American public values \n     this principle as well: forty-eight States have laws \n     protecting the confidentiality of library records, and the \n     other two States have attorney general opinions doing so.\n       As you know, both the FBI and the Department of Justice \n     have reported that there has been ``zero'' use of Section 215 \n     in libraries. However, our office is aware, at least \n     anecdotally, of FBI inquiries made using other methods in \n     what do not appear to be normal criminal or civil \n     investigations. To determine the extent of these inquiries \n     ALA has begun its own research regarding the scope of law \n     enforcement investigations of library patrons and their \n     reading records.\n       Leaders of ALA have met with Attorney General Gonzales and \n     FBI Director Mueller to discuss our concerns about these \n     library-related investigations as well as to discuss our \n     ongoing research. We are seeking aggregated data to \n     understand better the breadth of FBI investigations and the \n     impact the investigations have on library users.\n       We very much appreciate your questions seeking further \n     information from Director Mueller about these inquiries. \n     Specifically, we would like to know:\n       What exactly is a ``discreet inquiry?''\n       Do these inquiries require a subpoena and are they subject \n     to any judicial oversight?\n       How many ``discreet inquiries'' have been made in the last \n     four years? 1 year? In general, what kind of evidence was \n     uncovered?\n       Have these inquiries been related only to foreign \n     intelligence investigations or have they been used in non-\n     intelligence investigations?\n       What are the procedures and authorization for such \n     inquiries?\n       Are there pertinent FBI guidelines and related oversight \n     procedures for assessing ``discreet inquiries'' and if so, \n     are there aggregated public reports on this type of inquiry?\n\n[[Page S6082]]\n\n       The American Library Association holds that privacy is \n     essential to the exercise of free speech, free thought, and \n     free association and that, in a library, the subject of \n     users' interests should not be examined or scrutinized by \n     others. Whether there has been one F.B.I. inquiry at \n     libraries on the reading habits of patrons or thousands, the \n     threat to the confidentiality of library records chills \n     library use by the public and threatens confidentiality in \n     other venues where privacy is the essence of the service/\n     relationship.\n       Thank you again for all your work on issues surrounding law \n     enforcement investigations in libraries and on the other \n     important provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act and related \n     regulations that affect the privacy and civil liberties of \n     the public. We support your efforts to address both the need \n     for effective law enforcement and the civil liberties of the \n     American public in an appropriate and proportional manner.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Lynne E. Bradley,\n                          Director of OGR, ALA--Washington Office.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, no one is saying the FBI should not be \nallowed to conduct voluntary interviews. A voluntary interview is \ncertainly a legitimate and often nonintrusive investigative technique. \nBut the FBI agents must not be out there in effect demanding the \nrecords of our citizens without following proper legal procedures. \nSince the FBI has been so reluctant to discuss the activities relating \nto these discreet inquiries of libraries, the PATRIOT Act should \nrequire the Bureau to report on this topic. At a minimum, they should \nbe required to tell the Congress how this information is being used so \nthe Congress can determine whether the FBI's use of this provision is \nappropriate.\n  In several other areas of the PATRIOT Act there should be \nmodifications. A major problem area, for example, is section 505 that \ndeals with national security letters. National security letters are \nanother way for FBI agents to obtain records. Unlike FISA warrants, \nnational security letters do not require the approval of a judge. The \nFBI has said the national security letters can be appealed, but the \ncurrent PATRIOT Act does not specifically discuss this. It is often \ndifficult for recipients to learn more about the requests in their \nletters and their right to refuse since they are usually barred from \ndiscussing the letter with anyone, including a lawyer.\n  In the recent case of Doe v. Ashcroft, the Federal judge found that \nthe FBI had abused this authority by using a national security letter \nto demand records from an Internet service provider without telling the \nprovider that the letter could be challenged or even that it could be \ndiscussed with a lawyer. Congress should reform the national security \nletter statute to make it clear that national security letters can be \nchallenged, that they can be discussed with a lawyer, and that anyone \nwho receives one has the right to be informed as to their rights. \nCongress certainly ought to consider adding sunset to this provision.\n  Section 206 authorizes the FBI to use roving wiretaps in national \nsecurity investigations. The roving wiretap authority allows the FBI to \ntap not just a particular phone but any phone the person being targeted \nmight use. Unlike criminal investigations, there is not even a \nrequirement for the FBI to make sure that the person being investigated \nis using a line. If a suspected terrorist worked in a warehouse, roving \nwiretap authority could be used to tap a pay phone in that warehouse, \nand every person who used that phone could have their conversations \nsecretly recorded. This provision, in my view, again, should be \nmodified, and the sunset should definitely be renewed so the Congress \nhas more time to investigate how it has been used.\n  Finally, some of the tricky wording in several places of the PATRIOT \nAct needs to be clarified. A provision that looks like a safeguard for \ncivil liberties may expose Americans to unfair scrutiny when they \nexercise their rights. In several places, the PATRIOT Act prevents the \nuse of various investigative techniques when the investigation is based \nsolely on the first amendment activities of U.S. persons. Our \ncolleague, Senator Levin, has pointed out that simply saying ``solely'' \nwithout clarification can create problems and seems to indicate that it \nis acceptable to investigate Americans largely or even primarily on the \nbasis of their first amendment activities. I am not convinced this \nsafeguard is actually a safeguard. I hope it will be clarified and \nstrengthened throughout the consideration of the PATRIOT Act.\n  The Intelligence Committee may finish drafting a reauthorization of \nthe PATRIOT Act in the near future. My sense is the Judiciary Committee \nwill move shortly afterward. It is possible other committees may wish \nto weigh in on these portions of the PATRIOT Act that fall under their \njurisdiction. As we go forward in this debate, as the Congress proceeds \nto try to walk on that high wire, striking a balance between fighting \nterrorists ferociously while protecting our civil liberties, I simply \nsay to the Senate this afternoon that the Senate can do better. It is \npossible, for example, to give the FBI additional emergency power, \npower that should address the concerns they have raised in the open \nhearings, without removing the independent checks so necessary in \ncircumstances that are not emergencies.\n  The bottom line is, let's make sure law enforcement has the tools \nthat are necessary to fight terrorism, to protect the people of our \ncountry, but not hang up a sign on this PATRIOT Act reauthorization \nthat says: You hereby have a right to go on any fishing expedition you \ndesire.\n  The Senate can do better. The job of creating a more balanced \nprotector of security and civil liberties still has work ahead of us. I \nlook forward to working with our colleagues on a bipartisan basis to \nachieve those ends.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, as I understand, the Democrats have until \n4 p.m. to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The time is to speak \non the nomination.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Excellent. Mr. President, I am going to speak about the \nnomination of Janice Rogers Brown. Before I go into the reason I hope \nthe Senate will reject this nomination--and the ``reasons'' because \nthere are many--I wish to put into context for my colleagues, and for \nanyone watching this debate, why the Senate has spent so much time \nlooking at the rules surrounding the nomination and confirmation of \nFederal judges.\n  It is very clear when you vote to confirm a Federal judge that it is \na very important vote. Why is that? It is because these judges really \nvote on so many issues of importance to us, whether it is our right to \nvote, our right to a safe workplace, our right to privacy, our consumer \nrights--it goes on and on--our victims' rights. The fact is, these \nissues are crucial, and who winds up on the bench on Federal courts is \nvery important to the American people.\n  This is not an abstract debate about Senate rules and procedures; it \nis really about who sits on the courts, and why is it that for 200-plus \nyears the minority party has had the right to filibuster or delay the \nvote on nominees who they believe are outside the mainstream--whether \nthat means they are to the far right of the mainstream, as in this \nparticular case, or to the far left of the mainstream.\n  Presidents who have tried to pack the courts in the past, have tried \nto twist the arms of the court, have been rebuffed, from Thomas \nJefferson, once, to Franklin Delano Roosevelt, another time, when FDR \nhad 74 Democrats in this Chamber. He could do anything he wanted, if \nthey agreed. He had won his election by 60 percent of the votes. He \ndecided he did not like what the courts were doing, so he said: Well, I \nwant to double the size of the courts. He had the votes. But the \nDemocrats in the Senate said: Mr. President, we like you. We love you. \nWe think you are a great President. But we will not allow you to pack \nthe courts because the bottom line is that our Founders did not want a \nruler, they wanted someone to govern. They did not want a ruler, they \nwanted someone to govern. Therefore, they believed very strongly in \nchecks and balances and the rights of the minority so that we do not \nhave a court system that has on it people who would be so far out of \nthe mainstream as to disrupt the very fabric of our country.\n  Now, this President did his own move to pack the courts. Let's face \nit, that is\n\n[[Page S6083]]\n\nwhat happened. He had the agreement and acquiescence of almost a \nmajority of the Senate, until a few brave Republicans came over to our \nside and said: Look, let's step back from this precipice. Let's not do \naway with the filibuster. These are lifetime appointments. These judges \nget good pay, and they are never up for election. This is the only \ncheck and balance we have, when their names are brought before us.\n  So I was so appreciative of my colleagues on the other side for \nstanding up and saying: We are not going to change the rules of the \ngame in the middle of the game because some President wants to pack the \ncourts with people who are so far out of the mainstream that it could \nset our country back for generations. That is what really happened.\n  Now, in order to get that deal they came up with, they said to our \nside: You are going to have to give. You are going to have to give on \nthree judges whom you have stopped. This 10 on the chart represents the \nnumber of judges Democrats have stopped. They said: In order to get \nthis deal, you have to give up on three. One of those three judges is \nJanice Rogers Brown, a nominee way out of the mainstream, to the \nextreme, which I will explain.\n  But we have to remember this deal only involves the vote to end the \nfilibuster. We said: OK, enough of our colleagues will join with you to \nend the filibuster. But the deal did not say: Therefore, she would get \nautomatically voted in. We still have the up-or-down vote on Janice \nRogers Brown. A lot of us believe very strongly that 51 of us should \noppose this nomination. I think we might well get those 51 noes, or \nclose to it, but, obviously, we are pushing for 51.\n  Now, again, I want to focus your attention on these numbers: 208 to \n10. It is actually 209 to 10 with the Priscilla Owen judgeship \napproved. We have stopped 10. We have approved 209. And this President \nand the Republicans here have been crying every morning that they do \nnot get 100 percent of what they want. They have gotten 95 percent of \nwhat they want. It is not good enough. When you want all the power, it \nis not good enough.\n  When I go home and look in the eyes of my constituency, I ask: If you \ngot 95 percent in your course, would you be happy? Oh, yes. If you got \n95 percent of what you wanted from your spouse, would you be happy? Oh, \necstatic. If you wrote a list down of everything you wanted in your \nlife--where you wanted to go for a vacation, where you wanted to be \neducated, the kind of car you wanted--and at the end of the day you got \n95 percent of what you wanted, you would be thrilled, except if you \nbelieve you deserve 100 percent, by God, and nothing less will do. That \nis what we are facing with this Republican power grab. That is what we \nare facing.\n  Remember those numbers: 209 to 10. When you are out somewhere and \nsomebody says: Well, aren't the Democrats blocking all these judges? \nNo, no, no. Ten; and we approved 209.\n  Now, I am going to show you in just a moment the list of the groups \nthat oppose Janice Rogers Brown to be put on the DC Circuit Court of \nAppeals. Now, when you see these groups, you will be shocked because I \nthink everybody knows by now that Janice Rogers Brown is the daughter \nof a sharecropper. We have heard that over and over again, and that is \nremarkable. We have a lot of remarkable stories in America.\n  My own mother never even went to high school. I am in the Senate. She \nhad to drop out to support her family. There are lots of stories like \nthat. But I do not expect people to automatically support me because in \nmy family I went to the Senate and my mother never graduated from high \nschool. It is interesting and it is important, and it certainly says a \nlot about our country and the opportunity our country affords people \nsuch as Janice Rogers Brown and Barbara Boxer, and particularly people \nof color, women of color who have even a harder time.\n\n  It is a miraculous country we live in. That is why I oppose her \nnomination, because she would set it back. It is not her life that I \nattack when I say I am not for Janice Rogers Brown; it is what she will \ndo to your life. If you look at her record, you will see why the things \nshe will do to your life are things you would not want.\n  So I want you to listen to the groups that are opposed to Janice \nRogers Brown:\n  ADA Watch/National Coalition for Disability Rights; Advocates for the \nWest; AFL-CIO; Alliance for Justice; Alliance for Retired Americans; \nAmerican Association of University Women. I want you to think about why \nthese groups are opposed to her. Every one of them is opposed to her \nbecause they have read her list of cases and they understand that she \nwill hurt them. Retired Americans, when you hear about what she thinks \nabout seniors, you will understand that.\n  American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees; \nAmerican Lands Alliance; American Planning Association; American \nRivers; Americans for Democratic Action; Americans United for \nSeparation of Church and State; Amigos Bravos; Bazelon Center for \nMental Health Law; Center for Biological Diversity; Center for Medicare \nAdvocacy; Citizens Coal Council; Clean Water Council; Clean Water \nAction; Clean Water Action Council; Black Women Lawyers of Los Angeles; \nCalifornia Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League; California \nAssociation of Black Lawyers; Californians for Fair and Independent \nJudges; California Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO; California League of \nConservation Voters; California National Organization for Women.\n  Do we have more here?\n  California Native Plant Society; California Women's Law Center; \nCalifornians for Alternatives to Toxics; Chinese for Affirmative \nAction; Environmental Defense Center; Environmental Law Foundation; \nEquality California; John Muir Project; Coalition of Labor Union Women; \nCoast Alliance; Committee for Judicial Independence; Community Rights \nCounsel; Congressional Black Caucus; Defenders of Wildlife; Delta Sigma \nTheta Sorority; Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund; \nEarthjustice; Earth WINS; Endangered Species Coalition; Equal Justice \nSociety; Families USA; Feminist Majority; Friends of the Earth; Georgia \nCenter for Law in the Public Interest; Gray Panthers; Great Rivers \nEnvironmental Law Center; Leadership Conference on Civil Rights; Legal \nMomentum, formerly the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund; Northwest \nEnvironmental Advocates; NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund; Oil \nField Waste Policy Institute; People for the American Way; Planned \nParenthood Federation of America; Progressive Jewish Alliance; \nReligious Coalition for Reproductive Choice; Service Employees \nInternational Union; the Sierra Club; Southern Appalachian Biodiversity \nProject; the Foundation for Global Sustainability.\n  And I have some more to share with you. It is very rare to see such \nan outpouring of opposition to a court nominee.\n  Planned Parenthood Golden Gate; Planned Parenthood of Los Angeles; \nSan Bruno Mountain Watch; San Francisco La Raza Lawyers; SEIU Local 99; \nStonewall Democratic Club of Los Angeles; Unitarian Universalist \nProject Freedom of Religion; Western Law Center for Disability Rights; \nWomen Lawyers Association of Los Angeles; Women's Reproductive Rights \nAssistance Project; Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights of the Bay Area, \nNARAL Pro-Choice California; National Association of Women Business \nOwners, San Francisco Chapter; National Council of Jewish Women, \nCalifornia; National Council of Jewish Women, Los Angeles; National \nWomen's Political Caucus of California, which is a bipartisan \norganization; Pacific Institute for Women's Health; Mexican American \nLegal Defense and Educational Fund; Mineral Policy Center; NAACP Legal \nDefense and Educational Fund; NARAL Pro-Choice America; National \nAbortion Federation; National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium; \nNational Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the NAACP; \nNational Bar Association.\n  And there are more. This is remarkable. I needed this time to go \nthrough this extraordinary list, representing millions and millions of \nAmericans who are saying no to Janice Rogers Brown.\n  National Council of Jewish Women; National Council of Women's \nOrganizations; National Employment Lawyers Association; National \nCommittee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare--folks, when you \nhear what she\n\n[[Page S6084]]\n\nsays about Social Security, you will understand it, and senior \ncitizens--National Fair Housing Alliance; National Family Planning and \nReproductive Health Association; National Health Law Program; National \nOrganization for Women; National Partnership for Women and Families; \nNational Senior Citizens Law Center; National Urban League; National \nWomen's Law Center; Natural Heritage Institute; Natural Resources \nDefense Council; New Mexico Environmental Law Center; the Wilderness \nSociety; Union for Reform Judaism; Unitarian Universalist Association; \nUSAction; Valley Watch, Inc.; Washington Environmental Council; Western \nLand Exchange Project.\n  So that is a long list. That is a long list. There is a reason why \nthese organizations--many of which are nonprofit, many of which are \nbipartisan, many of which represent women, represent minorities, \nrepresent families, represent seniors, represent the environment, \nrepresent fairness in the judicial system--there are many reasons why \nthey oppose Janice Rogers Brown.\n  I hope if this debate on Janice Rogers Brown does nothing else, it \nsends a message to the American people that when the Democrats stood up \nand said no to 10 people--and, by the way, said yes to 209--said no to \n10 people--actually, now it is 9 people--they are people like \nthis. They are people like Janice Rogers Brown who are opposed by \nmainstream America.\n\n  At the end, I will read the editorials that are coming out across the \ncountry against Janice Rogers Brown. Packing the courts with people \nlike this will set our country back, and these organizations that have \nworked for so many years for fairness, for justice, for equality, for \nfairness in the workplace, for equal pay for equal work, for good \ntreatment in the workplace, to protect the air and water, know what \nthey are talking about.\n  Let's see some of the things that she has said in her lifetime on the \nbench. She said:\n\n       Where government moves in, community retreats, civil \n     society disintegrates, and our ability to control our own \n     destiny atrophies. The result is: Families under siege--\n\n  This is Janice Rogers Brown. This is what she thinks of America. This \nis what she thinks of the greatest country in the world--\n\n     families under siege; war in the streets; unapologetic \n     expropriation of property--\n\n  As someone who owns property, no one has ever tried to take it away \nfrom me. I don't know what her problem is--\n\n     the precipitous decline of the rule of law; the rapid rise of \n     corruption; the loss of civility; and the triumph of deceit.\n\n  She must hang out with some pretty tough people.\n\n       The result is a debased, debauched culture which finds \n     moral depravity entertaining and virtue contemptible.\n\n  This is Janice Rogers Brown's view of life in America. I didn't know, \nwhen we passed the seatbelt law or legislation to help the victims of \ndomestic violence, that our society disintegrated. But she thinks so.\n  She calls Supreme Court decisions upholding New Deal protections such \nas the minimum wage and the 40-hour workweek ``the triumph of our own \nsocialist revolution.'' I didn't know it was socialism to say that \npeople ought to work 40 hours, basically.\n  She accuses senior citizens of ``blithely cannibilizing their \ngrandchildren because they have a `right' to get as much free stuff as \nthe political system permits them to have.''\n  So she looks at grandparents like me as cannibalizing our \ngrandchildren. I ask every grandmother and grandfather in America to \noppose this woman getting on the bench. How can someone look at \ngrandparents as cannibals because they may think it is important to get \nthe Social Security and Medicare for which they paid into the system? \nIt is outrageous.\n  She declares:\n\n       Big government is . . . [t]he drug of choice--\n\n  Here she goes after everybody--\n\n     for multinational corporations, single moms, regulated \n     industries, rugged Midwestern farmers, and militant senior \n     citizens.\n\n  Every time I read that I think of the senior citizens I know getting \ndressed up in a military uniform and taking over the country. OK \neverybody, it is 12 o'clock, let's play bingo now.\n  She declares:\n\n       Big government is . . . [t]he drug of choice for militant \n     senior citizens, for single moms, for rugged Midwestern \n     farmers.\n\n  She takes them on, too. What is she thinking? I don't know any \nfarmers who believe big government is what they want in their lives.\n  She is bad on first amendment rights of individuals. She argued that \ne-mail messages sent by a former employee to coworkers criticizing a \ncompany's employment practices were not protected by the first \namendment. This was a young man who sent out a few e-mails during a \nvery long time period, and she said he had no right to free speech. He \ncouldn't do it. But the corporation could do it all day long.\n  This is showing you some of her decisions and her statements. She \nsaid a manager could use racial slurs against his Latino employees. Can \nyou imagine that? Using racial slurs in the workplace? That was fine \nwith Janice Rogers Brown.\n\n  She is way outside the mainstream. She argued that a city's rent \ncontrol ordinance was unconstitutional as a result of the revolution of \n1937. Believe me, most of the people who passed that ordinance weren't \nalive in 1937, so that is her other attack on the New Deal. She is way \nback. She has this thing about the New Deal, as if the New Deal is what \nwe are talking about today. Everyone agrees that what has survived of \nthe New Deal is very important wage and hour laws and protections and \nSocial Security. She is after it all.\n  She argued that a law that provided housing assistance to displaced \nelderly, disabled, and low-income people was unconstitutional. This is \nvery interesting because having been in local government myself, one of \nthe things that we try to do is help get housing for people who are so \nvulnerable. This is a law in San Francisco for the elderly, disabled, \nand low-income people. Who could you find who was more compelling to \nhelp than, say, an elderly woman, whom she calls a militant senior \ncitizen, who can barely stand up or look up from her walker?\n  She said San Francisco was ``turning into a kleptocracy'' and that \n``private property is now entirely extinct in San Francisco.''\n  This woman absolutely lives in a dream world to say something like \nthis. If you try to buy a home in San Francisco, you can buy it, if you \nhave $1 million. So I don't know what she is talking about. She makes \nthings up that fit her ideology. Imagine saying that providing housing \nassistance to displaced elderly, disabled, and low-income people has no \nchance of succeeding because it is unconstitutional. Her views stand \nalone as being so out of the mainstream.\n  Speaking of standing alone, I wanted to tell you about Janice Rogers \nBrown. She sits on the California Supreme Court where she has been \nsince 1996. She is on a court that has six Republicans and one \nDemocrat. She is a Republican. Follow this: She sits on a court that is \nmade up of six Republicans and one Democrat. You would think she would \nbe happy as a clam. No, she is not because those other Republicans, not \nto mention the one Democrat, don't see life through her eyes. She is so \noutside of the mainstream that she stood alone on court decisions 31 \ntimes. I am going to tell you of some of these cases where she stood \nalone.\n  She was the only member of the court to vote to overturn the \nconviction of the rapist of a 17-year-old girl because she believed the \nvictim gave mixed messages to the rapist. She was the only one on the \ncourt who stood on the side of the rapist. This is who George Bush \nwants to put on the bench so she can stand against your daughter? I \ndon't think we should do that. We should stand up and be counted on \nthis vote. We should not be standing with someone who supports a \nrapist. It is as simple as it gets.\n  She was the only member of the court to find that a 40-year-old woman \nwho was fired from her hospital job could not continue with her \nlawsuit. I want you to think for a moment of a 60-year-old woman with a \ngreat employment record--and I have to tell you, maybe it is my age, \nbut you are still going pretty strong at 60--and she was fired based on \nage discrimination. This is Janice Rogers Brown:\n\n       Discrimination based on age does not mark its victims with \n     a stigma of inferiority and second-class citizenship.\n\n  Really? The woman was fully employed, did a great job, was doing her\n\n[[Page S6085]]\n\nwork, was getting rewarded with a salary, and the next day she wakes \nup, and for no reason, she is fired. And Janice Rogers Brown says: That \nis not a stigma. That is no reason to feel bad. That is not a reason to \nfeel like a second-class citizen.\n  I beg your pardon. Six others on that court--five Republicans and one \nDemocrat--thought Janice Rogers Brown was off the wall. Her position \nsaying that age discrimination is not a stigma and, in fact, was \nreally not discrimination at all is contrary to State and Federal law. \nSo George Bush wants to elevate a woman who says essentially there is \nno such thing as age discrimination. Let's face it, that is the bottom \nline.\n\n  Someone can ask: Well, Senator, where did she say that? That is the \nresult of her ruling. She stood alone 31 times, and now George Bush \nwants to elevate her.\n  There were other times that she stood alone. This is how far out of \nthe mainstream she is. She was the only member of the court to oppose \nan effort to stop the sale of cigarettes to children. I say to every \nparent in America who may be listening to the debate, you don't want \nyour 10-year-old or 9-year-old or 11-year-old or 12-year-old to walk \ninto a supermarket to start smoking, which we know is devastating, \nwhich we know is addictive, which we do everything we can to stop our \nkids from doing. If you want your kid protected, then you tell George \nBush Janice Rogers Brown doesn't deserve to be elevated for that kind \nof decision.\n  This isn't the 1950s. I remember the 1950s where they used to say \ncigarettes are great for you. They are relaxing. They are wonderful. We \ngave them out free to people to tell them: Calm yourselves. This is \nterrific. You will live a long time.\n  The leading cause of cancer death among women is not breast cancer, \nit is lung cancer. In the meantime, she is saying: No, you can't stop \nthe sale of cigarettes to children in this particular case, which was \nthe case that came before her.\n  She was the only member of the court--remember, five Republicans and \none Democrat--who voted to strike down a State antidiscrimination law \nthat provided a contraceptive drug benefit to women. In the old days in \nthis country getting a contraceptive was illegal. It was the Supreme \nCourt eventually--and there is actually a 40th anniversary of this \ntomorrow, the Griswold case. Until the Griswold case, it was illegal to \nuse contraception in this country. The bottom line is, this case of the \nSupreme Court turned it around and said you can't stop something. So \nhere you have a situation where the State is saying you can't \ndiscriminate against women. You need to allow them to be covered with \nthis prescription drug contraception. Janice Rogers Brown says: Wait a \nminute. I am standing alone.\n  She was the only member of the court who said women can be \ndiscriminated against and their contraception does not have to be \nprotected.\n  Talk about going back. We are going back with this woman. She stood \nalone.\n\n       The only member of the court to find that a county could \n     not sue a utility company for illegal price fixing that had \n     substantially increased the county's costs for natural gas.\n\n  Where has this woman been? Does she think about things like Enron? \nThe scams that went on in California and on the west coast? Maybe she \nshould go see that movie, ``The Smartest Guy in the Room,'' I think is \nthe name of it. It is a story about Enron and their manipulation of the \nmarket. Here you had a situation where a county was being run into \nbankruptcy because of the utility bills they were getting from a \nprivate utility. Every single justice on that court in California said \nabsolutely the county has a right to sue that utility company. They ran \nup the price of natural gas. They hurt consumers. They hurt the county. \nBut not Janice Rogers Brown. She stood with the utility company.\n  Are you getting the picture here of someone who deserves a promotion? \nI hope not because I don't think she does. I hope that what I am doing \ntoday is making the record clear that when we stood up against these 10 \njudges--although in essence now 9--she was one of them for a reason. It \nis not happy for me to have to go against someone from my own State. It \nis not enjoyable for me to have to go against somebody who is a woman \nwhose life story is remarkable. It is not easy for me to have to take a \nstand against a minority woman, and it is not easy for every civil \nrights organization in this country to do the same. But we need to know \nwhat we are doing.\n  This President has to get a message. This could have been avoided if \nhe had sent his people to see the Senators, which is the way it used to \nbe done. Do you think it is OK to give this woman a promotion? No. \nLet's talk. Can we talk? Can I show you this research? Can I show you \nhow many times she stood alone, how she is bad for families, how she is \nhorrific for senior citizens, how she has ruled against consumers, how \nshe stood with the rapist? Can I show you? We never got the chance.\n  This President doesn't believe in advice and consent. He does not \nbelieve in it. He looks at it as an annoyance. He should read the \nConstitution. Senators are supposed to be giving advice and consent--\nadvice at the front end, consent when we have the vote. But, no, they \nwant 100 percent. They want to pack the courts. They want to pack the \ncourts with people who will hurt average Americans and stand up for the \nspecial interests and the far rightwing of this country.\n  That is not what this President said he was going to do. I remember \nthe day when he declared victory in 1992 and the Supreme Court gave him \nhis seat. He came out in a most humble way, he said: I will govern from \nthe center.\n  I believed him at that point; I honestly did. And then you have a \nnomination like this, and you just wonder were those empty words? I \nhave to say they were because you have to judge people not by their \nwords, but by their deeds. You have to judge this judge by her \ndecisions. She was standing alone 36 times in a court of 6 Republicans \nand 1 Democrat. We have some more.\n\n       The only member of the court to find that a State fair \n     housing commission could not award certain damages to housing \n     discrimination victims.\n\n  Imagine that. This is a minority woman, and she doesn't understand in \nher heart how it must feel to be discriminated against when you are \nlooking for housing simply because of the color of your skin or perhaps \nyour religion. It is stunning. It is absolutely stunning to me. The \nonly one to stand alone on this court.\n  So I am going to close with--wait, there is more. We have a few more \nof these ``only times to stand alone.''\n\n       The only member of the court to find that a jury should not \n     hear expert testimony in domestic violence cases about \n     battered women's syndrome.\n\n  You all know what battered women's syndrome is. It is a situation \nwhere a woman has been beaten and beaten and abused and abused--\nsometimes to a pulp. And it impacts her actions toward her abuser. She \nwas the only member of the court to find that a jury should not hear \nexpert testimony dealing with Battered Women's Syndrome.\n  Well, to me, that says she stands with the batterer against the \nwoman, against the victim. I have colleagues here who want, and \nsupport, an amendment to the Constitution to give rights to victims. \nYet, they are going to vote for this woman who stood with a rapist and \nwho stood on the side of batterers. It doesn't make sense.\n  This woman does not deserve to be promoted for standing against the \nvictims of violence and with the perpetrators of violence, and she \nstood alone.\n\n       The only member of the court who dissented from a decision \n     that a standard worker's compensation claim did not bar her \n     civil claim for sexual harassment.\n\n  That makes absolutely no sense. You go to work and you sign \ndocuments. One of them is a workers' comp release form. They are forms. \nThen this person finds out there is sexual harassment in the workplace, \nand she brings a lawsuit to stop it, and Janice Rogers Brown says: \nWell, the day you came to work and filled out all your forms, you said \nyou would not file a workers' comp claim.\n  Workers' comp is not a civil remedy for sexual harassment, in my \nopinion. Workers' comp is getting hurt on the job; it is not sexual \nharassment. She stood alone. I am sure her colleagues on the court were \nstunned, but that is Janice Rogers Brown. She stands alone against \nvictims and with the perpetrators of violence and harassment.\n\n\n[[Page S6086]]\n\n\n       The only member of the court to find nothing improper about \n     requiring a criminal defendant to wear a 50,000 volt stun \n     belt while testifying.\n\n  This is amazing. She thought: Oh, no, wear a 50,000-volt stun belt. \nAnd every other judge on the court said: No, no, no, this is America. \nWe don't do that here. But not Janice Rogers Brown because she is so \nout of the mainstream.\n\n       The only member of the court to find that a disabled worker \n     who was the victim of employment discrimination did not have \n     the right to raise past instances of discrimination that had \n     occurred.\n\n  So here you have a disabled victim. She had multiple sclerosis. So I \nsay to those who have a disability or to those who have compassion in \ntheir heart, you have a string of examples of how you were \ndiscriminated against. Janice Rogers Brown said: Oh, no, that is not \nadmissible. We don't want to know about it. She stood alone. She is bad \nfor workers, for victims, and the disabled. That, I think, completes \nour work on when she stood alone. I am going to close, in the few \nminutes I have remaining, with some editorials to show the broad range \nof comments about Janice Rogers Brown. I am going to lead off with \nGeorge Will, a very conservative columnist, as I think most of my \ncolleagues know. He talks about the deal that was cut on the \nfilibuster, and he says:\n\n       Janice Rogers Brown is out of that mainstream.\n\n  It is a fact, he is calling her out of the mainstream. This is George \nWill, and there is not much room on his right. So that is interesting.\n  The MercuryNews:\n\n       As an appellate judge who would hear the bulk of challenges \n     of Federal laws coming out of Washington, her appointment \n     would be disastrous.\n\n  I want you to know, the MercuryNews is in Silicon Valley. The \nMercuryNews is very balanced. The MercuryNews is very moderate. They \nsay her appointment would be disastrous.\n\n       She'd be likely to strike down critical environmental, \n     labor laws, and antidiscrimination protections. Brown, \n     though, has infused her legal opinions with her ideology, \n     ignoring higher court rulings that should temper her \n     judgment.\n\n  That is a scathing editorial of this nominee.\n\n       The issue isn't Brown's qualifications--\n\n  The Sacramento Bee says--\n\n     it's her judicial philosophy.\n\n  This is the Sacramento Bee. This is California speaking to the rest \nof the country. We should be prideful, but we are not. We are upset \nabout this appointment. The issue is not her qualifications, it is her \nphilosophy.\n\n       The minority in the Senate certainly is justified in \n     filibustering a lifetime appointment of Brown. The Court of \n     Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is the last \n     place we need a judge who would impose 19th century economic \n     theory on the Constitution and 21st century problems.\n\n  How far back are we going to go?\n  I have to say to my colleagues who may be watching this or may be \ncoming back to the Hill today, we have an opportunity here to stand up \nfor the people of the United States of America. We have an opportunity \nto say no to someone--not that they do not have a wonderful life story, \nbut in spite of that life story because this appointment is not about \nher life, it is about our life, it is about your life, it is about the \nlives of your children, your grandchildren, your grandmother, your \ngrandfather.\n  This is an appointment that is out of the mainstream, so stated by \nGeorge Will. This is a woman who stood alone 31 times. You will hear my \ncolleagues on the other side say: Don't listen to Senator Boxer, her \nexplanation of these cases is inaccurate. But I have to tell you, it is \naccurate. When you have a woman who is a Republican who stood alone \nagainst five other Republican mainstream judges 31 times, who dissented \nmore than a third of the time in a courtroom such as this, you know you \nare looking at someone who does not deserve a promotion.\n  I am going to keep talking about this nomination. We are going to \nhave a press conference with all of these groups that we can manage to \nmuster, and we are going to be very strong to our colleagues in saying, \nyes, we are not filibustering Janice Rogers Brown--we gave that up as \npart of the deal we made so that we would not see filibusters \noutlawed--but we are going to fight to see that she does not get the 51 \nrequired votes.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask the question: How did a wonderful \nperson and a wonderful nominee, such as Judge Janice Rogers Brown, \nbecome so controversial? What is it that is going on here?\n  She served 8 years on the California Supreme Court. She has served on \nthe Third Appellate District Court of Appeals of California. Every \nmember of that court of appeals with whom she has served has written in \nsupport of her nomination. She was reelected to the California Supreme \nCourt with 76 percent of the vote. I think there were four other judges \non the ballot. She had the highest vote of any of those judges. \nCalifornia is certainly not a right-wing State.\n  She grew up in my home State of Alabama, not too far away from my \nhometown in a small town area of Greenville, AL. She is the daughter of \na sharecropper. A sharecropper is a person who does not own land but \nfarms a part of somebody else's property. He pays the landowner with \nsome of the produce and keeps a little of the produce for himself and \nhis family. That is how she grew up. Somehow, as a teenager, she moved \noff to California, worked her way through college and then law school.\n  She then worked for the attorney general's office of the State of \nCalifornia in which she represented the State on appeals of criminal \ncases. She wrote the briefs, she argued the legal questions, she \nparticipated in the trials of criminal cases, but I think most of her \ntime was spent writing the appellate briefs to the court of appeals.\n  By the way, of course, supreme court justices, like appellate judges, \ndo not try cases, like the big cases we see in the newspapers. They \nsimply review the trial record of cases that have been tried.\n  They determine whether a fair trial occurred and whether the judgment \nshould be affirmed or reversed and a new trial held, that sort of \nthing. That is what she has been doing on the California Supreme Court. \nThat is exactly what she would do if she were appointed to the court of \nappeals in the DC Circuit.\n  Her judicial philosophy is absolutely mainstream. She agrees with the \nPresident of the United States, President George W. Bush. She is in \nharmony with his view of the role of courts and the rule of law in \nAmerica. Make no mistake, this is a big question. He campaigned on that \nissue around the country. President Bush talked about the courts and \nabout the role of courts in America. He talked about what we should do \nto strengthen the rule of law in this country, how important it was to \nhim, and he promised to appoint judges who would show restraint and not \nutilize their opportunity on an appellate bench to redefine the meaning \nof words, to have it say what they want it to say so they can impose \ntheir political views through a court ruling.\n  He said, I do not believe in that kind of jurisprudence. In fact, it \nhas not been the heritage of our country for 200 years, but in recent \nyears it has become the vogue in law schools and in certain areas of \nthe country, California being one of them, frankly, to have an activist \njudiciary.\n  Judges are praised for being bold and stepping out. We had one judge \nunder President Clinton who was confirmed to the court of appeals from \nCalifornia. He had been in the court system and he said, well, it is \nthe duty of a judge to act when the legislature would not act. That is \nwhat the definition of activism is, a judge who believes he has a duty \nto do something if he thinks the politically accountable bodies in our \ncountry do not; that it is perfectly all right for a judge to act if \nthe legislature does not act.\n  I will tell America, and this is important, when a legislature does \nnot act, it made a decision not to act, and those legislators are \nresponsible to the people. If they are irresponsibly failing to deal \nwith a problem, they will be removed from office eventually.\n  A Federal judge is given a lifetime appointment. They are not \naccountable to the public. We cannot cut their salary. So what we need \nis judges who understand the role of the judiciary in\n\n[[Page S6087]]\n\nthe American system. We need judges who show restraint and who \nunderstand that America is built on a political system and a \nconstitution that should be faithfully followed and the political \ndecisions ought to be made by those people in rooms such as this, in \nthe State legislatures and in the Congress. We are accountable to the \npeople who elect us.\n  Make no mistake about it, empowering judges to carry out political \nagendas is an anti-democratic act. It undermines the power of the \npeople of our country. Many of the complaints made against Janice \nRogers Brown are because she adopted and does believe in the view of a \njudiciary that the American people value, that President Bush values \nand that was affirmed in this past election when he won. That is what \nshe believes.\n  Now, the Court of Appeals in the Ninth Circuit Federal court in \nCalifornia a few years ago was reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court 27 \nout of 28 times. They reviewed 28 cases from that court and reversed it \n27 times. The New York Times said a majority of the members of the U.S. \nSupreme Court considered the California court to be a rogue circuit.\n  So this is not an itty-bitty matter. People have been saying, oh, \nthis is politics, this is Democrats and Republicans fussing and it is a \nlittle political discussion which does not amount to much, and what \ndoes it have to do with us.\n  Well, the truth is, the issue is simple, but it is far more important \nthan party politics. I am sure some in this body vote for political \nreasons and have not given a lot of thought to the judiciary and what \nis important, but we are dealing with the role of the judiciary in \nAmerica.\n\n  As a Senate, when we deal with confirmations, it is all right to ask \nsomebody about their political views or to look at their political \nviews, but we do not vote for and against nominees based on that. I \nvoted for 95 percent of President Clinton's nominees. I did not agree \nwith their political views on many things. I felt most of them who came \nthrough, certainly the ones I voted for, were committed enough to the \nrule of law that I could vote for them. Some I had doubts about, but I \ngave the President the benefit of the doubt and voted for them. A few I \nopposed.\n  What was the deal? It is not their politics that counts. It is their \njudicial philosophy. That is what counts. What is their view of the \nrole of a judge? What is their understanding of what law means in this \ncountry?\n  There are people who are teaching postmodernism in our law schools \ntoday. Some of them have been called advocates of the critical legal \nstudies idea. And what do they say? Nothing is really true; one cannot \nlook at a statute and interpret it. One can look at that statute and \nthey can make it say whatever they want it to say and justify that.\n  It is a dangerous philosophy. People have fought for our country, \ndied for our country, and in large part they died to preserve the rule \nof law. Maybe they did not even believe in the war, but they were \ncalled to go and they went and served their country because they were \nlegally called to serve. They did their duty. It has been the \ncornerstone of this country's strength since its founding.\n  As I travel the world, as I have the opportunity to do as a Senator \non occasion, I am more and more convinced that our legal system, our \nrespect for law, is what makes this country great. If someone signs a \ncontract, they can expect it to be enforced. If they do not pay their \nhouse note, someone will come and take the house. But because of that, \na person can borrow $200,000, a middle-class working American, and pay \nit back at 6 percent interest over 30 years. Now, tell me where that \nhappens in another place in the world?\n  It is part of the legal system that is so important, and we have a \ndangerous trend in this country. We have members of the U.S. Supreme \nCourt quoting the European Union as if that would affect how they \ninterpret a statute passed by a State legislature or the Congress or \nthe Constitution ratified in 1789. What possible value could that have? \nThis is a dangerous trend.\n  Judges are getting to the point where they feel they have to solve \ndifficult questions; that the legislatures cannot get them figured out \nquick enough to satisfy them so they want to solve them. It is not \ngood. It erodes public respect for the courts because more and more \nthey realize they are not deciding these cases on what the law says or \nwhat the Constitution says but what they think.\n  Who cares what they think? We do not pay judges to think. We pay \njudges to rule on the law.\n  It is a big deal and this is what it is all about. Do not make any \nmistake. The left understands it. They understand this absolutely, and \nthe courts have been the one branch of Government they have been \nutilizing to advance agendas the American people are not supportive \nof--in fact, oppose. But if someone can get a judge to say the \nConstitution says a marriage can be a union among whatever, then that \nis it. What does one do then? What does it take to have a \nconstitutional amendment? It takes a two-thirds vote of both Houses of \nCongress and three-fourths of the State legislatures. So judges have \ngreat power. If they abuse it, it is a big deal. I think that is why we \nare seeing the attack on a number of our nominees that I think is not \nfair. It goes beyond what is right. In fact, they have sort of become \npawns in this battle over the nature of our judiciary.\n\n  I have watched these groups closely over the years, and I have to \ntell you some of these leftwing groups that create these attack ads and \nattack pieces on these nominees ought to be ashamed of themselves. It \nis not legitimate or fair what they do. They dig into their records, \nevery statement they have ever made, their personal history, the cases \nthey have had, the speeches they have made, and they try to find \nanything they can. They will take one sentence. Maybe there are two \nparagraphs of qualifying explanation and they will take one sentence \nout of context and say that represents a certain thing and therefore \nthis nominee should be voted down.\n  But we are Members of the Senate. We are the ones who took an oath to \ndo our duty to enforce the Constitution, to fairly judge nominees the \nPresident sends up here. That is our responsibility. We cannot pass \nthat off to some group, some polling data, some newspaper editorial. So \nthey take a bit here, a bit there, a statement, a word, a case, a \ncircumstance--they take it out of context and distort it, many times \ndishonestly; dishonestly, many times deliberately doing so, to try to \ncreate a caricature of this nominee.\n  Then they ask the people of the Senate to vote against them. Vote \nagainst them. But we should not do that. That is not what the Senate \nshould be about.\n  Janice Rogers Brown sees things different from some people; \nparticularly, I guess, in California. She has a more classical \nunderstanding. She made a speech one time in which she questioned the \nvalidity of the welfare state and whether it helps people. So they say \nshe is against all poor people and welfare. She questioned overreaching \nregulations. They say she is against all regulations. She is a \nthrowback. She doesn't believe in any government regulation. Whereas \nshe has ruled on hundreds of cases affirming government regulations, \nfor Heaven's sake.\n  But some regulations do overreach. Is there any doubt about that? One \nof them dealt with rental property in California. The owner had long-\nterm leases and decided to convert them to short-term hotel work. He \nwanted to convert the building to a full-fledged hotel. Do you know \nwhat they told him in California? Well, we know this is your property, \nMr. Owner, but, you know, we want to help poor people and we want you \nto pay money to create low-income housing before you can do that. \nBefore you can do that you have to pay this money or create some other \nhousing. What kind of thing is this in America?\n  They say she doesn't believe in government regulations. That doesn't \nsound like a decent regulation to me. So she opposed that, citing \nSupreme Court precedent. I am going to tell you, the Constitution of \nthe United States provides someone's property cannot be taken from them \nwithout just compensation having first been paid. That is what the law \nis and what it ought to be. Private property is protected in our \nConstitution as much as free speech. The left talks about free speech, \nbut we will talk about a case or two that they have accused Justice\n\n[[Page S6088]]\n\nBrown of acting improperly on and all she was doing was affirming \nclearly and unequivocally the right of free speech in America. But the \nleft doesn't really believe in free speech. They have an agenda they \nwant to promote. It is big government in domination of our lives in any \nnumber of different ways.\n  I think this lady is a superb justice. She writes beautifully. She \ncares about America. She grew up in a land of segregation. They have \naccused her of not favoring civil rights. She has been discriminated \nagainst herself. She is an African American who was raised in \nsegregated Alabama and went off to California and had a tremendous \nsuccess story. The judges who write about her or lawyers who write \nabout her say she is brilliant, intellectually honest, always thinking \nto do the right thing. She speaks with clarity and integrity. She is \nhighly qualified. She doesn't agree with the leftwing agenda \npolitically and she said so, but that doesn't impact her legal \ndecisions. That is what is important: How do you rule in cases?\n\n  A judicial philosophy that shows restraint, let me say, is far less \ndangerous than a judicial philosophy that justifies expanding power. I \nthink this nominee, with her experience as a prosecutor and \nunderstanding criminal law will do an excellent job on the federal \nbench.\n  Some critics complain about her sole dissents. She was a sole \ndissenter in a death penalty case, saying that the lawyer was \ninadequate. No other person complained about her dissents, presumably \nbecause she was some rightwing person, but she believed this defendant \nhad not been properly defended by his lawyer, so she was the sole \ndissenter in that case.\n  She dissented in another case, a criminal case, in which a person was \nstopped because he was riding his bicycle the wrong way on a street, \nand she believed it was a racial profile stop. They didn't have a basis \nto stop that person to begin the search that resulted in the discovery \nof illegal drugs. That was a dissent, also. So what are these dissents \nabout? You don't dissent in America? Judges dissent all the time. Every \ntime you have a 5-to-4 decision of the U.S. Supreme Court you have four \ndissenters. There are many 8-to-1 decisions and one judge dissents. \nThat is nothing unusual.\n  Some of these dissents she participated in were joined in by liberal \nmembers of the California Supreme Court. Also, I think it is important \nfor us to note that in 2002 she was called on to write the majority \nopinion for the California Supreme Court more often than any other \nmember of that court. So how is she such an out-of-the-mainstream \nperson? She wrote more majority opinions in 2002 than any other member \nof the court. What happens is, when a court gets together and discusses \na case before they finally vote and make their opinion, they see how \nthe judges analyze the case. If it is a majority or a unanimous \ndecision one way, someone is selected to write the opinion for the \nmajority. If it is 5 to 4, someone is selected to write the opinion for \nthe five, the majority. Sometimes there will be four different \ndissents, maybe one dissent with all the rest joining in. Judges can do \nit any number of different ways.\n\n  This idea that she is out of the mainstream because she has dissented \non cases is a total mischaracterization of her record. They have gone \nback and dug through her records and tried to find numbers and ideas \nand concepts that put her in a bad light. They ignore the fact she \nwrote the majority opinion in 2002 in more cases than any other of the \nnine justices on the California Supreme Court.\n  There are a lot of different cases in which she has been criticized. \nA lot of great dissents have been issued in this country. There is the \ndissent of Justice Harlan in the separate but equal case of Plessy v. \nFerguson. Was that a good dissent? I think it was a good dissent.\n  By the way, in the zoning case her critics talk about, alleging that \nshe was taking an extreme position on that case, that vote in the \nCalifornia Supreme Court was 4 to 3. Only four judges were for it; \nthree were against it. She wrote the dissent. I thought it was a great \ndissent.\n  Several times, Senator Boxer and others have said Justice Janice \nRogers Brown said it was okay for Latinos to have racial slurs uttered \nagainst them in the workplace. That is a terrible charge. That is not \ntrue. Sometimes we wonder if there is a lawyer in this whole building. \nIs there anyone who knows how the legal system actually works? The case \nthey referenced was the Aguilar case. A court injunction or court order \nbarred a manager from using racial epithets in the future, raising \ngrave first amendment concerns to tell someone in our country, you \ncannot say something in the future. You can say what you said in the \npast was wrong and you can be sued for it, you can be put in jail, \nperhaps, if it amounts to a criminal action; but the courts in this \ncountry have always, as a result of free speech concerns, been very \nreluctant to enter into prior restraint, as the judges call it, to stop \nsomeone from saying something in the future. You pay a price if you say \nthe wrong thing in the future, but to order them never to say something \nis a very dangerous thing.\n  The court split on that case, 4 to 3. Yes, she was a dissenter, but \nalso dissenting with her in that case was the liberal icon of \nCalifornia jurisprudence, Stanley Mosk, her colleague on the bench. \nThis was a 4-to-3 decision representing a very important idea. She \nspecifically condemned the language. She said people could be sued, \nthey could have penalties imposed. She was concerned about a court \ninjunction saying to somebody, they could not say certain words in the \nfuture. That is what the question was. Any legal scholar in this \ncountry would agree that is a difficult matter. We ought to be careful \nbefore we pass injunctions saying people cannot say something. A \nprominent liberal jurist, Justice Mosk agreed with her on that point, \nas did three of the justices on that court.\n  One of the things one of the groups has attacked her about, and I \ndon't know if the Senators have raised it yet--I wouldn't be surprised, \nis the use of stun belt on a criminal defendant in court.\n  We are familiar with the recent case in the Atlanta, GA, courthouse, \nwhere a violent defendant overpowered the guard, took a gun, shot a \nbunch of people, ran off. There was a national uproar over what to do \nabout it, why that shouldn't have happened, and how we ought to take \nsteps to prevent this in the future. That was a good, healthy debate.\n  There is a device called a stun belt that can be placed on a \ndefendant. Simply by pushing a button, apparently, one can immobilize a \nsubject wearing a stun belt.\n\n  In recent years, we cannot bring criminals into the courtroom in \nprison garb. You cannot bring a prisoner in a courtroom and sit them \nbefore a jury in handcuffs. That would bias the jury, the courts have \nsaid, in their effort to be fair to defendants.\n  I was a prosecutor; I remember when that started happening. So we had \nto sit them up there in the witness box without any chains or \nhandcuffs. You never knew what they were going to do. There were \nmarshals and sheriff's deputies standing on alert to see if this guy \nwas going to make a break.\n  They came up with this idea to put a stun belt around a defendant, \nunder their clothes, that could not be seen. This guy was referred to \nas being psychotic, violent, dangerous in any number of ways and the \nCalifornia Supreme Court said, you cannot make him wear it. It made him \nnervous.\n  I hate to say that was a silly opinion, but it was, in my view. I bet \nif the decision was made after the Atlanta courtroom incident, they may \nnot have ruled the same way. But one justice on that court saw it \ncorrectly: Janice Rogers Brown. She dissented from that decision. That \nwas the right thing to do. Absolutely the right thing to do. I salute \nher for it. She should not be voted down for those issues.\n  There are many of these examples of distortions of her record we \ncould talk about. One interesting case in which Justice Brown authored \na majority opinion deals with the question of affirmative action. It is \nthe kind of case that gets someone in trouble with certain leftwing \ngroups in this country but is consistent with the law of America and \nthe law of the State. She did the only thing appropriate. It is the \nHigh-Voltage Wireworks case. In this case, the California Supreme Court \nunanimously concurred in Justice Brown's opinion.\n  They say she does not believe in affirmative action, quotas, and \nthings of\n\n[[Page S6089]]\n\nthat nature. This is one of the cases they cite. It was a unanimous \nsupreme court decision case. It demonstrates her ability to follow the \nConstitution and Federal law.\n  California proposition 209 was passed by the people of California. It \nadded a provision to the California Constitution that provided:\n\n       The states shall not discriminate against or grant \n     preferential treatment to any individual or group on the \n     basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in \n     the operation of public employment, public education or \n     public contract.\n\n  The people from California passed that.\n  There was a minority contracting program in San Jose that said \ncontractors bidding on city projects must utilize a specified \npercentage of minority and women contractors or document efforts to \ninclude minority and women contractors in their bids. Every judge who \nreviewed the case, including the trial, appellate, and supreme court, \nagreed that the San Jose program constituted preferential treatment \nwithin the meaning of proposition 209. Why, certainly it did.\n  Justice Brown's opinion demonstrates her firm commitment to the \nbedrock principles of civil rights. She noted:\n\n       Discrimination on the basis of race--\n\n  Remember, she is an African American.\n\n       Discrimination on the basis of race is illegal, immoral, \n     unconstitutional, inherently wrong, and destructive of \n     democratic society.\n\n  Contrary to the assertions of liberal smear groups, Judge Brown is \nnot opposed flatly to all affirmative action programs in all \ncircumstances. She has specifically acknowledged that ``equal \nprotection does not preclude race conscious programs.'' Certain race-\nconscious programs can be approved under the law. And she favorably \ncites Supreme Court decisions establishing the affirmative duty to \ndesegregate where there has been a showing of a prior discrimination, \nthat you can issue orders, then, if there has been a proof of \ndiscrimination.\n  She provided a historical discussion of all of American equal \nprotection law. It was part of an extremely well-reasoned opinion. But \nit has made some of those on the left unhappy, you see, because she is \nnot in lockstep for all these items, she is not in agreement with \neverything. She thinks there are limits to what the Government can do \nin this area, and should do, consistent with the Constitution of the \nUnited States.\n  There are many other cases she has ruled on. I will simply add this, \nin conclusion, that she has been a sterling justice, a justice who \nbelieves in law. She has approached each case she has dealt with from a \nperspective of trying to find out what the law is and how to do the \nright thing about it. She has courage and had the courage to stand up \nin the face of a legal system that has not been supportive of classical \nunderstandings of how we interpret statutes, how we enforce the law, \nand what the law means. She has been in an agenda-driven environment \nwhere judicial activism is more prominent in certain areas of the \ncountry. The fact she has dissented and has raised questions to defend \nprivate property and to question turning criminals loose on a rapid \nbasis, as some have, and those kinds of things, speak well of her.\n  What is important mostly is that she has a judicial philosophy that \nis consistent with the judicial philosophy our country has had, our \nheritage of law. That is what she believes in. That is what she has \ngiven her life and career to. She loves the law, and she cares about \nit. She cares about it enough to speak out if she thinks things are \ngoing wrong. Her views are consistent with the American people. \nPresident Bush campaigned on these issues aggressively in this last \nelection. He won 52 percent of the vote. It is the first time in many \nyears a Presidential candidate received over half the votes in this \ncountry. I think if you took on the question of judicial activism and \nthe feeling of the American people with regard to judges who exceed \ntheir bounds of power and start legislating from the bench rather than \nmaking decisions, he would have had much higher support.\n  Senators who joined this body defeating incumbents or winning open \nseats--the winners of those seats--consistently have been Senators who \nhave talked to the people of their States about the problem of an \noverreaching judiciary and the need to make sure the judges we have are \ntalented, smart, proven men and women of integrity and ability, but men \nand women who will show restraint on the bench, who will follow the law \nas written, even if they may not personally agree with it. Because if \nthey want to write the laws, they ought to run for office and see if \nthey can get elected. Maybe the reason people who got elected did not \npass a law they wanted is because the American people did not want that \nlaw, their constituents did not want it, and that is why they did not \npass it. So they are not empowered to impose their personal views by \nsubtly manipulating words and language and phrases and other things to \nmake the case come out the way they want it to come out. That is not \nwhat they are empowered to do.\n\n  I think Janice Rogers Brown represents the classical view of law, the \nmainstream view of law, which I will admit is under attack today in \nthis country. It was a big issue in the campaign. President Bush took \nhis case to the American people, and he was reelected on it. That was a \nbig issue in his election. There is no doubt about it. The American \npeople want judges with the philosophy of Justice Rogers Brown, her \nlegal philosophy. What she says politically somewhere in a speech is \nnot important, as long as her judicial philosophy is such that she \nshows and has demonstrated she will be faithful to the Constitution and \nto the law, whether or not she agrees with it.\n  That is what we in the Senate need to be doing in our confirmation \nprocess. We need to ask ourselves: This may be a view by a nominee I \nagree with or I do not agree with, but will they enforce the law? \nBecause we cannot expect every nominee to agree with us on our \nreligious values, our moral values, or our political beliefs. Judges \nare not expected to do that. You do not expect that. It is not running \nfor office. They are not going to be voting on these things. You want \npeople who understand the law and who will be fair and show \nintelligence and diligence and a determination to get it right. That is \nwhat she said in her testimony. She said: My goal is to get it right.\n  I believe this is a good nominee. I believe she will be a tremendous \naddition to the Court of Appeals for the United States. I am proud she \nis a native of my home State, and I am honored to have these moments to \nspeak on her behalf.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I was talking about Justice Janice \nRogers Brown and her record of courage and ability on the Supreme Court \nof California.\n  I note an article by Nat Hentoff. It is in the Jewish World Review. \nMr. Hentoff is a noted civil rights lawyer, of courage and \nindependence, who writes with clarity and is a civil libertarian who \nbelieves in American civil liberties, who has a long record of it. He \nis not someone who is slavishly part of any political agenda and is \nwilling to speak the truth wherever he sees it. Sometimes I agree with \nit; sometimes I don't. But he has written an article about the \nfilibuster of Janice Rogers Brown. He talks about the ``Action Alert'' \nfrom the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People \nthat ``accuses [Janice Rogers Brown] of having extreme right-wing \nviews'' and ``issuing many opinions hostile to civil rights.''\n  She has been a victim of civil oppression and segregation. She is a \ntrue champion of civil rights, as I think I indicated in my remarks.\n  He goes on to show ``how prejudicially selective the prosecution of \nher is by the Democrats, the NAACP, People for the American Way, and \nher other critics.''\n  He says:\n\n       To my knowledge, not one of her attackers has mentioned the \n     fact that in the case of\n\n[[Page S6090]]\n\n     People v. McKay, Brown was the only Supreme Court justice to \n     instruct her colleagues on the different standards some \n     police use when they search cars whose drivers are black:\n\n  This is Justice Brown's quote:\n\n       There is an undeniable relation between law enforcement \n     stop-and-search practices and the racial characteristics of \n     the driver. . . . The practice is so prevalent, it has a \n     name: ``Driving While Black.''\n\n  Does that sound like somebody who is hostile to civil rights? He goes \non to criticize the Action Alert and the selective comments that are \nmade there.\n  He says:\n\n       Sen. Ted Kennedy has accused Justice Brown of hostility not \n     only to civil rights but also to ``consumer protection.'' But \n     in Hartwell Corp. v. Superior Court (2002), she declared that \n     water utilities could be sued for having harmful chemicals in \n     the water that result in injuries to the residents of the \n     State who drink that water. Also in People ex rel. Lungren v. \n     Superior Court, Justice Brown affirmed the authority of \n     California's attorney general to haul into court faucet \n     manufacturers who include lead in their faucets.\n       Another charge by the NAACP in its ``Action Alert'' is that \n     Justice Brown dissented from ``a ruling that an injunction \n     against the use of racially offensive epithets in the \n     workplace did not violate the First Amendment.''\n\n  Mr. Hentoff then says this:\n\n       I know this case--Aguilar v. Avis Rent A Car System Inc.--\n     well, having covered it from the beginning and interviewed \n     lawyers on both sides. Brown dissented from an astonishing \n     decision by the California Supreme Court that authorized the \n     trial judge to actually put together a list of words that \n     would be forbidden for all time in that workplace, even if \n     uttered out of the presence of employees.\n\n  That is what Mr. Hentoff says about this opinion of the majority that \nshe dissented from. He goes on to say:\n\n       This extreme gag rule on speech turned the First Amendment \n     upside-down because as Stanley Mosk, a much-respected civil \n     libertarian on that California Supreme Court, emphasized: \n     ``The offensive content of using any one or more of a list of \n     verboten words cannot be determined in advance.'' As Brown \n     said plainly and correctly: ``We are not dealing merely with \n     a regulation of speech, we are dealing with an absolute \n     prohibition--a prior restraint.'' This could ``create the \n     exception that swallowed the First Amendment.''\n\n  Do you see what we are talking about here?\n  That is what has been going on on the floor of the Senate that is so \ndistressing to me. Let's lay it out here on the table.\n  Justice Janice Rogers Brown, according to one of the great civil \nliberty lawyers in America, Nat Hentoff, was defending first amendment \nfree speech, joined by one of the most liberal members of the \nCalifornia Supreme Court to defend free speech. What did they accuse \nher of? They said that she approved of using racial slurs against \nHispanics. Now, that is beyond unfair. It is beyond unfair. It is \nbeyond decency and integrity, and it is not right. It is wrong. That is \nwhat we have been doing to nominees here to justify the opposition \nbecause fundamentally they believe in a classic rule of law and don't \nbelieve in judicial activism.\n  Hentoff goes on further and talks about another case.\n\n       As for this justice's hostility to civil rights and \n     liberties, there was her dissent in In Re: Visciotti in which \n     she declared the sentence of John Visciotti--convicted of \n     murder, attempted murder, and armed robbery--be set aside \n     because of his defense lawyer's incompetence. In another \n     capital murder case (In Re: Brown) she reversed the death \n     sentence of John George Brown because the prosecutor \n     subverted the defendant's fundamental right to due process by \n     not disclosing evidence that could have been exculpatory.\n       Not a word about those two cases was in the NAACP ``Action \n     Alert'' or the New York Times editorial [or the Sacramento \n     Bee].\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the article of \nMr. Hentoff of May 9, 2005, entitled ``Filibustering Janice Rogers \nBrown.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Jewish World Review, May 9, 2005]\n\n                   Filibustering Janice Rogers Brown\n\n                            (By Nat Hentoff)\n\n       Janice Rogers Brown of the California Supreme Court has \n     been the Bush nominee for a federal circuit court judgeship \n     facing particularly fierce resistance by Democrats and their \n     allies. For example, the April 26 ``Action Alert'' from the \n     National Association for the Advancement of Colored People \n     accuses her of ``having extreme right-wing views,'' issuing \n     ``many opinions hostile to civil rights.''\n       I do not agree with all of Justice Brown's opinions, but I \n     write this to show how prejudicially selective the \n     prosecution of her is by the Democrats, the NAACP, People for \n     the American Way and her other critics. She was filibustered \n     in the last Congress, and may be again, now having been sent \n     to the floor on a 10-to-8 party-line vote by the Judiciary \n     Committee.\n       To my knowledge, not one of her attackers has mentioned the \n     fact that in the case of People v. McKay (2002), Brown was \n     the only California Supreme Court justice to instruct her \n     colleagues on the different standards some police use when \n     they search cars whose drivers are black:\n       ``There is an undeniable correlation between law \n     enforcement stop-and-search practices and the racial \n     characteristics of the driver. . . . The practice is so \n     prevalent, it has a name: `Driving While Black.' ''\n       The three-page ``Action Alert'' I received from the NAACP \n     ignored that opinion, in which Brown added that while racial-\n     profiling is ``more subtle, more diffuse and less visible'' \n     than racial segregation, ``it is only a difference of degree. \n     If harm is still being done to people because they are black, \n     or brown, or poor, the oppression is not lessened by the \n     absence of television cameras.''\n       This is right-wing extremism? Yet, an April 28 lead New \n     York Times editorial accuses Justice Brown of being ``a \n     consistent enemy of minorities (and is) an extreme right-wing \n     ideologue.''\n       Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) has accused Justice Brown of \n     hostility not only to civil rights but also to ``consumer \n     protection.'' But in Hartwell Corp. v. Superior Court (2002), \n     she declared that water utilities could be sued for having \n     harmful chemicals in the water that result in injuries to \n     residents of the state who drink that water.\n       Also in People ex rel. Lungren v. Superior Court (1996), \n     Justice Brown affirmed the authority of California's attorney \n     general to haul into court faucet manufacturers who include \n     lead in their faucets.\n       Another charge by the NAACP in its ``Action Alert'' is that \n     Justice Brown dissented from ``a ruling that an injunction \n     against the use of racially offensive epithets in the \n     workplace did not violate the First Amendment.''\n       I know this case--Aguilar v. Avis Rent A Car System Inc.--\n     well, having covered it from the beginning and interviewed \n     lawyers on both sides. Brown dissented from an astonishing \n     decision by the California Supreme Court that authorized the \n     trial judge to actually put together a list of words that \n     would be forbidden for all time in that workplace, even if \n     uttered out of the presence of employees.\n       This extreme gag rule on speech turned the First Amendment \n     upside-down because as Stanley Mosk, a much-respected civil \n     libertarian on that California Supreme Court, emphasized: \n     ``The offensive content of using any one, or more, of a list \n     of verboten words cannot be determined in advance.''

New York was \n     correctly decided?''\n       In that decision, which placed bakery owners' contract \n     rights over the health of workers and the health of buyers of \n     the company's products, the High Court ruled that employers \n     had the right to insist that their employees work unlimited \n     long hours, even if the public's health were to be endangered \n     because sick workers couldn't even take the day off.\n       If Justice Brown does indeed agree with that decision, \n     which was influential until President Roosevelt's New Deal, I \n     would have difficulty voting for her; but I would not \n     unjustly accuse her of having nothing in her record that \n     strongly upholds the interests of justice. She does not \n     deserve being stereotyped as an archetypical reactionary. And \n     her defense of the Fourth Amendment's protection of our \n     rights against government search and seizure are much \n     stronger than any current member of the Supreme Court.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. What kind of lady is this? She graduated from UCLA, one \nof our Nation's finest law schools. In February of 2004, the alumni of \nthat not-so-conservative law school presented Janice Rogers Brown with \nan award for public service. In recognizing Justice Brown, her fellow \nUCLA alumni, the people who know her, did not criticize her and say she \nwas an extremist. They didn't say anything like that. At UCLA law \nschool, where they gave her an award, they said:\n\n\n[[Page S6091]]\n\n\n       Janice Rogers Brown is a role model for all those born to \n     prejudice and disadvantage, and she has overcome adversity \n     and obstacles and, since 1996, has served as a member of the \n     California Supreme Court. . . . The professional training she \n     received at the UCLA School of Law has permitted her, even \n     now when decades remain to further enhance her career,--\n\n  Yes, we need to see her career be enhanced by this court of appeals \nappointment.\n\n     to have already a profound and revitalizing impact upon the \n     integrity of American jurisprudence.\n\n  I will repeat that. They said:\n\n      . . . even now, when decades remain to further enhance her \n     career, [she has been shown] to have already a profound and \n     revitalizing impact upon the integrity of American \n     jurisprudence.\n\n  I think that is a good description.\n\n       Despite her incredible intellect, work ethic, \n     determination, and resultant accomplishment, she remains \n     humble and approachable.\n\n  That is not the Janice Rogers Brown you hear her opponents describe. \nI will take the words of the people who know her and who have actually \nstudied her record over the rhetoric of special interest groups who are \nnot the least bit concerned, it seems to me, about being fair in their \ndescription of the nominee.\n  She spent 8 years as a deputy attorney general in the Office of the \nCalifornia Attorney General, where she prepared briefs and participated \nin oral arguments on behalf of the State's criminal appeals; she \nprosecuted criminal cases and litigated a variety of civil issues. Her \nkeen intellect and work ethic made her a rising star on the California \nlegal scene, and in 1994, Governor Pete Wilson tapped her as his legal \naffairs secretary. She served in that capacity until 1994, when she was \nnominated and confirmed as an associate justice on the California Third \nDistrict Court of Appeals. In May of 1996, to honor her for her \nsuperior performance on the appellate court, Governor Wilson elevated \nher to the California Supreme Court, where she has performed admirably.\n  Since she was appointed to the California Supreme Court, a couple of \nthings have happened which demonstrate she is doing her job and doing \nit well. During the 1998 elections, she was retained with 76 percent of \nthe vote, receiving a higher percentage of the vote than any other \njudge on the ballot and in 2002, she authored more majority opinions \nthan any other Justice on the Court.\n  The people of California who actually know the law and study the law \nand who have not been brainwashed by attack sheets that come out, by \nliberal groups, support her. For instance, Gerald Ullman, a California \nlaw professor, has expressed public support for this nominee. His \nstatement sums up what we ought to consider with regard to Justice \nBrown's nomination. Let me quote it:\n\n       Although I frequently find myself in disagreement with \n     Justice Brown's opinions, I have come to greatly admire her \n     independence, her tenacity, her intellect, and her wit. It is \n     time to refocus the judicial confirmation process on the \n     personal qualities of the candidates, rather than ``hot \n     button'' issues of the past. We have no way of predicting \n     where the hot button issues will be in years to come, and our \n     goal should be to have judges in place with a reverence for \n     our Constitution, who will approach these issues with \n     independence, an open mind, a lot of common sense, a \n     willingness to work hard and an ability to communicate \n     clearly and effectively. . . . Janice Rogers Brown has \n     demonstrated all these qualities in abundance.\n\n  That is what Professor Ullman said.\n  Her colleagues and former colleagues also support her. A bipartisan \ngroup of Justice Brown's current and former judicial colleagues, \nincluding all of her former colleagues on the Court of Appeals, Third \nAppellate District, and four current members of the California Supreme \nCourt, also have written in support of her nomination.\n  Twelve current and former colleagues noted in a letter to the \ncommittee that:\n\n       Much has been written about Justice Brown's humble \n     beginnings, and the story of her rise to the California \n     Supreme Court is truly compelling. But that alone would not \n     be enough to gain our endorsement for a seat on the Federal \n     bench. We believe that Justice Brown is qualified because she \n     is a superb judge. We who have worked with her on a daily \n     basis know her to be extremely intelligent, keenly \n     analytical, and a very hard worker. We know that she is a \n     jurist who applies the law without favor, without bias, with \n     an even hand.\n\n  That was sent to Chairman Orrin Hatch in October 2003.\n  Ellis Horvitz, a Democrat and one of the deans of the appellate bar \nin California, has written in support of Justice Brown, noting that:\n\n       In my opinion, Justice Brown [possesses] those qualities an \n     appellate judge should have. She is extremely intelligent, \n     very conscientious and hard-working, refreshingly articulate, \n     and possessing great common sense and integrity. She is \n     courteous and gracious to the litigants and counsel who \n     appear before her.\n\n  That was another letter to Chairman Orrin Hatch.\n  The praise for Justice Brown and her performance on the bench goes on \nand on. Sure, some do not agree with her politically, but they \nrecognize and appreciate her approach to jurisprudence. She is a \nrestrained jurist who refuses to change the definition of marriage or \nto strike down the Pledge of Allegiance or throw out the ``three \nstrikes and you are out'' law in California.\n\n  She is the kind of judge President Bush promised to support. Again, I \nthink she has done a terrific job on the Supreme Court of California. I \nam proud she is from Alabama. I am sorry the discrimination she \nbelieved she and her family faced in our State was, I am sure, part of \nthe reason they left Alabama to seek a fair life. She went to \nCalifornia and has taken advantage of the opportunities given her. She \nachieved a tremendous record. It is an honor for me to speak in support \nof her nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Alabama for his \nremarks. I did not hear them all, but he did say the record of Justice \nJanice Rogers Brown is compelling, and I agree with that. It is so far \noff the mainstream that one has to look at it compellingly. It is hard \nto believe, frankly, that the President nominated someone with these \nviews. I think it shows how far over and out of the mainstream the \nPresident's nominees are and, unfortunately, how much in lockstep the \nmajority in the Senate walks with these nominees.\n  I have no doubt that Justice Brown is smart and accomplished. Her \nrise from humble beginnings is impressive. That does not make somebody \nwho belongs on the second most powerful court in the land. Someone's \nrise from humble beginnings is very important, but it does not mean \nthey can run a major company. It does not mean they would be a great \nlineman or center or linebacker for the New York Giants. It is a \nwonderful thing, but it does not qualify them for the job.\n  Judge Janice Rogers Brown's humble rise cannot offset her radical and \nregressive approach to the law. I would argue that none of the views of \nthe nominees we have had so far are so off the charts as Janice Rogers \nBrown. None of what she has done in her life can mitigate her hostility \nto a host of litigants who have appeared before her. If someone is \npolite and then takes your argument and throws it out, even though the \nlaw is behind you, and leaves you hopeless, it does not mean they have \ndone a good job as a judge.\n  Janice Rogers Brown, on the merits, is the most out of the \nmainstream, the least deserving of all of the President's appeals court \nnominees. In a moment, I am going to review those reasons. Before I do, \nI want to ask a question that has been nagging me for a while: Why are \nso many self-described conservatives planning to vote for her? She is \nnot conservative, she is a radical. She is the opposite of a \nconservative. And why are moderate Senators on the other side of the \naisle boarding the Brown bandwagon when everything she believes is \nagainst what they believe?\n  Is it that this nominee, more than any other, embodies the \nconservative ideal for an appellate judge? Let's see what conservatives \ndescribe as what a judge ought to be.\n  This is the President and Republican leaders. They said a model judge \nshould be a strict constructionist, judicially constrained, and \nmainstreamed. Janice Rogers Brown is none of those, absolutely none. \nLet's take a look at the record.\n  Is she a proud and principled strict constructionist? Is that why the \nPresident and Republican leaders are pushing her? President Bush has \nsaid time and again that he wants judges who will not legislate from \nthe bench. He\n\n[[Page S6092]]\n\nsaid he wants strict constructionists in the mold of Antonin Scalia. \nBut Janice Rogers Brown is no more a strict constructionist than I am a \nsecond baseman for the New York Yankees. Anyone who says that the New \nDeal is a socialist revolution and ought to be undone, when we have had \n70 years, seven decades of law based on the construct of the New Deal; \nwhere 99 percent of America agrees--does that person belong on the \nbench? Absolutely not. The New Deal is a socialist revolution and ought \nto be undone--does anyone on this side of the aisle agree with that?\n  And then defend for me once, I would like to hear in all the debate \nwe had and will have on Janice Rogers Brown one person defending those \ncomments. The only person I heard is Orrin Hatch: Well, she tries to be \ninflammatory, or she tries to get people's attention. She has said \nthings such as this over and over.\n\n  If you believe the New Deal was a socialist revolution that ought to \nbe undone, you are not a strict constructionist. The legislature, the \nCongress, and the President, Democrats and Republicans, from 1932 on \nhave said the things we have done in the New Deal and built upon on the \nbasis of the New Deal ought to stay. Should one judge be able to undo \nthat? Then why are we voting for her? That is not strict \nconstructionism. That is not conservatism.\n  Listen to what a conservative commentator, Ramesh Ponnuru, wrote \nabout her in the National Review some time ago. The National Review is \na conservative publication.\n\n       Republicans and their conservative allies have been willing \n     to make lame arguments to rescue even nominees whose juris \n     prudence is questionable.\n\n  He continues to say--this is not my quote:\n\n       Janice Rogers Brown has argued there is properly an extra \n     constitutional dimension to constitutional law.\n\n  Those are her words.\n\n       She has said that judges should be willing to invoke--\n\n  And this is Mr. Ponnuru quoting Janice Rogers Brown, not me--\n\n       She has said that judges should be willing to invoke ``a \n     higher law than the Constitution.''\n\n  You can find a higher law to the Constitution if you so believe from \nthe far right, from the far left, maybe from the animal rights people \nor the vegetarians, but that is not what judges should do.\n  Take a look at her own words in a dissent involving a California \nproposition, proposition 209. In that case, which involved affirmative \naction, Justice Brown did not feel compelled to limit herself strictly \nto the language of that proposition. Instead, she decided that she \nshould ``look to the analytical and philosophical evolution of the \ninterpretation and application of title VII to develop the historical \ncontext behind proposition 209.''\n  This sounds like Justice Brennan or some of the very liberal judges \nthe conservatives decry. If you are going to make up your own law, are \nwe saying on the other side of the aisle, you are not a strict \nconstructionist if you want to make up your own laws to the left, but \nyou are a strict constructionist if you want to make up your own laws \nto the right? As somebody who believes deeply in moderation on the \nbench, I am offended by either side.\n  So Janice Rogers Brown is not a strict constructionist, but is she \notherwise a proven warrior against the scourge of conservatives \neverywhere--judicial activism? No. She is clearly an activist judge. \nShe takes what comes into her own mind--she is bright, but a lot of her \nviews compared to American law veer way off course--and she writes them \nin her opinions. Decades of elections, tens of thousands of \nlegislators, executives, and she just throws them out the window \nbecause she happens to believe she knows better than everybody else.\n  That is what a judicial activist is. That is what the conservative \nmovement against judicial activism rebelled against.\n  Well, conservatives and moderates alike have criticized her for her \nactivism, and her own words show her to be as activist as they come. \nHer own words demonstrate she is quick to want to reverse precedent, \nthe very definition of an activist judge. When it comes to reversing \nprecedent, one might say Janice Rogers Brown has an itchy trigger \nfinger; she cannot wait to reverse precedent.\n  Here is what she said in People v. Roberman, 1998: We cannot simply \ncloak ourselves in the doctrine of stare decisis. Hello? I went to law \nschool. I learned throughout law school, one studies cases because of \nstare decisis. One is supposed to look at the train of law, and here \nshe is: Forget stare decisis.\n  If that was said by a liberal who wanted to move things way over to \nthe left--a liberal would not say it; it would be someone further \nover--what would be heard on that side of the aisle? What does it say \nabout her reluctance to be an activist?\n  Time and time again she has jumped at the chance to reshape settled \nlaw. Listen to a few statements from opinions she has written, not from \nspeeches. Everyone has said, do not judge her speeches--they are \ninflammatory and intended to be so--but her opinions. Here she says: \nThe commercial speech doctrine, which has been established in our law \nfor decades, needs and deserves reconsideration and this is as good as \nany place to begin.\n  She wrote she was disinclined to perpetuate dubious law for no better \nreason than it exists.\n  I had a history professor in college. He said his first lesson of \nhistory is we are no smarter than our fathers, and people who think \nthey are much smarter than people who came before them and have nothing \nto learn from them do not belong on the bench. Here she is: disinclined \nto perpetuate dubious law for no better reason than it exists. Is she \nsaying all the people who wrote those opinions should be ignored?\n  On other occasions she has talked about ``taking a fresh look'', her \nwords, at settled doctrine under California law. And just listen to the \nCalifornia State Bar Judicial Nominees Convention which gave Justice \nBrown a not qualified rating when nominated to the California Supreme \nCourt in 1996. The rating in part was because of complaints that she \nwas ``insensitive to established legal precedent.''\n  Or listen to the words of conservative writer Andrew Sullivan who \nagrees with many of Justice Brown's views. He said there is a case to \nbe made for ``the constitutional extremism of one of the President's \nfavorite nominees, Janice Rogers Brown. Whatever else she is, she does \nnot fit the description of a judge who simply applies the law.'' This \nis Andrew Sullivan, conservative commentator, not Chuck Schumer. He \nsaid: If she is not a judicial activist, I do not know who would be.\n  Mr. Sullivan made it a point to say he might agree with some of her \nviews but not her penchant for imposing those views in her position as \na judge, and that is the point. God bless her for her views. This is \nAmerica. We can all have different views. But when one becomes a judge \nand they take an oath of office to uphold the Constitution, part of \nthat means they uphold the traditions of law that are under the \nConstitution.\n  Here is what Sullivan said:\n\n       I might add, I am not unsympathetic to her views but she \n     should run for office, not the courts.\n\n  He has it exactly right. Let her run on her views that the New Deal \nwas a socialist revolution. Let her run on her views that there should \nnot be child labor laws. Let her run on her views that there should be \nno zoning laws so someone who wanted to open a pornographic store next \nto a high school had a constitutional right to do so or somebody could \nbuy a tract of land right next to your nice suburban house and put in a \nfactory.\n  How about Mr. Ponnuru, again, a conservative writer from the National \nReview magazine:\n\n       She has said that judicial activism is not troubling per \n     se. What matters is the world view of the judicial activist. \n     In other words, one can be a judicial activist if they agree \n     with her views, not if they do not.\n\n  I have to say to my friends on the other side of the aisle, they have \nlost a lot of the argument on judicial activism when they support \nJanice Rogers Brown. Judicial activism is not sometimes yes and \nsometimes no. An activist is somebody who makes his or her own law, it \ncomes out of their own head and supersedes everything we have known, \nwhether it is left, right, center.\n  It is incredible. It is incredible that we are discussing Janice \nRogers Brown. I can imagine the reaction if a Democratic President put \nforward a nominee\n\n[[Page S6093]]\n\nwho said all of these things. We would have pandemonium on that side of \nthe aisle. But guess what. President Clinton never would have nominated \nsomeone like this. It is only because President Bush is so in the \nthrall of the hard right that he has to do this. Thank God it is not \ntrue of most of the judges he has nominated, conservative though they \nmay be.\n\n  So as the record reflects, Janice Rogers Brown does not have the \nimpulses of a restrained judge. She has the passions of a judicial \nactivist and that was the type I thought conservatives wanted to keep \noff the bench at all costs.\n  How about this argument: She is not a strict constructionist and she \nis a judicial activist. But are her judicial views otherwise in the \nmainstream of conservatism? Is that why people on the other side of the \naisle support her? My friend Jeff Sessions said Justice Brown is in the \nmainstream. Well, let us ask the American people if her views are in \nthe mainstream. Or first let us ask conservative commentator George \nWill, a very respected man--and I have more respect for him because at \nleast he is calling the shots as he sees them, not like my colleagues \nwho seem to be marching to the tune of Janice Rogers Brown without even \nthinking. Here is what George Will said, and in fairness to George Will \nhe was first saying that Priscilla Owen, who we opposed, is part of the \nmainstream, but here is what he said about Brown:\n\n       Another of the three, Janice Rogers Brown, is out of that \n     mainstream. That should not be an automatic disqualification, \n     but it is a fact . . .\n\n  I say to Mr. Will, it surely is a disqualification to me, but that is \nnot the point. Even George Will says Janice Rogers Brown is out of the \nmainstream. Which mainstream was he talking about? George Will was \ntalking about the mainstream of conservative jurisprudence.\n  He went on to say, and these are his words:\n\n       It is a fact she has expressed admiration for the Supreme \n     Court's pre-1937 hyperactivism in declaring unconstitutional \n     many laws and regulations of the sort that now define the \n     post-New Deal regulatory state.\n\n  George Will has the forthrightness, straightforwardness, and courage \nto admit what Janice Rogers Brown is. When will one of my colleagues \nfrom the other side?\n  What does the record then show about Janice Rogers Brown? She is not \nstrict in her construction. She is not mainstream in her conservatism. \nNor is she quiet about her activism. So I am left with the same \nquestion: Why is it that Janice Rogers Brown is touted as the model \nconservative judge when she is anything but conservative in her \njudicial approach?\n  I believe there are many Senators across the aisle who would vote \nagainst such a candidate because her judicial philosophy could not be \nmore out of sync with theirs, but I worry that there is enormous \npolitical pressure, party pressure, on those moderate Senators.\n  Senator Frist has spoken the last few weeks about leader-led \nfilibusters of judges, whatever that means. Well, is this a leader-led \nrubberstamping of nominees who have not even convinced noted \nconservatives that they belong on the bench?\n  Let me make one other point. If one looks at all the nominees, 45 \ncourt of appeals nominees, every measure that was put forward on the \nother side of the aisle for every one of the court of appeals nominees, \nwhether it is to invoke cloture or to vote for them, there was not a \nsingle Republican dissent, except one: Trent Lott on Roger Gregory for \nthe Fourth Circuit. That was the man Jesse Helms blocked, mostly \nbecause he did not want a Black man on the Fourth Circuit, which has \nnot had a Black man before, even though the Fourth Circuit, North \nCarolina, Virginia, has a large Black population.\n  Let us look at the merits of Justice Brown. Let us look at her views \nand why I feel she could not have been a worse pick. This has nothing \nto do with her faith, her race, her gender, or her background. We are \nbeing blind to all that. Any nominee who has these views--could be \nBlack, White, Hispanic, Asian, man, woman--you just can't support \nsomebody like this because of their views, not because of who they are \nand not because of their background. What a record she has.\n\n  In case after case, Justice Brown goes through contortions of legal \nlogic that reach results to hurt workers, limit environmental \nprotections, and injure basic rights. Time and time again, when a legal \nquestion is presented twice, she takes two polar opposite approaches in \norder to achieve the outcome she wants. That is judicial activism at \nits worst.\n  Judicial activism can be dangerous on any court, but it is especially \ndangerous on the DC Circuit, which is known, for good reason, as the \nNation's second highest court.\n  Some of the things she said. She said that the Lochner case was \ndecided correctly. The Lochner case says that States cannot pass any \nlaws protecting workers. If you ask most lawyers to name the worst \nSupreme Court decision of the 20th century, Lochner would be at the top \nof any list. Fortunately, the Court threw it out a few decades later. \nNot even Justice Scalia believes States should be prohibited from \npassing wages and hours laws. But Janice Rogers Brown believes not only \nis the Federal Government not allowed to, under the commerce clause, \nbut the States themselves cannot do anything. It is confounding. It is \njust unbelievable.\n  How about her views in the San Remo case, where she says all zoning \nlaws are a taking of property, an unconstitutional taking of property? \nDoes anyone in America believe that? Does the most conservative Member \nof this Chamber? I don't know who it might be. We might have a race for \nthat. But does the most conservative Member of this Chamber believe \nthere should be no zoning laws? These are State laws, which has nothing \nto do with federalism, which Justice Scalia made one of his hallmarks. \nI disagree with him on those issues, but that is a different argument. \nThese are local zoning laws. Unconstitutional? Is it unconstitutional \nto say you cannot put poison in the air? Is it unconstitutional to say \nyou can't pollute the water? Is it unconstitutional to say in a \nresidential community you cannot put in a factory or a porno palace? \nWhat are we doing here? What is going on here?\n  I have to tell you, I do not see how anyone on that side of the aisle \ncan look in the mirror and say they really think this woman belongs on \nthe DC Court of Appeals.\n  If it were just one view, you would say: Well, these guys are just \nfocusing on one view. It is over and over again. Until Santa Monica--\njust to go back to Lochner-- v. Superior Court, she called the demise \nof the Lochner era ``the revolution of 1937.'' That is that socialist \nrevolution, the New Deal. She wants to undo it.\n  Here is what she said on another occasion:\n\n       Today's senior citizens blithely cannibalize their \n     grandchildren because they have the right to get as much free \n     stuff as the political system will permit them to extract.\n\n  I suppose you read from that that she wants to repeal Social \nSecurity. After all, that was part of the socialist revolution. Does \nanyone here believe we should repeal Social Security? Anyone?\n  In a dissenting opinion, she wrote:\n\n       I would deny the senior citizen plaintiff relief because \n     she has failed to establish that public policy against age \n     discrimination inures to the benefit of the public is \n     fundamental and substantial.\n\n  It goes without saying that a nominee who does not agree that public \npolicy against age discrimination benefits the public is far out of any \nmainstream.\n  I don't know of a single person on the U.S. courts--and there may be \none or two but none that have come to my attention--who is as out of \nthe mainstream, as far over to the right as Janice Rogers Brown.\n  So my colleagues--and this is really a plea to those on the other \nside of the aisle--we have already come to an agreement, at least 14 in \nthe middle--God bless them for trying--that we are going to invoke \ncloture on Janice Rogers Brown, which means there will be an up-or-down \nvote. But no one here has voted up or down on Janice Rogers Brown \nbefore, except Members of the Judiciary Committee.\n  I urge, plead with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle--\nparticularly those who are somewhat more moderate--look at the record \nof this nominee. Look at what she says and what she stands for. If \nthere were ever a time to show some independence, to not march in \nlockstep, to vote your\n\n[[Page S6094]]\n\nconvictions because you can't believe that someone of these views \nbelongs on the court, now is that time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SIMPSON III\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \nambassador of the law. Charles R. Simpson III, judge of the United \nStates District Court for the Western District of Kentucky, is a \nrenowned fixture of the legal community in his home state as well as a \nworld traveler, in his capacity as a member of the Committee on \nInternational Judicial Relations of the Judicial Conference of the \nUnited States. In that role, he serves as both a student and a teacher \nin courtrooms all over the world.\n  Judge Simpson is also an old friend of mine. He graduated from my \nalma mater, the University of Louisville, where he received both his \nbachelor's degree in 1967 and his law degree in 1970. Soon afterwards, \nwe both helped found the law firm of Levin, Yussman, McConnell & \nSimpson. Obviously it was not the last stop for either of us.\n  After serving the public in county government, where I also served, \nJudge Simpson was appointed to the District Court by President Ronald \nReagan in 1986. He has retained that post for nearly 20 years, rising \nto become one of the most respected voices in Louisville and throughout \nthe State. But he also wanted to take his legal knowledge and his love \nof Kentucky and spread it beyond America's borders.\n  Dating to a period in his youth when he studied painting and \narchitecture in Europe, Chuck has enjoyed an adventurer's spirit. So he \nspearheaded the establishment of a sister-court relationship between \nhis court and one in Croatia. Through this friendship, Croatians got a \nfirsthand look at American jurisprudence, and Judge Simpson learned how \nthe law deals with the difficulties of life in Eastern Europe.\n  Because of his groundbreaking efforts, Chief Justice of the United \nStates William H. Rehnquist appointed Judge Simpson to the Committee on \nInternational Judicial Relations of the Judicial Conference of the \nUnited States in 2004. His wide travels have included countries such as \nRussia, Croatia, Slovenia and Cyprus.\n  Once on a visit to Ivanovo, Russia, Judge Simpson caused a minor \ninternational incident when he accidentally locked himself in the \ncourtroom cage usually reserved for the defendant. Apparently, it was \nquite difficult to find the key. Everyone handled the situation with \ngreat humor, and Chuck struck a blow for diplomacy when his story made \nthe front page of the local Ivanovo newspaper.\n  In 1999 Judge Simpson was named outstanding alumnus of the University \nof Louisville's Louis D. Brandeis School of Law, and in 2000 the \nLouisville Bar Association named him judge of the year. He and his wife \nClare have three children, one of whom, their daughter Pam, has served \nwith distinction for 2 years in my Washington office.\n  For his decades of service, the Kentucky Bar Association has named \nChuck the 2005 outstanding judge of the year. They recognize that he is \na superb representative of the American justice system to our friends \nacross the world, and the knowledge he brings home from his travels \nenriches us all. Mr. President, today I ask my colleagues to join me in \ncommending Judge Simpson for receiving this high honor, and for his \nservice to the law and his country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/06/senate-section/article/S6094-3", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6094-S6095]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nNOMINATION OF JOHN BOLTON TO BE UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED \n                                NATIONS\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I will be voting against the nomination \nof John Bolton to be Ambassador to the United Nations.\n  When the President first nominated Mr. Bolton for this position, I \nexpressed deep disappointment and concern. First, because of his \nrepeated expression of disdain for the organization. But, more \nimportantly, because Mr. Bolton is as responsible as any member of the \nadministration for the needless confrontations with the rest of the \nworld and for the international isolation that plagued President Bush's \nfirst term and for the shaky credibility we carry today. At a time when \nwe need to be strengthening our alliances and making full use of \ninternational institutions to achieve our foreign policy goals, sending \nMr. Bolton to the United Nations sends the exact wrong message. I do \nnot accept his view that the U.N. is a vehicle to be used by the U.S. \n``when it suits our interests and we can get others to go along.'' \nDiplomacy in most people's minds requires attention to more than just \ncoalitions of the willing.\n  Over the past month, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has \nuncovered a pattern of behavior on the part of Mr. Bolton that has only \nconfirmed my concerns. Most disturbing to me is the evidence of Mr. \nBolton's troubled and confrontational relationship with our \nintelligence community.\n  In speeches and testimony, he has appeared to stretch the available \nintelligence to fit his preconceived views. On three separate \noccasions, he tried to inflate language characterizing our intelligence \nassessments regarding Syria's nuclear activities. He sought to \nexaggerate the intelligence community's views about Cuba's possible \nbiological weapons activities. His track record, on these and other \nmatters, was so bad that the Deputy Secretary of State made an \nextraordinary order--that Mr. Bolton could not give any testimony or \nspeech that was not personally cleared by the Deputy Secretary or the \nSecretary's chief of staff.\n  He also dampened critical debates among professionals on important \npolicy issues by retaliating against analysts who presented a different \npoint of view than his own. For example, on three occasions over a 6 \nmonth period, he sought to remove a midlevel analyst who disputed the \nlanguage he tried to use about Cuba. The proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction is a serious matter. I would not criticize Mr. Bolton \nfor asking intelligence analysts hard questions about proliferation \nissues, nor should policy makers refrain from challenging the \nassumptions of those analysts. But Mr. Bolton was doing something far \ndifferent. He made it clear that he expected intelligence analyses that \nconformed with his preconceived policy views. Rather than welcome \ncontrary intelligence analyses as essential to an informed debate, he \nretaliated against those who offered contrary views.\n  Mr. Bolton's approach to those around him has been harshly criticized \nby those who have worked with him. Larry Wilkerson, the chief of staff \nfor Secretary Powell, called him a ``lousy leader.'' Carl Ford, former \nhead of the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research, \nreferred to Mr. Bolton as a ``quintessential kiss-up, kick-down sort of \nguy.''\n  This is not the person we need at the United Nations. Good diplomacy, \nlike good business, relies on a great team and a good leader. Good \nleaders listen. They listen to their troops, they make reasoned \ndecisions, they take responsibility, and they build the respect and \nloyalty of their staff. Management by fear is a recipe, in both public \nservice and the private sector, for getting only the information that \nyou want to hear. Shoot the messenger and other messengers will not \nvolunteer to deliver the bad news. And I submit that Mr. Bolton has \ndeveloped a reputation for shooting the messenger.\n\n[[Page S6095]]\n\n  We must begin to learn the lessons of Iraq. It should be more than \nclear by now that our national interests are damaged when policy makers \nbend intelligence. And we should all understand by now that accurate, \nobjective intelligence requires analysts who are free to offer \ndiffering views. We face serious threats, from international terrorism \nto the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. We have serious \nforeign policy concerns to address, from genocide to global climate \nchange. Protecting our national security interests demands policymakers \nwho seek objective intelligence on these and other challenges. Given \nhis track record, John Bolton is clearly not that policymaker.\n  Another lesson of Iraq is the critical importance of American \ncredibility. The inaccurate presentations made by our Government to the \ninternational community have done serious damage to our interests. If \nwe are to gain the active support of other nations in confronting \ncommon threats such as terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, we \nwill need to convince those nations of our views. To do so, we will \nneed their trust. This challenge is especially complicated at the \nUnited Nations, where Secretary of State Colin Powell gave what turned \nout to be an almost entirely inaccurate presentation on Iraq, and where \nthe administration dismissed all alternative views, including those of \nUN inspectors. Mr. Bolton is not the person to repair this damage. His \nrecord makes it extremely unlikely that he could rebuild our \ncredibility in the international community in its most visible forum--\nthe U.N.\n  The nomination of John Bolton is a lost opportunity for this \nadministration to regain American leadership at the United Nations. It \nis also dangerous. Failure to gain support in the UN for our policies \nputs us at unnecessary risk. Simply put, we cannot afford an \nineffective Ambassador at the United Nations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/06/senate-section/article/S6095-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6095]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        COMMENDING RICHARD PRICE\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I rise to commend and thank Mr. \nRichard Price of the Congressional Research Service, CRS, for his many \nyears of outstanding service to the U.S. Congress. In June, Mr. Price \nis retiring from CRS after 32 years of service. For over three decades \nat CRS, Mr. Price has played a significant role in providing assistance \nto Congress in analyzing major health care legislation. In his position \nat CRS, he has been an invaluable asset not only through his own work \nanalyzing health care legislation, but also in his tireless efforts to \nguide others in the Health Care and Medicine unit at CRS which he \nmanaged.\n  Over the past three decades, Mr. Price has worked on health care \nlegislation across a wide array of health care policy and programs. Mr. \nPrice is a recognized expert on the major U.S. health care financing \nprograms--Medicare and Medicaid; his particular areas of expertise span \nmost aspects of Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement policy, long-term \ncare, Medicaid eligibility, nursing home reform, managed care, hospice \ncare, skilled nursing home services, end stage renal disease, home \nhealth care services, and public health service programs, among many \nothers. His contributions to the development of legislation in these \nareas have been substantial. Over his long career at CRS, he has helped \nhundreds of staff understand the effect of the legislative proposals \nbeing considered through thoughtful analyses, balanced presentations, \nand clear explanations. I wish to especially thank him for his work \nwith the Senate Finance Committee and its staff.\n  In addition to his own analytic work on legislative analysis, Mr. \nPrice has been responsible for management of a staff of CRS analysts \nwho assist Congress across a wide spectrum of health care issues, \nincluding those related to Medicare, Medicaid, the Public Health \nService, the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of \nHealth, and the Veterans Administration. Mr. Price was instrumental in \nbuilding the health care staff of CRS to a large team of senior \nanalysts. In addition, Mr. Price has been involved in innumerable \nprojects to develop the capacity of CRS analysts to evaluate and \nanalyze health care data, including models to estimate the effect of \nvarious legislative changes in Medicare and other health care programs.\n  Other organizations that analyze issues related to health care policy \nhave acknowledged Mr. Price's accomplishments and knowledge of U.S. \nhealth care policy. For example, Mr. Price is a member of the steering \ncommittee of the National Health Policy Forum, a nonpartisan \norganization that provides research to senior level health policy \nmakers in Washington. Mr. Price is also a member of the prestigious \nNational Academy on Social Insurance, NASI.\n  Mr. Price's service to Congress in the analysis and development of \npolicy alternatives across a wide array of health care programs, his \nability to conceptualize complex public policy issues, as well as his \nleadership of staff who work on many varied and complex health care \nissues, set the highest standards for assistance provided by CRS in \nservice to the Congress. He will be missed, both here in Congress and \nacross the street at the Library of Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/06/senate-section/article/S6095-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6095]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RETIREMENT OF GEORGE W. MULLEN\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to honor George \nW. Mullen of Pennsylvania, who will step down as State Adjutant of the \nPennsylvania Department of Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United \nStates this June. George's retirement will mark the end of a \ndistinguished 59 year career of service to our military, our veterans \ncommunity, and our Nation.\n  George W. Mullen joined the United States Navy in 1943 at the age of \n17 and served during World War II aboard the merchant ship SS Ben Holt \nand the destroyer USS Cotton in both the Atlantic and Pacific Theatres. \nWhile on active duty aboard the Holt, his ship arrived 2 days after the \ninvasion of Normandy, France, to help supply Allied forces in the \nbattle against Germany. His duty on the Cotton included helping rescue \na downed American pilot and supporting the invasion of Okinawa.\n  George worked at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Coatesville \nfor 35 years before becoming the Pennsylvania Veterans of Foreign Wars \nState Adjutant in 1983. As a member of the Pennsylvania War Veterans \nCouncil and the Pennsylvania State Veterans Commission, he has been a \nfamiliar face to governors and many State and Federal legislators who \nhave sought his guidance.\n  Mr. Mullen, who lives in Parkesburg, has touched many lives and that \nhas not gone unnoticed. He has been honored at the local, State and \nnational level for his many contributions.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the \nOnline Freedom of Speech Act which my colleague Senator Reid has \nintroduced. This legislation clarifies the campaign finance legislation \nof 2002 in order to restore freedom of speech to the Internet.\n       The Internet is more than a remarkable new technology. It's \n     a means of bringing people together. I read somewhere that \n     the most important time in a person's development is the \n     first 5 years. Things that happen during infancy have \n     dramatic effects on how that child will develop for the rest \n     of their life. The Internet is no different. It is a \n     technology in its infancy. We are fortunate to live in an \n     exciting time of great technological change. In my State of \n     Montana, cutting-edge technology is creating jobs and \n     industry. But like anything in its infancy, we should be very \n     careful about how we respond to technological infants like \n     the Internet. A wrong step now could affect how it develops \n     for the next 100 years.\n  For this reason, the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 did not \nidentify the Internet as a target of regulation. However, it also did \nnot specifically exclude it. When the FEC decided how to enforce the \nregulatory measures of the new law, they erred on the side of caution \nand exempted the Internet from their regulatory scope.\n  The fruits of that decision have been profound. According to a Pew \nInternet\n\n[[Page S6096]]\n\nand American Life Project survey, two thirds of adult Americans, or 136 \nmillion citizens, use the Internet. For youth, that number is even \nhigher. Over half of the adults who use the Internet used it during the \n2004 campaign cycle. They used it to obtain news and determine \ncandidate positions. They viewed websites for campaigns and advocacy \ngroups. They looked for information to register to vote. They followed \nopinion polls, looked at jokes, and checked the validity of rumors. \nThey emailed one another about the election, and received email \nnewsletters from candidates and advocacy groups. By a 10 to 1 margin, \nthese Americans said that the Internet was a positive addition to \npublic debate in the 2004 campaign. In the past several years, the \nInternet has become a powerful way for the American People to voice \ntheir opinions on everything from car parts to hair styles to political \nelections.\n  The Internet has been utilized by Americans representing the numerous \nideologies of all the political parties. It is not Republican. It is \nnot Democrat. It is not rich or poor. The Internet, like this country, \nis the mixture of all of those things together. It has become the \nnewest and most dynamic melting pot of ideas.\n  But all this may be threatened because in 2004 a Federal court here \nin Washington, DC, instructed the FEC to begin regulating the Internet. \nThe FEC has begun working out the details for this new regulatory \nframework, and right now we can see what that process looks like. I'll \ntell you this. It's not easy to understand. There are experts who don't \nunderstand it all. There are thousands of pages of comments and \nproposals.\n  The Online Freedom of Speech Act can clean up this entire mess with 8 \nsimple lines of legislation.\n  In 1996, I was a co-founder of the Congressional Internet Caucus. \nToday, there are 176 members of this caucus from both parties and in \nboth the Senate and the House of Representatives. These members have \npledged to uphold the following: Promoting growth and advancement of \nthe Internet; providing a bicameral, bipartisan forum for Internet \nconcerns to be raised; promoting the education of Members of Congress \nand their staffs about the Internet; promoting commerce and the free \nflow of information on the Internet; advancing the United States' world \nleadership in the digital world; and maximizing the openness of and \nparticipation in government by the people.\n  I helped found this caucus because I understand the importance of \ncareful treatment of this technology in its infancy. Government tends \nto want to regulate, and regulation can stunt growth. I am very \nconcerned that without legislation like the Online Freedom of Speech \nAct, the First Amendment rights of Americans, from Montana and \nthroughout the rest of the county, will be severely damaged.\n  Experts have warned that at the very least, proposed online \nregulation will subject Internet advocates, like bloggers, to the \nprospect of FEC investigations. That can mean subpoenas, lawyers, \nincreased government payrolls and bureaucracy. Such investigations are \nnot only a huge commitment for the FEC, but a serious threat to free \nspeech online.\n  One of the things that makes the Internet unique is that it is so \nbroadly accessible. Compared to more traditional forms of publication \nit is very cheap to publish on the Internet. As little as 20 years ago, \nthe only way for someone's ideas to reach the full Marketplace of Ideas \nwas to secure access to a printing press or broadcast center.\n  But as I said, the Internet is much different, now allowing anyone to \npromote his or her ideas into the marketplace. Internet media doesn't \ncrowd out other competing media. And since everyone can have their say, \nthe reader is the one who gets to decide what he or she wants to read. \nWe need to be mindful of allowing the government to try to limit the \nchoices of what the consumer can make.\n  Mr. President, as you can see, regulatory standards for the Internet \nmust be much different than for other forms of public communication. \nThe traditional arguments for traditional media do not apply here.\n  Some of my colleagues may think that there must be some regulation of \nthe Internet for some types of political speech. However, before we \nchoose to regulate this infant technology, we need learned-testimony \nand debate on this issue by discussing this bill. We need to make sure \nthat regulation is the best course of action. Accordingly, I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in support for the Online Freedom of Speech Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/06/senate-section/article/S6096-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6096]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BAKERS CREEK TRAGEDY\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to offer remarks on the \ntragedy that occurred on June 14, 1943 at Bakers Creek, Australia. On \nthat day, 40 members of the U.S. Armed Forces, six of whom were from \nthe Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, lost their lives when the B-17C \nFlying Fortress airplane that they were flying in crashed at Bakers \nCreek, Australia. This tragedy marked the worst aviation disaster of \nthe Southwest Pacific Theater during World War II.\n  I understand that at approximately 6 a.m. on June 14, 1943, the B-17C \nFlying Fortress transporting six crew members and thirty-five soldiers \nthat were returning from leave in Australia departed from Mackay \nAirport in Bakers Creek for Port Moresby, when shortly after takeoff, \nthe plane lost altitude and subsequently crashed. The sole survivor of \nthis crash was Corporal Foye Kenneth Roberts of Wichita Falls, Texas.\n  This June will mark the 62nd anniversary of the Bakers Creek crash. I \napplaud the work of Dr. Robert S. Cutler and the Bakers Creek Memorial \nAssociation for their research and tireless dedication to ensuring that \nthe memory of those who perished at Bakers Creek, Australia in 1943 \nnever be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/06/senate-section/article/S6096-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6096-S6097]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nCONGRATULATING THE WINNERS OF THE NEW HAMPSHIRE EXCELLENCE IN EDUCATION \n                                 AWARDS\n\n Mr. SUNUNU.

These awards, \notherwise known as the ``ED''ies, are given to those individuals and \nschools that have exhibited the highest standards of excellence in \ncurriculum and instruction, teaching and learning process, student \nachievement, leadership and decision-making, community and parental \ninvolvement, and school climate.\n  On June 4, 2005, 30 individuals, 2 school boards and 6 schools were \nrecognized for their leadership and outstanding dedication in preparing \ntheir students for our rapidly changing workplace. I am honored to lend \nmy voice to those of their colleagues, students, and communities in \nconveying our appreciation and respect for the professionals they are \nand the sacrifices and contributions they make every day in classrooms \nthroughout the Granite State.\n  Nominees consist of some of New Hampshire's finest teachers and \ncommunity leaders. They are carefully reviewed by selection committees \nthat apply standards developed by The Board of Directors for the New \nHampshire Excellence in Education Awards. Nominees come from \nelementary, middle and secondary schools, as well as higher education. \nMany are honored in specific categories of excellence such as art \neducation, world languages, school nursing, counseling and technology.\n  As a student in Salem, I was privileged to have had many great \nteachers at every level of my education. Today, as a parent looking \nback on that experience, I see even more clearly the great impact \nthey've had on my life. Not only did they provide an environment \nconducive to learning, but each in their own way provided me with the \ndirection necessary to succeed.\n  Like the classroom heroes I knew growing up in Salem, the group of \neducators chosen this year for the ``ED''ies have demonstrated superior \ndedication and service to their students, schools and communities. They \nrichly deserve this prestigious honor for the important roles they play \nin helping our children reach their goals and succeed in school. The \nteachers, principals, counselors, librarians and other school leaders \nbeing commended this year have provided students with the tools\n\n[[Page S6097]]\n\nthey need to become productive and engaged citizens, and have been some \nof our State's most treasured role models--setting positive examples \nfor the children that surround them, teaching personal responsibility \nand hard work, and shaping the character of young minds. For these \nachievements, our State and our country owe them a great deal of \ngratitude.\n  Since being elected to Congress in 1996, I have been ever mindful \nthat I am a beneficiary of the State of New Hampshire's public \neducation system. A system that is an exemplary model due in large \nmeasure to the contributions and leadership of the many educators and \nschools being recognized this year.

Spitznagel, TSP is the largest architectural and engineering firm in \nthe State. Throughout its 75 years, TSP has contributed to the \nlandscape of 100 different South Dakota communities. Among its most \nnotable structures are the Sylvan Lake Hotel, Sioux Falls City Hall, \nSt. Mary's Catholic Church, Sioux Falls Arena, IBP/Tyson Foods \nCorporate Headquarters, South Dakota Technology Business Center, \nHarrisburg High School, and Sioux Falls Veterans' Memorial Park.\n  Following the firm's significant expansion in 1969, TSP established \noffices in Minnesota, Wyoming, Colorado, Iowa, and Nebraska. \nAccordingly, what was once a small budding company staffed by a single \nperson in Sioux Falls is now a prominent firm with offices in nine \ncities and over 200 employees.\n  Mr. President, it is with great honor that I share with my colleagues \nthe accomplishments of Harold T. Spitznagel, his partners, associates, \nand employees. TSP's proven success will undoubtedly continue to \nenhance both the beauty and property of South Dakota for many years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/06/senate-section/article/S6097-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6097]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               HONORING THE CITY OF SPENCER, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to honor and publicly \nrecognize the 125th anniversary of the founding of the city of Spencer, \nSD. On June 18, 2005, the citizens of Spencer will celebrate their \ncity's proud past, as well as their hope for a promising future.\n  Located in southeastern South Dakota, the origin of Spencer's name is \na bit contentious. One story tells of an Indian Camp located exactly \nwhere the town of Spencer now sits. One tale has it that scouts from \nthe Lewis and Clark expedition came across the Indian Camp in 1804, \nwhere they found an ill and weary Indian woman with her new born baby. \nAfter nursing the two back to health, the woman gave the men a short \njacket, known as a ``Spencer'' jacket, as a token of her gratitude. \nAdditionally, she prophesied that a city would one day flourish there; \ndecades later, her prophecy was fulfilled. The railroad came to Dakota \nTerritory in 1887, and in the words of the Spencer News, the town \n``like a mushroom, sprang into existence.'' Similarly, the other \naccount of Spencer's name asserts it was named for Hugh Spencer, the \ndivision superintendent of the Omaha Railroad.\n  Platted in 1880, Spencer was officially incorporated into McCook \nCounty in 1917. Ever since E. L. Hunskaar opened the town's first \nrailroad depot in 1887, the community has been home to a number of \nprosperous businesses and has supported farmers and ranchers across the \nregion.\n  Unfortunately, as many know, Spencer suffered a horrific tragedy in \n1998 when the most destructive tornado in South Dakota history, an F-4, \ndevastated the region. On Saturday, May 30, the tornado ripped through \nthe tiny town, killing six people and injuring over 150 of Spencer's \n320 residents. I remember peering over the city from a ladder on a \nSioux Falls fire truck and thinking how much the terrible scene \nresembled a Civil War battlefield. Most of the houses were reduced to \nrubble; the post office, first station, library, bank, and multiple \nchurches were all destroyed. Despite the devastation, Spencer's \ndedicated residents committed themselves to the rebuilding effort with \nundaunted determination. As a result of the residents' diligence and \ndetermination, Spencer commemorates its 125th anniversary as a proud \nand thriving town.\n  In the twelve and a half decades since its founding, Spencer has \nproven its ability to flourish and survive. Spencer's proud residents \ncelebrate its 125th anniversary on June 18, 2005, and it is with great \npleasure that I share with my colleagues the achievements made by this \nremarkable and resilient community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/06/senate-section/article/S6097-3", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6097-S6098]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               HONORING THE TOWN OF De SMET, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to honor and publicly \nrecognize the 125th anniversary of the founding of the town of De Smet, \nSD. As the 125th anniversary approaches, De Smet looks back on a proud \nhistory and looks forward to a promising future.\n  Founded in 1880 by the Western Town Lot Company, De Smet is almost \nequidistant from the Nebraska State line and from the North Dakota \nState line. Situated in central Kingsbury County, De Smet is named for \nFather Pierre Jean De Smet, a Belgian priest who tirelessly worked \namong the region's local Indian tribes. Despite the town's status as \nKingsbury County seat, De Smet originally was sparsely populated, home \npredominantly to single men. The arrival of the Chicago Northwestern \nRailroad in 1880, however, sparked an influx of residents that included \nmany families.\n  In 1889, De Smet's most notable resident, Laura Ingalls Wilder, \nauthor of the Little House on the Prairie books which evolved into the \nlongest running series in TV history, arrived with her family. While \nher series immortalizes this great community, every summer De Smet \nhonors the famous writer with the Laura Ingalls Wilder Pageant.\n  Another of De Smet's attractions is Washington Park, host to \ncountless family picnics and outdoor activities. The park is also home \nto a statue honoring Father Pierre Jean De Smet, the duplicate of which \nis located in his hometown of Dendermonde, Belgium. De Smet's statue, \nwhich was dedicated to the public on June 8, 1986, established a bond \nbetween Dendermonde, Belgium and De Smet, SD and the two became sister \ncities.\n  De Smet's other distinguished landmarks include the historic \ncourthouse, the Ingalls Homestead, the Loftus Store, and the De Smet \nDepot, a museum immortalizing the town's past.\n\n[[Page S6098]]\n\nAdditionally, De Smet's over 1,100 residents have come to count on The \nNews, founded in 1880, and The Kingsbury County Independent, \nestablished in 1890, for quality and accurate reporting on local events \nand affairs.\n  In the twelve and a half decades since its founding, De Smet has \nproven its ability to thrive, while preserving and cherishing its rich \npast. De Smet's proud residents celebrate its 125th anniversary on June \n11, 2005, and it is with great honor that I share with my colleagues \nthe achievements made by this great community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/06/senate-section/article/S6098-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6098]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/06/senate-section/article/S6098-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6098]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/06/senate-section/article/S6098-3", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6098]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:02 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.

A bill to amend title 10 and 38, United States Code, to \nrepeal the 10-year limits on use of Montgomery GI Bill educational \nassistance benefits, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about an investment \nprogram in lifelong education for our service members and veterans. The \nMontgomery GI Bill is consistently cited as an important reason people \njoin the military. The GI Bill continues to be one of the most \nimportant benefits of military service today. There is no reason why \n100 percent of our active duty, selected reserve, and veteran \nservicemembers shouldn't be taking advantage of their earned education \nbenefits.\n  That is why I'm introducing the ``GI Bill for Life Act of 2005,'' \nwhich would allow Montgomery GI Bill participants an unlimited time to \nuse their earned benefits.\n  The MGIB is a program that provides up to 36 months of education \nbenefits for educational opportunities ranging from college to \napprenticeship and job\n\n[[Page S6103]]\n\ntraining, and even flight training. Upon enlistment, the GI Bill also \nrequires service members to contribute $100 per month for their first \n12 months of services.\n  Basically, the MGIB is divided into two programs. One program targets \nactive duty and veteran members, paying over $1,000 per month to \nqualified students. That's more than $36,000 for school. The other is \ndirected at the Selected Reserve. This program provides educational \nbenefits of $288 per month, for a total of $10,368.\n  If recruits are overwhelmingly declaring that education opportunity \nunder the GI Bill is the key incentive for them to join the military, \nthen it makes sense that most--if not all--of our troops, who signed up \nfor the program, would also be cashing in on their benefits. But \nreports show that the majority, 40-60 percent, do not actually use the \nbenefits they earned.\n  Currently, MGIB participants have up to 10 years from their release \ndate from the military to use their earned education benefits. Members \nof the Selected Reserve are able to use their MGIB benefits for 14 \nyears. However, that means your earned education benefits expire if you \ndon't I use them within the required timeframe, closing your window of \nopportunity to go to school or finish your college education. Plus you \nlose the $1,200 dedicated for your GI Bill during your first year of \nenlistment.\n  Originally, the intent of 1944 GI Bill of Rights was to help veterans \nsuccessfully transition back into civilian life--as education is the \nkey to employment opportunities. Looking back now, we know that the GI \nBill opened the door to higher education, helping millions of service \nmembers and veterans who wouldn't otherwise have had the chance to pay \nfor college. That is, servicemembers benefited from the GI Bill because \nthey used the payments within the 10- and 14 year limitation.\n  But there are many others who did not use their earned education \nbenefits within that timeframe. For example, after leaving the \nmilitary, some servicemembers postponed going to school because they \nhad to go straight to work in order to support their family. Others \nunfortunately, were either homeless or incarcerated for long periods of \ntime due to disability associated with military service--but are now \nready to move forward in their lives, and going back to school is their \nfirst step. In some cases, due to random life circumstances, some \npeople just lost track of time. Additionally, because of misinformation \nand bureaucratic language, the GI Bill is known as a complicated \nprogram to navigate.\n  A constituent of mine, Ruben Ruelas--who is a Local Veterans \nEmployment Representative (LVER) for the WorkSource in Wenatchee, \nWashington--wrote to me saying, ``It's been my experience that most \npeople don't know what they want to do in life or are placed in \nsituations where, due to changing economic times, they are displaced \nand need further education and training to compete for jobs. But most \ndon't have access to training resources to do so.''\n  In terms of Vietnam Era veterans, Mr. Ruelas goes on to say, ``[m]any \n50 year olds are unemployed, untrained and uneducated and could use \ntheir educational benefits to improve their skills to compete for \nbetter jobs. Many have come to realize, too late, that they need \ncollege or retraining and don't have the resources to do so.''\n  While times have changed remarkably, one thing remains constant: \neducation is critical to employment opportunity. In the 21st Century \nglobal labor market, enhancing skills through education and job \ntraining is now more important than ever. The need for retraining is \neven more underscored for our military service members and veterans.\n  My legislation, the GI Bill for Life, would ensure that educational \nopportunities are lifelong, allowing service members and veterans the \nflexibility to seek education and job training opportunities when it is \nthe right time for them to do so.\n  Higher education not only serves as an individual benefit, but \npositive externalities have transpired: the GI Bill was instrumental in \nbuilding our country's middle class and continues to help close the \ncollege education gap.\n  Today, employers are requiring higher qualifications from the \nworkforce. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that six of the ten \nfastest-growing occupations require an associate's degree or bachelor's \ndegree. By 2010,40 percent of all job growth will require some form of \npostsecondary education. While a highly skilled workforce is one \ncharacteristic of the new economy, working for one employer throughout \na lifetime is no longer routine, but rather an evanescent feature. \nAccording to findings by Brigham Young University, the average person \nchanges jobs or careers eight times in his or her lifetime. To keep up \nwith these trends, expanding access to education and training is a must \ndo in the 21st Century global marketplace.\n  A 1999 report by the Congressional Commission on Service members and \nVeterans Transition Assistance stated that the GI Bill of the future \nmust include the following: provide veterans with access to post-\nsecondary education that they use; assist the Armed forces in \nrecruiting the high-quality high school graduates needed; enhance the \nNation's competitiveness by further educating American veterans, a \npopulation that is already self-disciplined, goal-oriented, and \nsteadfast and attract the kind of service members who will go on to \noccupy leadership positions in government and the private sector\n  Eliminating the GI Bill 10- and 14-year limitation for service \nmembers, veterans, and Selected Reserve moves one step toward improving \nthe MGIB. The GI Bill for Life would allow MGIB members, including \nqualified Vietnam Era Veterans the flexibility to access their earned \neducation benefits at any time.\n  As the nation's economy continues to recover and grow stronger, the \nGI Bill will continue to be the primary vehicle keeping our active duty \nservice members and veterans of military service on track, helping to \nensure our country's prosperity.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE (for himself and Mr. Akaka):\n  S. 1165. A bill to provide for the expansion of the James Campbell \nNational Wildlife Refuge, Honolulu County, Hawaii; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the James \nCampbell National Wildlife Refuge Expansion Act of 2005, and ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge is the premier endangered \nHawaiian waterbird recovery area in the northern portion of the Island \nof Oahu. It supports all four endangered Hawaiian waterbirds and a \nvariety of migratory shorebirds and waterfowl. The expansion of James \nCampbell National Wildlife Refuge under my bill would provide for \nwildlife and habitat protection, and would also resolve issues \nassociated with the hydrology of the Kahuku floodplain.\n  The expansion would restore historical wetland habitat and form the \nlargest managed freshwater wetland on Oahu. It would connect the two \nexisting units of the Refuge and create a protected flyway between them \nto provide essential habitat for four endangered waterbird species and \nmigratory waterbirds. It would also protect the last remaining large \nscale coastal dune ecosystem on Oahu and preserve native strand plants \nand protect coastal wildlife such as threatened green sea turtles, \nseabirds, migratory shorebirds, and possibly the endangered Hawaiian \nmonk seal. Support facilities could be constructed on upland areas to \nsupport environmental education and interpetation programs, visitor \nservices, and habitat management programs. All land proposed for the \nexpansion is owned by the Estate of James Campbell, a willing seller.\n  Heavy floods occur frequently in this area, devastating residents who \nlive in the adjacent town of Kahuku. Because of the location and \nnatural function of this historical floodplain, the land acquisition \nalso serves as the crucial component for the proposed Kahuku flood \ncontrol project by increasing the capacity of the area to drain and \npreserving the floodwater retention of these wetlands.\n  This habitat restoration proposal represents the most significant \nwetland enhancement project ever undertaken in Hawaii. By combining \neffective flood control, wetland development, endangered species \nconservation,\n\n[[Page S6104]]\n\nenvironmental education, and visitor opportunities, benefits provided \nwill serve not only the local communities, but also Hawaii residents \nand visitors for generations to come.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this non-\ncontroversial legislation.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1165\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``James Campbell National \n     Wildlife Refuge Expansion Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the United States Fish and Wildlife Service manages the \n     James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge for the purpose of \n     promoting the recovery of 4 species of endangered Hawaiian \n     waterbirds;\n       (2) the United States Fish and Wildlife Service leases \n     approximately 240 acres of high-value wetland habitat \n     (including ponds, marshes, freshwater springs, and adjacent \n     land) and manages the habitat in accordance with the National \n     Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act (16 U.S.C. 668dd note; \n     Public Law 105-312);\n       (3) the United States Fish and Wildlife Service entered \n     into a contract to purchase in fee title the land described \n     in paragraph (2) from the estate of James Campbell for the \n     purposes of--\n       (A) permanently protecting the endangered species habitat; \n     and\n       (B) improving the management of the Refuge;\n       (4) the United States Fish and Wildlife Service has \n     identified for inclusion in the Refuge approximately 800 \n     acres of additional high-value wildlife habitat adjacent to \n     the Refuge that are owned by the estate of James Campbell;\n       (5) the land of the estate of James Campbell on the Kahuku \n     Coast features coastal dunes, coastal wetlands, and coastal \n     strand that promote biological diversity for threatened and \n     endangered species, including--\n       (A) the 4 species of endangered Hawaiian waterbirds \n     described in paragraph (1);\n       (B) migratory shorebirds;\n       (C) waterfowl;\n       (D) seabirds;\n       (E) endangered and native plant species;\n       (F) endangered monk seals; and\n       (G) green sea turtles;\n       (6) because of extensive coastal development, habitats of \n     the type within the Refuge are increasingly rare on the \n     Hawaiian islands;\n       (7) expanding the Refuge will provide increased \n     opportunities for wildlife-dependent public uses, including \n     wildlife observation, photography, and environmental \n     education and interpretation; and\n       (8) acquisition of the land described in paragraph (4)--\n       (A) will create a single, large, manageable, and \n     ecologically-intact unit that includes sufficient buffer land \n     to reduce impacts on the Refuge; and\n       (B) is necessary to reduce flood damage following heavy \n     rainfall to residences, businesses, and public buildings in \n     the town of Kahuku.\n\n     SEC. 3.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as are \n     necessary to carry out this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 1166. A bill to extend the authorization of the Kalaupapa National \nHistorical Park Advisory Commission; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \nreauthorize the Kalaupapa National Historical Park Advisory Commission, \nan advisory group to Kalaupapa National Historical Park. The park was \nestablished by statute in 1980, P.L. 96-565, to provide for the \npreservation of the nationally and internationally significant \nresources of the Kalaupapa settlement on the island of Molokai in the \nState of Hawaii--the residents, culture, history, and natural \nresources. The purpose of the park is to provide a well-maintained \ncommunity in which the Kalaupapa Hansen's disease patients are \nguaranteed that they may remain at Kalaupapa as long as they wish, and \nto protect the current lifestyle of these patients and their individual \nprivacy. The Act provides that the preservation and interpretation of \nthe settlement be managed and performed by patients and Native \nHawaiians to the extent practical.\n  Section 108 of the enacting legislation establishes the Kalaupapa \nNational Historical Park Advisory Commission consisting of 11 members, \nappointed by the Secretary of the Interior for terms of five years. \nSeven of the members are patients or former patients elected by the \npatient community. Four members are appointed from recommendations made \nby the Governor of Hawaii, and at least one of these is Native \nHawaiian. The appointments are not compensated.\n  The Advisory Commission is an important body providing input and \nadvice to the Secretary of the Interior on policy concerning visitation \nto the park and other matters. It is remarkable that 25 years have \npassed since enactment of the bill establishing the park and \nCommission; and at the end of the 2005 calendar year, the Advisory \nCommission expires. It is important to continue the work of the \nCommission, which is to provide a voice for the patients and residents \nto be heard on matters concerning their home. I and my cosponsor \nSenator Inouye urge favorable consideration of this legislation in a \ntimely fashion, so that the Commission can continue its business and \nadvisory functions.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1166\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. EXTENSION OF AUTHORIZATION.\n\n       Section 108(e) of the Act entitled ``An Act to establish \n     the Kalaupapa National Historical Park in the State of \n     Hawaii, and for other purposes'' (16 U.S.C. 410jj-7) is \n     amended by striking ``twenty-five years from'' and inserting \n     ``on the date that is 45 years after''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON of Florida:\n  S. 1168. A bill to amend section 212 of the Immigration and \nNationality Act to make inadmissible individuals who law enforcement \nknows, or has reasonable grounds to believe, seek entry into the United \nStates to participate in illegal activities with criminal gangs located \nin the United States; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I wish to bring to the \nattention of the Senate a serious threat to the security of our Nation. \nCriminal gangs, originally from Central America, are infiltrating \nseveral major cities in this country and threatening the safety and \nsecurity of our citizens.\n  MS-13, also known as Mara Salvatrucha, is a brutal and violent gang \nresponsible for horrific acts of violence. MS-13 gang members are \nidentified by the various tattoos on their bodies. They have origins in \nEl Salvador, but you find they are frequently found now in Honduras, El \nSalvador, and Nicaragua. This gang uses extreme\n\n[[Page S6105]]\n\nacts of violence to try to intimidate people, not only in Central \nAmerica but in America itself. According to the Bureau of Immigration, \nCustoms and Enforcement, MS-13 poses the greatest threat to Los \nAngeles, New York, Baltimore, Newark, the Washington, DC, area, and \nMiami. MS-13 has been active in increasing their numbers here in the \nUnited States by assisting other members enter the United States from \nCentral America. Federal authorities provide that there are between \n8,000 and 10,000 members of MS-13 in the United States and my concern \nis that if we don't act now to stop them, they will be able to get a \ntoe-hold here in the United States and significantly increase their \nmembership and horrific form of violence.\n  What is some of that violence? According to law enforcement \nofficials, MS-13 has been involved in murder, extortion, robbery, rape, \ndrug trafficking and human smuggling throughout the United States. Here \nin the Washington, DC, area, for example, two members of MS-13 were \nfound guilty of the stabbing and throat slashing murder of a 17-year-\nold government witness who was 7 months pregnant at the time of her \ngang-ordered execution. And to apparently to send some kind of message \nof intimidation, the gang members disfigured her corpse. Many of their \ncrimes also involve drug trafficking and could very well expand to arms \ntrafficking. And, who knows whether their crimes will soon extend into \nthe terrorist network itself that we are so concerned about. The Bureau \nof Immigration, Customs and Enforcement reports that there has been \nspeculation of links between MS-13 and international terrorist groups \nlike al-Qaida. The F.B.I. is investigating these rumors of a possible \nlink, but to date has discovered no evidence establishing this link.\n  In Honduras, MS-13 members murdered 28 women and children 2 days \nbefore Christmas. Their victims were on a bus returning home after \nhaving gone to shopping for Christmas gifts; some of the children were \nstill clutching the Christmas gifts they had just purchased with their \nmothers. The purpose of this horrific act of violence was to intimidate \nthe Government of Honduras from cracking down on these gangs.\n  Over the recess last week, I went to Honduras with our Four Star \nGeneral, the Combatant Commander of the United States Southern Command.\n  We went there to meet with the Honduran President Ricardo Maduro, and \nour ambassador, Ambassador Palmer, to try to have a better \nunderstanding of this problem, and what we should do not only to help a \ncountry such as Honduras that is trying to get its arms around these \ngangs and to stop the violence but to keep this from spreading into the \nUnited States.\n  As a result of what I have learned, and the exceptional threat this \ngang poses to United States, I am filing legislation today that will do \na couple of things. First, it will give our consular officers in law an \nautomatic reason to reject entry into the United States for anyone they \nknow, or have reasonable grounds to believe, is a member of one of \nthese gangs. Secondly, this legislation I am filing would up the \npenalty for anyone smuggling one of these gang members into the United \nStates from 1 to 10 years.\n  I am also cosponsoring legislation with the senior Senator from \nCalifornia which goes after gang violence by trying to give additional \nFederal assistance to local law enforcement as they try to grapple with \nthis.\n  I have a good example. In south Florida last week, after I had \nreturned from Honduras, I met with the joint task force of multiple \nlevels of law enforcement--city, the county, sheriff deputies, the \nFeds, and the State--that has formed a joint team to attack this \nproblem and to try to keep these gangs, specifically MS-13, from \ngetting a toe-hold in south Florida. We hope if we are successful in \nFlorida it will be an example to the rest of the country, and with the \nincreased penalties offered by this legislation, it will give our law \nenforcement and our consular officers additional tools to stamp out \nthis violence, this gang-related activity that could lead itself very \nmuch into the hands of the terrorists who are trying to exact so much \nharm upon us as a country and as a people. The time to act to stop the \nspread of this gang is now, before they are able to spread their web of \nviolence to more cities and areas within the United States. I hope that \nmy colleagues will join me and support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mr. Sununu, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Akaka, \n        Mr. Jeffords, and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 1169. A bill to require reports to Congress on Federal agency use \nof data-mining; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the \nFederal Agency Data-Mining Reporting Act of 2005. I want to thank \nSenator Sununu for cosponsoring this bill. He has consistently been a \nleader on privacy issues, and I am very pleased to work with him on \nthis effort. I also want to thank Senators Leahy, Akaka, Jeffords and \nWyden for their support of the bill.\n  The controversial data analysis technology known as data-mining is \ncapable of reviewing millions of both public and private records on \neach and every American. The possibility of government law enforcement \nor intelligence agencies fishing for patterns of criminal or terrorist \nactivity in these vast quantities of digital data raises serious \nprivacy and civil liberties issues--not to mention questions about the \neffectiveness of these types of searches. But more than two years after \nCongress first learned about the Defense Department's program called \nTotal Information Awareness, there is still much we do not know about \nthe Federal government's other work on data-mining., We found out last \nyear from a GAO report that there are 199 Federal data-mining programs, \n122 of which rely on personal information and 29 of which are for the \npurpose of investigating terrorists or criminals, but we don't know the \ndetails of those programs. This is information we need to have. \nCongress should not be learning the details about data-mining programs \nafter millions of dollars are spent testing or using data-mining \nagainst unsuspect- ing Americans.\n  Coupled with the expanded domestic surveillance already undertaken by \nthis Administration, the unchecked, secret use of data-mining \ntechnology threatens one of the most important values that we are \nfighting for as we combat terrorism--freedom. My bill would require all \nFederal agencies to report to Congress within 90 days and every year \nthereafter data-mining programs developed or used to find a pattern \nindicating terrorist or other criminal activity and how these programs \nimplicate the civil liberties and privacy of all Americans. If \nnecessary, information in the various reports could be classified.\n  Let me clarify what this bill does not do. It does not have any \neffect on the government's use of commercial data to conduct \nindividualized searches on people who are already suspects. It does not \nend funding for any program, determine the rules for use of data-mining \ntechnology, or threaten any ongoing investigation that uses data-mining \ntechnology.\n  My bill would simply provide Congress with information about the \nnature of the technology and the data that will be used. The Federal \nAgency Data-Mining Reporting Act would require all government agencies \nto assess the efficacy of the data-mining technology and whether the \ntechnology can deliver on the promises of each program. In addition, my \nbill would make sure that Congress knows whether the Federal agencies \nusing data-mining technology have considered and developed policies to \nprotect the privacy and due process rights of individuals.\n\n  With complete information about the current data-mining plans and \npractices of the Federal government, Congress will be able to conduct a \nthorough review of the costs and benefits of the practice of data-\nmining on a program-by-program basis and make considered judgments \nabout which programs should go forward and which should not. Congress \nwill also be able to evaluate whether new privacy rules are necessary.\n  Data-mining could rely on a combination of intelligence data and \npersonal information like individuals' traffic violations, credit card \npurchases, travel records, medical records, communications records, and \nvirtually any information contained in commercial or public databases. \nCongress must\n\n[[Page S6106]]\n\nconduct oversight to make sure that government agencies like the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice, and the \nDepartment of Defense use these types of sensitive personal information \nappropriately.\n  Furthermore, data-mining is unproven in this area. The government \nargues that data-mining can help locate potential terrorists before \nthey strike. But we do not, today, have evidence that data-mining will \nprevent terrorism. In fact, some technology experts have warned that \ndata-mining is not the right approach for the terrorism problem. The \nfinancial world has successfully used data-mining to identify people \ncommitting fraud because it has data on literally millions, if not \nbillions, of historical financial transactions. And the banks and \ncredit card companies know, in large part, which of those past \ntransactions have turned out to be fraudulent. So when they apply \nsophisticated statistical algorithms to that massive amount of \nhistorical data, they are able to make a pretty good guess about what a \nfraudulent transaction might look like in the future.\n  We do not have that kind of historical data about terrorists and \nsleeper cells. We have just a handful of individuals whose past actions \ncan be analyzed, which makes it virtually impossible to apply the kind \nof advanced statistical analysis required to use data-mining in this \nway. That doesn't mean we should stop the Federal government from \nattempting to solve that problem, but it raises serious questions about \nwhether data-mining will ever be able to locate an actual terrorist. \nBefore the government starts reviewing personal information about every \nman, woman and child in this country, we should learn what data-mining \ncan and can't do--and what limits and protections are needed.\n  We must also bear in mind that there will inevitably be errors in the \nunderlying data. Everyone knows people who have had errors on their \ncredit reports--and that is the one area of commercial data where the \nlaw already imposes strict accuracy requirements. Other types of \ncommercial data are likely to be even more inaccurate. Even if the \ntechnology itself were effective, I am very concerned that innocent \npeople could be ensnared because of mistakes in the data that make them \nlook suspicious. The recent rise in identity theft, which creates even \nmore data accuracy problems, makes it even more important that we \naddress this issue.\n  Most Americans believe that their private lives should remain \nprivate. Data-mining programs run the risk of intruding into the lives \nof individuals who have nothing to do with terrorism or other criminal \nactivity and understandably do not want their credit reports, shopping \nhabits and doctor visits to become a part of a gigantic computerized \nsearch engine operating without any controls or oversight.\n  The Administration should be required to report to Congress about the \nimpact of the various data-mining programs now underway or being \nstudied, and the impact those programs may have on our privacy and \ncivil liberties, so that Congress can determine whether the proposed \nbenefits of this practice come at too high a price to our privacy and \npersonal liberties.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill. All it asks for is \ninformation to which Congress and the American people are entitled.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1169\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish the Fort Stanton-Snowy River National \nCave Conservation Area; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nprotect the recent discovery of a natural wonder in my home State of \nNew Mexico. That discovery is a passage within the Fort Stanton Cave \nthat contains what can only be described as a magnificent white river \nof calcite. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by my colleague \nfrom New Mexico, Senator Bingaman.\n  Many locals are familiar with the Fort Stanton Cave in Lincoln \nCounty, NM. Exploration of the cave network dates back to at least the \n1850s, when troops stationed in the area began visiting the caverns. \nThat exploration has continued into the 21st century, and in 2001 led \nto a unique discovery of a two-mile long continuous calcite formation \nby BLM volunteers.\n  We have not found a formation of this size anywhere else in New \nMexico or perhaps even in the United States. In addition to the beauty \nof this discovery, I am particularly excited about the scientific and \neducational opportunities associated with the find. This large, \ncontinuous stretch of calcite may yield valuable research opportunities \nrelating to hydrology, geology, and microbiology. In fact, there may be \nno limits to what we can learn from this snow white cave passage.\n  It is not often that we find something like the calcite formation \nrecently discovered at Ft. Stanton. I believe this find is worthy of \nstudy and our most thoughtful management and conservation.\n  My legislation does the following: 1. creates a Fort Stanton-Snowy \nRiver\n\n[[Page S6107]]\n\nCave Conservation Area to protect, secure and conserve the natural and \nunique features of the Snowy River Cave. 2. instructs the BLM to \nprepare a map and legal description of the Snowy River cave, and to \ndevelop a comprehensive, long-term management plan for the cave area. \n3. authorizes the conservation of the unique features and environs in \nthe cave for scientific, educational and other public uses deemed safe \nand appropriate under the management plan. 4. authorizes the BLM to \nwork hand in hand with colleges, universities, scientific institutions, \nand researchers to further our understanding of the geologic, \nhydrologic, mineralogical, and biologic significance of Snowy River. 5. \nprotects the caves from mineral and mining leasing operations; and 6. \nprotects existing surface uses at Fort Stanton.\n  New Mexico is home to many natural wonders, and I am proud to play a \nrole in the protection of this newest unique discovery in my State. I \nhope my colleagues will join with me in approving the Fort Stanton-\nSnowy River National Cave Conservation Area Act. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1170\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to halt Saudi support for institutions that fund, \ntrain, incite, encourage, or in any other way aid and abet terrorism, \nand to secure full Saudi cooperation in the investigation of terrorist \nincidents, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to offer \nlegislation to halt Saudi Arabia's support for institutions that fund, \ntrain, incite or in any other way aid and abet terrorism, and to secure \nfull Saudi cooperation in the investigation of terrorist incidents and \norganizations.\n  Despite the Saudi government's attempts to show otherwise, a growing \namount of evidence indicates that Saudi Arabia has provided only \nlackluster support for U.S. investigations into terrorist networks, \nsuch as al Qaeda. Mounting documentation and reports have revealed that \nsince the attacks of September 11, 2001, Saudi citizens have provided \nsignificant amounts of financial support to al Qaeda, Hamas, and other \nterrorist organizations. The Saudi government continues to use direct \nand indirect means to support organizations that propagate hate and \nincite terror around the world.\n  United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373, adopted in 2001, \nmandates that all states ``refrain from providing any form of support, \nactive or passive, to entities or persons involved in terrorist acts . \n. . take the necessary steps to prevent the commission of terrorist \nacts . . . deny safe haven to those who finance, plan, support, or \ncommit terrorist acts . . . ensure that\n\n[[Page S6108]]\n\nany person who participates in the financing, planning, preparation or \nperpetration of terrorist acts or in supporting terrorist acts is \nbrought to justice'' and that member countries ``afford one another the \ngreatest measure of assistance in connection with criminal \ninvestigations or criminal proceedings relating to the financing or \nsupport of terrorist acts.'' I would like to share some findings with \nmy colleagues that I believe paint a clear picture that Saudi Arabia \nhas failed to comply with this U.N. standard.\n  Saudi Arabia's lack of cooperation with the United States is not a \npost\n9/11 phenomenon. At the time of the Khobar Towers bombing in 1996, I \nchaired the Senate Intelligence Committee. I visited Dhahran and had \nthe opportunity to inspect the results of the car bomb which killed \nnineteen of our airmen and injured 400 others. In that situation, U.S. \ninvestigators were denied the opportunity to interview the suspects. I \npersonally met with Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia and requested \nthat the FBI be permitted to speak with suspects in custody. Crown \nPrince Abdullah denied my request and informed me that the United \nStates should not meddle in Saudi internal affairs. The murder of \nnineteen U.S. airmen and the wounding of 400 more hardly qualifies as a \nSaudi internal affair.\n  A joint committee of the Select Committee on Intelligence of the \nSenate and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House \nof Representatives issued a report on July 24, 2003, which found ``a \nnumber of U.S. Government officials complained to the Joint Inquiry \nabout a lack of Saudi cooperation in terrorism investigations both \nbefore and after the September 11 attacks.'' With regard to dealing \nwith Saudi officials, General Counsel of the Treasury Department, David \nAufhauser, testified on July 23, 2002, that ``there is an almost \nintuitive sense, however, that things are not being volunteered. So I \nwant to fully inform you about it, that we have to ask and we have to \nseek and we have to strive.''\n  The Saudi Government has asserted its right to question Saudi \nnationals captured by U.S. forces in Afghanistan, yet according to a \nSeptember 15, 2003 issue of Time Magazine, the Saudi Government denied \n``U.S. officials access to several suspects in custody, including a \nSaudi in detention for months who had knowledge of extensive plans to \ninject poison gas in the New York City subway system.''\n\n  In a June 2004 report entitled ``Update on the Global Campaign \nAgainst Terrorist Financing'', the Council on Foreign Relations \nreported that ``we find it regrettable and unacceptable that since \nSeptember 11, 2001, we know of not a single Saudi donor of funds to \nterrorist groups who have been publicly punished.''\n  Additionally, the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the \nUnited\n  States, also referred to as the 9/11 Commission, interviewed numerous \nmilitary officers and government officials who repeatedly listed Saudi \nArabia as a prime place for terrorists to set up bases. ``In talking \nwith American and foreign government officials and military officers on \nthe front lines fighting terrorists today, we [9/11 Commission] asked \nthem: If you were a terrorist leader today, where would you locate your \nbase? Some of the same places come up again and again on their lists . \n. . the Arabian Peninsula, especially Saudi Arabia.''\n  The U.S. should not be in the position of begging for information and \nexpending time and energy pleading for assistance from Saudi Arabia on \nmatters of such great importance to our national security.\n  In the case of funneling funds to terrorist organizations, Saudi \nArabia cannot be permitted to turn a blind eye to the millions of \ndollars its citizens funnel to radical organizations. It sends a \nmessage to the U.S. that they are not serious about stemming the flow \nof support for terror and it sends a message to their own people that \nthis type of behavior is tolerated.\n  The New York Times reported on September 17, 2003, that ``at least \nfifty percent of Hamas's current operating budget of about $10 million \na year comes from people in Saudi Arabia.'' In a July 3, 2003 report, \nThe Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) reported that various \nSaudi organizations have funneled over four billion dollars to finance \nthe Palestinian intifada that began in September 2000.\n  The 9/11 Commission also clearly stated that ``Saudi Arabia's society \nwas a place where al Qaeda raised money directly from individuals \nthrough charities.''\n  In testimony presented to the Senate Judiciary Committee in July \n2003, David Aufhauser, General Counsel of the Treasury Department, was \nasked if the trail of money funding terrorists led back to Saudi \nArabia. He indicated that ``in many cases it is the epicenter.''\n  Not only has the government failed to halt the hemorrhaging of \nterrorist funds from its citizens, but its own leadership has \nreportedly provided significant support for terrorist organizations. \nSaudi Arabia must begin by getting its own house in order which \nincludes rooting out those of its leaders and those in its government \nwho are fanning the fire of hate. According to the aforementioned MEMRI \nreport, ``for decades the royal family of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia \nhas been the main financial supporter of Palestinian groups fighting \nIsrael.''\n  In addition to financial support, Saudi Arabia, through its various \ndomestic and foreign institutions, has supported the spread of radical \nideology. A report released on January 28, 2005 by Freedom House's \nCenter for Religious Freedom found that Saudi Arabia is the state most \nresponsible for the propagation of material promoting hatred, \nintolerance, and violence within United States mosques and Islamic \ncenters, and that these publications are often official publications of \na Saudi ministry or distributed by the Embassy of Saudi Arabia in \nWashington, DC.\n\n  Freedom House also found that ``while the government of Saudi Arabia \nclaims to be `updating' or reforming its textbooks and study materials \nwithin the Kingdom, its publications propagating an ideology of hatred \nremain plentiful in some prominent American mosques and Islamic \ncenters, and continue to be a principal resource available to students \nof Islam within the United States.''\n  One such document Freedom House collected from a Herndon, Virginia \nmosque, distributed by the Cultural Department of the Saudi Arabian \nEmbassy in Washington, was found to contain ``virulent denunciations of \nChristians and of the infidelity of their beliefs and practices. It \noffers intricate guidelines concerning the proper relations Muslims \nshould have with non-Muslims while they reside in the latter's `lands \nof shirk and kufr' (i.e. lands of idolatry and infidelity).'' The \nreport also found a fatwa in a Saudi Embassy publication condemning \ntolerant Muslims and ``is followed by selective Koranic verses that \nspell out the infidelity of Jews and Christians and condemn them to the \neternal fires of hell.''\n  In a May 2003 report on Saudi Arabia, the United States Commission on \nInternational Religious Freedom found ``some Saudi government-funded \ntextbooks used both in Saudi Arabia and also in North American Islamic \nschools and mosques have been found to encourage incitement to violence \nagainst non-Muslims.'' The Commission further found ``offensive and \ndiscriminatory language in Saudi government-sponsored school textbooks, \nsermons in mosques, and articles and commentary in the media about \nJews, Christians, and non-Wahhabi streams of Islam.''\n  The September 13, 2003 issue of Time Magazine reported eighth and \nninth grade Saudi textbooks which read ``that Allah cursed Jews and \nChristians and turned some of them into apes and pigs . . . and that \nJudgment Day will not come until the Muslims fight the Jews and kill \nthem.''\n  Time also, found that ``many of the Taliban, who went on to rule much \nof Afghanistan, were educated in Saudi-financed madaris in Pakistan.'' \nIn the September 2003 issue of Time Magazine, a former Saudi diplomat, \nMohammed al-Khilewi, stated that ``the Saudi government spends billions \nof dollars to establish cultural centers in the U.S. and all over the \nworld'' and that they ``use these centers to recruit individuals and to \nestablish extreme organizations.'' It is no surprise that it is from \nthese fertile grounds that fifteen of the nineteen 9/11 hijackers were \nborn and radicalized.\n\n[[Page S6109]]\n\n  To be successful in the global war on terrorism we need the proactive \nand full cooperation of all nations--especially those who consider \nthemselves allies of the United States.\n  The Saudi Government must provide complete, unrestricted and \nunobstructed cooperation to the United States in the investigation of \nterrorist organizations and individuals. This bill directs the \nPresident to certify to Congress that the Government of Saudi Arabia is \nfully cooperating with the United States in investigating and \npreventing terrorist attacks, has closed permanently all Saudi-based \nterror organizations, has ended funding for any offshore terrorist \norganization, and has made all efforts to block funding from private \nSaudi citizens and entities to offshore terrorist organizations. If \nSaudi Arabia fails to take such steps, this legislation will require \nthe President to prohibit certain exports to Saudi Arabia and restrict \nthe travel of Saudi diplomats. This legislation permits the President \nto waive such sanctions if he determines it is in the national security \ninterest of the United States.\n  Two major objectives in the Global War on Terrorism are to deny \nterrorists safe haven and to eradicate the sources of terrorist \nfinancing. We cannot be successful in this war by ignoring the problem \nSaudi Arabia presents to our security. The government of Saudi Arabia \ncan no longer remain idle while its citizenry continues to provide the \nwherewithal for terrorist groups with global reach nor can it continue \nto directly facilitate and support institutions that incite violence.\n  President Bush has stated that the United States ``will challenge the \nenemies of reform, confront the allies of terror, and expect a higher \nstandard from our friends.'' The 108th Congress passed, and the \nPresident signed, the Syrian Accountability Act. I believe the Saudis \nare a much greater threat to U.S. interests than the Syrians and there \nought to be a very firm approach to our relationship with the Saudi \nGovernment. The 9/11 Commission recommended that the problems in our \nbilateral relationship with Saudi Arabia must be confronted openly--\nthis legislation takes a step in that direction.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself, Mr. Harkin, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Obama, \n        and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 1172. A bill to provide for programs to increase the awareness and \nknowledge of women and health care providers with respect to \ngynecologic cancers; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \nintroduce The Gynecological Cancer Education and Awareness Act of 2005 \nalso known as Johanna's Law.\n  Every year, over 80,000 women in the United States are newly \ndiagnosed with some form of gynecologic cancer such as ovarian, \nuterine, or cervical cancer. In 2005, 29,000 American women are \nexpected to die from these cancers.\n  Early detection of these cancers must be improved to decrease this \ntragic loss of life. Unfortunately, thousands of women in the U.S. each \nyear aren't diagnosed until their cancers have progressed to more \nadvanced and far less treatable stages. In the case of ovarian cancer, \nwhich kills more women in the U.S. than all other gynecologic cancers \ncombined, 70 percent of all new diagnoses take place after this cancer \nhas progressed beyond its earliest and most survivable stage.\n  Women are often diagnosed many months, sometimes more than a year \nafter they first experience symptoms due to a lack of knowledge of \nearly warning signs of gynecological cancers. Adding to the challenge \nof a prompt and accurate diagnosis is the similarity of gynecological \ncancer symptoms to those of more common gastrointestinal conditions and \nbenign gynecologic conditions such as perimenopause and menopause. \nWomen too often receive diagnoses reflecting these benign conditions \nwithout their physicians having first considered gynecologic cancers as \na possible cause of the symptoms.\n  The Gynecological Cancer Education and Awareness Act will improve \nearly detection of gynecologic cancers by creating a national awareness \nand an education outreach campaign to inform physicians and individuals \nof the risk factors and symptoms of these diseases. When gynecological \ncancer is detected in its earliest stage, patients 5-year survival \nrates are greater than 90 percent and many go on to live normal, \nhealthy lives.\n  The national awareness campaign will be carried out by the Department \nof Health and Human Services (HHS) to increase women's awareness and \nknowledge of gynecologic cancers. The campaign will maintain and \ndistribute a supply of written materials that provide information to \nthe public about gynecologic cancers. Further, the program will develop \npublic service announcements encouraging women to discuss their risks \nfor gynecologic cancers with their physicians, and inform the public \nabout the availability of written materials and how to obtain them. The \nprojected cost of the awareness campaign is $5 million per year from \n2006-2008, totaling $15 million.\n  The educational outreach campaign will be carried out through \ndemonstration grants through HHS. These demonstration grants will go to \nlocal and national non-profits to test different outreach and education \nstrategies, including those directed at providers, women, and their \nfamilies. Groups with demonstrated expertise in gynecologic cancer \neducation, treatment, or in working with groups of women who are at \nespecially high risk will be given priority. Grant funding recipients \nwill also be asked to work in cooperation with health providers, \nhospitals, and state health departments. The projected cost of the \neducational outreach campaign is $10 million per year from 2006-2008, \ntotaling $30 million.\n  This legislation was brought to my attention by my friend Fran \nDrescher, who was diagnosed with uterine cancer in 2000 and whose \ndiagnosis was also delayed due to her lack of knowledge about symptoms \nof this disease. She has recovered from uterine cancer and is \nadvocating on behalf of gynecological cancer awareness. She also \nbrought to my attention one of the many victims of gynecological \ncancers Johanna Silver Gordon, after whom this bill is named, who was \ndiagnosed at an advanced stage of ovarian cancer.\n  Johanna, the daughter and sister of physicians, was extremely health \nconscious taking the appropriate measures to maintain a healthy \nlifestyle including exercising regularly, eating nutritiously, and \nreceiving annual Pap smears and pelvic exams. Johanna however did not \nhave the information to know that the gastric symptoms she experienced \nin the fall of 1996 were common symptoms of ovarian cancer. She didn't \nlearn these crucial facts until after she was diagnosed at an advanced \nstage of this cancer. Despite aggressive treatment that included four \nsurgeries, various types of chemotherapy, and participation in two \nclinical trials, Johanna died from ovarian cancer 3\\1/2\\ years after \nbeing diagnosed. Johanna is survived by her sister Sheryl Silver who \nhas tirelessly worked to increase the information available regarding \ngynecological cancers.\n  As Chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education \nAppropriations Subcommittee, I led, along with Senator Harkin, the \neffort to double funding for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) \nover five years. Funding for the NIH has increased from $11.3 billion \nin fiscal year 1995 to $28.5 billion in fiscal year 2005. In 2004, the \nNIH, through the National Cancer Institute provided $212.5 million for \ngynecological cancer research. Further, the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention's National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection \nProgram (NBCCEDP) provided $209 million in fiscal year 2005 for breast \nand gynecological cancer screening and diagnostic services, including: \npap tests, surgical consultation, and diagnostic testing for women \nwhose screening outcome is abnormal. To date, the Program has screened \nmore than 2.1 million women, provided more than 5 million screening \nexams, and diagnosed 66,295 pre-cancerous cervical lesions and 1,262 \ninvasive cervical cancers. We must continue these efforts to do more to \nprovide information about gynecological cancer to physicians and those \nmost at risk.\n  I believe this bill can provide desperately needed information to \nphysicians and individuals so that women can be diagnosed faster and \nmore effectively. I urge my colleagues to work with Senator Harkin and \nme to move this legislation forward promptly.\n\n[[Page S6110]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1172\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues Senators \nSpecter and Harkin to introduce The Gynecological Cancer Education and \nAwareness Act of 2005, also known as Johanna's Law. This important \nlegislation authorizes a national gynecologic cancer early detection \nand awareness campaign for women and their providers. This bill is \nnamed in honor of Johanna Silver Gordon who died from ovarian cancer \nand whose sister, Sheryl Silver, founded Johanna's Law Alliance for \nWomen's Cancer Awareness. We thank Ms. Silver for her courage and her \npersistent efforts to turn her sister's tragedy into a crusade to raise \nawareness and prevent needless suffering and death from gynecologic \ncancers for other women.\n  Nearly 80,000 American women are diagnosed with gynecologic cancers \neach year. Tragically, 29,000 of them die from this disease. We know \nthat early detection is the key to successful treatment of all \ngynecologic cancers, and we have made great strides at reducing rates \nof cervical cancer with wide-spread use of Pap screening tests. Yet, we \nhave not been able to replicate this success with uterine cancer and \novarian cancer, for which effective and general screening methods do \nnot exist. For ovarian cancer, which is the deadliest of the \ngynecologic cancers, in addition to lack of screening tests, doctors \nand researchers have not identified effective diagnostic and \ntreatments. Seventy percent of all new diagnoses of ovarian cancer take \nplace after this cancer has progressed beyond its earliest and most \nsurvivable stage.\n  Given these challenges, knowing the symptoms of gynecologic cancers, \nwhich can mimic GI illnesses, menopause or perimenopause, is key to \nearly diagnosis. The 5-year survival rates for the most common \ngynecologic cancers are 90 percent when diagnosed early, but drop to 50 \npercent for cancers diagnosed later.\n  Johanna's Law will promote early detection and awareness through a \nNational Public Awareness Campaign conducted by the Department of \nHealth and Human Services. Women will be given written materials that \nprovide information about gynecologic cancers, and Public Service \nAnnouncements will be developed to encourage women to talk to their \ndoctors about gynecologic cancer. The Department will also give grants \nfor demonstration projects to local and national non-profit \norganizations to identify the best ways to reach and educate women \nabout these cancers, particularly those women who are high risk.\n  Johanna's Law will make sure that women and doctors get the \ninformation they need to help them recognize early symptoms of \ngynecologic cancers, so that women can be diagnosed and treated earlier \nwhen their cancers are treatable. I urge my colleagues to work to move \nthis legislation forward promptly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/06/senate-section/article/S6110-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6110-S6111]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 160--DESIGNATING JUNE 2005 AS ``NATIONAL SAFETY \n                                MONTH''\n\n  Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Cochran, Mrs. Dole, Ms. \nLandrieu, Ms. Murkowski, and Mr. Lugar) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

School, then in Pomfret, Connecticut, \n     and now in Brookline, Massachusetts;\n       Whereas in 1941, Archbishop Iakovos was named preacher at \n     Holy Trinity Cathedral in New York City, and

University;\n       Whereas Archbishop Iakovos became a United States citizen \n     in 1950;\n       Whereas in 1954, Archbishop Iakovos was ordained Bishop of \n     Melita by his spiritual father and mentor, Ecumenical \n     Patriarch Athenagoras, for whom he served four years as \n     personal representative of the Patriarchate to the World \n     Council of Churches in Geneva;\n       Whereas on February 14, 1959, the Holy Synod of the \n     Ecumenical Patriarchate elected Archbishop Iakovos to succeed \n     Archbishop Michael as primate of the Greek Orthodox Church in \n     the Americas;\n       Whereas Archbishop Iakovos was enthroned April 1, 1959, at \n     Holy Trinity Cathedral in New York City, assuming \n     responsibility for a jurisdiction that has grown to be over \n     500 parishes in the United States alone;\n       Whereas the enthronement of Archbishop Iakovos in 1959 \n     ushered in a new era for the Greek Orthodox Church in \n     America, in which the Church became part of the mainstream of \n     American religious life;\n       Whereas in 1959, shortly after being named archbishop, \n     Archbishop Iakovos held a historic meeting with Pope John

Christian, and Inter-Religious dialogues;\n       Whereas Archbishop Iakovos vigorously supported the passage \n     of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and had the courage to walk \n     hand in hand with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in Selma, \n     Alabama, a historic moment for America that was captured on \n     the cover of LIFE Magazine on March 26, 1965;\n       Whereas Archbishop Iakovos spoke out forcefully against \n     violations of human rights and religious freedom and, in \n     1974, undertook a massive campaign to assist Greek Cypriot \n     refugees following the invasion of Cyprus by Turkish armed \n     forces;\n       Whereas Archbishop Iakovos was a recipient of the \n     Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Nation's highest civilian \n     honor, which was bestowed on him by President Carter on June \n     9, 1980;\n       Whereas in 1986, Archbishop Iakovos was awarded the Ellis \n     Island Medal of Honor and was cited by the Academy of Athens, \n     the National Conference of Christians and Jews, and the \n     Appeal of Conscience;\n       Whereas Archbishop Iakovos, during his stewardship of the \n     Greek Orthodox Church in America, became an

presented a prayer at \n     Presidential inaugural ceremonies in 1961, 1965, 1969, and \n     1973;\n       Whereas the Archbishop has said of his pastoral work with \n     immigrants in New England and New York, ``I lived and \n     struggled with them to maintain the faith and culture.'';\n       Whereas in a 1995 interview, the Archbishop said he had \n     accomplished a major goal ``to have the Orthodox Church be \n     accepted by the family of religions in the United States''; \n     and\n       Whereas Archbishop Iakovos was interred at the Holy Cross \n     Greek Orthodox School of Theology in Brookline, \n     Massachusetts, on April 15, 2005: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) mourns the loss of Archbishop Iakovos and commends the \n     life the Archbishop led;\n       (2) thanks Archbishop Iakovos for his service to the \n     members of his church and to the people of this Nation;\n       (3) honors Archbishop Iakovos' commitment to the

whose hard work, determination, and pride in their \n     religious and cultural heritage Archbishop Iakovos embodied; \n     and\n       (B) who will dearly miss the Archbishop.\n\n
